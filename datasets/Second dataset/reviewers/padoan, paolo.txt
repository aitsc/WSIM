0907.0248	the star formation rate of supersonic mhd turbulence	this work presents a new physical model of the star formation rate (sfr),verified with an unprecedented set of large numerical simulations of driven,supersonic, self-gravitating, magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence, wherecollapsing cores are captured with accreting sink particles. the model dependson the relative importance of gravitational, turbulent, magnetic, and thermalenergies, expressed through the virial parameter, alpha_vir, the rms sonic machnumber, m_s,0, and the ratio of mean gas pressure to mean magnetic pressure,beta_0. the sfr is predicted to decrease with increasing alpha_vir (strongerturbulence relative to gravity), to increase with increasing m_s,0 (forconstant values of alpha_vir), and to depend weakly on beta_0 for valuestypical of star forming regions (m_s,0 ~ 4-20 and beta_0 ~ 1-20). in theunrealistic limit of beta_0 -&gt; infinity, that is in the complete absence of amagnetic field, the sfr increases approximately by a factor of three, whichshows the importance of magnetic fields in the star formation process, evenwhen they are relatively weak (super-alfvenic turbulence). in thisnon-magnetized limit, our definition of the critical density for star formationhas the same dependence on alpha_vir, and almost the same dependence on m_s,0,as in the model of krumholz and mckee, although our physical derivation doesnot rely on the concepts of local turbulent pressure and sonic scale. however,our model predicts a different dependence of the sfr on alpha_vir and m_s,0than the model of krumholz and mckee. the star-formation simulations used totest the model result in an approximately constant sfr, after an initialtransient phase. both the value of the sfr and its dependence on the virialparameter found in the simulations are shown to agree very well with thetheoretical predictions.

0907.0587	the super-alfv\'enic model of molecular clouds: predictions for  mass-to-flux and turbulent-to-magnetic energy ratios	recent measurements of the zeeman effect in dark-cloud cores provideimportant tests for theories of cloud dynamics and prestellar core formation.in this letter we report results of simulated zeeman measurements, based onradiative transfer calculations through a snapshot of a simulation ofsupersonic and super-alfv\'enic turbulence. we have previously shown that thesame simulation yields a relative mass-to-flux ratio (core versus envelope) inagreement with the observations (and in contradiction with the ambipolar-driftmodel of core formation). here we show that the mass-to-flux andturbulent-to-magnetic-energy ratios in the simulated cores agree with observedvalues as well. the mean magnetic field strength in the simulation is very low,\bar{b}=0.34 \mug, presumably lower than the mean field in molecular clouds.nonetheless, high magnetic field values are found in dense cores, in agreementwith the observations (the rms field, amplified by the turbulence, isb_{rms}=3.05 \mug). we conclude that a strong large-scale mean magnetic fieldis not required by zeeman effect measurements to date, although it is not ruledout by this work.

0910.1384	the power spectrum of turbulence in ngc 1333: outflows or large-scale  driving?	is the turbulence in cluster-forming regions internally driven by stellaroutflows or the consequence of a large-scale turbulent cascade? we address thisquestion by studying the turbulent energy spectrum in ngc 1333. using synthetic13co maps computed with a snapshot of a supersonic turbulence simulation, weshow that the vcs method of lazarian and pogosyan provides an accurate estimateof the turbulent energy spectrum. we then apply this method to the 13co map ofngc 1333 from the complete database. we find the turbulent energy spectrum is apower law, e(k) k^-beta, in the range of scales 0.06 pc &lt; ell &lt; 1.5 pc, withslope beta=1.85\pm 0.04. the estimated energy injection scale of stellaroutflows in ngc 1333 is ell_inj 0.3 pc, well resolved by the observations.there is no evidence of the flattening of the energy spectrum above the scaleell_inj predicted by outflow-driven simulations and analytical models. thepower spectrum of integrated intensity is also a nearly perfect power law inthe range of scales 0.16 pc &lt; ell &lt; 7.9 pc, with no feature above ell_inj. weconclude that the observed turbulence in ngc 1333 does not appear to be drivenprimarily by stellar outflows.

1005.2419	relative velocity of inertial particles in turbulent flows	we present a model for the relative velocity of inertial particles inturbulent flows. our general formulation shows that the relative velocity hascontributions from two terms, referred to as the generalized acceleration andgeneralized shear terms, because they reduce to the well known acceleration andshear terms in the saffman-turner limit. the generalized shear term representsparticles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories anddepends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. theimportance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relativevelocity is emphasized. we find that our model with a two-phase separationbehavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found byrecent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particlepairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at lowreynolds numbers. in the monodisperse case with identical particles, thegeneralized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determinedby the generalized shear term. at large reynolds numbers, our model gives a$st^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the stokes number $st$ in theinertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the richardson separationlaw. this leads to the same inertial-range scaling for the two-phase separationthat well fits the simulation results. our calculations for the bidisperse caseshow that, with the friction timescale of one particle fixed, the relativespeed as a function of the other particle's friction time has a dip when thetwo timescales are similar. we find that the primary contribution at the dip isfrom the generalized shear term, while the generalized acceleration term isdominant for particles of very different sizes.

1101.5163	pop. iii stars from turbulent fragmentation at redshift ~ 11	we report results from a cosmological simulation with non-equilibriumchemistry of 21 species, including h2, hd, and lih molecular cooling. startingfrom cosmological initial conditions, we focus on the evolution of the central1.8 kpc region of a 3 x 10^7 msun halo. the crossing of a few 10^6 msun halosand the gas accretion through larger scale filaments generate a turbulentenvironment within this region. due to the short cooling time caused by thenon-equilibrium formation of h2, the supersonic turbulence results in a veryfragmented mass distribution, where dense, gravitationally unstable clumpsemerge from a complex network of dense filaments. at z=10.87, we findapproximately 25 well defined, gravitationally unstable clumps, with masses of4 x 10^3-9 x 10^5 msun, temperatures of approximately 300k, and cooling timesmuch shorter than the free-fall time. only the initial phase of the collapse ofindividual clumps is spatially resolved in the simulation. depending on thedensity reached in the collapse, the estimated average bonnor-ebert masses arein the range 200-800 msun. we speculate that each clump may further fragmentinto a cluster of stars with a characteristic mass in the neighborhood of 50msun. this process at z ~ 11 may represent the dominant mode of pop. iii starformation, causing a rapid chemical enrichment of the protogalacticenvironment.

1103.5525	comparing numerical methods for isothermal magnetized supersonic  turbulence	we employ simulations of supersonic super-alfvenic turbulence decay as abenchmark test problem to assess and compare the performance of nineastrophysical mhd methods actively used to model star formation. the set ofnine codes includes: enzo, flash, kt-mhd, ll-mhd, pluto, ppml, ramses, stagger,and zeus. we present a comprehensive set of statistical measures designed toquantify the effects of numerical dissipation in these mhd solvers. we comparepower spectra for basic fields to determine the effective spectral bandwidth ofthe methods and rank them based on their relative effective reynolds numbers.we also compare numerical dissipation for solenoidal and dilatational velocitycomponents to check for possible impacts of the numerics on small-scale densitystatistics. finally, we discuss convergence of various characteristics for theturbulence decay test and impacts of various components of numerical schemes onthe accuracy of solutions. we show that the best performing codes employ aconsistently high order of accuracy for spatial reconstruction of the evolvedfields, transverse gradient interpolation, conservation law update step, andlorentz force computation. the best results are achieved with divergence-freeevolution of the magnetic field using the constrained transport method, andusing little to no explicit artificial viscosity. codes which fall short in oneor more of these areas are still useful, but they must compensate highernumerical dissipation with higher numerical resolution. this paper is thelargest, most comprehensive mhd code comparison on an application-like testproblem to date. we hope this work will help developers improve their numericalalgorithms while helping users to make informed choices in picking optimalapplications for their specific astrophysical problems.

1106.3695	turbulent clustering of protoplanetary dust and planetesimal formation	we study clustering of inertial particles in turbulent flows and discuss itsapplications to dust particles in protoplanetary disks. using numericalsimulations, we compute the radial distribution function (rdf), which measuresthe probability of finding particle pairs at given distances, and theprobability density function of the particle concentration. the clusteringstatistics depend on the stokes number, $st$, defined as the ratio of theparticle friction timescale, $\tau_{\rm p} $, to the kolmogorov timescale inthe flow. in the dissipation range, the clustering intensity strongly peaks at$st \simeq 1$, and the rdf for $st \sim 1$ shows a fast power-law increasetoward small scales, suggesting that turbulent clustering may considerablyenhance the particle collision rate. clustering at inertial-range scales is ofparticular interest to the problem of planetesimal formation. at these scales,the strongest clustering is from particles with $\tau_{\rm p}$ in the inertialrange. clustering of these particles occurs primarily around a scale where theeddy turnover time is $\sim\tau_{\rm p}$. particles of different sizes tend tocluster at different locations, leading to flat rdfs between differentparticles at small scales. in the presence of multiple particle sizes, theoverall clustering strength decreases as the particle size distributionbroadens. we discuss particle clustering in recent models for planetesimalformation. we point out that, in the model based on turbulent clustering ofchondrule-size particles, the probability of finding strong clusters that canseed planetesimals may have been significantly overestimated. we discussvarious clustering mechanisms in simulations of planetesimal formation bygravitational collapse of dense clumps of meter-size particles, in particularthe contribution from turbulent clustering due to the limited numericalresolution.

1108.2543	the observable prestellar phase of the imf	the observed similarities between the mass function of prestellar cores (cmf)and the stellar initial mass function (imf) have led to the suggestion that theimf is already largely determined in the gas phase. however, theoreticalarguments show that the cmf may differ significantly from the imf. in thisletter, we study the relation between the cmf and the imf, as predicted by theimf model of padoan and nordlund. we show that 1) the observed mass ofprestellar cores is on average a few times smaller than that of the stellarsystems they generate; 2) the cmf rises monotonically with decreasing mass,with a noticeable change in slope at approximately 3-5 solar masses, dependingon mean density; 3) the selection of cores with masses larger than half theirbonnor-ebert mass yields a cmf approximately consistent with the system imf,rescaled in mass by the same factor as our model imf, and therefore suitable toestimate the local efficiency of star formation, and to study the dependence ofthe imf peak on cloud properties; 4) only one in five pre-brown-dwarf corecandidates is a true progenitor to a brown dwarf.

1202.2594	the two states of star forming clouds	we examine the effects of self-gravity and magnetic fields on supersonicturbulence in isothermal molecular clouds with high resolution simulations andadaptive mesh refinement. these simulations use large root grids (512^3) tocapture turbulence and four levels of refinement to capture high density, foran effective resolution of 8,196^3. three mach 9 simulations are performed, twosuper-alfv\'enic and one trans-alfv\'enic. we find that gravity splits theclouds into two populations, one low density turbulent state and one highdensity collapsing state. the low density state exhibits properties similar tonon-self-gravitating in this regime, and we examine the effects of variedmagnetic field strength on statistical properties: the density probabilitydistribution function is approximately lognormal; velocity power spectralslopes decrease with field strength; alignment between velocity and magneticfield increases with field; the magnetic field probability distribution can befit to a stretched exponential. the high density state is characterized byself-similar spheres; the density pdf is a power-law; collapse rate decreaseswith increasing mean field; density power spectra have positive slopes,p({\rho},k) \propto k; thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratios are unity for allsimulations; dynamic-to-magnetic pressure ratios are larger than unity for allsimulations; magnetic field distribution is a power-law. the high alfv\'en machnumbers in collapsing regions explain recent observations of magnetic influencedecreasing with density. we also find that the high density state is found infilaments formed by converging flows, consistent with recent herschelobservations. possible modifications to existing star formation theories areexplored.

1208.3758	a simple law of star formation	we show that supersonic mhd turbulence yields a star formation rate (sfr) aslow as observed in molecular clouds (mcs), for characteristic values of thefree-fall time divided by the dynamical time, $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn}$, thealfv\'{e}nic mach number, ${\cal m}_{\rm a}$, and the sonic mach number, ${\calm}_{\rm s}$. using a very large set of deep adaptive-mesh-refinementsimulations, we quantify the dependence of the sfr per free-fall time,$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, on the above parameters. our main results are: i)$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ decreases exponentially with increasing $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rmdyn}$, but is insensitive to changes in ${\cal m}_{\rm s}$, for constant valuesof $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn}$ and ${\cal m}_{\rm a}$. ii) decreasing values of${\cal m}_{\rm a}$ (stronger magnetic fields) reduce $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, butonly to a point, beyond which $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ increases with a furtherdecrease of ${\cal m}_{\rm a}$. iii) for values of ${\cal m}_{\rm a}$characteristic of star-forming regions, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ varies with ${\calm}_{\rm a}$ by less than a factor of two. we propose a simple star-formationlaw, based on the empirical fit to the minimum $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, anddepending only on $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn}$: $\epsilon_{\rm ff} \approx\epsilon_{\rm wind} \exp(-1.6 \,t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn})$. because it onlydepends on the mean gas density and rms velocity, this law is straightforwardto implement in simulations and analytical models of galaxy formation andevolution.

0704.3851	the statistics of supersonic isothermal turbulence	we present results of large-scale three-dimensional simulations of supersoniceuler turbulence with the piecewise parabolic method and multiple gridresolutions up to 2048^3 points. our numerical experiments describenon-magnetized driven turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of state andan rms mach number of 6. we discuss numerical resolution issues and demonstrateconvergence, in a statistical sense, of the inertial range dynamics insimulations on grids larger than 512^3 points. the simulations allowed us tomeasure the absolute velocity scaling exponents for the first time. theinertial range velocity scaling in this strongly compressible regime deviatessubstantially from the incompressible kolmogorov laws. the slope of thevelocity power spectrum, for instance, is -1.95 compared to -5/3 in theincompressible case. the exponent of the third-order velocity structurefunction is 1.28, while in incompressible turbulence it is known to be unity.we propose a natural extension of kolmogorov's phenomenology that takes intoaccount compressibility by mixing the velocity and density statistics andpreserves the kolmogorov scaling of the power spectrum and structure functionsof the density-weighted velocity v=\rho^{1/3}u. the low-order statistics of vappear to be invariant with respect to changes in the mach number. forinstance, at mach 6 the slope of the power spectrum of v is -1.69, and theexponent of the third-order structure function of v is unity. we also directlymeasure the mass dimension of the "fractal" density distribution in theinertial subrange, d_m = 2.4, which is similar to the observed fractaldimension of molecular clouds and agrees well with the cascade phenomenology.

1305.0307	turbulence-induced relative velocity of dust particles i: identical  particles	we study the relative velocity of inertial particles suspended in turbulentflows and discuss implications for dust particle collisions in protoplanetarydisks. we simulate a weakly compressible turbulent flow, evolving 14 particlespecies with friction timescale, tau_p, covering the entire range of scales inthe flow. the particle stokes numbers, st, measuring the ratio of tau_p to thekolmogorov timescale, are in the range from ~0.1 to ~800. using simulationresults, we show that the model by pan &amp; padoan (pp10) gives satisfactorypredictions for the rms relative velocity between identical particles. theprobability distribution function (pdf) of the relative velocity is found to behighly non-gaussian. the pdf tails are well described by a 4/3 stretchedexponential function for particles with tau_p ~ 1-2 t_l, where t_l is thelagrangian correlation timescale, consistent with a prediction based on pp10.the pdf approaches gaussian only for very large particles with tau_p &gt;~ 54 t_l.we split particle pairs at given distances into two types with low and highrelative speeds, referred to as continuous and caustic types, respectively, andcompute their contributions to the collision kernel. although amplified by theeffect of clustering, the continuous contribution vanishes in the limit ofinfinitesimal particle distance, where the caustic contribution dominates. thecaustic kernel per unit cross section rises rapidly as st increases toward ~1,reaches a maximum at tau_p ~ 2 t_l, and decreases as tau_p^{-1/2} for tau_p &gt;&gt;t_l.

1403.3865	turbulence-induced relative velocity of dust particles ii: the  bidisperse case	we extend our earlier work on turbulence-induced relative velocity betweenequal-size particles (pan and padoan, paper i) to particles of arbitrarilydifferent sizes. the pan and padoan (pp10) model shows that the relativevelocity between different particles has two contributions, named thegeneralized shear and acceleration terms, respectively. the generalized shearterm represents the particles' memory of the spatial flow velocity differenceacross the particle distance in the past, while the acceleration term isassociated with the temporal flow velocity difference on individual particletrajectories. using the simulation of paper i, we compute the root-mean-squarerelative velocity, &lt;w^2&gt;^1/2, as a function of the friction times, tau_p1 andtau_p2, of the two particles, and show that the pp10 prediction is insatisfactory agreement with the data, confirming its physical picture. for agiven tau_p1 below the lagrangian correlation time of the flow, t_l, &lt;w^2&gt;^1/2as a function of tau_p2 shows a dip at tau_p2~tau_p1, indicating tightervelocity correlation between similar particles. defining a ratiof=tau_pl/tau_ph, with tau_pl and tau_ph the friction times of the smaller andlarger particles, we find that &lt;w^2&gt;^1/2 increases with decreasing f due to thegeneralized acceleration contribution, which dominates at f&lt;1/4. at a fixed f,our model predicts that &lt;w^2&gt;^1/2 scales as tau_ph^1/2 for tau_p,h in theinertial range of the flow, stays roughly constant for t_l &lt;tau_ph &lt; t_l/f, andfinally decreases as tau_ph^-1/2 for tau_ph&gt;&gt;t_l/f. the acceleration term isindependent of the particle distance, r, and thus reduces the r-dependence of&lt;w^2&gt;^1/2 in the bidisperse case.

1407.1101	turbulence-induced relative velocity of dust particles iii: the  probability distribution	motivated by its important role in the collisional growth of dust particlesin protoplanetary disks, we investigate the probability distribution function(pdf) of the relative velocity of inertial particles suspended in turbulentflows. using the simulation from our previous work, we compute the relativevelocity pdf as a function of the friction timescales, tau_p1 and tau_p2, oftwo particles of arbitrary sizes. the friction time of particles included inthe simulation ranges from 0.1 tau_eta to 54t_l, with tau_eta and t_l thekolmogorov time and the lagrangian correlation time of the flow, respectively.the relative velocity pdf is generically non-gaussian, exhibiting fat tails.for a fixed value of tau_p1, the pdf is the fattest for equal-size particles(tau_p2~tau_p1), and becomes thinner at both tau_p2&lt;tau_ p1 and tau_p2&gt;tau_p1.defining f as the friction time ratio of the smaller particle to the largerone, we find that, at a given f in 1/2&lt;f&lt;1, the pdf fatness first increaseswith the friction time, tau_ph, of the larger particle, peaks attau_ph~tau_eta, and then decreases as tau_ph increases further. for 0&lt;f&lt;1/4,the pdf shape becomes continuously thinner with increasing tau_ph. the pdf isnearly gaussian only if tau_ph is sufficiently large (&gt;&gt;t_l). these featuresare successfully explained by the pan &amp; padoan model. using our simulation dataand some simplifying assumptions, we estimated the fractions of collisionsresulting in sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation as a function of the dustsize in protoplanerary disks, and argued that accounting for non-gaussianity ofthe collision velocity may help further alleviate the bouncing barrier problem.

1407.1445	infall-driven protostellar accretion and the solution to the luminosity  problem	we investigate the role of mass infall in the formation and evolution ofprotostars. to avoid ad hoc initial and boundary conditions, we consider theinfall resulting self-consistently from modeling the formation of stellarclusters in turbulent molecular clouds. we show that infall rates in turbulentclouds are comparable to accretion rates inferred from protostellarluminosities or measured in pre-main-sequence stars. they should not beneglected in modeling the luminosity of protostars and the evolution of disks,even after the embedded protostellar phase. we find large variations of infallrates from protostar to protostar, and large fluctuations during the evolutionof individuals protostars. in most cases, the infall rate is initially of order10$^{-5}$\msun\ yr$^{-1}$, and may either decay rapidly in the formation oflow-mass stars, or remain relatively large when more massive stars are formed.the simulation reproduces well the observed characteristic values and scatterof protostellar luminosities and matches the observed protostellar luminosityfunction. the luminosity problem is therefore solved once realisticprotostellar infall histories are accounted for, with no need for extremeaccretion episodes. these results are based on a simulation of randomly-drivenmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulence on a scale of 4pc, including self-gravity,adaptive-mesh refinement to a resolution of 50au, and accreting sink particles.the simulation yields a low star formation rate, consistent with theobservations, and a mass distribution of sink particles consistent with theobserved stellar initial mass function during the whole duration of thesimulation, forming nearly 1,300 sink particles over 3.2 myr.

1410.1989	turbulence-induced relative velocity of dust particles iv: the collision  kernel	motivated by its importance for modeling dust particle growth inprotoplanetary disks, we study turbulence-induced collision statistics ofinertial particles as a function of the particle friction time, tau_p. we showthat turbulent clustering significantly enhances the collision rate forparticles of similar sizes with tau_p corresponding to the inertial range ofthe flow. if the friction time, tau_p,h, of the larger particle is in theinertial range, the collision kernel per unit cross section increases withincreasing friction time, tau_p,l, of the smaller particle, and reaches themaximum at tau_p,l = tau_p,h, where the clustering effect peaks. this featureis not captured by the commonly-used kernel formula, which neglects the effectof clustering. we argue that turbulent clustering helps alleviate the bouncingbarrier problem for planetesimal formation. we also investigate the collisionvelocity statistics using a collision-rate weighting factor to account forhigher collision frequency for particle pairs with larger relative velocity.for tau_p,h in the inertial range, the rms relative velocity withcollision-rate weighting is found to be invariant with tau_p,l and scales withtau_p,h roughly as ~ tau_p,h^(1/2). the weighting factor favors collisions withlarger relative velocity, and including it leads to more destructive and lesssticking collisions. we compare two collision kernel formulations based onspherical and cylindrical geometries. the two formulations give consistentresults for the collision rate and the collision-rate weighted statistics,except that the spherical formulation predicts more head-on collisions than thecylindrical formulation.

1502.02670	the relative and absolute ages of old globular clusters in the lcdm  framework	old globular clusters (gcs) in the milky way have ages of about 13 gyr,placing their formation time in the reionization epoch. we propose a novelscenario for the formation of these systems based on the merger of two or moreatomic cooling halos at high-redshift (z&gt;6). first generation stars are formedas an intense burst in the center of a minihalo that grows above the thresholdfor hydrogen cooling (halo mass m_h~10^8 msun) by undergoing a major mergerwithin its cooling timescale (~150 myr). subsequent minor mergers and sustainedgas infall bring new supply of pristine gas at the halo center, creatingconditions that can trigger new episodes of star formation. the dark-matterhalo around the gc is then stripped during assembly of the host galaxy halo.minihalo merging is efficient only in a short redshift window, set by the lcdmparameters, allowing us to make a strong prediction on the age distribution forold gcs. from cosmological simulations we derive an average merging redshift&lt;z&gt;=9 and narrow distribution dz=2, implying average gc age &lt;t_age&gt;=13.0+/-0.2gyr including ~0.2 gyr of star formation delay. qualitatively, our scenarioreproduces other general old gc properties (characteristic masses and number ofobjects, metallicity versus galactocentric radius anticorrelation, radialdistribution), but unlike age, these generally depend on details of baryonicphysics. in addition to improved age measurements, direct validation of themodel at z~10 may be within reach of ultradeep gravitationally lensedobservations with the james webb space telescope.

1512.00416	protostellar accretion traced with chemistry: comparing synthetic c18o  maps of embedded protostars to real observations	context: understanding how protostars accrete their mass is a centralquestion of star formation. one aspect of this is trying to understand whetherthe time evolution of accretion rates in deeply embedded objects is bestcharacterised by a smooth decline from early to late stages or by intermittentbursts of high accretion.  aims: we create synthetic observations of deeply embedded protostars in alarge numerical simulation of a molecular cloud, which are compared directly toreal observations. the goal is to compare episodic accretion events in thesimulation to observations and to test the methodology used for analysing theobservations.  methods: simple freeze-out and sublimation chemistry is added to thesimulation, and synthetic c$^{18}$o line cubes are created for a large numberof simulated protostars. the spatial extent of c$^{18}$o is measured for thesimulated protostars and compared directly to a sample of 16 deeply embeddedprotostars observed with the submillimeter array. if co is distributed over alarger area than predicted based on the protostellar luminosity, it mayindicate that the luminosity has been higher in the past and that co is stillin the process of refreezing.  results: approximately 1% of the protostars in the simulation show extendedc$^{18}$o emission, as opposed to approximately 50% in the observations,indicating that the magnitude and frequency of episodic accretion events in thesimulation is too low relative to observations. the protostellar accretionrates in the simulation are primarily modulated by infall from the largerscales of the molecular cloud, and do not include any disk physics. thediscrepancy between simulation and observations is taken as support for thenecessity of disks, even in deeply embedded objects, to produce episodicaccretion events of sufficient frequency and amplitude.

0806.4970	the temperature of interstellar clouds from turbulent heating	to evaluate the effect of turbulent heating in the thermal balance ofinterstellar clouds, we develop an extension of the log-poisson intermittencymodel to supersonic turbulence. the model depends on a parameter, d,interpreted as the dimension of the most dissipative structures. by comparingthe model with the probability distribution of the turbulent dissipation ratein a simulation of supersonic and super-alfvenic turbulence, we find a best-fitvalue of d=1.64. we apply this intermittency model to the computation of themass-weighted probability distribution of the gas temperature of molecularclouds, high-mass star-forming cores, and cold diffuse hi clouds. our mainresults are: i) the mean gas temperature in molecular clouds can be explainedas the effect of turbulent heating alone, while cosmic ray heating may dominateonly in regions where the turbulent heating is low; ii) the mean gastemperature in high-mass star-forming cores with typical fwhm of ~6 km/s(corresponding to a 1d rms velocity of 2.5 km/s) may be completely controlledby turbulent heating, which predicts a mean value of approximately 36 k, two tothree times larger than the mean gas temperature in the absence of turbulentheating; iii) the intermittency of the turbulent heating can generate enoughhot regions in cold diffuse hi clouds to explain the observed ch+ abundance, ifthe rms velocity on a scale of 1 pc is at least 3 km/s, in agreement withprevious results based on incompressible turbulence. because of its importancein the thermal balance of molecular clouds and high-mass star-forming cores,the process of turbulent heating may be central in setting the characteristicstellar mass and in regulating molecular chemical reactions.

astro-ph;0010344	the effects of noise and sampling on the spectral correlation function	the effects of noise and sampling on the ``spectral correlation function''(scf) introduced by rosolowsky et al. 1999 are studied using observationaldata, numerical simulations of magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence, and simplemodels of gaussian spectral line profiles. the most significant innovations ofthis paper are: i) the normalization of the scf based on an analytic model forthe effect of noise; ii) the computation of the scf as a function of thespatial lag between spectra within a map. by computing of the dependence of thescf on the spatial lag, s_o(dr), we have been able to conclude that: 1) s_o(dr)is a power law, with slope in the range of scales l_i-l_o. 2) the correlationouter scale, l_o, is determined by the size of the map, and no evidence for atrue departure from self-similarity on large scales has been found. 3) thecorrelation inner scale, l_i, is a true estimate of the smallest self-similarscale in a map. 4) the spectral slope in a given region, is independent ofvelocity resolution (above a minimum resolution threshold), spatial resolution,and average spectrum quality. 5) molecular transitions which trace higher gasdensity yield larger values of the spectral slope than transitions tracinglower gas density. 6) nyquist sampling, bad pixels in detector arrays, andreference sharing data acquisition need to be taken into account for a correctdetermination of the scf at lag dr=1. the value of the spectral slope, however,can be computed correctly without a detailed knowledge of observationalprocedures.

astro-ph;0011122	the turbulent shock origin of proto--stellar cores	the fragmentation of molecular clouds (mc) into protostellar cores is acentral aspect of the process of star formation. because of the turbulentnature of super-sonic motions in mcs, it has been suggested that densestructures such as filaments and clumps are formed by shocks in a turbulentflow. in this work we present strong evidence in favor of the turbulent originof the fragmentation of mcs. the most generic result of turbulent fragmentationis that dense post shock gas traces a gas component with a smaller velocitydispersion than lower density gas, since shocks correspond to regions ofconverging flows, where the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion isdissipated. using synthetic maps of spectra of molecular transitions, computedfrom the results of numerical simulations of super--sonic turbulence, we showthat the dependence of velocity dispersion on gas density generates anobservable relation between the rms velocity centroid and the integratedintensity (column density), sigma(v_0)-i, which is indeed found in theobservational data. the comparison between the theoretical model (maps ofsynthetic 13co spectra), with 13co maps from the perseus, rosette and taurus mccomplexes, shows excellent agreement in the sigma(v_0)-i relation. thesigma(v_0)-i relation of different observational maps with the same total rmsvelocity are remarkably similar, which is a strong indication of their originfrom a very general property of the fluid equations, such as the turbulentfragmentation process.

astro-ph;0011229	turbulent fragmentation and the initial conditions for star formation	super-sonic turbulence fragments molecular clouds (mc) into a very complexdensity field with density contrasts of several orders of magnitude. a fractionof the gas is locked into dense and gravitationally bound cores, which collapseas proto-stars. this process can be studied with numerical simulations ofsuper-sonic self-gravitating turbulence.  in this work, we use numerical simulations of magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd),super-sonic, super-alfv\'{e}nic and self-gravitating turbulence to compute themass distribution of collapsing proto-stellar cores, which are selected aslocal density maxima. we find that the mass distribution of collapsing cores isconsistent with the stellar initial mass function (imf), suggesting thatsuper-sonic turbulence may be responsible for the generation of the imf.  to support this conclusion we also show that the physical properties of thenumerically selected cores are in agreement with the properties of observednh$_3$ cores and that their magnetic field strength is consistent with zeemansplitting measurements.  in turbulent mcs, star formation occurs via the gravitational collapse ofsuper-critical cores, formed by the turbulent flow, sub-critical cores beingirrelevant for the process of star formation.

astro-ph;0011465	the stellar imf from turbulent fragmentation	the morphology and kinematics of molecular clouds (mcs) are best explained asthe consequence of super--sonic turbulence. super--sonic turbulence fragmentsmcs into dense sheets, filaments and cores and large low density ``voids'', viathe action of highly radiative shocks. we refer to this process as "turbulentfragmentation". in this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationallyunstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. the massdistribution above one solar mass depends primarily on the power spectrum ofthe turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in amagnetized gas. for a power spectrum index \beta=-1.74, consistent withlarson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well as with new numerical andanalytic results on super--sonic turbulence, we obtain a power law massdistribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-\beta) = 1.33,consistent with the slope of the stellar imf. below one solar mass, the massdistribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of a solar mass, asobserved for the stellar imf in a number of stellar clusters, because only thedensest cores are gravitationally unstable. the mass distribution at low massesis determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which isknown to be approximately log--normal for an isothermal turbulent gas. theintermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsiblefor the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even ofsub--stellar mass. since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable insuper--sonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of thepresent model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar imf, we concludethat turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar imf.

astro-ph;0104231	theoretical models of polarized dust emission from protostellar cores	we model the polarized thermal dust emission from protostellar cores that areassembled by super-sonic turbulent flows in molecular clouds. self-gravitatingcores are selected from a three dimensional simulation of super-sonic andsuper-alfvenic magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence. the polarization iscomputed in two ways. in model a it is assumed that dust properties and grainalignment efficiency are uniform; in model b it is assumed that grains are notaligned at visual extinction larger than 3 mag. the main results of this workare: i) values of the degree of polarization p between 1 and 10% are typical,despite the super-alfvenic nature of the turbulence; ii) a steep decrease of pwith increasing values of the sub-mm dust continuum intensity i is always foundin self--gravitating cores selected from the mhd simulations, if grains are notaligned above a certain value of visual extinction (model b); iii) the samebehavior is hard to reproduce if grains are aligned independently of visualextinction (model a); iv) the chandrasekhar-fermi formula, corrected by afactor f=0.4, provides an approximate estimate of the average magnetic fieldstrength in the cores. sub-mm dust continuum polarization maps of quiescentprotostellar cores and bok globules always show a decrease in p with increasingvalue of i consistent with the predictions of our model b. we thereforeconclude that sub-mm polarization maps of quiescent cores do not map themagnetic field inside the cores at visual extinction larger than approximately3 mag. there is no inconsistency between the results from optical and near-irpolarized absorption of background stars, and the observed polarization ofsub-mm dust continuum from quiescent cores. in both cases, grains at largevisual extinction appear to be virtually unaligned.

astro-ph;0211135	the spectral correlation function of molecular clouds: a statistical  test for theoretical models	we compute the spectral correlation function (scf) of 13co j=1--0 maps ofmolecular cloud complexes. the scf is a power law over approximately an orderof magnitude in spatial separation in every map. the power law slope of thescf, alpha, its normalization, s_0(1pc), and the spectral line width averagedover the whole map, sigma_v, are computed for all the observational maps. thevalues of alpha, s_0(1pc) and sigma_v are combined to obtain empiricalcorrelations to be used as tests for theoretical models of molecular clouds.synthetic spectral maps are computed from different theoretical models,including solutions of the magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) equations with differentvalues of the rms mach number of the flow and stochastic models with differentpower spectra of the velocity field. in order to compute the radiative transferfrom the mhd models it is necessary to assign the models a physical scale and aphysical density. when these assignments are made according to larson typerelations the best fit to the observational correlations is obtained.unphysical stochastic models are instead ruled out by the empiricalcorrelations. mhd models with equipartition of magnetic and kinetic energy ofturbulence do not reproduce the observational data when their average magneticfield is oriented approximately parallel to the line of sight.

astro-ph;0411129	a solution to the protostellar accretion problem	accretion rates of order 10^-8 m_\odot/yr are observed in young protostars ofapproximately a solar mass with evidence of circumstellar disks. the accretionrate is significantly lower for protostars of smaller mass, approximatelyproportional to the second power of the stellar mass, \dot{m}_accr\propto m^2.the traditional view is that the observed accretion is the consequence of theangular momentum transport in isolated protostellar disks, controlled by diskturbulence or self--gravity. however, these processes are not well understoodand the observed protostellar accretion, a fundamental aspect of starformation, remains an unsolved problem. in this letter we propose theprotostellar accretion rate is controlled by accretion from the large scale gasdistribution in the parent cloud, not by the isolated disk evolution.describing this process as bondi--hoyle accretion, we obtain accretion ratescomparable to the observed ones. we also reproduce the observed dependence ofthe accretion rate on the protostellar mass. these results are based onrealistic values of the ambient gas density and velocity, as inferred fromnumerical simulations of star formation in self--gravitating turbulent clouds.

astro-ph;0603711	current advances in the methodology and computational simulation of the  formation of low-mass stars	developing a theory of low-mass star formation ($\sim 0.1$ to 3~m$_{\odot}$)remains one of the most elusive and important goals of theoreticalastrophysics. the star-formation process is the outcome of the complex dynamicsof interstellar gas involving non-linear interactions of turbulence, gravity,magnetic field and radiation. the evolution of protostellar condensations, fromthe moment they are assembled by turbulent flows to the time they reach stellardensities, spans an enormous range of scales, resulting in a majorcomputational challenge for simulations. since the previous protostars andplanets conference, dramatic advances in the development of new numericalalgorithmic techniques have been successfully implemented on large scaleparallel supercomputers. among such techniques, adaptive mesh refinement andsmooth particle hydrodynamics have provided frameworks to simulate the processof low-mass star formation with a very large dynamic range. it is now feasibleto explore the turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds and thegravitational collapse of cores into stars self-consistently within the samecalculation. the increased sophistication of these powerful methods comes withsubstantial caveats associated with the use of the techniques and theinterpretation of the numerical results. in this review, we examine what hasbeen accomplished in the field and present a critique of both numerical methodsand scientific results. we stress that computational simulations should obeythe available observational constraints and demonstrate numerical convergence.failing this, results of numerical simulations do not advance our understandingof low-mass star formation.

astro-ph;9901288	a super-alfvenic model of dark clouds	supersonic random motions are observed in dark clouds and are traditionallyinterpreted as alfven waves, but the possibility that these motions aresuper-alfvenic has not been ruled out. in this work we report the results ofnumerical experiments in two opposite regimes; m_a ~ 1 and m_a &gt;&gt; 1, where m_ais the initial alfvenic mach number --the ratio of the rms velocity to thealfven speed. our results show that models with m_a &gt;&gt; 1 are consistent withthe observed properties of molecular clouds that we have tested --statistics ofextinction measurements, zeeman splitting measurements of magnetic fieldstrength, line width versus integrated antenna temperature of molecularemission line spectra, statistical b-n relation, and scatter in that relation--while models with m_a ~ 1 have properties that are in conflict with theobservations. we find that both the density and the magnetic field in molecularclouds may be very intermittent. the statistical distributions of magneticfield and gas density are related by a power law, with an index that decreaseswith time in experiments with decaying turbulence. after about one dynamicaltime it stabilizes at b ~ n^{0.4}. magnetically dominated cores form early inthe evolution, while later on the intermittency in the density field wins out,and also cores with weak field can be generated, by mass accretion alongmagnetic field lines.

astro-ph;9905383	super-sonic turbulence in the perseus molecular cloud	we compare the statistical properties of j=1-0 13co spectra observed in theperseus molecular cloud with synthetic j=1-0 13co spectra, computed solving thenon-lte radiative transfer problem for a model cloud obtained as solutions ofthe three dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) equations. the model cloud isa randomly forced super-alfvenic and highly super-sonic turbulent isothermalflow.  the purpose of the present work is to test if idealized turbulent flows,without self-gravity, stellar radiation, stellar outflows, or any other effectof star formation, are inconsistent or not with statistical properties of starforming molecular clouds.  we present several statistical results that demonstrate remarkable similaritybetween real data and the synthetic cloud. statistical properties of molecularclouds like perseus are appropriately described by random super-sonic andsuper-alfvenic mhd flows. although the description of gravity and stellarradiation are essential to understand the formation of single protostars andthe effects of star formation in the cloud dynamics, the overall description ofthe cloud and of the initial conditions for star formation can apparently beprovided on intermediate scales without accounting for gravity, stellarradiation, and a detailed modeling of stellar outflows.  we also show that the relation between equivalent line width and integratedantenna temperature indicates the presence of a relatively strong magneticfield in the core b1, in agreement with zeeman splitting measurements.

astro-ph;9908207	the chemical evolution of the galaxy with variable imfs	in this work we explore the effects of adopting initial mass functions (imfs)variable in time on the chemical evolution of the galaxy. in order to do thatwe adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes forthe formation of the galaxy and which proved to be successful in reproducingthe majority of the observational constraints, at least for the case of aconstant imf. different variable imfs are tested with this model, all assumingthat massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity.this implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and atlarge galactocentric distances. our numerical results have shown that all thevariable imfs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevantobservational constraints in the galaxy and that a constant imf stillreproduces better the observations. in particular, variable imfs of the kindexplored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients evenwhen allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as, forinstance, the star formation rate. as a consequence of this we conclude thatthe g-dwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a largetimescale and a constant imf, since it is possible to find variable imfs of thekind studied here, reproducing the g-dwarf metallicity but this worsen theagreement with other observational constraints.

astro-ph;9910279	proto-galactic starbursts at high redshift	we have computed the evolving ultraviolet-millimeter spectral energydistribution (sed) produced by proto-galactic starbursts at high redshift,incorporating the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in a consistentmanner. dust extinction is calculated in a novel way, that is not based onempirical calibrations of extinction curves, but rather on the lifetime ofmolecular clouds which delays the emergence of each successive generation ofstars at ultraviolet wavelengths by typically 15 myr. the predicted rest-framefar-infrared to millimeter-wave emission includes the calculation of molecularemission-line luminosities ($^{12}$co and o$_{2}$ among other molecules)consistent with the evolving chemical abundances. here we present details ofthis new model, along with the results of comparing its predictions withseveral high-redshift observables, namely: the ultraviolet seds of lyman-limitgalaxies, the high-redshift radiogalaxies 4c41.17 and 8c1435, the scubasub-millimeter survey of the hubble deep field (hdf), and the seds ofintermediate-redshift elliptical galaxies. with our new reddening method, weare able to fit the spectrum of the lyman-limit galaxy 1512-cb58, and we findan extinction of about 1.9 magnitudes at 1600 {\aa}. the model also predictsthat most lyman-limit galaxies should have a value of $\alpha$ inside thatrange, as it is observed. the 850 $\mu$m flux density of a typical lyman-limitgalaxy is expected to be only $\simeq 0.5$ mjy, and therefore the opticalcounterparts of the most luminous sub-mm sources in the hdf (or any othercurrently feasible sub-mm survey) are unlikely to be lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;9910529	primordial proto-galaxies	the first stars to form in protogalaxies must have primordial chemicalcomposition. we refer to a protogalaxy that is forming stars of primordialcomposition, or very low metallicity ($z\le 0.01 z_{\odot}$), as ``primordialproto-galaxy'' (ppg). ppgs contain little or no dust, and therefore theirspectral energy distribution can be modelled from the rest-frame ultraviolet tothe infrared without accounting for dust extinction and emission. we presentthe results of computing the photometric properties of high redshift ppgs atnear-d-to-mid infrared wavelengths, that will soon be available with the newgeneration of infrared space telescopes, such as sirtf and the ngst. we showthat: i) ppgs at very high redshift (5&lt;z&lt;10) should be easily selected fromdeep near/mid ir surveys with a colour-colour criterion; ii) ppgs at redshift5&lt;z&lt;10 can be detected at 8 $\mu$m with the ngst, if they have a constant starformation rate of at least 100 m$_{\odot}/$yr; iii) once the redshift of a ppgphotometric candidate is determined, its near-to-mid infrared colors shouldprovide strong constraints on the stellar imf at zero or very low metallicity.
