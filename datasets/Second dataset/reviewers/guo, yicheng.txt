0901.1150	structural properties of central galaxies in groups and clusters	using a representative sample of 911 central galaxies (cens) from the sdssdr4 group catalogue, we study how the structure of the most massive members ingroups and clusters depend on (1) galaxy stellar mass (mstar), (2) dark matterhalo mass of the host group (mhalo), and (3) their halo-centric position. weestablish and thoroughly test a galfit-based pipeline to fit 2d sersic modelsto sdss data. we find that the fitting results are most sensitive to thebackground sky level determination and strongly recommend using the sdss globalvalue. we find that uncertainties in the background translate into a strongcovariance between the total magnitude, half-light size (r50), and sersic index(n), especially for bright/massive galaxies. we find that n depends strongly onmstar for cens, but only weakly or not at all on mhalo. less (more) massivecens tend to be disk (spheroid)-like over the full mhalo range. likewise, thereis a clear r50-mstar relation for cens, with separate slopes for disks andspheroids. when comparing cens with satellite galaxies (sats), we find that lowmass (&lt;10e10.75 msun/h^2) sats have larger median n than cens of similar mstar.low mass, late-type sats have moderately smaller r50 than late-type cens of thesame mstar. however, we find no size differences between spheroid-like cens andsats, and no structural differences between cens and sats matched in both massand colour. the similarity of massive sats and cens shows that this distinctionhas no significant impact on the structure of spheroids. we conclude that mstaris the most fundamental property determining the basic structure of a galaxy.the lack of a clear n-mhalo relation rules out a distinct group mass forproducing spheroids, and the responsible morphological transformation processesmust occur at the centres of groups spanning a wide range of masses.

0911.1158	the morphology of passively evolving galaxies at z ~ 2 from hst/wfc3  deep imaging in the hubble ultradeep field	we present near-ir images, obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst) andthe wfc3/ir camera, of six passive and massive galaxies at redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4(ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}; stellar mass m~10^{11} m_{sun}), selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey (goods). these images, which have aspatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc, provide the deepest view of the opticalrest-frame morphology of such systems to date. we find that the light profileof these galaxies is regular and well described by a sersic model with indextypical of today's spheroids. their size, however, is generally much smallerthan today's early types of similar stellar mass, with four out of six galaxieshaving r_e ~ 1 kpc or less, in quantitative agreement with previous similarmeasures made at rest-frame uv wavelengths. the images reach limiting surfacebrightness mu~26.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the f160w bandpass; yet, there is noevidence of a faint halo in the galaxies of our sample, even in their stackedimage. we also find that these galaxies have very weak "morphologicalk-correction" between the rest-frame uv (from the acs z-band), and therest--frame optical (wfc3 h-band): the sersic index, physical size and overallmorphology are independent or only mildly dependent on the wavelength, withinthe errors.

1009.3504	a detailed study of photometric redshifts for goods-south galaxies	we use the deepest and the most comprehensive photometric data currentlyavailable for goods-south galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. thephotometry includes vlt/vimos (u-band), hst/acs (f435w, f606w, f775w, andf850lp bands), vlt/isaac (j-, h-, and ks-bands), and four spitzer/irac channels(3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron). the catalog is selected in the z-band (f850lp)and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed tfitalgorithm, which performs psf matched photometry uniformly across differentinstruments and filters, despite large variations in psfs and pixel scales.photometric redshifts are derived using the goodz code, which is based on thetemplate fitting method using priors. the code also implements "training" ofthe template sed set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order tominimize systematic differences between the templates and the seds of theobserved galaxies. our final catalog covers an area of 153 sq. arcmin andincludes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. the scatterbetween our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma=0.040with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing tosigma=0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit m(z)&lt;24.5. this isconsistent with the best results previously published for goods-s galaxies,however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and providesphotometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits andhigher redshifts than earlier works. furthermore, we show that the photometricredshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent withthose expected based on the lyman break technique.

1106.1205	discovery of cold, pristine gas possibly accreting onto an overdensity  of star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6	we report the discovery of large amounts of cold (t ~ 10^4 k), chemicallyyoung gas in an overdensity of galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6 in the greatobservatories origins deep survey southern field (goods-s). the gas isidentified thanks to the ultra-strong mg ii absorption features it imprints inthe rest-frame uv spectra of galaxies in the background of the overdensity.there is no evidence that the optically-thick gas is part of any massive galaxy(i.e. m_star &gt; 4x10^9 m_sun), but rather is associated with the overdensity;less massive and fainter galaxies (25.5 &lt; z_850 &lt; 27.5 mag) have too large animpact parameter to be causing ultra-strong absorption systems, based on ourknowledge of such systems. the lack of corresponding fe ii absorption features,not detected even in co-added spectra, suggests that the gas is chemically morepristine than the ism and outflows of star-forming galaxies at similarredshift, including those in the overdensity itself, and comparable to the mostmetal-poor stars in the milky way halo. a crude estimate of the projectedcovering factor of the high-column density gas (n_h &gt;~ 10^20 cm-2) based on theobserved fraction of galaxies with ultra-strong absorbers is c_f ~ 0.04. abroad, continuum absorption profile extending to the red of the interstellar mgii absorption line by &lt;~ 2000 km/s is possibly detected in two independentco-added spectra of galaxies of the overdensity, consistent with a large-scaleinfall motion of the gas onto the overdensity and its galaxies. overall, thesefindings provides the first tentative evidence of accretion of cold, chemicallyyoung gas onto galaxies at high redshift, possibly feeding their star formationactivity. the fact that the galaxies are members of a large structure, asopposed to field galaxies, might play a significant role in our ability todetect the accreting gas.

1106.4308	the relative abundance of compact and normal massive early-type galaxies  and its evolution from redshift z~2 to the present	we report on the evolution of the number density and size of early-typegalaxies from z~2 to z~0. we select a sample of 563 massive (m&gt;10^{10} msun),passively evolving (ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}) and morphologically spheroidalgalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, using the panchromatic photometry and spectroscopicredshifts available in the goods fields. we combine acs and wfc3 hst images tostudy the morphology of our galaxies in their optical rest-frame in the whole0&lt;z&lt;2.5 range. we find that throughout the explored redshift range the passivegalaxies selected with our criteria have weak morphological k-correction, withsize being slightly smaller in the optical than in the uv rest-frame (by ~20and ~10 at z&gt;1.2 and z&lt;1.2, respectively). we measure a significant evolutionof the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies, with the fractional incrementthat is almost independent on the stellar mass. early-type galaxies (etgs)formed at z&gt;1 appear to be preferentially small, and the evolution of themass-size relation at z&lt;1 is driven by both the continuous size growth of thecompact galaxies and the appearance of new etgs with large sizes. we also findthat the number density of all passive early-type galaxies increases rapidly,by a factor of 5, from z~2 to z~1, and then more mildly by another factor of1.5 from z~1 to z~0. we interpret these results as the evidence that the bulkof the etgs are formed at 1&lt;z&lt;3 through a mechanism that leaves very compactremnants. at z&lt;1 the compact etgs grow gradually in size, becoming normal sizegalaxies, and at the same time new etgs with normal-large sizes are formed.

1107.0317	galaxy structure and mode of star formation in the sfr-mass plane from z  ~ 2.5 to z ~ 0.1	we analyze the dependence of galaxy structure (size and sersic index) andmode of star formation (\sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv) on the position ofgalaxies in the sfr versus mass diagram. our sample comprises roughly 640000galaxies at z~0.1, 130000 galaxies at z~1, and 36000 galaxies at z~2.structural measurements for all but the z~0.1 galaxies were based on hstimaging, and sfrs are derived using a herschel-calibrated ladder of sfrindicators. we find that a correlation between the structure and stellarpopulation of galaxies (i.e., a 'hubble sequence') is already in place since atleast z~2.5. at all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequenceare well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescentgalaxies are better described by de vaucouleurs profiles. in the upper envelopeof the main sequence, the relation between the sfr and sersic index reverses,suggesting a rapid build-up of the central mass concentration in thesestarbursting outliers. we observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-formingsystems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. at eachmass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. therate of size growth correlates with specific sfr, and so does \sigma_sfr ateach redshift. a simple model using an empirically determined sf law andmetallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and starsis able to relate the observed \sigma_sfr and sfr_ir/sfr_uv, provided a morepatchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.

1107.5256	extreme emission line galaxies in candels: broad-band selected,  star-bursting dwarf galaxies at z&gt;1	we identify an abundant population of extreme emission line galaxies (eelgs)at redshift z~1.7 in the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) imaging from hubble space telescope/wide field camera 3(hst/wfc3). 69 eelg candidates are selected by the large contribution ofexceptionally bright emission lines to their near-infrared broad-bandmagnitudes. supported by spectroscopic confirmation of strong [oiii] emissionlines -- with rest-frame equivalent widths ~1000\aa -- in the four candidatesthat have hst/wfc3 grism observations, we conclude that these objects aregalaxies with 10^8 msol in stellar mass, undergoing an enormous starburst phasewith m_*/(dm_*/dt) of only ~15 myr. these bursts may cause outflows that arestrong enough to produce cored dark matter profiles in low-mass galaxies. theindividual star formation rates and the co-moving number density (3.7x10^-4mpc^-3) can produce in ~4 gyr much of the stellar mass density that ispresently contained in 10^8-10^9 msol dwarf galaxies. therefore, ourobservations provide a strong indication that many or even most of the stars inpresent-day dwarf galaxies formed in strong, short-lived bursts, mostly at z&gt;1.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.3794	candels observations of the structural properties and evolution of  galaxies in a cluster at z=1.62	we discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in az=1.62 proto-cluster using near-ir imaging data from hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 data of the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphologyrelation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally havemorphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistentwith ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. the sizedistribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (&lt;1kpc), massive galaxies compared to candels field galaxies at z=1.6. as aresult the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizescompared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent clustergalaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). if this result is generalizable, then it implies thatphysical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to havecaused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slowersubsequent growth at z&lt;1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. thequiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lowerredshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggestthat they contain extended stellar disks. we argue the cluster galaxies requiredissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the diskmaterial and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, andcolor of early-type galaxies in z&lt;1 clusters.

1110.3800	multi-wavelength view of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forming  galaxies at z~2	this paper studies the properties of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forminggalaxies at z~2 through multi-wavelength broad band photometry. a sample of 40clumps is identified through auto-detection and visual inspection from 10galaxies with 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 in the hubble ultra deep field, where deep andhigh-resolution hst/wfc3 and acs images enable us to resolve structures of z~2galaxies down to kpc scale in the rest-frame uv and optical bands as well as todetect clumps toward the faint end. the physical properties of clumps aremeasured through fitting spatially resolved seven-band (bvizyjh) spectralenergy distribution to models. on average, the clumps are blue and have similarmedian rest-frame uv--optical color as the diffuse components of their hostgalaxies, but the clumps have large scatter in their colors. although the starformation rate (sfr)--stellar mass relation of galaxies is dominated by thediffuse components, clumps emerge as regions with enhanced specific sfrs,contributing individually ~10% and together ~50% of the sfr of the hostgalaxies. however, the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv/opticalluminosity and stellar mass are smaller, typically a few percent individuallyand ~20% together. on average, clumps are younger by 0.2 dex and denser by afactor of 8 than diffuse components. clump properties have obvious radialvariations in the sense that central clumps are redder, older, more extincted,denser, and less active on forming stars than outskirts clumps. our results arebroadly consistent with a widely held view that clumps are formed throughgravitational instability in gas-rich turbulent disks and would eventuallymigrate toward galactic centers and coalesce into bulges. roughly 40% of thegalaxies in our sample contain a massive clump that could be identified as aproto-bulge, which seems qualitatively consistent with such a bulge-formationscenario.

1111.1233	how do star-forming galaxies at z&gt;3 assemble their masses?	we investigate how star-forming galaxies typically assemble their masses athigh redshift. using the deep multi-wavelength coverage of the goods dataset,we measure stellar mass of a large sample of star-forming galaxies at z~4 and5, and make a robust determination of stellar mass function (smf). we report abroad correlation between stellar mass and uv luminosity, such that moreuv-luminous galaxies are, on average, more massive. however, the correlationhas a substantial intrinsic scatter evidenced by a non-negligible number ofuv-faint but massive galaxies. furthermore, the low-mass end of the smf doesnot rise as steeply as the uv luminosity function (alpha_uvlf} -(1.7-1.8),alpha_smf -(1.3-1.4)) of the same galaxies. in a smooth formation scenariowhere star formation (sf) is sustained at the observed rates for a long time,these galaxies would have accumulated more mass (by a factor of ~3) thanobserved and therefore the smf would mirror more closely that of the uvlf. therelatively shallow slope of the smf is due to the fact that many of theuv-selected galaxies are not massive enough, and therefore are too faint intheir rest-frame optical bands, to be detected in the current observations. ourresults favor a episodic formation history in which sf in low-mass galaxiesvary significantly over time, a scenario favored by galaxy clustering. ourfindings for the uv-faint galaxies are in contrast with those found for moreuv-luminous galaxies, which exhibit tighter sfr-m_star correlations. thediscrepancy may suggest that galaxies at different luminosities may havedifferent evolutionary paths.

1111.2135	clustering properties of bzk-selected galaxies in goods-n: environmental  quenching and triggering of star formation at z ~ 2	using a sample of bzk-selected galaxies at z~2 identified from thecfht/wircam near-infrared survey of goods-north, we discuss the relationbetween star formation rate (sfr), specific star formation rate (ssfr), andstellar mass (m_{*}), and the clustering of galaxies as a function of theseparameters. for star-forming galaxies (sbzks), the uv-based sfr, corrected forextinction, scales with the stellar mass as sfr ~ m_{*}^{alpha} with alpha =0.74+/-0.20 down to m_{*} ~ 10^{9} m_{solar}, indicating a weak dependence onthe stellar mass of the ssfr. we also measure the angular correlation functionand hence infer the correlation length for sbzk galaxies as a function ofm_{*}, sfr, and ssfr, as well as k-band apparent magnitude. we show thatpassive galaxies (pbzks) are more strongly clustered than sbzk galaxies at agiven stellar mass, mirroring the color-density relation seen at lowerredshifts. we also find that the correlation length of sbzk galaxies rangesfrom 4 to 20 h^{-1}mpc, being a strong function of m_{k}, m_{*}, and sfr. onthe other hand, the clustering dependence on ssfr changes abruptly at 2x10^{-9}yr^{-1}, which is the typical value for "main sequence" star-forming galaxiesat z~2. we show that the correlation length reaches a minimum at thischaracteristic value, and is larger for galaxies with both smaller and largerssfrs; a dichotomy that is only marginally implied from the predictions of thesemi-analytical models. our results suggest that there are two types ofenvironmental effects at work at z~2. stronger clustering for relativelyquiescent galaxies implies that the environment has started to play a role inquenching star formation. at the same time, stronger clustering for galaxieswith elevated ssfrs ("starbursts") might be attributed to an increasedefficiency for galaxy interactions and mergers in dense environments.

1201.1012	survey design for spectral energy distribution fitting: a fisher matrix  approach	the spectral energy distribution (sed) of a galaxy contains information onthe galaxy's physical properties, and multi-wavelength observations are neededin order to measure these properties via sed fitting. in planning thesesurveys, optimization of the resources is essential. the fisher matrixformalism can be used to quickly determine the best possible experimental setupto achieve the desired constraints on the sed fitting parameters. however,because it relies on the assumption of a gaussian likelihood function, it is ingeneral less accurate than other slower techniques that reconstruct theprobability distribution function (pdf) from the direct comparison betweenmodels and data. we compare the uncertainties on sed fitting parameterspredicted by the fisher matrix to the ones obtained using the more thorough pdffitting techniques. we use both simulated spectra and real data, and consider alarge variety of target galaxies differing in redshift, mass, age, starformation history, dust content, and wavelength coverage. we find that theuncertainties reported by the two methods agree within a factor of two in thevast majority (~ 90%) of cases. if the age determination is uncertain, thetop-hat prior in age used in pdf fitting to prevent each galaxy from beingolder than the universe needs to be incorporated in the fisher matrix, at leastapproximately, before the two methods can be properly compared. we concludethat the fisher matrix is a useful tool for astronomical survey design.

1201.5642	on the detection of ionizing radiation arising from star-forming  galaxies at redshift z ~ 3-4 : looking for analogs of "stellar reionizers"	we use the spatially-resolved, multi-band photometry in the goods south fieldacquired by the candels project to constrain the nature of candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters at redshift z~3.7 identified using ultra-deep imagingbelow the lyman limit (1-sigma limit of ~30 ab in a 2" diameter aperture). in18 candidates, out of a sample of 19 with flux detected at &gt;3-sigma level, thelight centroid of the candidate lyc emission is offset from that of the lbg byup to 1.5". we fit the sed of the lyc candidates to spectral populationsynthesis models to measure photometric redshifts and the stellar populationparameters. we also discuss the differences in the uv colors between the lbgand the lyc candidates, and how to estimate the escape fraction of ionizingradiation (f_esc) in cases, like in most of our galaxies, where the lycemission is spatially offset from the host galaxy. in all but one case weconclude that the candidate lyc emission is most likely due to lower redshiftinterlopers. based on these findings, we argue that the majority of similarmeasurements reported in the literature need further investigation before itcan be firmly concluded that lyc emission is detected. our only surviving lyccandidate is a lbg at z=3.795, which shows the bluest (b-v) color among lbgs atsimilar redshift, a stellar mass of m~2 x 10^9 msun, weak interstellarabsorption lines and a flat uv spectral slope with no lya in emission. weestimate its f_esc to be in the range 25%-100%, depending on the dust andintergalactic attenuation.

1203.1831	galapagos: from pixels to parameters	to automate source detection, two-dimensional light-profile sersic modellingand catalogue compilation in large survey applications, we introduce a new codegalapagos, galaxy analysis over large areas: parameter assessment by galfittingobjects from sextractor. based on a single setup, galapagos can process acomplete set of survey images. it detects sources in the data, estimates alocal sky background, cuts postage stamp images for all sources, preparesobject masks, performs sersic fitting including neighbours and compiles allobjects in a final output catalogue. for the initial source detection galapagosapplies sextractor, while galfit is incorporated for modelling sersic profiles.it measures the background sky involved in the sersic fitting by means of aflux growth curve. galapagos determines postage stamp sizes based on sextractorshape parameters. in order to obtain precise model parameters galapagosincorporates a complex sorting mechanism and makes use of modern cpu'smultiplexing capabilities. it combines sextractor and galfit data in a singleoutput table. when incorporating information from overlapping tiles, galapagosautomatically removes multiple entries from identical sources. galapagos isprogrammed in the interactive data language, idl. we test the stability and theability to properly recover structural parameters extensively with artificialimage simulations. moreover, we apply galapagos successfully to the stages dataset. for one-orbit hst data, a single 2.2 ghz cpu processes about 1000 primarysources per 24 hours. note that galapagos results depend critically on theuser-defined parameter setup. this paper provides useful guidelines to help theuser make sensible choices.

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1303.2689	constraining the assembly of normal and compact passively evolving  galaxies from redshift z=3 to the present with candels	we study the evolution of the number density, as a function of the size, ofpassive early-type galaxies with a wide range of stellar masses10^10&lt;m*/msun&lt;10^11.5) from z~3 to z~1, exploiting the unique dataset availablein the goods-south field, including the recently obtained wfc3 images as a partof the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels). in particular, we select a sample of 107 massive (m*&gt;10^10 m_sun),passive (ssfr&lt;10^-2 gyr^-1) and morphologically spheroidal galaxies at 1.2&lt;z&lt;3,taking advantage of the panchromatic dataset available for goods, includingvlt, cfht, spitzer, chandra and hst acs+wfc3 data. we find that at 1&lt;z&lt;3 thepassively evolving early-type galaxies are the reddest and most massive objectsin the universe, and we prove that a correlation between mass, morphology,color and star-formation activity is already in place at that epoch. we measurea significant evolution in the mass-size relation of passive early-typegalaxies (etgs) from z~3 to z~1, with galaxies growing on average by a factorof 2 in size in a 3 gyr timescale only. we witness also an increase in thenumber density of passive etgs of 50 times over the same time interval. we findthat the first etgs to form at z&gt;2 are all compact or ultra-compact, whilenormal sized etgs (meaning etgs with sizes comparable to those of localcounterparts of the same mass) are the most common etgs only at z&lt;1. theincrease of the average size of etgs at 0&lt;z&lt;1 is primarily driven by theappearance of new large etgs rather than by the size increase of individualgalaxies.

1304.4622	serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096: implications  for the early formation and late evolution of cd galaxies	we have made a serendipitous discovery of a massive cd galaxy at z=1.096 in acandidate rich cluster in the hudf area of goods-south. this brightest clustergalaxy is the most distant cd galaxy confirmed to date. ultra-deep hst/wfc3images reveal an extended envelope starting from ~10 kpc and reaching ~70 kpcin radius along the semi-major axis. the spectral energy distributions indicatethat both its inner component and outer envelope are composed of an old,passively-evolving stellar population. the cd galaxy lies on the same mass-sizerelation as the bulk of quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. the cd galaxyhas a higher stellar mass surface density but a similar velocity dispersion tothose of more-massive, nearby cds. if the cd galaxy is one of the progenitorsof today's more massive cds, its size and stellar mass have had to increase onaverage by factors of $3.4\pm1.1$ and $3.3\pm1.3$ over the past ~8 gyrs,respectively. such increases in size and stellar mass without being accompaniedby significant increases in velocity dispersion are consistent withevolutionary scenarios driven by both major and minor dry mergers. if such cdenvelopes originate from dry mergers, our discovery of even one example provesthat some bcgs entered the dry merger phase at epochs earlier than z=1. ourdata match theoretical models which predict that the continuance of dry mergersat z&lt;1 can result in structures similar to those of massive cd galaxies seentoday. moreover, our discovery is a surprise given that the extreme depth ofthe hudf is essential to reveal such an extended cd envelope at z&gt;1 and, yet,the hudf covers only a minuscule region of sky. adding that cds are rare, ourserendipitous discovery hints that such cds may be more common than expected.[abridged]

1305.6931	structural evolution of early-type galaxies to z=2.5 in candels	projected axis ratio measurements of 880 early-type galaxies at redshifts1&lt;z&lt;2.5 selected from candels are used to reconstruct and model their intrinsicshapes. the sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors toreflect low star-formation activity. we demonstrate that these galaxies as anensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth lightprofiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. similar to theirpresent-day counterparts, the z&gt;1 early-type galaxies show a variety ofintrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributionscannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with verysimilar intrinsic shapes. however, a two-population model for the intrinsicshapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat(c/a~0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratiodistributions of both present-day and z&gt;1 early-type galaxies. we find that theproportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies'stellar mass, and - at a given mass - on redshift. for present-day and z&lt;1early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. at z&gt;1this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here(10^10&lt;m*/m_sun&lt;10^11), because the oblate fraction among massive (m*~10^11m_sun) was much higher in the past: 0.59+-0.10 at z&gt;1, compared to 0.20+-0.02at z~0.1. in contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies(log(m*/m_sun)&lt;10.5) increased toward the present, from 0.38+-0.11 at z&gt;1 to0.72+-0.06 at z=0.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1310.3819	the progenitors of the compact early-type galaxies at high-redshift	we use goods and candels images to identify progenitors of massive (log m &gt;10 msun) compact "early-type" galaxies (etgs) at z~1.6. since merging andaccretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if theprogenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compactthemselves. we select candidate progenitors among compact lyman-break galaxiesat z~3 based on their mass, sfr and central stellar density and find that theseaccount for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact etgs at z~1.6. wefind that the average far-uv sed of the candidates is redder than that of thenon-candidates, but the optical and mid-ir sed are the same, implying that theredder uv of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration, andconsistent with more evolved (aging) star-formation. this is in line with otherevidence that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity amonghigh-redshift massive galaxies. we also find that the light distribution ofboth the compact etgs and their candidate progenitors does not show anyextended "halos" surrounding the compact "core", both in individual images andin stacks. we argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology ofmerger remnants, even if gas-rich, as predicted by n-body simulations. thissuggests that the compact etgs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseousaccretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected inthe hst images, with their stellar mass assembling in-situ, and that they havenot experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z~1.6.

1312.3233	a comparison between semi-analytic model predictions for the candels  survey	we compare the predictions of three independently developed semi-analyticgalaxy formation models that are being used to aid in the interpretation ofresults from the candels survey. these models are each applied to the same setof halo merger trees extracted from the "bolshoi" simulation and are carefullytuned to match the local galaxy stellar mass function using the powerful methodof bayesian inference coupled with mcmc or by hand. the comparisons reveal thatin spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formationand feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similarpredictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and starformation over cosmic time. we show that the sams generally require strongoutflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present daystellar mass function. however, all of the models considered producepredictions for the star formation rates and metallicities of low-mass galaxiesthat are inconsistent with existing data and diverge between the models. wesuggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and smalldifferences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem fromdifferent assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor. importantly, whilemore accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, sfr and metallicityof galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;5 will discriminate between models, the discrepanciesbetween the models and existing data of these observables have already revealedchallenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxyformation. the three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs ofmock galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the candels survey,which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases anduncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real observations.-abridged

1401.5477	morphologies of z~0.7 agn host galaxies in candels: no trend of merger  incidence with agn luminosity	the processes that trigger active galactic nuclei (agn) remain poorlyunderstood. while lower luminosity agn may be triggered by minor disturbancesto the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to triggerluminous agn. major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for agntriggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques.there is however little observational evidence for a strong connection betweenagn and major mergers. we analyse the morphological properties of agn hostgalaxies as a function of agn and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to acarefully matched sample of control galaxies. agn are x-ray selected in theredshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and have luminosities 41 &lt; log(l_x [erg/s]) &lt;44.5. 'fake agn' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sourceswith the magnitude of the matched agn. we find that agn host and controlgalaxies have comparable assymetries, sersic indices and ellipticities atrestframe ~950nm. agn host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries norhigher fractions of very disturbed objects. there is no increase in theprevalence of merger signatures with agn luminosity. at 95% confidence we findthat major mergers are responsible for &lt;6% of all agn in our sample as well as&lt;40% of the highest luminosity agn log(l_x [erg/s]) ~ 43.5). major mergerstherefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of agn in theluminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features toremain visible.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1407.0149	probing outflows in z= 1~2 galaxies through feii/feii* multiplets	we report on a study of the 2300-2600\aa feii/feii* multiplets in the rest-uvspectra of star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.6 as probes of galactic-scaleoutflows. we extracted a mass-limited sample of 97 galaxies at z~1.0-2.6 fromultra-deep spectra obtained during the gmass spetroscopic survey in the goodssouth field with the vlt and fors2. we obtain robust measures of the restequivalent width of the feii absorption lines down to a limit of w_r&gt;1.5 \aaand of the feii* emission lines to w_r&gt;0.5 \aa. whenever we can measure thesystemic redshift of the galaxies from the [oii] emission line, we find thatboth the feii and mgii absorption lines are blueshifted, indicative that bothspecies trace gaseous outflows. we also find, however, that the feii gas hasgenerally lower outflow velocity relative to that of mgii. we investigate thevariation of feii line profiles as a function of the radiative transferproperties of the lines, and find that transitions with higher oscillatorstrengths are more blueshifted in terms of both line centroids and line wings.we discuss the possibility that feii lines are suppressed by stellarabsorptions. the lower velocities of the feii lines relative to the mgiidoublet, as well as the absence of spatially extended feii* emission in 2dstacked spectra, suggest that most clouds responsible for the feii absorptionlie close (3~4 kpc) to the disks of galaxies. we show that the feii/feii*multiplets offer unique probes of the kinematic structure of galactic outflows.

1407.1834	the interstellar medium and feedback in the progenitors of the compact  passive galaxies at z~2	quenched galaxies at z&gt;2 are nearly all very compact relative to z~0,suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,rapid cessation of star-formation. we present restframe uv spectra oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors ofquenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes andhigh surface density of star-formation. we compare their uv properties to thoseof more extended lbgs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).we find that candidate progenitors have faster ism gas velocities and higherequivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocityspread among absorbing clouds. candidates deviate from the relationship betweenequivalent widths of lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in thattheir lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,possibly indicating that the neutral hi fraction is patchy such thatlyman-alpha photons can escape. we detect stronger civ p-cygni features(emission and absorption) and heii emission in candidates, indicative of largerpopulations of metal rich wolf-rayet stars compared to non-candidates. thefaster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and lyman-alpha propertiesof candidates are consistent with their ism being subject to more energeticfeedback than non-candidates. together with their larger metallicity (implyingmore evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, ifspeculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them asprogenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. we propose that massive, compact galaxiesundergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gasaccretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized lbgsat these early epochs.

1407.7525	no more active galactic nuclei in clumpy disks than in smooth galaxies  at z~2 in candels / 3d-hst	we use candels imaging, 3d-hst spectroscopy, and chandra x-ray data toinvestigate if active galactic nuclei (agns) are preferentially fueled byviolent disk instabilities funneling gas into galaxy centers at 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4. weselect galaxies undergoing gravitational instabilities using the number ofclumps and degree of patchiness as proxies. the candels visual classificationsystem is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matchedcomparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. we notethat, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates,the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulgescompared to the clumpy galaxies. the lack of smooth extended disks is probablya general feature of the z~2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directlycompare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift.we find that z~2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced agn fractions selectedby integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatiallyresolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena ratherthan nuclear agns. meanwhile the x-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, andintermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable agn fractions derived fromboth individual detections and stacked non-detections. the data demonstratethat agn fueling modes at z~1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities orsecular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpygalaxies.

1408.2527	the mass evolution of the first galaxies: stellar mass functions and  star formation rates at $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$ in the candels goods-south field	we measure new estimates for the galaxy stellar mass function and starformation rates for samples of galaxies at $z \sim 4,~5,~6~\&amp;~7$ using data inthe candels goods south field. the deep near-infrared observations allow us toconstruct the stellar mass function at $z \geq 6$ directly for the first time.we estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectralenergy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular lineand continuum emission. the observed uv luminosity functions for the samplesare consistent with previous observations, however we find that the observed$m_{uv}$ - m$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constantmass to light ratio and a normalisation which evolves with redshift. ourstellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha \approx -1.9$),steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of theuv luminosity function. integrating our new mass functions, we find theobserved stellar mass density evolves from $\log_{10} \rho_{*} =6.64^{+0.58}_{-0.89}$ at $z \sim 7$ to $7.36\pm0.06$ $\text{m}_{\odot}\text{mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4$. finally, combining the measured uv continuumslopes ($\beta$) with their rest-frame uv luminosities, we calculate dustcorrected star-formation rates (sfr) for our sample. we find the specificstar-formation rate for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst theglobal sfr density falls rapidly over this period. our new sfr densityestimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.

1409.1214	galaxy zoo: candels barred disks and bar fractions	the formation of bars in disk galaxies is a tracer of the dynamical maturityof the population. previous studies have found that the incidence of bars indisks decreases from the local universe to z ~ 1, and by z &gt; 1 simulationspredict that bar features in dynamically mature disks should be extremely rare.here we report the discovery of strong barred structures in massive diskgalaxies at z ~ 1.5 in deep rest-frame optical images from candels. from withina sample of 876 disk galaxies identified by visual classification in galaxyzoo, we identify 123 barred galaxies. selecting a sub-sample within the sameregion of the evolving galaxy luminosity function (brighter than l*), we findthat the bar fraction across the redshift range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 2 (f_bar = 10.7 +6.3-3.5% after correcting for incompleteness) does not significantly evolve. wediscuss the implications of this discovery in the context of existingsimulations and our current understanding of the way disk galaxies have evolvedover the last 11 billion years.

1409.4791	kpc-scale properties of emission-line galaxies	we perform a detailed study of the resolved properties of emission-linegalaxies at kpc-scale to investigate how small-scale and global properties ofgalaxies are related. 119 galaxies with high-resolution keck/deimos spectra areselected to cover a wide range in morphologies over the redshift range0.2&lt;z&lt;1.3. using the hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging data taken as a part of thecandels project, for each galaxy we perform sed fitting per resolution element,producing resolved rest-frame u-v color, stellar mass, star formation rate, ageand extinction maps. we develop a technique to identify blue and red "regions"within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps. as expected, forany given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surfacedensities and older ages compared to the blue regions. furthermore, we quantifythe spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshiftand stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions towardthe centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift orstellar mass. we find that the "main sequence" of star forming galaxies existsamong both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blueregions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.6 dex. the blue regions show higher specific star formation rates (ssfr)than their red counterparts with the ssfr decreasing since z~1, driverprimarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the sfrs at a giverresolution element.

1410.7398	clumpy galaxies in candels. i. the definition of uv clumps and the  fraction of clumpy galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3	although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution,the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because thedefinition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. in this paper, we studythe basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3,using our proposed physical definition that uv-bright clumps are discretestar-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of therest-frame uv light of their galaxies. clumps defined this way aresignificantly brighter than the hii regions of nearby large spiral galaxies,either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution andcosmological dimming are considered. under this definition, we measure thefraction of sfgs that contain at least one off-center clump (fclumpy) and thecontributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv light and star formation rate ofsfgs in the candels/goods-s and uds fields, where our mass-complete sampleconsists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q&gt;0.5. the redshift evolution offclumpy changes with the stellar mass (m*) of the galaxies. low-mass(log(m*/msun)&lt;9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant fclumpy of about 60% fromz~3.0 to z~0.5. intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their fclumpy from55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. we find that (1) the trendof disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the fclumpytrend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of thefclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z&lt;1.5, given a realisticobservability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for thefclumpy trend in all masses at z&lt;1.5. the clump contribution to the rest-frameuv light of sfgs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(m*/msun)~10.5 atall redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.(abridged)

1503.00722	the role of bulge formation in the homogenization of stellar populations  at $z\sim2$ as revealed by internal color dispersion in candels	we use data from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations ofgalaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. we use theinternal color dispersion (icd), measured between the rest-frame uv and opticalbands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellarpopulations. the icd shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologiesof the galaxies. galaxies with the largest variation in their stellarpopulations as evidenced by high icd have disk-dominated morphologies (withs\'{e}rsic indexes $&lt; 2$) and stellar masses between $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot}&lt; 11$. there is a marked decrease in the icd as the stellar mass and/orthe s\'ersic index increases. by studying the relations between the icd andother galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, anddust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellarpopulations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-formingclumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. this phase reaches a peak forgalaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/ m_\odot}&lt; 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. in contrast,galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher s\'{e}rsic index ($n&gt; 2$) show reduced icd values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellarpopulations. this indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulgealong with a star forming disk, typical of hubble sequence galaxies, this ismost common for stellar masses $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot} &lt; 11$ and when thebulge component remains relatively small ($n&lt;2$).

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1512.08791	giant clumps in simulated high-z galaxies: properties, evolution and  dependence on feedback	we study the evolution of giant clumps in high-z disc galaxies using amrcosmological simulations at redshifts z=6-1. our sample consists of 34galaxies, of halo masses 10^{11}-10^{12}m_s at z=2, run with and withoutradiation pressure (rp) feedback from young stars. while rp has little effecton the sizes and global stability of discs, it reduces the amount ofstar-forming gas by a factor of ~2, leading to a decrease in stellar mass by asimilar factor by z~2. both samples undergo violent disc instability (vdi) andform giant clumps of masses 10^7-10^9m_s at a similar rate, though rpsignificantly reduces the number of long-lived clumps. when rp is (not)included, clumps with circular velocity &lt;40(20)km/s, baryonic surface density&lt;200(100)m_s/pc^2 and baryonic mass &lt;10^{8.2}(10^{7.3})m_s are short-lived,disrupted in a few free-fall times. the more massive and dense clumps surviveand migrate toward the disc centre over a few disc orbital times. in the rpsimulations, the distribution of clump masses and star-formation rates (sfrs)normalized to their host disc is very similar at all redshifts. they exhibit atruncated power-law with a slope slightly shallower than -2. short-lived clumpspreferentially have young stellar ages, low masses, high gas fractions andspecific sfrs (ssfr), and they tend to populate the outer disc. the ssfr ofmassive, long-lived clumps declines with age as they migrate towards the disccentre, producing gradients in mass, stellar age, gas fraction, ssfr andmetallicity that distinguish them from short-lived clumps. ex situ mergers makeup ~37% of the mass in clumps and ~29% of the sfr. they are more massive andwith older stellar ages than the in situ clumps, especially near the disc edge.roughly half the galaxies at redshifts z=4-1 are clumpy over a wide range ofstellar mass, with clumps accounting for ~3-30% of the sfr but ~0.1-3% of thestellar mass.

astro-ph;0403658	spatial locality of galaxy correlation function in phase space: samples  from the 2mass extended source catalog	we analyze the statistical properties and dynamical implications of galaxydistributions in phase space for samples selected from the 2mass extendedsource catalog. the galaxy distribution is decomposed into modes $\delta({\bfk, x})$ which describe the number density perturbations of galaxies in phasespace cell given by scale band $\bf k$ to ${\bf k}+\delta {\bf k}$ and spatialrange $\bf x$ to ${\bf x}+\delta {\bf x}$. in the nonlinear regime,$\delta({\bf k, x})$ is highly non-gaussian. we find, however, that thecorrelations between $\delta({\bf k, x})$ and $\delta({\bf k', x'})$ are alwaysvery weak if the spatial ranges (${\bf x}$, ${\bf x}+\delta {\bf x}$) and(${\bf x'}$, ${\bf x'}+\delta {\bf x'}$) don't overlap. this feature is due tothe fact that the spatial locality of the initial perturbations is memorizedduring hierarchical clustering. the highly spatial locality of the 2mass galaxycorrelations is a strong evidence for the initial perturbations of the cosmicmass field being spatially localized, and therefore, consistent with a gaussianinitial perturbations on scales as small as about 0.1 h$^{-1}$ mpc. moreover,the 2mass galaxy spatial locality indicates that the relationship betweendensity perturbations of galaxies and the underlying dark matter should belocalized in phase space. that is, for a structure consisting of perturbationson scales from $k$ to $ k+\delta {k}$, the nonlocal range in the relationbetween galaxies and dark matter should {\it not} be larger than $|{\delta {\bfx}}|=2\pi/|\delta {\bf k}|$. the stochasticity and nonlocality of the biasrelation between galaxies and dark matter fields should be no more than theallowed range given by the uncertainty relation $|{\delta {\bf x}|| \delta{\bfk}}|=2\pi$.
