0904.4463	the acs lcid project. i. short-period variables in the isolated dwarf  spheroidal galaxies cetus &amp; tucana	(abridged) we present the first study of the variable star populations in theisolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsph) cetus and tucana. based on hubblespace telescope images obtained with the advanced camera for surveys in thef475w and f814w bands, we identified 180 and 371 variables in cetus and tucana,respectively. the vast majority are rr lyrae stars. in cetus we also foundthree anomalous cepheids, four candidate binaries and one candidate long-periodvariable (lpv), while six anomalous cepheids and seven lpv candidates werefound in tucana. of the rr lyrae stars, 147 were identified as fundamental mode(rrab) and only eight as first-overtone mode (rrc) in cetus, with mean periodsof 0.614 and 0.363 day, respectively. in tucana we found 216 rrab and 82 rrcgiving mean periods of 0.604 and 0.353 day. these values place both galaxies inthe so-called oosterhoff gap, as is generally the case for dsph. we calculatedthe distance modulus to both galaxies using different approaches based on theproperties of rrab and rrc, namely the luminosity-metallicity andperiod-luminosity-metallicity relations, and found values in excellentagreement with previous estimates using independent methods:(m-m)_{0,cet}=24.46+-0.12 and (m-m)_{0,tuc}=24.74+-0.12, corresponding to780+-40 kpc and 890+-50 kpc. we also found numerous rr lyrae variablespulsating in both modes simultaneously (rrd): 17 in cetus and 60 in tucana.tucana is, after fornax, the second dsph in which such a large fraction of rrd(~17%) has been observed. we provide the photometry and pulsation parametersfor all the variables, and compare the latter with values from the literaturefor well-studied dsph of the local group and galactic globular clusters.

0906.4485	foreword: advanced science letters (asl), special issue on computational  astrophysics	computational astrophysics has undergone unprecedented development over thelast decade, becoming a field of its own. the challenge ahead of us willinvolve increasingly complex multi-scale simulations. these will bridge the gapbetween areas of astrophysics such as star and planet formation, or starformation and galaxy formation, that have evolved separately until today. aglobal knowledge of the physics and modeling techniques of astrophysicalsimulations is thus an important asset for the next generation of modelers.with the aim at fostering such a global approach, we present the special issueon computational astrophysics for the advanced science letters(http://www.aspbs.com/science.htm). the advanced science letters (asl) is a newmulti-disciplinary scientific journal which will cover extensivelycomputational astrophysics and cosmology, and will act as a forum for thepresentation and discussion of novel work attempting to connect differentresearch areas. this special issue collects 9 reviews on 9 key topics of modernastrophysics and cosmology in which simulations have had a pivotalcontribution. from asteroid collisions to the formation of stars, from thephysics and origin of galaxy clusters to large-scale phenomena such as thereionization of the universe, it is a showcase of state-of-the-art numericalwork in a diverse range of topics. the 9 reviews are available on today'slisting of the astro-ph archive (arxiv id numbers are provided in thisforeword).

0906.5084	the stellar structure and kinematics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies formed  by tidal stirring	using high-resolution n-body simulations we study the stellar properties ofdwarf spheroidal galaxies resulting from the tidally induced morphologicaltransformation of disky dwarfs on a cosmologically motivated eccentric orbitaround the milky way. dwarf galaxy models initially consist of an exponentialstellar disk embedded in an extended spherical dark matter halo. depending onthe initial orientation of the disk with respect to the orbital plane,different final configurations are obtained. the least evolved dwarf istriaxial and retains a significant amount of rotation. the more evolved dwarfsare prolate spheroids with little rotation. we show that the final densitydistribution of stars can be approximated by a simple modification of theplummer law. the kinematics of the dwarfs is significantly different dependingon the line of sight which has important implications for mapping the observedstellar velocity dispersions of dwarfs to subhalo circular velocities. when thedwarfs are observed along the long axis, the measured velocity dispersion ishigher and decreases faster with radius. in the case where rotation issignificant, when viewed perpendicular to the long axis, the effect of minoraxis rotation is detected, as expected for triaxial systems. we model thevelocity dispersion profiles and rotation curves of the dwarfs by solving thejeans equations for spherical and axisymmetric systems and adjusting differentsets of free parameters. we find that the mass is typically overestimated whenthe dwarf is seen along the long axis and underestimated when the observationis along the short or intermediate axis. the effect of non-sphericity cannothowever bias the inferred mass by more than 60 percent in either direction,even for the most strongly stripped dwarf which is close to disruption.

0707.0737	the causes of halo shape changes induced by cooling baryons: disks  versus substructures	cold dark matter cosmogony predicts triaxial dark matter halos, whereasobservations find quite round halos. this is most likely due to thecondensation of baryons leading to rounder halos. we examine the halo phasespace distribution basis for such shape changes. triaxial halos are supportedby box orbits, which pass arbitrarily close to the density center. the decreasein triaxiality caused by baryons is thought to be due to the scattering ofthese orbits. we test this hypothesis with simulations of disks grown insidetriaxial halos. after the disks are grown we check whether the phase spacestructure has changed by evaporating the disks and comparing the initial andfinal states. while the halos are substantially rounder when the disk is atfull mass, their final shape after the disk is evaporated is not much differentfrom the initial. likewise, the halo becomes (more) radially anisotropic whenthe disk is grown, but the final anisotropy is consistent with the initial.only if the baryons are unreasonably compact or massive does the halo changeirreversibly. we show that the character of individual orbits is not generallychanged by the growing mass. thus the central condensation of baryons does notdestroy enough box orbits to cause the shape change. rather, box orbits merelybecome rounder along with the global potential. however, if angular momentum istransferred to the halo, either via satellites or via bars, a largeirreversible change in the halo distribution occurs. the ability of satellitesto alter the phase space distribution of the halo is of particular concern togalaxy formation simulations since halo triaxiality can profoundly influencethe evolution of disks.

0908.4022	the orientation and kinematics of inner tidal tails around dwarf  galaxies orbiting the milky way	using high-resolution collisionless n-body simulations we study theproperties of tidal tails formed in the immediate vicinity of a two-componentdwarf galaxy evolving in a static potential of the milky way (mw). the stellarcomponent of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disk and the galaxy isplaced on an eccentric orbit motivated by cdm-based cosmological simulations.we measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars inthe tails. due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf,where the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, theyare typically oriented towards the mw and not along the orbit. we report on aninteresting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentreto the apocentre the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new onespointing towards the mw are formed over a short timescale. we also find a tightlinear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and theirdistance from the dwarf. using mock data sets we demonstrate that if dwarfspheroidal (dsph) galaxies in the vicinity of the mw are tidally affected theirkinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars whichtend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. the effect isstronger for dwarfs on their way from the peri- to the apocentre due to theformation of new tidal tails after pericentre. realistic mass estimates of dsphgalaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples.

0909.4075	environmental mechanisms shaping the nature of dwarf spheroidal  galaxies; the view of computer simulations	we review numerical work carried out over the last decade on the role ofenvironmental mechanisms in shaping the nature of the faintest galaxies known,dwarf spheroidals (dsphs). in particular we discuss a model in which dsphsoriginated from gas dominated, disky dwarfs that were accreted by massivegalaxies several billions of years ago. dwarfs accreting at $z &gt; 1$, when thecosmic ultraviolet ionizing flux was much higher than today and was thus ableto keep the gas in the dwarfs warm and diffuse, were rapidly stripped of theirbaryons via ram pressure and tidal forces, producing very dark matter dominatedobjects with truncated star formation histories, such as the draco dsph. thelow star formation efficiency expected in such low-metallicity objects prior totheir infall was crucial for keeping their disks gas dominated until strippingtook over. {\it therefore gas stripping along with inefficient star formationprovides a new feedback mechanism, alternative to photoevaporation orsupernovae feedback, playing a crucial role in dwarf galaxy formation andevolution}. tidally induced instabilities, termed "tidal stirring", turned thesurviving stellar disk into a spheroid. moreover, we examine the properties ofthe newly discovered ultra-faint dsphs in light of this scenario and argue thatthey likely belong to a different population of lower mass dwarf satellites.these were mostly shaped by reionization rather than by environmentalmechanisms and are thus good candidates for being "reionization fossils". wediscuss implications of the morphological transformation scenario on thesubstructure problem.

0911.2237	at the heart of the matter: the origin of bulgeless dwarf galaxies and  dark matter cores	for almost two decades the properties of "dwarf" galaxies have challenged thecold dark matter (cdm) paradigm of galaxy formation. most observed dwarfgalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive dm halo witha near constant-density core. yet, models based on the cdm scenario invariablyform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar "bulges" and steep central dmprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and dm sink to the center of galaxiesthrough accretion and repeated mergers. processes that decrease the centraldensity of cdm halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theorywith observations of present day dwarfs. this failure is potentiallycatastrophic for the cdm model, possibly requiring a different dm particlecandidate. this letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a lambda$cdmframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallowcentral dm profile, are formed. this is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneousinterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosionswhich remove low angular momentum gas. this inhibits the formation of bulgesand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the centralkiloparsec. realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome ofgalaxy formation in the cdm scenario.

0912.4262	direct formation of supermassive black holes via multi-scale gas inflows  in galaxy mergers	observations of distant bright quasars suggest that billion solar masssupermassive black holes (smbhs) were already in place less than a billionyears after the big bang. models in which light black hole seeds form by thecollapse of primordial metal-free stars cannot explain their rapid appearancedue to inefficient gas accretion. alternatively, these black holes may form bydirect collapse of gas at the center of protogalaxies. however, this requiresmetal-free gas that does not cool efficiently and thus is not turned intostars, in contrast with the rapid metal enrichment of protogalaxies. here weuse a numerical simulation to show that mergers between massive protogalaxiesnaturally produce the required central gas accumulation with no need tosuppress star formation. merger-driven gas inflows produce an unstable, massivenuclear gas disk. within the disk a second gas inflow accumulates more than 100million solar masses of gas in a sub-parsec scale cloud in one hundred thousandyears. the cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, which eventually leads tothe formation of a massive black hole. the black hole can grow to a billionsolar masses in less than a billion years by accreting gas from the surroundingdisk.

1002.3376	the impact of dark matter cusps and cores on the satellite galaxy  population around spiral galaxies	(abridged) we use n-body simulations to study the effects that a divergent(i.e. "cuspy") dark matter (dm) profile introduces on the tidal evolution ofdwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). our models assume cosmologically-motivatedinitial conditions where dsphs are dm-dominated systems on eccentric orbitsabout a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. we find thatthe resilience of dsphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the halocuspiness; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by thehost disc, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant. for a given haloprofile the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides iscontrolled solely by the total amount of mass lost. this information is used toconstruct a semi-analytic code that simulates the hierarchical build-up ofspiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. we find thattidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellites atall galactocentric radii. interestingly, satellites accreted beforere-ionization (z&gt;6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicitypatterns, survive only if haloes are cuspy. we show that the size-mass relationestablished from milky way (mw) dwarfs strongly supports the presence of cuspsin the majority of these systems, as cored models systematically underestimatethe masses of the known ultra-faint dsphs. our models also indicate that amassive m31 disc may explain why many of its dsphs fall below the size-massrelationship derived from mw dsphs. we use our models to constrain the massthreshold below which star formation is suppressed in dm haloes, finding thatluminous satellites must be accreted with masses above 10^8--10^9 m_sol inorder to explain the size-mass relation observed in mw dwarfs.

1003.4744	mass distribution in galaxy clusters: the role of agn feedback	we use 1 kpc resolution cosmological amr simulations of a virgo-like galaxycluster to investigate the effect of feedback from supermassive black holes(smbh) on the mass distribution of dark matter, gas and stars. we comparedthree different models: (i) a standard galaxy formation model featuring gascooling, star formation and supernovae feedback, (ii) a "quenching" model forwhich star formation is artificially suppressed in massive halos and finally(iii) the recently proposed agn feedback model of booth &amp; schaye (2009).without agn feedback (even in the quenching case), our simulated clustersuffers from a strong overcooling problem, with a stellar mass fractionsignificantly above observed values in m87. the baryon distribution is highlyconcentrated, resulting in a strong adiabatic contraction (ac) of dark matter.with agn feedback, on the contrary, the stellar mass in the bright centralgalaxy (bcg) lies below observational estimates and the overcooling problemdisappears. the stellar mass of the bcg is seen to increase with increasingmass resolution, suggesting that our stellar masses converges to the correctvalue from below. the gas and total mass distributions are in strikingagreement with observations. we also find a slight deficit (~10%) of baryons atthe virial radius, due to the effect of agn-driven shock waves pushing gas tompc scales and beyond. this baryon deficit results in a slight adiabaticexpansion of the dark matter distribution, that can be explained quantitativelyby ac theory.

1003.5560	biases in mass estimates of dsph galaxies	using a high resolution n-body simulation of a two-component dwarf galaxyorbiting in the potential of the milky way, we study two effects that lead tosignificant biases in mass estimates of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. both are dueto the strong tidal interaction of initially disky dwarfs with their host. thetidal stripping of dwarf stars leads to the formation of strong tidal tailsthat are typically aligned with the line of sight of an observer positionedclose to the host center. the stars from the tails contaminate the kinematicsamples leading to a velocity dispersion profile increasing with the projectedradius and resulting in an overestimate of mass. the tidal stirring of thedwarf leads to the morphological transformation of the initial stellar diskinto a bar and then a spheroid. the distribution of stars in the dwarf remainsnon-spherical for a long time leading to an overestimate of its mass if it isobserved along the major axis and an underestimate if it seen in theperpendicular direction.

1008.2032	recoiling massive black holes in gas-rich galaxy mergers	the asymmetric emission of gravitational waves produced during thecoalescence of a massive black hole (mbh) binary imparts a velocity "kick" tothe system that can displace the hole from the center of its host. here westudy the trajectories and observability of mbhs recoiling in three (one major,two minor) gas-rich galaxy merger remnants that were previously simulated athigh resolution, and in which the pairing of the mbhs had been shown to besuccessful. we run new simulations of mbhs recoiling in the major mergerremnant with mach numbers in the range 1&lt;m&lt;6, and use simulation data toconstruct a semi-analytical model for the orbital evolution of mbhs in gas-richsystems. we show that: 1) in major merger remnants the energy deposited by themoving hole into the rotationally supported, turbulent medium makes anegligible contribution to the thermodynamics of the gas. this contributionbecomes significant in minor merger remnants, potentially allowing for anelectromagnetic signature of mbh recoil; 2) in major merger remnants, thecombination of both deeper central potential well and drag from high-densitygas confines even mbhs with kick velocities as high as 1200 km/s within 1 kpcfrom the host's center; 3) kinematically offset nuclei may be observable fortimescales of a few myr in major merger remnants in the case of recoilvelocities in the range 700-1,000 km/s; 4) in minor mergers remnants the effectof gas drag is weaker, and mbhs with recoil speeds in the range 300-600 km/swill wander through the host halo for longer timescales. when accounting forthe probability distribution of kick velocities, however, we find that thelikelihood of observing recoiling mbhs in gas-rich galaxy mergers is very low,typically below 10^-5 - 10^-6.

1009.2499	on the efficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism for the origin of  dwarf spheroidals: dependence on the orbital and structural parameters of the  progenitor disky dwarfs	(abridged) the tidal stirring model posits the formation of dsph galaxies viathe tidal interactions between rotationally-supported dwarfs and mw-sized hostgalaxies. using a set of collisionless n-body simulations, we investigate theefficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism. we explore a wide variety of dwarforbital configurations and initial structures and demonstrate that in mostcases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellarcomponents undergo a dramatic morphological and dynamical transformation: fromdisks to bars and finally to pressure-supported spheroidal systems withkinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dsphs in thelocal group (lg). our results suggest that such tidal transformations should becommon occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm andhighlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be thestrength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. we demonstratethat the combination of short orbital times and small pericenters,characteristic of dwarfs being accreted at high redshift, induces the strongesttransformations. our models also indicate that the transformation efficiency isaffected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. lastly,we find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation vmax = \sqrt{3} * sigma,where sigma is the 1d, central stellar velocity dispersion and vmax is themaximum halo circular velocity, with intriguing implications for the missingsatellites problem. overall, we conclude that the action of tidal forces fromthe hosts constitutes a crucial evolutionary mechanism for shaping the natureof dwarf galaxies in environments such as that of the lg. environmentalprocesses of this type should thus be included as ingredients in models ofdwarf galaxy formation and evolution.

1011.2777	the central slope of dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies: simulations  vs. things	we make a direct comparison of the derived dark matter (dm) distributionsbetween hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies assuming a lcdm cosmologyand the observed dwarf galaxies sample from the things survey in terms of (1)the rotation curve shape and (2) the logarithmic inner density slope alpha ofmass density profiles. the simulations, which include the effect of baryonicfeedback processes, such as gas cooling, star formation, cosmic uv backgroundheating and most importantly physically motivated gas outflows driven bysupernovae (sne), form bulgeless galaxies with dm cores. we show that thestellar and baryonic mass is similar to that inferred from photometric andkinematic methods for galaxies of similar circular velocity. analyzing thesimulations in exactly the same way as the observational sample allows us toaddress directly the so-called "cusp/core" problem in the lcdm model. we showthat the rotation curves of the simulated dwarf galaxies rise less steeply thancdm rotation curves and are consistent with those of the things dwarf galaxies.the mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes alpha of the simulatedgalaxies' dark matter density profiles is ~ -0.4 +- 0.1, which shows goodagreement with \alpha = -0.29 +- 0.07 of the things dwarf galaxies. the effectof non-circular motions is not significant enough to affect the results. thisconfirms that the baryonic feedback processes included in the simulations areefficiently able to make the initial cusps with \alpha ~ -1.0 to -1.5 predictedby dark-matter-only simulations shallower, and induce dm halos with a centralmass distribution similar to that observed in nearby dwarf galaxies.

1101.5762	the acs lcid project. v. the star formation history of the dwarf galaxy  \objectname[]{lgs-3}: clues for cosmic reionization and feedback	we present an analysis of the star formation history (sfh) of thetransition-type (dirr/dsph) local group galaxy \objectname[]{lgs-3} (pisces)based on deep photometry obtained with the {\it advanced camera for surveys}onboard the {\it hubble space telescope}. our analysis shows that the sfh of\objectname[]{lgs-3} is dominated by a main episode $\sim 11.7$ gyr ago with aduration of $\sim$ 1.4 gyr which formed $\sim 90%$ of the stars. subsequently,\objectname[]{lgs-3} continued forming stars until the present, although at amuch lower rate. the lack of early chemical enrichment is in contrast to thatobserved in the isolated dsph galaxies of comparable luminosity, implying thatthe dsphs were more massive and subjected to more tidal stripping.  we compare the sfh of \objectname[]{lgs-3} with expectations fromcosmological models. most or all the star formation was produced in\objectname[]{lgs-3} after the reionization epoch, assumed to be completed at$z\sim6$ or $\sim 12.7$ gyr ago. the total mass of the galaxy is estimated tobe between 2 and $4\times 10^8$ m$_\odot$, corresponding to circular velocitiesbetween 28 km\ s$^{-1}$ to 36 km\ s$^{-1}$. these values are close to butsomewhat above the limit of 30 km\ s$^{-1}$ below which the uv background isexpected to prevent any star formation after reionization. feedback from sneassociated with the initial episode of star formation (mechanical luminosityfrom sne $l_w=5.3\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) is probably inadequate tocompletely blow away the gas. however, the combined effects of sn feedback anduv background heating might be expected to completely halt star formation atthe reionization epoch for the low mass of \objectname[]{lgs-3}; this suggeststhat self-shielding is important to the early evolution of galaxies in thismass range.

1103.4909	evolutionary tracks of tidally stirred disky dwarf galaxies	using collisionless n-body simulations, we investigate the tidal evolution oflate-type, rotationally supported dwarfs inside milky way-sized host galaxies.our study focuses on a wide variety of dwarf orbital configurations and initialstructures. during the evolution, the disky dwarfs undergo strong mass loss,the stellar disks are transformed into spheroids, and rotation is replaced byrandom motions of the stars. thus, the late-type progenitors are transformedinto early-type dwarfs as envisioned by the tidal stirring model for theformation of dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies in the local group. we determinethe photometric properties of the dwarfs, including the total visual magnitude,the half-light radius and the central surface brightness as they would bemeasured by an observer near the galactic center. special emphasis is alsoplaced on studying their kinematics and shapes. we demonstrate that themeasured values are biased by a number of observational effects including theincreasing angle of the observation cone near the orbital pericenter, the factthat away from the pericenter the tidal tails are typically oriented along theline of sight, and the fact that for most of the evolution the stellarcomponents of the dwarfs are triaxial ellipsoids whose major axis tumbles withrespect to the line of sight. finally, we compare the measured properties ofthe simulated dwarfs to those of dwarf galaxies in the local group. theevolutionary tracks of the dwarfs in different parameter planes and thecorrelations between their different properties, especially the total magnitudeand the surface brightness, strongly suggest that present-day dsph galaxies mayhave indeed formed from late-type progenitors as proposed by the tidal stirringscenario.

1103.6030	forming realistic late-type spirals in a lcdm universe: the eris  simulation	simulations of the formation of late-type spiral galaxies in a cold darkmatter lcdm universe have traditionally failed to yield realistic candidates.here we report a new cosmological n-body/sph simulation of extreme dynamicrange in which a close analog of a milky way disk galaxy arises naturally.termed eris, the simulation follows the assembly of a galaxy halo of massmvir=7.9x10^11 msun with a total of n=18.6 million particles (gas + dark matter+ stars) within the final virial radius, and a force resolution of 120 pc. itincludes radiative cooling, heating from a cosmic uv field and supernovaexplosions, a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold(nsf=5 atoms cm^-3 rather than the canonical nsf=0.1 atoms cm^-3), and neglectsagn feedback. at the present epoch, the simulated galaxy has an extendedrotationally-supported disk with a radial scale length rd=2.5 kpc, a gentlyfalling rotation curve with circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lenghts ofv2.2=214 km/s, a bulge-to-disk ratio b/d=0.35, and a baryonic mass fractionthat is 30% below the cosmic value. the disk is thin, is forming stars in theregion of the sigma_sfr - sigma_hi plane occupied by spiral galaxies, and fallson the photometric tully-fisher and the stellar mass-halo virial massrelations. hot (t&gt;3x10^5 k), x-ray luminous halo gas makes only 26% of theuniversal baryon fraction and follows a flattened density profile proportionalto r^-1.13 out to r=100 kpc. eris appears then to be the first cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulation in which the galaxy structural properties, the massbudget in the various components, and the scaling relations between mass andluminosity are all consistent with a host of observational constraints.(abridged)

1104.4278	formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies in the cdm universe	we first review the results of the tidal stirring model for thetransformation of gas-rich dwarf irregulars into dwarf spheroidals, which turnsrotationally supported stellar systems into pressure supported ones. weemphasize the importance of the combined effect of ram pressure stripping andheating from the cosmic ultraviolet background in removing the gas andconverting the object into a gas poor system as dsphs. we discuss how thetiming of infall of dwarfs into the primary halo determines the finalmass-to-light ratio and star formation history. secondly we review the resultsof recent cosmological simulations of the formation of gas-rich dwarfs. thesesimulations are finally capable to produce a realistic object with no bulge, anexponential profile and a slowly rising rotation curve. the result owes to theinclusion of an inhomogeneous ism and a star formation scheme based on regionshaving the typical density of molecular cloud complexes. supernovae-drivenwinds become more effective in such mode, driving low angular momentum baryonsoutside the virial radius at high redshift and turning the dark matter cuspinto a core. finally we show the first tidal stirring experiments adoptingdwarfs formed in cosmological simulations as initial conditions. the latter aregas dominated and have have turbulent thick gaseous and stellar disks disksthat cannot develop strong bars, yet they are efficiently heated into spheroidsby tidal shocks.

1108.3606	formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies via mergers of disky dwarfs	we perform collisionless n-body simulations to investigate whether binarymergers between rotationally-supported dwarfs can lead to the formation ofdwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). our simulation campaign is based on a hybridapproach combining cosmological simulations and controlled numericalexperiments. we select merger events from a constrained local universe (clues)simulation of the local group (lg) and record the properties of the interactingdwarf-sized halos. this information is subsequently used to seed controlledexperiments of binary encounters between dwarf galaxies consisting ofexponential stellar disks embedded in cosmologically-motivated dark matterhalos. these simulations are designed to reproduce eight cosmological mergerevents, with initial masses of the interacting systems in the range ~ (5-60) x10^7 mo, occurring quite early in the history of the lg, more than 10 gyr ago.we compute the properties of the merger remnants as a distant observer wouldand demonstrate that at least three of the simulated encounters produce systemswith kinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dsphs inthe lg. tracing the history of the remnants in the cosmological simulation toz=0, we find that two dsph-like objects remain isolated at distances largerthan 800 kpc from either the milky way or m31. these systems constituteplausible counterparts of the remote dsphs cetus and tucana which reside in thelg outskirts, far from the tidal influence of the primary galaxies. we concludethat merging of rotationally-supported dwarfs represents a viable mechanism forthe formation of dsphs in the lg and similar environments.

1111.0223	observability of dual active galactic nuclei in merging galaxies	supermassive black holes (smbhs) have been detected in the centers of mostnearby massive galaxies. galaxies today are the products of billions of yearsof galaxy mergers, but also billions of years of smbh activity as activegalactic nuclei (agns) that is connected to galaxy mergers. in this context,detection of agn pairs should be relatively common. observationally, however,dual agn are scant, being just a few percent of all agn. in this letter weinvestigate the triggering of agn activity in merging galaxies via a suite ofhigh resolution hydrodynamical simulations. we follow the dynamics andaccretion onto the smbhs as they move from separations of tens of kiloparsecsto tens of parsecs. our resolution, cooling and star formation implementationproduce an inhomogeneous, multi-phase interstellar medium, allowing us toaccurately trace star formation and accretion onto the smbhs. we study theimpact of gas content, morphology, and mass ratio, allowing us to study agnactivity and dynamics across a wide range of relevant conditions. we test whenthe two agn are simultaneously detectable, for how long and at whichseparations. we find that strong dual agn activity occurs during the latephases of the mergers, at small separations (&lt;1-10 kpc) below the resolutionlimit of most surveys. much of the smbh accretion is not simultaneous, limitingthe dual agn fraction detectable through imaging and spectroscopy to a fewpercent, in agreement with observational samples.

1112.5336	the shapes of milky way satellites: looking for signatures of tidal  stirring	we study the shapes of milky way satellites in the context of the tidalstirring scenario for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the standardprocedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data andthus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which areusually subtle in low surface brightness systems. taking advantage of the factthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introducediscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and thefourier bar mode. we apply these measures of shape first to a variety ofsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in darkmatter halos and orbiting the milky way. in addition to strong mass loss andrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformationthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the firstpericenter passage. these tidally induced bars persist for a few gyr beforebeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strongenough. we test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape ofnearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the milky way. we detect inner bars inursa minor, sagittarius, lmc and possibly carina. in addition, six out ofeleven studied dwarfs show elongated stellar distributions in the outer partsthat may signify transition to tidal tails. we thus find the shapes of milkyway satellites to be consistent with the predictions of the tidal stirringmodel.

1201.5784	how to make an ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy: tidal stirring of  disky dwarfs with shallow dark matter density profiles	in recent years the sloan digital sky survey has unraveled a new populationof ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (ufds) in the vicinity of the milky way (mw)whose origin remains a puzzle. using a suite of collisionless n-bodysimulations, we investigate the formation of ufds in the context of the tidalstirring model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the localgroup (lg). our simulations are designed to reproduce the tidal interactionsbetween mw-sized host galaxies and rotationally supported dwarfs embedded in10^9 m_sun dark matter (dm) halos. we explore a variety of inner density slopes\rho \propto r^{-\alpha} for the dwarf dm halos, ranging from core-like (\alpha= 0.2) to cuspy (\alpha = 1), and different dwarf orbital configurations. ourexperiments demonstrate that ufds can be produced via tidal stirring of diskydwarfs on relatively tight orbits, consistent with a redshift of accretion bythe host galaxy of z \sim 1, and with intermediate values for the halo innerdensity slopes (\rho \propto r^{-0.6}). the inferred slopes are in excellentagreement with those resulting from both the modeling of the rotation curves ofdwarf galaxies and recent cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxy formation.comparing the properties of observed ufds with those of their simulatedcounterparts, we find remarkable similarities in terms of basic observationalparameters. we conclude that tidal stirring of rotationally supported dwarfsrepresents a viable mechanism for the formation of ufds in the lg environment.

1201.6605	the fate of high redshift massive compact galaxies in dense environments	massive compact galaxies seem to be more common at high redshift than in thelocal universe, especially in denser environments. to investigate the fate ofsuch massive galaxies identified at z~2 we analyse the evolution of theirproperties in three cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that formvirialised galaxy groups of mass ~10^13 msun hosting a central massiveelliptical/s0 galaxy by redshift zero. we find that at redshift ~2 thepopulation of galaxies with m_*&gt; 2 10^10 msun is diverse in terms of mass,velocity dispersion, star formation and effective radius, containing both verycompact and relatively extended objects. in each simulation all the compactsatellite galaxies have merged into the central galaxy by redshift 0 (with theexception of one simulation where one of such satellite galaxy survives).satellites of similar mass at z = 0 are all less compact than their highredshift counterparts. they form later than the galaxies in the z = 2 sampleand enter the group potential at z &lt; 1, when dynamical friction times arelonger than the hubble time. also, by z = 0 the central galaxies have increasedsubstantially their characteristic radius via a combination of in situ starformation and mergers. hence in a group environment descendants of compactgalaxies either evolve towards larger sizes or they disappear before thepresent time as a result of the environment in which they evolve. since thegroup-sized halos that we consider are representative of dense environments inthe lambdacdm cosmology, we conclude that the majority of high redshift compactmassive galaxies do not survive until today as a result of the environment.

1203.1623	formation and hardening of supermassive black hole binaries in minor  mergers of disk galaxies	we model for the first time the complete orbital evolution of a pair ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) in a 1:10 galaxy merger of two disk dominatedgas-rich galaxies, from the stage prior to the formation of the binary up tothe onset of gravitational wave emission when the binary separation has shrunkto 1 milli parsec. the high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)simulations used for the first phase of the evolution include star formation,accretion onto the smbhs as well as feedback from supernovae explosions andradiative heating from the smbhs themselves. using the direct n-body code\phi-gpu we evolve the system further without including the effect of gas,which has been mostly consumed by star formation in the meantime. we start atthe time when the separation between two smbhs is ~ 700 pc and the two blackholes are still embedded in their galaxy cusps. we use 3 million particles tostudy the formation and evolution of the smbh binary till it becomes hard.after a hard binary is formed, we reduce (reselect) the particles to 1.15million and follow the subsequent shrinking of the smbh binary due to 3-bodyencounters with the stars. we find approximately constant hardening rates andthat the smbh binary rapidly develops a high eccentricity. similar hardeningrates and eccentricity values are reported in earlier studies of smbh binaryevolution in the merging of dissipation-less spherical galaxy models. theestimated coalescence time is ~ 2.9 gyr, significantly smaller than a hubbletime. we discuss why this timescale should be regarded as an upper limit. since1:10 mergers are among the most common interaction events for galaxies at allcosmic epochs, we argue that several smbh binaries should be detected withcurrently planned space-borne gravitational wave interferometers, whosesensitivity will be especially high for smbhs in the mass range consideredhere.

1205.0270	the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies at z~3: a test for stellar  feedback, galactic outflows, and cold streams	we present new results on the kinematics, thermal and ionization state, andspatial distribution of metal-enriched gas in the circumgalactic medium (cgm)of massive galaxies at redshift 3, using the "eris" suite of cosmological"zoom-in" simulations. the reference run adopts a blastwave scheme forsupernova feedback that produces galactic outflows, a star formation recipebased on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, and amodel for the diffusion of metals and thermal energy. synthetic spectra throughthe multiphase cgm produce interstellar absorption line strengths of lya, cii,civ, siii, and siiv as a function of galactocentric impact parameter (scaled tothe virial radius) that are in broad agreement with those observed athigh-redshift by steidel et al. (2010). only about one third of all the gaswithin r_vir is outflowing. the fraction of sightlines within one virial radiusthat intercept optically thick material is 27%, in agreement with recentobservations by rudie et al. (2012). such optically thick absorption is shownto trace inflowing "cold" streams that penetrate deep inside the virial radius.the streams, enriched to metallicities above 0.01 solar, give origin to strong(log n &gt; 13) cii absorption with a covering factor of 22% within r_vir and 10%within 2 r_vir. galactic outflows do not cause any substantial suppression ofthe cold accretion mode. the central galaxy is surrounded by a large ovi halo,with a typical column density log n&gt;14 and a near unity covering factormaintained all the way out to 150 kpc. this matches the trends recentlyobserved in star-forming galaxies at low redshift by tumlinson et al. (2011).our zoom-in simulations of this single system appear to reproducequantitatively the complex baryonic processes that determine the exchange ofmatter, energy, and metals between galaxies and their surroundings.

1208.4844	an off-center density peak in the milky way's dark matter halo?	we show that the position of the central dark matter density peak may beexpected to differ from the dynamical center of the galaxy by several hundredparsec. in eris, a high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulation of arealistic milky-way-analog disk galaxy, this offset is 300 - 400 pc (~3gravitational softening lengths) after z=1. in its dissipationlessdark-matter-only twin simulation erisdark, as well as in the via lactea ii andghalo simulations, the offset remains below one softening length for most ofits evolution. the growth of the dm offset coincides with a flattening of thecentral dm density profile in eris inwards of ~1 kpc, and the direction fromthe dynamical center to the point of maximum dm density is correlated with theorientation of the stellar bar, suggesting a bar-halo interaction as a possibleexplanation. a dark matter density offset of several hundred parsec greatlyaffects expectations of the dark matter annihilation signals from the galacticcenter. it may also support a dark matter annihilation interpretation of recentreports by weniger (2012) and su &amp; finkbeiner (2012) of highly significant 130gev gamma-ray line emission from a region 1.5 degrees (~200 parsec projected)away from sgr a* in the galactic plane.

1211.1713	pseudobulge formation as a dynamical rather than a secular process	we investigate the formation and evolution of the pseudobulge in "eris", ahigh-resolution n-body + smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) cosmologicalsimulation that successfully reproduces a milky way-like massive late-typespiral in a cold dark matter (lcdm) universe. at the present epoch, eris has avirial mass mvir=8x10^11 msun, a photometric stellar mass m*=3.2x10^10 msun, abulge-to-total ratio b/t = 0.26, and a weak nuclear bar. we find that the bulkof the pseudobulge forms quickly at high redshift via a combination ofnon-axisymmetric disk instabilities and tidal interactions or mergers bothoccurring on dynamical timescales, not through slow secular processes at lowerredshift. its subsequent evolution is not strictly secular either, and isclosely intertwined with the evolution of the stellar bar. in fact, thestructure that we recognize as a pseudobulge today evolves from a stellar barthat formed at high redshift, was destroyed by minor mergers at z~3, reformedshortly after, and weakened again following a steady gas inflow at z&lt;1. thegradual dissolution of the bar ensues at z=1 and continues until the presentwithout increasing the stellar velocity dispersion in the inner regions. inthis scenario the pseudobulge is not a separate component from the inner diskin terms of formation path, rather it is the first step in the inside-outformation of the baryonic disk, in agreement with the fact that pseudobulges ofmassive spiral galaxies have typically a dominant old stellar population. ifour simulations do indeed reproduce the formation mechanisms of massivespirals, then the progenitors of late-type galaxies should have strong bars andsmall photometric pseudobulges at high redshift.

1212.3438	can we measure the slopes of density profiles in dwarf spheroidal  galaxies?	using collisionless n-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the milkyway (mw) we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies ofthe local group. the dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded indark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on aneccentric orbit typical for mw subhaloes. after a few gyr of evolution thestellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidalforces. observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of thestellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-lightradii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. using the estimator proposed bywolf et al. we calculate masses within half-light radii. the masses obtainedthis way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line ofsight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. we thendivide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population andtrace their evolution in time. the two populations, although affected by tidalforces, retain different density profiles even after a few gyr. we measure thehalf-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populationsalong different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the massdistribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by walker &amp;penarrubia. the inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated,depending on the line of sight. in particular, when the dwarf is seen along thelongest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower densityprofile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. since mostdsphs are non-spherical and their orientation with respect to our line of sightis unknown, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfswhen these systematic errors are expected to be diminished.

1301.0620	inside out and upside down: tracing the assembly of a simulated disk  galaxy using mono-age stellar populations	we analyze the present-day structure and assembly history of a highresolution hydrodynamic simulation of the formation of a milky way (mw)-likedisk galaxy, from the "eris" simulation suite, dissecting it into cohorts ofstars formed at different epochs of cosmic history. at z=0, stars with t_form &lt;2 gyr mainly occupy the stellar spheroid, with the oldest (earliest forming)stars having more centrally concentrated profiles. the younger age cohortspopulate disks of progressively longer radial scale length and shorter verticalscale height. at a given radius, the vertical density profiles and velocitydispersions of stars vary smoothly as a function of age, and the superpositionof old, vertically-extended and young, vertically-compact cohorts gives rise toa double-exponential profile like that observed in the mw. turning to formationhistory, we find that the trends of spatial structure and kinematics withstellar age are largely imprinted at birth, or immediately thereafter. starsthat form during the active merger phase at z&gt;3 are quickly scattered intorounded, kinematically hot configurations. the oldest disk cohorts form instructures that are radially compact and relatively thick, while subsequentcohorts form in progressively larger, thinner, colder configurations from gaswith increasing levels of rotational support. the disk thus forms "inside-out"in a radial sense and "upside-down" in a vertical sense. secular heating andradial migration influence the final state of each age cohort, but the changesthey produce are small compared to the trends established at formation. thepredicted correlations of stellar age with spatial and kinematic structure arein good qualitative agreement with the correlations observed for mono-abundancestellar populations in the mw.

1302.0008	tidal stirring of disky dwarfs with shallow dark matter density  profiles: enhanced transformation into dwarf spheroidals	(abridged) the origin of dsphs in the local group (lg) remains an enigma. thetidal stirring model posits that late-type, rotationally-supported dwarfsresembling present-day dwarf irregular (dirr) galaxies can transform into dsphsvia interactions with milky way-sized hosts. using collisionless n-bodysimulations, we investigate for the first time how tidal stirring depends onthe dark matter (dm) density distribution in the central stellar region of theprogenitor disky dwarf. specifically, we explore various asymptotic innerslopes gamma of the dwarf dm density profiles (rho \propto r^{-gamma} as r -&gt;0). for a given orbit inside the primary, rotationally-supported dwarfsembedded in dm halos with core-like density distributions (gamma = 0.2) andmild density cusps (gamma = 0.6) demonstrate a substantially enhancedlikelihood and efficiency of transformation into dsphs compared to theircounterparts with steeper dm density profiles (gamma = 1). such shallow dmdistributions are akin to those of observed dirrs, highlighting tidal stirringas a plausible model for the lg morphology-density relation. when gamma &lt;1, asingle pericentric passage can induce dsph formation and disky dwarfs onlow-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are able to transform into dsphs;these new results allow the tidal stirring model to explain the existence ofvirtually all known dsphs across a wide range of distances from their hosts. asubset of rotationally-supported dwarfs with gamma &lt;1 are eventually disruptedby the primary; those that survive as dsphs are generally on orbits that arebiased towards lower eccentricities and/or larger pericenters relative to thoseof typical cdm satellites. the latter could explain the rather peculiar orbitsof several classic lg dsphs such as fornax, leo i, tucana, and cetus.

1307.0822	massive black hole pairs in clumpy, self-gravitating circumnuclear  disks: stochastic orbital decay	we study the dynamics of massive black hole pairs in clumpy gaseouscircumnuclear disks. we track the orbital decay of the light, secondary blackhole $m_{\bullet2}$ orbiting around the more massive primary at the center ofthe disk, using $n$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations. we findthat the gravitational interaction of $m_{\bullet2}$ with massive clumps$m_{\rm cl}$ erratically perturbs the otherwise smooth orbital decay. in closeencounters with massive clumps, gravitational slingshots can kick the secondaryblack hole out of the disk plane. the black hole moving on an inclined orbitthen experiences the weaker dynamical friction of the stellar background,resulting in a longer orbital decay timescale. interactions between clumps canalso favor orbital decay when the black hole is captured by a massive clumpwhich is segregating toward the center of the disk. the stochastic behavior ofthe black hole orbit emerges mainly when the ratio $m_{\bullet2}/m_{\rm cl}$falls below unity, with decay timescales ranging from $\sim1$ to $\sim50$ myr.this suggests that describing the cold clumpy phase of the inter-stellar mediumin self-consistent simulations of galaxy mergers, albeit so far neglected, isimportant to predict the black hole dynamics in galaxy merger remnants.

0801.3845	the formation of disk galaxies in computer simulations	the formation of disk galaxies is one of the most outstanding problems inmodern astrophysics and cosmology. we review the progress made by numericalsimulations carried out on large parallel supercomputers. recent progress stemsfrom a combination of increased resolution and improved treatment of theastrophysical processes modeled in the simulations, such as thephenomenological description of the interstellar medium and of the process ofstar formation. high mass and spatial resolution is a necessary condition inorder to obtain large disks comparable with observed spiral galaxies avoidingspurious dissipation of angular momentum. a realistic model of the starformation history. gas-to-stars ratio and the morphology of the stellar andgaseous component is instead controlled by the phenomenological description ofthe non-gravitational energy budget in the galaxy. we show that simulations ofgas collapse within cold dark matter halos including a phenomenologicaldescription of supernovae blast-waves allow to obtain stellar disks with nearlyexponential surface density profiles as those observed in real disk galaxies,counteracting the tendency of gas collapsing in such halos to form cuspybaryonic profiles. however, the ab-initio formation of a realistic rotationallysupported disk galaxy with a pure exponential disk in a fully cosmologicalsimulation is still an open problem. we argue that the suppression of bulgeformation is related to the physics of galaxy formation during the merger ofthe most massive protogalactic lumps at high redshift, where the reionizationof the universe likely plays a key role. a sufficiently high resolution duringthis early phase of galaxy formation is also crucial to avoid artificialangular momentum loss (abridged).

1310.1108	early evolution of clumps formed via gravitational instability in  protoplanetary disks; precursors of hot jupiters?	although it is fairly established that gravitational instability (gi) shouldoccur in the early phases of the evolution of a protoplanetary disk, the fateof the clumps resulting from disk fragmentation and their role in planetformation is still unclear. in the present study we investigatesemi-analytically their evolution following the contraction of a syntheticpopulation of clumps with varied initial structure and orbits coupled with thesurrounding disk and the central star. our model is based on recently publishedstate-of-the-art 3d collapse simulations of clumps with varied thermodynamics.various evolutionary mechanisms are taken into account, and their effect isexplored both individually and in combination with others: migration and tidaldisruption, mass accretion, gap opening and disk viscosity. it is found that,in general, at least 50% of the initial clumps survive tides, leaving behindpotential gas giant progenitors after ~10^5 yr of evolution in the disk. therest might be either disrupted or produce super-earths and other low massplanets provided that a solid core can be assembled on a sufficiently shorttimescale, a possibility that we do not address in this paper. extrapolating tomillion year timescales, all our surviving protoplanets would lead to close-ingas giants. this outcome might in part reflect the limitations of the migrationmodel adopted, and is reminiscent of the analogous result found incore-accretion models in absence of fine-tuning of the migration rate. yet itsuggests that a significant fraction of the clumps formed by gravitationalinstability could be the precursors of hot jupiters.

1404.3212	the argo simulation: i. quenching of massive galaxies at high redshift  as a result of cosmological starvation	observations show a prevalence of high redshift galaxies with large stellarmasses and predominantly passive stellar populations. a variety of processeshave been suggested that could reduce the star formation in such galaxies toobserved levels, including quasar mode feedback, virial shock heating, orgalactic winds driven by stellar feedback. however, the main quenchingmechanisms have yet to be identified. here we study the origin of starformation quenching using argo, a cosmological, hydrodynamical zoom-insimulation that follows the evolution of a massive galaxy at $z\geq{}2$. thissimulation adopts the same sub-grid recipes of the eris simulations, which havebeen shown to form realistic disk galaxies, and, in one version, adopts also amass and spatial resolution identical to eris. the resulting galaxy hasproperties consistent with those of observed, massive (m_* ~ 1e11 m_sun)galaxies at z~2 and with abundance matching predictions. our models do notinclude agn feedback indicating that supermassive black holes likely play asubordinate role in determining masses and sizes of massive galaxies at high z.the specific star formation rate (ssfr) of the simulated galaxy matches theobserved m_* - ssfr relation at early times. this period of smooth stellar massgrowth comes to a sudden halt at z=3.5 when the ssfr drops by almost an orderof magnitude within a few hundred myr. the suppression is initiated by aleveling off and a subsequent reduction of the cool gas accretion rate onto thegalaxy, and not by feedback processes. this "cosmological starvation" occurs asthe parent dark matter halo switches from a fast collapsing mode to a slowaccretion mode. additional mechanisms, such as perhaps radio mode feedback froman agn, are needed to quench any residual star formation of the galaxy and tomaintain a low ssfr until the present time.

1405.4870	comparing m31 and milky way satellites: the extended star formation  histories of andromeda ii and andromeda xvi	we present the first comparison between the lifetime star formation histories(sfhs) of m31 and milky way (mw) satellites. using the advanced camera forsurveys aboard the hubble space telescope, we obtained deep optical imaging ofandromeda ii (m$_{v} = -$12.0; log(m$_{\star}$/m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 6.7) andandromeda xvi (m$_{v} = -$7.5; log(m$_{\star}$/m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 4.9)yielding color-magnitude diagrams that extend at least 1 magnitude below theoldest main sequence turnoff, and are similar in quality to those available forthe mw companions. and ii and and xvi show strikingly similar sfhs: both formed50-70% of their total stellar mass between 12.5 and 5 gyr ago (z$\sim$5-0.5)and both were abruptly quenched $\sim$ 5 gyr ago (z$\sim$0.5). the predominanceof intermediate age populations in and xvi makes it qualitatively differentfrom faint companions of the mw and clearly not a pre-reionization fossil.neither and ii nor and xvi appears to have a clear analog among mw companions,and the degree of similarity in the sfhs of and ii and and xvi is not seenamong comparably faint-luminous pairs of mw satellites. these findings providehints that satellite galaxy evolution may vary substantially among hosts ofsimilar stellar mass. although comparably deep observations of more m31satellites are needed to further explore this hypothesis, our results underlinethe need for caution when interpreting satellite galaxies of an individualsystem in a broader cosmological context.

0803.2464	tidal evolution of disky dwarf galaxies in the milky way potential: the  formation of dwarf spheroidals	we conduct high-resolution collisionless n-body simulations to investigatethe tidal evolution of dwarf galaxies on an eccentric orbit in the milky way(mw) potential. the dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightnessstellar disk embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. during 10gyr of dynamical evolution and after 5 pericentre passages the dwarfs suffersubstantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a majormorphological transformation from a disk to a bar and finally to a spheroid.the bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum istransferred outside the galaxy. a dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy is formed viagradual shortening of the bar. this work thus provides a comprehensivequantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformationmechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. wecompare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disk and findthat the evolution is fastest when the disk is coplanar with the orbit. despitethe strong tidal perturbations and mass loss the dwarfs remain dark matterdominated. for most of the time the 1d stellar velocity dispersion, \sigma,follows the maximum circular velocity, v_{\rm max}, and they are both goodtracers of the bound mass. specifically, we find that m_{\rm bound} \proptov_{\rm max}^{3.5} and v_{\rm max} \sim \sqrt{3} \sigma in agreement withearlier studies based on pure dark matter simulations. the latter relation isbased on directly measuring the stellar kinematics of the simulated dwarf andmay thus be reliably used to map the observed stellar velocity dispersions ofdsphs to halo circular velocities when addressing the missing satellitesproblem.

1409.0004	growth and activity of black holes in galaxy mergers with varying mass  ratios	we study supermassive black holes (bhs) in merging galaxies, using a suite ofhydrodynamical simulations with very high spatial (~10 pc) and temporal (~1myr) resolution, where we vary the initial mass ratio, the orbitalconfiguration, and the gas fraction. (i) we address the question of when andwhy, during a merger, increased bh accretion occurs, quantifying gas inflowsand bh accretion rates. (ii) we also quantify the relative effectiveness ininducing agn activity of merger-related versus secular-related causes, bystudying different stages of the encounter: the stochastic (or early) stage,the (proper) merger stage, and the remnant (or late) stage. (iii) we assesswhich galaxy mergers preferentially enhance bh accretion, finding that theinitial mass ratio is the most important factor. (iv) we study the evolution ofthe bh masses, finding that the bh mass contrast tends to decrease in minormergers and to increase in major mergers. this effect hints at the existence ofa preferential range of mass ratios for bhs in the final pairing stages. (v) inboth merging and dynamically quiescent galaxies, the gas accreted by the bh isnot necessarily the gas with $low$ angular momentum, but the gas that $loses$angular momentum.

0804.0204	the anatomy of leo i: how tidal tails affect the kinematics	we model the recently published kinematic data set for leo i dsph galaxy byfitting the solutions of the jeans equations to the velocity dispersion andkurtosis profiles measured from the data. we demonstrate that when the sampleis cleaned of interlopers the data are consistent with the assumption that massfollows light and isotropic stellar orbits with no need for an extended darkmatter halo. our interloper removal scheme does not clean the data ofcontamination completely, as demonstrated by the rotation curve of leo i. whenmoving away from the centre of the dwarf, the rotation appears to be reversed.we interpret this behaviour using the results of an n-body simulation of adwarf galaxy possessing some intrinsic rotation, orbiting in the milky waypotential and show that it can be reproduced if the galaxy is viewed almostalong the tidal tails so that the leading (background) tail contaminates thewestern part of leo i while the trailing (foreground) tail the eastern one. weshow that this configuration leads to a symmetric and gaussian distribution ofline-of-sight velocities. the simulation is also applied to test our modellingmethod on mock data sets. we demonstrate that when the data are cleaned ofinterlopers and the fourth velocity moment is used the true parameters of thedwarf are typically within 1 \sigma errors of the best-fitting parameters.restricting the fitting to the inner part of leo i our best estimate for theanisotropy is \beta = -0.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4} and the total mass m = (4.5 +/- 0.7) x10^7 m_sun. the mass-to-light ratio including the errors in mass, brightnessand distance is m/l_v = 8.2 +/- 4.5 solar units.

1410.6818	the argo simulation: ii. the early build-up of the hubble sequence	the hubble sequence is a common classification scheme for the structure ofgalaxies. despite the tremendous usefulness of this diagnostic, we still do notfully understand when, where, and how this morphological ordering was put inplace. here, we investigate the morphological evolution of a sample of 22 highredshift ($z\geq3$) galaxies extracted from the argo simulation. argo is acosmological zoom-in simulation of a group-sized halo and its environment. itadopts the same high resolution ($\sim10^4$ m$_\odot$, $\sim100$ pc) andsub-grid physical model that was used in the eris simulation but probes asub-volume almost ten times bigger with as many as 45 million gas and starparticles in the zoom-in region. argo follows the early assembly of galaxieswith a broad range of stellar masses ($\log m_{\star}/{\rm m}_{\odot}\sim8-11$at $z\simeq3$), while resolving properly their structural properties. werecover a diversity of morphologies, including late-type/irregular discgalaxies with flat rotation curves, spheroid dominated early-type discs, and amassive elliptical galaxy, already established at $z\sim3$. we identify majormergers as the main trigger for the formation of bulges and the steepening ofthe circular velocity curves. minor mergers and non-axisymmetric perturbations(stellar bars) drive the bulge growth in some cases. the specific angularmomenta of the simulated disc components fairly match the values inferred fromnearby galaxies of similar $m_{\star}$ once the expected redshift evolution ofdisc sizes is accounted for. we conclude that morphological transformations ofhigh redshift galaxies of intermediate mass are likely triggered by processessimilar to those at low redshift and result in an early build-up of the hubblesequence.

1411.5683	direct formation of supermassive black holes in metal-enriched gas at  the heart of high-redshift galaxy mergers	we present novel 3d multi-scale sph simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergersbetween the most massive galaxies at $z \sim 8 - 10$, designed to scrutinizethe direct collapse formation scenario for massive black hole seeds proposed in\citet{mayer+10}. the simulations achieve a resolution of 0.1 pc, and includeboth metallicity-dependent optically-thin cooling and a model for thermalbalance at high optical depth. we consider different formulations of the sphhydrodynamical equations, including thermal and metal diffusion. when the twomerging galaxy cores collide, gas infall produces a compact, optically thicknuclear disk with densities exceeding $10^{-10}$ g cm$^3$. the disk rapidlyaccretes higher angular momentum gas from its surroundings reaching $\sim 5$ pcand a mass of $\gtrsim 10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ in only a few $10^4$ yr. outside$\gtrsim 2$ pc it fragments into massive clumps. instead, supersonic turbulenceprevents fragmentation in the inner parsec region, which remains warm ($\sim3000-6000$ k) and develops strong non-axisymmetric modes that cause prominentradial gas inflows ($&gt; 10^4$ $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), forming an ultra-densemassive disky core. angular momentum transport by non-axisymmetric modes shouldcontinue below our spatial resolution limit, quickly turning the disky coreinto a supermassive protostar which can collapse directly into a massive blackhole of mass $10^8-10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ via the relativistic radial instability.such a "cold direct collapse"' explains naturally the early emergence of high-zqsos. its telltale signature would be a burst of gravitational waves in thefrequency range $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ hz, possibly detectable by the plannedelisa interferometer.

1412.3319	a lower fragmentation mass scale in high redshift galaxies and its  implications on giant clumps: a systematic numerical study	we study the effect of sub-grid physics, galaxy mass, structural parametersand resolution on the fragmentation of gas-rich galaxy discs into massive starforming clumps. the initial conditions are set up with the aid of the argocosmological hydrodynamical simulation. blast-wave feedback does not suppressfragmentation, but reduces both the number of clumps and the duration of theunstable phase. once formed, bound clumps cannot be destroyed by our feedbackmodel. widespread fragmentation is promoted by high gas fractions and low haloconcentrations. yet giant clumps $m &gt; 10^8 m_{\odot}$ lasting several hundredmyr are rare and mainly produced by clump-clump mergers. they occur in massivediscs with maximum rotational velocities $v_{max} &gt; 250$ km/s at $z \sim 2$, atthe high mass end of the observed galaxy population at those redshifts. thetypical gaseous and stellar masses of clumps in all runs are in the range $\sim10^7-10^8 m_{\odot}$ for galaxies with disc mass in the range $10^{10}-8\times10^{10} m_{\odot}$. clumps sizes are usually in the range $100-400$ pc, inagreement with recent clump observations in lensed high-z galaxies. \\ we arguethat many of the giant clumps identified in observations are not due to in-situfragmetation, or are the result of blending of smaller structures owing toinsufficient resolution. using an analytical model describing local collapseinside spiral arms, we can predict the characteristic gaseous masses of clumpsat the onset of fragmentation ($\sim 3-5 \times 10^7 m_{\odot}$) quiteaccurately, while the conventional toomre mass overestimates them. due to theirmoderate masses, clumps which migrate to the centre have marginal effect onbulge growth.

1502.06597	on the gap-opening criterion of migrating planets in protoplanetary  disks	we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to quantitativelyexplore the torque balance criterion for gap-opening (as formulated by crida etal. 2006) in a variety of disks when considering a migrating planet. we findthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planetsstill do not open gaps. we stress that gap-opening is not only dependent onwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do soquickly enough. this can be expressed as an additional condition on thegap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes theplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. while this point has beenbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range ofprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucialit is for gap-opening. this additional condition has important implications forthe survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well asgiant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massivedisks. it is particularly important for planets with intermediate massessusceptible to type iii-like migration. for some observed transition disks ordisks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses basedon the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient. withconsideration of this additional timescale criterion theoretical studies mayfind a reduced planet survivability or that planets may migrate further inwardsbefore opening a gap.

1506.02140	the evolution of dwarf galaxy satellites with different dark matter  density profiles in the erismod simulations. i. the early infalls	we present the first simulations of tidal stirring of dwarf galaxies in thelocal group carried out in a cosmological context. we use the erisdarksimulation of a mw-sized galaxy to identify some of the most massive subhalos($m_{vir} &gt; 10^8 m_{\odot}$) that fall into the main host before $z=2$.subhalos are replaced before infall with high-resolution models of dwarfgalaxies comprising a faint stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo. theset of models contains cuspy halos as well as halos with "cored" profiles (withasymptotic inner slope $\gamma = 0.6$). the simulations are then run to $z=0$with as many as 54 million particles and resolution as small as $\sim 4$ pcusing the n-body code changa. the stellar components of all satellites aresignificantly affected by tidal stirring, losing stellar mass and undergoing amorphological transformation towards a pressure supported spheroidal system.however, while some remnants with cuspy halos maintain significant rotationalflattening and disk-like features, all the shallow halo models achieve$v/\sigma &lt; 0.5$ and round shapes typical of dsph satellites of the mw and m31.mass loss is also enhanced in the latter, and remnants can reach luminositiesand velocity dispersions as low as those of ultra faint dwarfs (ufds). we arguethat cuspy progenitors must be the exception rather than the rule amongsatellites of the mw since all the mw and m31 satellites in the luminosityrange of our remnants are dsphs, a result matched only in the simulation with"cored" models.

1508.07328	black hole starvation and bulge evolution in a milky way-like galaxy	we present a new zoom-in hydrodynamical simulation, "erisbh", which followsthe cosmological evolution and feedback effects of a supermassive black hole atthe center of a milky way-type galaxy. erisbh shares the same initialconditions, resolution, recipes of gas cooling, star formation and feedback, asthe close milky way-analog "eris", but it also includes prescriptions for theformation, growth and feedback of supermassive black holes. we find that thegalaxy's central black hole grows mainly through mergers with other black holescoming from infalling satellite galaxies. the growth by gas accretion isminimal because very little gas reaches the sub-kiloparsec scales. the finalblack hole is, at z=0, about 2.6 million solar masses and it sits closely tothe position of sgra* on the mbh-mbulge and mbh-sigma planes, in a locationconsistent with what observed for pseudobulges. given the limited growth due togas accretion, we argue that the mass of the central black hole should be above10^5 solar masses already at z~8. the effect of agn feedback on the host galaxyis limited to the very central few hundreds of parsecs. despite being weak, agnfeedback seems to be responsible for the limited growth of the central bulgewith respect to the original eris, which results in a significantly flatterrotation curve in the inner few kiloparsecs. moreover, the disk of erisbh ismore prone to instabilities, as its bulge is smaller and its disk larger theneris. as a result, the disk of erisbh undergoes a stronger dynamical evolutionrelative to eris and around z=0.3 a weak bar grows into a strong bar of a fewdisk scale lengths in size. the bar triggers a burst of star formation in theinner few hundred parsecs, provides a modest amount of new fuel to the centralblack hole, and causes the bulge of erisbh to have, by z=0, a box/peanutmorphology.(abridged)

0806.3975	migration and growth of giant planets in self-gravitating disks with  varied thermodynamics	we report on the results of novel global high-resolution three-dimensionalsimulations of disk-planet interaction which incorporate simultaneouslyrealistic radiation physics and the self-gravity of the gas, as well asallowing the planet to move. we find that thermodynamics and radiative physicshave a remarkable effect on both migration and accretion of jupiter massplanets. in simulations with radiative transfer adopting flux-limiteddiffusion, inward migration can be decreased by about 30% relative to theisothermal case, while in adiabatic runs migration nearly shuts off after a fewtens of orbits. migration varies because the relative strength of the inner andouter spiral perturbations is affected by thermodynamics, thus changing the nettorque acting on the planet. mass accretion rates on the planet can be reducedby more than an order of magnitude going from isothermal to radiative transferand adiabatic simulations. a circumplanetary disk always forms except inadiabatic runs. with radiative transfer the disk is sub-keplerian (vrot/vkep ~0.7) owing to significant pressure support. we discuss the effect ofcircumplanetary disk structure on the drift of embedded dust grains andplanetesimals and thus on the formation of the rocky satellites of giantplanets.

0705.3182	gravitational instability in binary protoplanetary disks	we review the models and results of simulations of self-gravitating, gaseousprotoplanetary disks in binary star systems. these models have been calculatedby three different groups with three different computational methods, twoparticle-based and one grid-based. we show that interactions with the companionstar can affect the temperature distribution and structural evolution of disks,and discuss the implications for giant planet formation by gravitationalinstability as well as by core accretion. complete consensus has not beenreached yet on whether the formation of giant planets is promoted or suppressedby tidal interactions with a companion star. while systems with binaryseparations of order 100 au or larger appear to behave more or less as inisolation, systems with smaller separations exhibit an increased or decreasedsusceptibility to fragmentation, depending on the details of thermodynamics, inparticular on the inclusion or absence of artificial viscosity, and on theinitial conditions. while code comparisons on identical problems need to becarried out (some of which are already in progress) to decide which computermodels are more realistic, it is already clear that relatively close binarysystems, with separations of order 60 au or less, should provide strongconstraints on how giant planets form in these systems.

0807.3329	formation of nuclear disks and supermassive black hole binaries in  multi-scale hydrodynamical galaxy mergers	(abridged) we review the results of the first multi-scale, hydrodynamicalsimulations of mergers between galaxies with central supermassive black holes(smbhs) to investigate the formation of smbh binaries in galactic nuclei. wedemonstrate that strong gas inflows produce nuclear disks at the centers ofmerger remnants whose properties depend sensitively on the details of gasthermodynamics. in numerical simulations with parsec-scale spatial resolutionin the gas component and an effective equation of state appropriate for astarburst galaxy, we show that a smbh binary forms very rapidly, less than amillion years after the merger of the two galaxies. binary formation issignificantly suppressed in the presence of a strong heating source such asradiative feedback by the accreting smbhs. we also present preliminary resultsof numerical simulations with ultra-high spatial resolution of 0.1 pc in thegas component. these simulations resolve the internal structure of theresulting nuclear disk down to parsec scales and demonstrate the formation of acentral massive object (~ 10^8 mo) by efficient angular momentum transport.this is the first time that a radial gas inflow is shown to extend to parsecscales as a result of the dynamics and hydrodynamics involved in a galaxymerger, and has important implications for the fueling of smbhs. due to therapid formation of the central clump, the density of the nuclear disk decreasessignificantly in its outer region, reducing dramatically the effect ofdynamical friction and leading to the stalling of the two smbhs at a separationof ~1 pc. we discuss how the orbital decay of the black holes might continue ina more realistic model which incorporates star formation and the multi-phasenature of the ism.

astro-ph;0011041	tidal stirring and the origin of dwarf spheroidals in the local group	n-body/sph simulations are used to study the evolution of dwarf irregulargalaxies (dirrs) entering the dark matter halo of the milky way or m31 onplunging orbits. we propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution ofgas rich, rotationally supported dirrs, mostly found at the outskirts of thelocal group (lg), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)or dwarf ellipticals (des), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals.the initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive darkmatter halos and reproduce nearby dirrs. repeated tidal shocks at thepericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and triggerdynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component.after only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (lsb) dirrs are transformed intodsphs, while high surface brightness (hsb) dirrs evolve into des. thisevolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relationobserved for lg dwarfs. dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, likethe archetypical dirr gr8, are turned into draco or ursa minor, the faintestand most dark matter dominated among lg dsphs. if disks include a gaseouscomponent, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts ofstar formation. the resulting star formation histories are in good qualitativeagreement with those derived using hst color-magnitude diagrams for localdsphs.

astro-ph;0110386	tidal debris of dwarf spheroidals as a probe of structure formation  models	recent observations suggest that carina and other nearby dwarf spheroidalgalaxies are surrounded by unbound stars tidally stripped by the milky way. werun high-resolution n-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within themilky way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with darkmatter potentials as those implied by current structure formation models. weshow that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or withcuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter ($c &lt; 5$) lead to flatouter stellar density profiles like that of carina for a variety of orbitalconfigurations. on the contrary, it is more difficult to remove stars fromcuspy dark matter halos with concentrations as high as predicted by cdm modelsat the mass scale of dwarf galaxies ($c \simgt 10$) and the data can only bereproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. our simulations show that carina islosing mass at a fractional rate $&lt; 0.1$ gyr$^{-1}$ and its mass-to-light ratiocould be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected alongthe line of sight. we follow the evolution of the tidal debris within atriaxial clumpy cold dark matter milky way halo which causes differentialprecession and small scale heating of the stellar streams. this renders theiruse as a dynamical tracer of the galactic potential practically useless, butdoes provide a novel test of the nature of the dark matter. models with warmdark matter (wdm) or fluid dark matter (fdm) produce dwarf halos with lowercentral densities than cdm and would be consistent with the observed tidaltails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current dataon nearby dwarf spheroidals. galactic halos in fdm are smooth and spherical andwould be favored by the detection of coherent streams.

astro-ph;0309500	the baryonic mass-velocity relation; clues to feedback processes during  structure formation and the cosmic baryon inventory	we show that a global relation between baryonic mass and virial velocity canbe constructed from the scale of dwarf galaxies up to that of rich galaxyclusters. the slope of this relation is close to that expected if dark matterhalos form in the standard hierarchical cosmogony and capture a universalbaryon fraction, once the details of halo structure and the adiabaticcontraction of halos due to cooling gas are taken into account. the scatter anddeficiency of baryons within low mass halos ($v_{vir} &lt; 50$ km/s) is consistentwith the expected suppression of gas accretion by photo-evaporation due to thecosmic uv background at high redshift. the data are not consistent withsignificant gas removal from strong supernovae winds unless the velocities ofgalaxies measured from their gas kinematics are significantly lower than thetrue halo velocities for objects with $v_{vir} &lt; 100$ km/s. thus models such as$\lambda$cdm with a steep mass function of halos may find it difficult toreproduce both the baryonic mass-velocity relation presented here whilst at thesame time reproducing the flat luminosity/hi function of galaxies. galaxieshold about 10% of the baryons in the universe, which is close to the collapsedmass fraction expected within hierarchical models on these scales, suggesting ahigh efficiency for galaxy formation. most of the baryons are expected to beevenly distributed between diffuse intergalactic gas in low densityenvironments and the intra-galactic medium within galaxy groups.

astro-ph;0310771	the evolution of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks:  fragmentation and possible giant planet formation	we carry out a large set of very high resolution, three dimensional smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations describing the evolution ofgravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks. we consider a broadrange of initial disk parameters. disk masses out to 20 au range from 0.075 to0.125 $m_{\odot}$, roughly consistent with the high-end of the massdistribution inferred for disks around t tauri stars. the initial disks spanminimum $q$ parameters between 0.8 and 2, with most models being around $\sim1.4$. the disks are evolved assuming either a locally isothermal equation ofstate or an adiabatic equation of state with varying $\gamma$. whenoverdensities above a specific threshold appear as a result of gravitationalinstability in a locally isothermal calculation, the equation of state isswitched to adiabatic to account for the increased optical depth. we show thatwhen a disk has a minimum $q$ parameter less than 1.4 strong trailing spiralinstabilities, typically three or four armed modes, form and grow untilfragmentation occurs along the arms after about 5 mean disk orbital times. theresulting clumps contract quickly to densities several orders of magnitudehigher than the initial disk density, and the densest of them survive evenunder adiabatic conditions. these clumps are stable to tidal disruption andmerge quickly, leaving 2-3 protoplanets on fairly eccentric orbits (the meaneccentricity being around 0.2) with masses between 0.7 and more than $7m_{jup}$, well in agreement with those of detected extrasolar planets.after$\sim 10^3$ years. fragmentation is not strongly dependent on whether the diskstarts from a marginally unstable state or gradually achieves it, as shown by atest where the disk gradually achieves the critical $q$ by growing in mass.

astro-ph;0312194	density profiles of cold dark matter substructure: implications for the  missing satellites problem	the structural evolution of substructure in cold dark matter (cdm) models isinvestigated combining ``low-resolution'' satellites from cosmological n-bodysimulations of parent halos with n=10^7 particles with high-resolutionindividual subhalos orbiting within a static host potential. we show that, as aresult of mass loss, convergence in the central density profiles requires theinitial satellites to be resolved with n=10^7 particles and parsec-scale forceresolution. we find that the density profiles of substructure halos can be wellfitted with a power-law central slope that is unmodified by tidal forces evenafter the tidal stripping of over 99% of the initial mass and an exponentialcutoff in the outer parts. the solution to the missing-satellites problemadvocated by stoehr et al. in 2002 relied on the flattening of the dark matter(dm) halo central density cusps by gravitational tides, enabling the observedsatellites to be embedded within dm halos with maximum circular velocities aslarge as 60 km/s. in contrast, our results suggest that tidal interactions donot provide the mechanism for associating the dwarf spheroidal satellites(dsphs) of the milky way with the most massive substructure halos expected in acdm universe. we compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles of fornaxand draco to observations, assuming that they are embedded in cdm halos. modelswith isotropic and tangentially anisotropic velocity distributions for thestellar component fit the data only if the surrounding dm halos have maximumcircular velocities in the range 20-35 km/s. if the dsphs are embedded withinhalos this large then the overabundance of satellites within the concordancelcdm cosmological model is significantly alleviated, but this still does notprovide the entire solution.

astro-ph;0407407	fate of supermassive black holes and evolution of the m(bh)-sigma  relation in merging galaxies: the effect of gaseous dissipation	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the orbital evolution of supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) using high-resolution self-consistent gasdynamicalsimulations of binary equal- and unequal-mass mergers of disk galaxies. thegalaxy models are consistent with the lcdm paradigm of structure formation andthe simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. wefind that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close smbh pairat the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adoptedforce resolution of ~ 100 pc. instead, the final smbh separation inunequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of themerging galaxies is modified by dissipation. in the absence of dissipation, thesatellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completedleaving its smbh wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnantfor the formation of a close pair. in contrast, we show that gas coolingfacilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companiongalaxy to tidal disruption. moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxiesconstructed to obey the m(bh)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending onwhether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of themass ratio of the merging systems. collisionless simulations reveal thatremnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role ofgas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.  in dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associatedwith the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by starformation provides the necessary fuel to the smbhs and allows the mergerremnants to satisfy the relation.

astro-ph;0412312	the gravitational and hydrodynamical interaction between the lmc and the  galaxy	we use high resolution n-body/sph simulations to study the hydrodynamical andgravitational interaction between the large magellanic cloud and the milky way.we model the dark and hot extended halo components as well as thestellar/gaseous disks of the two galaxies. both galaxies are embedded inextended cuspy lcdm dark matter halos. we follow the previous four gyrs of thelmc's orbit such that it ends up with the correct location and orientation onthe sky. tidal forces elongate the lmc's disk, forcing a bar and creating astrong warp and diffuse stellar halo, although very few stars become unbound.the stellar halo may account for some of the microlensing events. ram-pressurefrom a low density ionised halo is then sufficient to remove 1.4e8 msolar ofgas from the lmc's disk forming a great circle trailing stream around thegalaxy. the column density of stripped gas falls by two orders of magnitude 100degrees from lmc. the lmc does not induce any response in the milky way disk.on the contrary, the tides raised by the milky way determine the truncation ofthe satellite at about 11 kpc. after several gyrs of interaction the gas diskof the lmc is smaller than the stellar disk due to ram pressure and its sizecompares well with the observational data.

astro-ph;0504277	simultaneous ram pressure and tidal stripping; how dwarf spheroidals  lost their gas	we perform high-resolution n-body+sph simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxysatellites orbiting within a milky way-sized halo and study for the first timethe combined effects of tides and ram pressure. the structure of the galaxymodels and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to thoseexpected in a lcdm universe.while tidal stirring of disky dwarfs producesobjects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarfspheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirelyremove their gas component. gravitational tides can aid ram pressure strippingby diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce barformation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.this inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.assuming a low density of the hot galactic corona consistent with observationalconstraints, dwarfs with v_{peak} &lt; 30 km/s can be completely stripped of theirgas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. instead, dwarfs withmore massive dark haloes and v_{peak} &gt; 30 km/s lose most or all of their gascontent only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partiallycounteracting the bar-driven inflow. we show that the ionizing radiation fromthe cosmic uv background at z &gt; 2 can provide the required heating. in theseobjects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenterpassage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in dracoand ursa minor. the stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressureconfined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densitiescomparable to the hi clouds recently discovered around m31.(abridged)

astro-ph;0504530	the kinematic signature of face-on peanut-shaped bulges	we present a kinematic diagnostic for peanut-shaped bulges in nearly face-ongalaxies. the face-on view provides a novel perspective on peanuts which wouldallow study of their relation to bars and disks in greater detail than hithertopossible. the diagnostic is based on the fact that peanut shapes are associatedwith a flat density distribution in the vertical direction. we show that thekinematic signature corresponding to such a distribution is a minimum in thefourth-order gauss-hermite moment $s_4$. we demonstrate our method on $n$-bodysimulations of varying peanut strength, showing that strong peanuts can berecognized to inclinations $i \simeq 30\degrees$, regardless of the strength ofthe bar. we also consider compound systems in which a bulge is present in theinitial conditions as may happen if bulges form at high redshift throughmergers. we show that in this case, because the vertical structure of the bulgeis not derived from that of the disk, that the signature of a peanut in $s_4$is weakened. thus the same kinematic signature of peanuts can be used toexplore bulge formation mechanisms. the observational requirements foridentifying peanuts with this method are challenging, but feasible.

astro-ph;0505064	the environment of dwarf spheroidal satellites; ram pressure, tides and  external radiation fields	we discuss the role of environmental mechanisms in the evolution of dwarfgalaxy satellites using high-resolution n-body+sph simulations that includesimultaneously tidal forces, ram pressure and heating from ionizing radiationfields. tidally induced bar-buckling instabilities can transform a rotatingdisky dwarf into a pressure supported spheroidal. efficient gas removalrequires instead a combination of tidal mass loss and ram pressure stripping ina diffuse gaseous corona around the primary system. the efficiency of rampressure depends strongly on how extended the gas remains during the evolution.bar driven inflows that tend to drive the gas to the bottom of the potentialwell can be opposed by the heating from ultraviolet radiation. we show thateven fairly massive dwarfs ($v_{peak} &gt;$ 30 km/s) would be stripped of theirgas over a few gyr if they enter the milky way halo at $z &gt; 2$ thanks to theeffect of the cosmic uv background. gas mass loss can be much faster, occurringin less than 1 gyr, if dwarf satellites have their first close approach withthe primary at the epoch of bulge formation. indeed at that time the primarygalaxy should have a fuv luminosity comparable to that of major present-daystarbursts, resulting in a local radiation field even more intense than thecosmic background.

astro-ph;0509310	the secular evolution of disk structural parameters	we present a comprehensive series of $n$-body as well as $n$-body + sphsimulations to study the secular evolution of the structure of disk galaxies.our simulations are organized in a hierarchy of increasing complexity, rangingfrom rigid-halo collisionless simulations to fully live simulations with gasand star formation. comparisons between the different types of simulationsallow us to isolate the role of various physical mechanisms. we focus on theevolution of systems expected in a lcdm universe.  our goal is to examine which structural properties of disk galaxies mayresult from secular evolution rather than from direct hierarchical assembly. inthe vertical direction, we find that various mechanisms can lead to heating.the strongest heating occurs during the vertical buckling instability of a bar.among the consequences of this instability is the formation of peanut-shapedbulges which produce clear kinematic signatures when observed face-on. we findthat bars are robust structures that are not destroyed by buckling. they can bedestroyed instead by a central mass concentration but we find that this massneeds to be a large fraction of the total mass of the disk. we then study theevolution of stellar surface density profiles showing how angular momentumredistribution leads to increasing central densities and disk scale lengths andto profile breaks at large radii. the breaks in these simulations are inexcellent agreement with observed breaks, even when the evolution is purelycollisionless. disk scale-lengths increase even when the total disk angularmomentum is conserved; thus mapping halo angular momenta to scale-lengths isnon-trivial.

astro-ph;0601115	angular momentum transport and disk morphology in sph simulations of  galaxy formation	we perform controlled n-body/sph simulations of disk galaxy formation bycooling a rotating gaseous mass distribution inside equilibrium cuspy sphericaland triaxial dark matter halos. we systematically study the angular momentumtransport and the disk morphology as we increase the number of dark matter andgas particles from 10^4 to 10^6, and decrease the gravitational softening from2 kpc to 50 parsecs. the angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radialprofiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. at low resolution,similar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gascomponent has lost half of its initial angular momentum via differentmechanisms. the angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halocomponent, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,the latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. in addition,disk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phaseby artificial viscosity. in the central disk, particles can transfer away over99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or thepresence of a central bar. the strength of this transport also depends on forceand mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, lowmass resolution enhances the spiral structure. this complex interplay betweenresolution and angular momentum transfer highlights the complexity ofsimulations of galaxy formation even in isolated haloes. with 10^6 gas and darkmatter particles, disk particles lose only 10-20% of their original angularmomentum, yet we are unable to produce pure exponential profiles.

astro-ph;0606361	fragmentation of gravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks  with radiative transfer	we report on the results of the first 3d sph simulation of massive,gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks with radiative transfer. we adopta flux-limited diffusion scheme justified by the high opacity of most of thedisk. the optically thin surface of the disk cools as a blackbody. the disksgrow slowly in mass starting from a toomre-stable initial condition to thepoint at which they become marginally unstable. we find that gravitationallybound clumps with masses close to a jupiter mass can arise. fragmentationappears to be driven by vertical convective-like motions capable oftransporting the heat from the disk midplane to its surface on a timescale ofonly about 40 years at 10 au. a larger or smaller cooling efficiency of thedisk at the optically thin surface can promote or stifle fragmentation byaffecting the vertical temperature profile, which determines whether convectioncan happen or not, and by regulating the accretion flow from optically thinregions towards overdense regions. we also find that the chances offragmentation increase for a higher mean molecular weight $\mu$ sincecompressional heating is reduced. around a star with mass $1 m_{\odot}$ onlydisks with $\mu \ge 2.4$, as expected for gas with a metallicity comparable tosolar or higher, fragment. this suggests that disk instability, likecore-accretion, should be more effective in forming gas giants at higher gasmetallicities, consistent with the observed correlation between metallicity ofthe planet-hosting stars and frequency of planets
