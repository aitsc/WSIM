0905.2966	equivalence principle implications of modified gravity models	theories that attempt to explain the observed cosmic acceleration bymodifying general relativity all introduce a new scalar degree of freedom thatis active on large scales, but is screened on small scales to matchexperiments. we show that if such screening occurrs via the chameleon mechanismsuch as in f(r), it is possible to have order one violation of the equivalenceprinciple, despite the absence of explicit violation in the microscopic action.namely, extended objects such as galaxies or constituents thereof do not allfall at the same rate. the chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge forlarge objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by thegravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). this leads toorder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. in jordanframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. in contrast, ifthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the dgp braneworldmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. wepropose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. smallgalaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical frictionis negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared tostandard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should havedifferent velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical massestimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones. wediscuss possible pitfalls in some of these tests. the cleanest is the third onewhere mass estimate from hi rotational velocity could exceed that from stars by30 % or more. to avoid blanket screening of all objects, the most promisingplace to look is in voids.

0708.0031	lensing corrections to features in the angular two-point correlation  function and power spectrum	it is well known that magnification bias, the modulation of galaxy or quasarsource counts by gravitational lensing, can change the observed angularcorrelation function. we investigate magnification-induced changes to the shapeof the observed correlation function w(\theta) and the angular power spectrumc_{\ell}, paying special attention to the matter-radiation equality peak andthe baryon wiggles. lensing mixes the correlation function of the sourcegalaxies with the matter correlation at the lower redshifts of the lenses.since the lenses probe structure nearer to the observer, the angular scaledependence of the lensing terms is different from that of the sources, thus theobserved correlation function is distorted. we quantify how the lensingcorrections depend on the width of the selection function, the galaxy bias b,and the number count slope s. the correction increases with redshift and largercorrections are present for sources with steep number count slopes and/or broadredshift distributions. the most drastic changes to c_{\ell} occur formeasurements at z &gt;~1.5 and \ell &lt;~ 100. for the source distributions weconsider, magnification bias can shift the matter-radiation equality scale by1-6% at z ~ 1.5 and by z ~ 3.5 the shift can be as large as 30%. the baryonbump in \theta^2w(\theta) is shifted by &lt;~ 1% and the width is typicallyincreased by ~10%. shifts of &gt;~ 0.5% and broadening of &gt;~ 20% occur only forvery broad selection functions and/or galaxies with (5s-2)/b&gt;~2. however, nearthe baryon bump the magnification correction is not constant but a gentlyvarying function which depends on the source population. depending on how thew(\theta) data is fitted, this correction may need to be accounted for whenusing the baryon acoustic scale for precision cosmology.

1004.1165	gravitational lensing as signal and noise in lyman-alpha forest  measurements	in lyman-alpha forest measurements it is generally assumed that quasars aremere background light sources which are uncorrelated with the forest.gravitational lensing of the quasars violates this assumption. this effectleads to a measurement bias, but more interestingly it provides a valuablesignal. the lensing signal can be extracted by correlating quasar magnitudeswith the flux power spectrum and with the flux decrement. these correlationswill be challenging to measure but their detection provides a direct measure ofhow features in the lyman-alpha forest trace the underlying mass density field.observing them will test the fundamental hypothesis that fluctuations in theforest are predominantly driven by fluctuations in mass, rather than in theionizing background, helium reionization or winds. we discuss ways todisentangle the lensing signal from other sources of such correlations,including dust, continuum and background residuals. the lensing-inducedmeasurement bias arises from sample selection: one preferentially collectsspectra of magnified quasars which are behind overdense regions. thismeasurement bias is ~0.1-1% for the flux power spectrum, optical depth and theflux probability distribution. since the effect is systematic, quantities suchas the amplitude of the flux power spectrum averaged across scales should beinterpreted with care.

1005.3493	how to run through walls: dynamics of bubble and soliton collisions	it has recently been shown in high resolution numerical simulations thatrelativistic collisions of bubbles in the context of a multi-vacua potentialmay lead to the creation of bubbles in a new vacuum. in this paper, we showthat scalar fields with only potential interactions behave like free fieldsduring high-speed collisions; the kick received by them in a collision can bededuced simply by a linear superposition of the bubble wall profiles. thisprocess is equivalent to the scattering of solitons in 1+1 dimensions. wededuce an expression for the field excursion (shortly after a collision), whichis related simply to the field difference between the parent and bubble vacua,i.e. contrary to expectations, the excursion cannot be made arbitrarily largeby raising the collision energy. there is however a minimum energy thresholdfor this excursion to be realized. we verify these predictions using a numberof 3+1 and 1+1 numerical simulations. a rich phenomenology follows from thesecollision induced excursions - they provide a new mechanism for scanning thelandscape, they might end/begin inflation, and they might constitute our veryown big bang, leaving behind a potentially observable anisotropy.

1011.4107	stellar structure and tests of modified gravity	theories that attempt to explain cosmic acceleration by modifying gravitytypically introduces a long-range scalar force that needs to be screened onsmall scales. one common screening mechanism is the chameleon, where the scalarforce is screened in environments with a sufficiently deep gravitationalpotential, but acts unimpeded in regions with a shallow gravitationalpotential. this leads to a variation in the overall gravitational g withenvironment. we show such a variation can occur within a star itself,significantly affecting its evolution and structure, provided that the hostgalaxy is unscreened. the effect is most pronounced for red giants, which wouldbe smaller by a factor of tens of percent and thus hotter by 100's of k,depending on the parameters of the underlying scalar-tensor theory. carefulmeasurements of these stars in suitable environments (nearby dwarf galaxies notassociated with groups or clusters) would provide constraints on the chameleonmechanism that are four orders of magnitude better than current large scalestructure limits, and two orders of magnitude better than present solar systemtests.

1012.2912	the effect of peculiar velocities on supernova cosmology	we present an analysis of peculiar velocities and their effect on supernovacosmology. in particular, we study (a) the corrections due to our own motion,(b) the effects of correlations in peculiar velocities induced by large-scalestructure, and (c) uncertainties arising from a possible local under- orover-density. for all of these effects we present a case study of their impacton the cosmology derived by the sloan digital sky survey-ii supernova survey(sdss-ii sn survey). correcting supernova redshifts for the cmb dipole slightlyover-corrects nearby supernovae that share some of our local motion. we showthat while neglecting the cmb dipole would cause a shift in the derivedequation of state of delta w ~ 0.04 (at fixed matter density) the additionallocal-motion correction is currently negligible (delta w&lt;0.01). we use acovariance-matrix approach to statistically account for correlated peculiarvelocities. this down-weights nearby supernovae and effectively acts as agraduated version of the usual sharp low-redshift cut. neglecting coherentvelocities in the current sample causes a systematic shift of ~2% in thepreferred value of w and will therefore have to be considered carefully whenfuture surveys aim for percent-level accuracy. finally, we perform n-bodysimulations to estimate the likely magnitude of any local density fluctuation(monopole) and estimate the impact as a function of the low-redshift cutoff. wesee that for this aspect the low-z cutoff of z=0.02 is well-justifiedtheoretically, but that living in a putative local density fluctuation leavesan indelible imprint on the magnitude-redshift relation.

1105.3421	anisotropic extinction distortion of the galaxy correlation function	similar to the magnification of the galaxies' fluxes by gravitationallensing, the extinction of the fluxes by comic dust, whose existence isrecently detected by menard et al (2009), also modify the distribution of aflux-selected galaxy sample. we study the anisotropic distortion by dustextinction to the 3d galaxy correlation function, including magnification biasand redshift distortion at the same time. we find the extinction distortion ismost significant along the line of sight and at large separations, similar tothat by magnification bias. the correction from dust extinction is negativeexcept at sufficiently large transverse separations, which is almost alwaysopposite to that from magnification bias (we consider a number count slope s &gt;0.4). hence, the distortions from these two effects tend to reduce each other.at low z (~&lt;1), the distortion by extinction is stronger than that bymagnification bias, but at high z, the reverse holds. we also study how dustextinction affects probes in real space of the baryon acoustic oscillations(bao) and the linear redshift distortion parameter beta. we find its effect onbao is negligible. however, it introduces a positive scale-dependent correctionto beta that can be as large as a few percent. at the same time, we also find anegative scale-dependent correction from magnification bias, which is up topercent level at low z, but to ~40% at high z. these corrections arenon-negligible for precision cosmology, and should be considered when testinggeneral relativity through the scale-dependence of beta.

1108.5512	large-scale bias and efficient generation of initial conditions for  non-local primordial non-gaussianity	we study the scale-dependence of halo bias in generic (non-local) primordialnon-gaussian (png) initial conditions of the type motivated by inflation,parametrized by an arbitrary quadratic kernel. we first show how to generatenon-local png initial conditions with minimal overhead compared to local pngmodels for a general class of primordial bispectra that can be written aslinear combinations of separable templates. we run cosmological simulations forthe local, and non-local equilateral and orthogonal models and present resultson the scale-dependence of halo bias. we also derive a general formula for thefourier-space bias using the peak-background split (pbs) in the context of theexcursion set approach to halos and discuss the difference and similaritieswith the known corresponding result from local bias models. our pbs biasformula generalizes previous results in the literature to include non-markovianeffects and non-universality of the mass function and are in better agreementwith measurements in numerical simulations than previous results for a varietyof halo masses, redshifts and halo definitions. we also derive for the firsttime quadratic bias results for arbitrary non-local png, and show thatnon-linear bias loops give small corrections at large-scales. the resultingwell-behaved perturbation theory paves the way to constrain non-local png frommeasurements of the power spectrum and bispectrum in galaxy redshift surveys.

0710.4191	anisotropic magnification distortion of the 3d galaxy correlation: ii.  fourier and redshift space	in paper i of this series we discuss how magnification bias distorts the 3dcorrelation function by enhancing the observed correlation in the line-of-sight(los) orientation, especially on large scales. this lensing anisotropy isdistinctive, making it possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy,galaxy-magnification {\it and} magnification-magnification correlations. herewe extend the discussion to the power spectrum and also to redshift space. inreal space, pairs oriented close to the los direction are not protected againstnonlinearity even if the pair separation is large; this is because nonlinearfluctuations can enter through gravitational lensing at a small transverseseparation (or i.e. impact parameter). the situation in fourier space isdifferent: by focusing on a small wavenumber $k$, as is usually done, linearityis guaranteed because both the los and transverse wavenumbers must be small.this is why magnification distortion of the galaxy correlation appears lesssevere in fourier space. nonetheless, the effect is non-negligible, especiallyfor the transverse fourier modes, and should be taken into account ininterpreting precision measurements of the galaxy power spectrum, for instancethose that focus on the baryon oscillations. the lensing induced anisotropy ofthe power spectrum has a shape that is distinct from the more well knownredshift space anisotropies due to peculiar motions and the alcock-paczynskieffect. the lensing anisotropy is highly localized in fourier space whileredshift space distortions are more spread out. this means that one couldseparate the magnification bias component in real observations, implying thatpotentially it is possible to perform a gravitational lensing measurementwithout measuring galaxy shapes.

1206.4253	quasi-dilaton: theory and cosmology	general relativity (gr), with or without matter fields, admits a naturalextension to a scale invariant theory that requires a dilaton. here we showthat the recently formulated massive gr, minimally coupled to matter, possessesa new global symmetry related to scaling of the reference coordinates w.r.t.the physical ones. the field enforcing this symmetry, dubbed herequasi-dilaton, coincides with an ordinary dilaton if only pure gravity isconsidered, but differs from it when the matter lagrangian is present. westudy: (1) theoretical consistency of massive gr with the quasi-dilaton; (2)consistency with observations for spherically symmetric sources on (nearly)flat backgrounds; (3) cosmological implications of this theory. we find that:(i) the theory with the quasi-dilaton is as consistent as massive gr is. (ii)the vainshtein mechanism is generically retained, owing to the fact that in thedecoupling limit there is an enhanced symmetry, which turns the quasi-dilatoninto a second galileon, consistently coupled to a tensor field. (iii) unlike inmassive gr, there exist flat frw solutions. in particular, we findself-accelerated solutions and discuss their quadratic perturbations. thesesolutions are testable by virtue of the different effective newton's constantsthat govern the hubble expansion and structure growth.

0712.1162	the evolution of bias - generalized	fry (1996) showed that galaxy bias has the tendency to evolve towards unity,i.e. in the long run, the galaxy distribution tends to trace that of matter.generalizing slightly fry's reasoning, we show that his conclusion remainsvalid in theories of modified gravity (or equivalently, complex clustered darkenergy). this is not surprising: as long as both galaxies and matter aresubject to the same force, dynamics would drive them towards tracing eachother. this holds, for instance, in theories where both galaxies and mattermove on geodesics. this relaxation of bias towards unity is tempered by cosmicacceleration, however: the bias tends towards unity but does not quite make it,unless the formation bias were close to unity. our argument is extended in astraightforward manner to the case of a stochastic or nonlinear bias. animportant corollary is that dynamical evolution could imprint a scaledependence on the large scale galaxy bias. this is especially pronounced ifnon-standard gravity introduces new scales to the problem: the bias atdifferent scales relaxes at different rates, the larger scales generally moreslowly and retaining a longer memory of the initial bias. a consistency test ofthe current (general relativity + uniform dark energy) paradigm is therefore tolook for departure from a scale independent bias on large scales. a simple wayis to measure the relative bias of different populations of galaxies which areat different stages of bias relaxation. lastly, we comment on the possibilityof directly testing the poisson equation on cosmological scales, as opposed toindirectly through the growth factor.

1212.2623	binary systems as resonance detectors for gravitational waves	gravitational waves at suitable frequencies can resonantly interact with abinary system, inducing changes to its orbit. a stochastic gravitational-wavebackground causes the orbital elements of the binary to execute a classicrandom walk, with the variance of orbital elements growing with time. the lackof such a random walk in binaries that have been monitored with high precisionover long time-scales can thus be used to place an upper bound on thegravitational-wave background. using periastron time data from the hulse-taylorbinary pulsar spanning ~30 years, we obtain a bound of h_c &lt; 7.9*10^(-14) at~10^(-4) hz, where h_c is the strain amplitude per logarithmic frequencyinterval. our constraint complements those from pulsar timing arrays, whichprobe much lower frequencies, and ground-based gravitational-wave observations,which probe much higher frequencies. interesting sources in our frequency band,which overlaps the lower sensitive frequencies of proposed space-basedobservatories, include white-dwarf/supermassive black-hole binaries in theearly/late stages of inspiral, and tev scale preheating or phase transitions.the bound improves as (time span)^(-2) and (sampling rate)^(-1/2). thehulse-taylor constraint can be improved to ~3.8*10^(-15) with a suitableobservational campaign over the next decade. our approach can also be appliedto other binaries, including (with suitable care) the earth-moon system, toobtain constraints at different frequencies. the observation of additionalbinary pulsars with the ska could reach a sensitivity of h_c ~ 3*10^(-17).

0705.0165	is modified gravity required by observations? an empirical consistency  test of dark energy models	we apply the technique of parameter-splitting to existing cosmological datasets, to check for a generic failure of dark energy models. given a dark energyparameter, such as the energy density omega_lambda or equation of state w, wesplit it into two meta-parameters with one controlling geometrical distances,and the other controlling the growth of structure. observational data spanningtype ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (cmb), galaxy clustering,and weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the twometa-parameters to be equal. this technique checks for inconsistency betweendifferent data sets, as well as for internal inconsistency within any one dataset (e.g., cmb or lensing statistics) that is sensitive to both geometry andgrowth. we find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with currentdata. theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growthand geometry that is different from that of general relativity.parameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space ofsuch theories. our analysis of current data already appears to put sharp limitson these theories: assuming a flat universe, current data constrain thedifference omega_lambda(geom) - omega_lambda(grow) to be -0.0044 +/- 0.0058(68% c.l.); allowing the equation of state w to vary, the difference w(geom) -w(grow) is constrained to be 0.37 +/- 0.37 (68% c.l.). interestingly, theregion w(grow) &gt; w(geom), which should be generically favored by theories thatslow structure formation relative to general relativity, is quite restricted bydata already. we find w(grow) &lt; -0.80 at 2 sigma. as an example, the best-fitflat dvali-gabadadze-porrati (dgp) model approximated by our parametrizationlies beyond the 3 sigma contour for constraints from all the data sets.

1304.0723	on cosmological perturbations of quasidilaton	a theory of the quasidilaton is an extension of massive gravity by a scalarfield, nonlinearly realizing a certain new global symmetry of the lagrangian.it has been shown that unlike pure massive gravity, this theory does admithomogeneous and isotropic spatially flat solutions. among the latter,selfaccelerated solutions attract a special attention. previous studies ofperturbations, performed in the decoupling limit, revealed one healthy scalarmode, while the second relevant scalar was not captured in that limit. here westudy full cosmological perturbations above the simplest selfacceleratedbackground. we show that the fluctuations of a mixed state of the quasidilatonand the helicity-0 graviton necessarily have a negative kinetic term at shortdistances, making this background unphysical. in addition, these cosmologiesexhibit an order one sensitivity to higher dimensional terms suppressed by anenergy scale that is parametrically higher than the strong coupling scale ofthe quasidilaton effective theory: such terms include galileons, goldstone-likeselfinteractions and derivatives of the quasidilaton coupled to curvature, noneof which introduce extra ostrogradsky states. as one consequence, cosmology atthe hubble distances for this particular class of solutions depends on anunknown extension of the quasidilaton below its strong coupling distance scale.we note that non-frw solutions that are similar to those of pure massivegravity should not necessarily suffer from these pathologies.

1306.4335	dynamics of strongly twisted relativistic magnetospheres	magnetar magnetospheres are believed to be strongly twisted, due to shearingof the stellar crust by internal magnetic stresses. we present time-dependentaxisymmetric simulations showing in detail the evolution of relativisticforce-free magnetospheres subjected to slow twisting through large angles. whenthe twist amplitude is small, the magnetosphere moves quasi-statically througha sequence of equilibria of increasing free energy. at some twist amplitude themagnetosphere becomes tearing-mode unstable to forming a resistive currentsheet, initiating large-scale magnetic reconnection in which a significantfraction of the magnetic free energy can be dissipated. this "critical" twistangle is insensitive to the resistive length scale. rapid shearing temporarilystabilizes the magnetosphere beyond the critical angle, allowing themagnetosphere of a rapidly differentially rotating star to store, anddissipate, more free energy. in addition to these effects, shearing the surfaceof a rotating star increases the spindown torque applied to the star. ifshearing is much slower than rotation, the resulting spikes in spindown ratecan occur on timescales anywhere from the long twisting timescale to thestellar spin period or shorter, depending both on the stellar sheardistribution and the existing distribution of magnetospheric twists. a model inwhich energy is stored in the magnetosphere, and released by a magnetosphericinstability, therefore predicts large changes in the measured spindown ratebefore sgr giant flares.

1309.5389	novel probes of gravity and dark energy	the discovery of cosmic acceleration has stimulated theorists to considerdark energy or modifications to einstein's general relativity as possibleexplanations. the last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyondsmooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. whilethe theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence offifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observationalsignatures. this report focuses on observations that differ from theconventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure.examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via labexperiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearbyuniverse, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters,and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. theobservational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratoryexperiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radioobservations. in the coming decade, searches for these effects have thepotential for discovering fundamental new physics. we discuss how the searchescan be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modestadaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. the accompanyingpaper on the growth of cosmic structure describes complementary tests ofgravity with observations of large-scale structure.

1310.7517	the impact of magnification and size bias on weak lensing power spectrum  and peak statistics	the weak lensing power spectrum is a powerful tool to probe cosmologicalparameters. additionally, lensing peak counts contain cosmological informationbeyond the power spectrum. both of these statistics can be affected by thepreferential selection of source galaxies in patches of the sky with highmagnification, as well as by the dilution in the source galaxy surface densityin such regions. if not accounted for, these biases introduce systematic errorsfor cosmological measurements. here we quantify these systematic errors, usingconvergence maps from a suite of ray-tracing n-body simulations. at the cut-offmagnitude m of on-going and planned major weak lensing surveys, the logarithmicslope of the cumulative number counts s = dlog[n(&gt;m)]/dlog(m) is in the range0.1 &lt; s &lt; 0.5. at s = 0.2, expected in the i band for lsst, the inferred valuesof omega_m, w and sigma_8 are biased by many sigma (where sigma denotes themarginalized error) and therefore the biases will need to be carefully modeled.we also find that the parameters are biased differently in the (omega_m, w,sigma_8) parameter space when the power spectrum and when the peak counts areused. in particular, w derived from the power spectrum is less affected than wderived from peak counts, while the opposite is true for the best-constrainedcombination of [sigma_8 omega_m^gamma] (with gamma=0.62 from the power spectrumand gamma = 0.48 from peak counts). this suggests that the combination of thepower spectrum and peak counts can help mitigate the impact of magnificationand size biases.

1406.0842	soft-pion theorems for large scale structure	consistency relations -- which relate an n-point function to a squeezed(n+1)-point function -- are useful in large scale structure (lss) because oftheir non-perturbative nature: they hold even if the n-point function is deepin the nonlinear regime, and even if they involve astrophysically messy galaxyobservables. the non-perturbative nature of the consistency relations isguaranteed by the fact that they are symmetry statements, in which the velocityplays the role of the soft pion. in this paper, we address two issues: (1) howto derive the relations systematically using the residual coordinate freedom inthe newtonian gauge, and relate them to known results in $\zeta$-gauge (oftenused in studies of inflation); (2) under what conditions the consistencyrelations are violated. in the non-relativistic limit, our derivationreproduces the newtonian consistency relation discovered by kehagias \&amp; riottoand peloso &amp; pietroni. more generally, there is an infinite set of consistencyrelations, as is known in $\zeta$-gauge. there is a one-to-one correspondencebetween symmetries in the two gauges; in particular, the newtonian consistencyrelation follows from the dilation and special conformal symmetries in$\zeta$-gauge. we probe the robustness of the consistency relations by studyingmodels of galaxy dynamics and biasing. we give a systematic list of conditionsunder which the consistency relations are violated; violations occur if thegalaxy bias is non-local in an infrared divergent way. we emphasize therelevance of the adiabatic mode condition, as distinct from symmetryconsiderations. as a by-product of our investigation, we discuss a simple fluidlagrangian for lss.

1412.0757	cosmology constraints from the weak lensing peak counts and the power  spectrum in cfhtlens	lensing peaks have been proposed as a useful statistic, containingcosmological information from non-gaussianities that is inaccessible fromtraditional two-point statistics such as the power spectrum or two-pointcorrelation functions. here we examine constraints on cosmological parametersfrom weak lensing peak counts, using the publicly available data from the 154deg$^2$ cfhtlens survey. we utilize a new suite of ray-tracing n-bodysimulations on a grid of 91 cosmological models, covering broad ranges of thethree parameters $\omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$, and replicating the galaxysky positions, redshifts, and shape noise in the cfhtlens observations. we thenbuild an emulator that interpolates the power spectrum and the peak counts toan accuracy of $\leq 5\%$, and compute the likelihood in the three-dimensionalparameter space ($\omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $w$) from both observables. we findthat constraints from peak counts are comparable to those from the powerspectrum, and somewhat tighter when different smoothing scales are combined.neither observable can constrain $w$ without external data. when the powerspectrum and peak counts are combined, the area of the error "banana'' in the($\omega_m$, $\sigma_8$) plane reduces by a factor of $\approx2$, compared tousing the power spectrum alone. for a flat $\lambda$ cold dark matter model,combining both statistics, we obtain the constraint$\sigma_8(\omega_m/0.27)^{0.63}=0.85\substack{+0.03 \\ -0.03}$.

1506.03047	phenomenology of dark energy: general features of large-scale  perturbations	we present a systematic exploration of dark energy and modified gravitymodels containing a single scalar field non-minimally coupled to the metric.even though the parameter space is large, by exploiting an effective fieldtheory (eft) formulation and by imposing simple physical constraints such asstability conditions and (sub-)luminal propagation of perturbations, we arriveat a number of generic predictions. (1) the linear growth rate of matterdensity fluctuations is generally suppressed compared to $\lambda$cdm atintermediate redshifts ($0.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 1$), despite the introductionof an attractive long-range scalar force. this is due to the fact that, inself-accelerating models, the background gravitational coupling weakens atintermediate redshifts, over-compensating the effect of the attractive scalarforce. (2) at higher redshifts, the opposite happens; we identify a period ofsuper-growth when the linear growth rate is larger than that predicted by$\lambda$cdm. (3) the gravitational slip parameter $\eta$ - the ratio of thespace part of the metric perturbation to the time part - is bounded from above.for brans-dicke-type theories $\eta$ is at most unity. for more generaltheories, $\eta$ can exceed unity at intermediate redshifts, but not more thanabout $1.5$ if, at the same time, the linear growth rate is to be compatiblewith current observational constraints. we caution against phenomenologicalparametrization of data that do not correspond to predictions from viablephysical theories. we advocate the eft approach as a way to constrain newphysics from future large-scale-structure data.

0807.3551	clustering of luminous red galaxies iv: baryon acoustic peak in the  line-of-sight direction and a direct measurement of h(z)	we study the clustering of lrg galaxies in the latest spectroscopic sdss datareleases, dr6 and dr7, which sample over 1 gpc^3/h^3 to z=0.47. the 2-pointcorrelation function $\xisp$ is estimated as a function of perpendicular$\sigma$ and line-of-sight $\pi$ (radial) directions. we find a significantdetection of a peak at $r\simeq 110$mpc/h, which shows as a circular ring inthe $\sigma-\pi$ plane. there is also significant evidence for a peak along theradial direction whose shape is consistent with its originating from therecombination-epoch baryon acoustic oscillations (bao). a $\xisp$ model with noradial bao peak is disfavored at $3.2\sigma$, whereas a model with nomagnification bias is disfavored at $2\sigma$. the radial data enable, for thefirst time, a direct measurement of the hubble parameter $h(z)$ as a functionof redshift. this is independent from earlier bao measurements which used thespherically averaged (monopole) correlation to constrain an integral of $h(z)$.using the bao peak position as a standard ruler in the radial direction, wefind: $h(z=0.24)= 79.69 \pm 2.32 (\pm 1.29)$ km/s/mpc for z=0.15-0.30 and$h(z=0.43)= 86.45 \pm 3.27 (\pm 1.69)$ km/s/mpc for $z=0.40-0.47$. the firsterror is a model independent statistical estimation and the second accounts forsystematics both in the measurements and in the model. for the full sample,$z=0.15-0.47$, we find $h(z=0.34)= 83.80 \pm 2.96 (\pm 1.59)$ km/s/mpc.

astro-ph;0005049	on estimating the qso transmission power spectrum	we present new methods to minimize the systematic and random errors formeasuring the transmission power spectrum from the lyman-alpha forest. sourcesof systematic errors explored include metal line contamination andcontinuum-fitting. we advocate the technique of trend-removal in place oftraditional continuum-fitting -- here, a spectrum is normalized by its(smoothly varying) mean rather than its continuum -- this method is easilyautomated and removes biases introduced by continuum-fitting. trend- removalcan be easily applied to spectra where continuum-fitting is difficult, such aswhen the resolution or signal-to-noise is low, or for spectra at highredshifts. furthermore, a measurement of the continuum power spectrum usingtrend-removal, from either low redshift quasar spectra or the red-side oflyman-alpha, allows in principle the removal of spurious power introduced bythe continuum and thereby expanding scales probed to larger ones. we alsoderive expressions for the shot-noise bias and variance of the power spectrumestimate, taking into account the non-poissonian nature of the shot-noise andthe non-gaussianity of the cosmic fluctuations. an appropriate minimum varianceweighting of the data is given. finally, we give practical suggestions onobserving strategy: the desired resolution and s/n for different purposes, andhow to distribute one's finite observing time among quasar targets. alsodiscussed is the quasar spectroscopic study of the sloan digital sky survey,which has the potential to measure the power spectrum at z ~ 2-4 accurate tobetter than 1 % per mode -- the techniques presented here will be useful fortackling the anticipated issues of shot-noise and continuum contamination.

astro-ph;0006319	how many galaxies fit in a halo? constraints on galaxy formation  efficiency from spatial clustering	we study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clusteringis described in terms of dark matter halos. at small scales, clusteringstatistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory withhalo biasing. galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, andgalaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function ofhalo mass. this approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy powerspectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, andthe galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scalesthan their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. we findthat requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the apmgalaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. the data atlarge scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at smallmasses, m =10^10 msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the numberof galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-masslimit. these constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosityfunction or tully-fisher relation. we also predict the power spectrum,bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. although halomodels agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higherorder sp parameters in n-body simulations, the model assumption that halos arespherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of thebispectrum at small scales. we stress the importance of finite volume effectsin higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.

astro-ph;0009167	linear and nonlinear contributions to pairwise peculiar velocities	we write the correlation function of dark matter particles, xi(r), as the sumof two terms - one which accounts for nonlinear evolution, and dominates onsmall scales, and another which is essentially the term from linear theory, anddominates on large scales. we use models of the number and spatial distributionof haloes and halo density profiles to describe the nonlinear term and itsevolution. the result provides a good description of the evolution of xi(r) insimulations. we then use this decomposition to provide simple and accuratemodels of how the single particle velocity dispersion evolves with time, andhow the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution dependon scale. the key idea is to use the simple physics of linear theory on largescales, the simple physics of the virial theorem on small scales, and our modelfor the correlation function to tell us how to weight the two types ofcontributions (linear and nonlinear) to the pairwise velocity statistics. whenincorporated into the streaming model, our results will allow a simple accuratedescription of redshift-space distortions over the entire range of linear tohighly nonlinear regimes.

astro-ph;0102349	unitarity bounds and the cuspy halo problem	conventional cold dark matter cosmological models predict small scalestructures, such as cuspy halos, which are in apparent conflict withobservations. several alternative scenarios based on modifying fundamentalproperties of the dark matter have been proposed. we show that generalprinciples of quantum mechanics, in particular unitarity, imply interestingconstraints on two proposals: collisional dark matter proposed by spergel &amp;steinhardt, and strongly annihilating dark matter proposed by kaplinghat, knox&amp; turner. efficient scattering required in both implies m &lt; 12 gev and m &lt; 25gev respectively. the same arguments show that the strong annihilation in thesecond scenario implies the presence of significant elastic scattering,particularly for large enough masses. recently, a variant of the collisionalscenario has been advocated to satisfy simultaneously constraints from dwarfgalaxies to clusters, with a cross section that scales inversely with velocity.we show that this scenario likely involves super-elastic processes, and theassociated kinetic energy change must be taken into account when makingpredictions. exceptions and implications for experimental searches arediscussed.

astro-ph;0103329	atmospheric lensing and oblateness effects during an extrasolar  planetary transit	future high precision photometric measurements of transiting extrasolarplanets promise to tell us much about the nature of these systems. we examinehow atmospheric lensing and (projected) planet oblateness/ellipticity modifytransit light curves. the large density gradients expected in planetatmospheres can offset the unfavorably large observer-lens to source-lensdistance ratio, and allow the existence of caustics. under such conditions,starlight from all points in the planet's shadow is refracted into viewproducing a characteristic slowing down of the dimming at ingress (vice versafor egress). a search over several parameters, the planet radius etc., cannotproduce a nonlensed transit light curve that can mimic a lensed light curve.the fractional change in the diminution of starlight is approximately the ratioof atmospheric scale height to planet radius, expected to be 1 % or less.planet oblateness induces an asymmetry to the transit light curve about thepoint of minimum flux, depending on the planet orientation. the fractionalasymmetry is around 0.5 % for a projected ellipticity of 10 %, independent oflensing. for favorable ratios of planet to star radius, the above effects arepotentially observable with future space-based missions. this will allow us toconstrain the planet shape, and its atmospheric scale height, density andrefractive coefficient, providing information on its rotation, temperature andcomposition. for hd 209458b, the only currently known transiting extrasolarplanet, caustics are absent because of the very small lens-source separation.finally, we provide estimates of other variations to transit light curves thatcould be of comparable importance, including rings, satellites, stellaroscillations, star spots, and weather.

astro-ph;0104442	the cosmic baryon fraction and the extragalactic ionizing background	we reassess constraints on the cosmological baryon density from observationsof the mean decrement and power spectrum of the lyman-alpha forest, taking intoaccount uncertainties in all free parameters in the simplest gravitationalinstability model. the uncertainty is dominated by that of the photoionizingbackground, but incomplete knowledge of the thermal state of the intergalacticmedium also contributes significantly to the error-budget. while currentestimates of the baryon fraction from the forest do prefer values that aresomewhat higher than the big bang nucleosynthesis value of \omega_b h^2 = 0.02\pm 0.001, the discrepancy is at best about 3 \sigma. for instance, assumingthe highest estimate of the ionizing background, as indicated by recentmeasurements of a large escape fraction from lyman-break galaxies by steidel,pettini &amp; adelberger, we find \omega_b h^2 = 0.045 \pm 0.008. a recentmeasurement of the ionizing background from the proximity effect by scott etal., on the other hand, implies \omega_b h^2 = 0.03 \pm 0.01. we provide anexpression from which future likelihoods for \omega_b h^2 can be derived asmeasurements of the ionizing background improve -- consistency amongconstraints from the forest, nucleosynthesis and the microwave background willprovide a powerful test of the gravitational instability model. we also developa formalism which treats lower bounds on the baryon density in a statisticalmanner, which is appropriate if only a lower bound on the ionizing backgroundis known. finally, we discuss the implications of the escape fractionmeasurement for the age, structure and stellar content of lyman-break galaxies.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0111346	how neutral is the intergalactic medium at z ~ 6?	recent observations of high redshift quasar spectra reveal long gaps withlittle flux. a small or no detectable flux does not by itself imply theintergalactic medium (igm) is neutral. inferring the average neutral fractionfrom the observed absorption requires assumptions about clustering of the igm,which the gravitational instability model supplies. our most stringentconstraint on the neutral fraction at z ~ 6 is derived from the mean lyman-betatransmission measured from the z=6.28 sdss quasar of becker et al. -- theneutral hydrogen fraction at mean density has to be larger than 4.7 times10^{-4}. this is substantially higher than the neutral fraction of ~ 3-5 times10^{-5} at z = 4.5 - 5.7, suggesting that dramatic changes take place around orjust before z ~ 6, even though current constraints are still consistent with afairly ionized igm at z ~ 6. an interesting alternative method to constrain theneutral fraction is to consider the probability of having many consecutivepixels with little flux, which is small unless the neutral fraction is high.this constraint is slightly weaker than the one obtained from the meantransmission. we show that while the derived neutral fraction at a givenredshift is sensitive to the power spectrum normalization, the size of the jumparound z ~ 6 is not. we caution that systematic uncertainties include spatialfluctuations in the ionizing background, and the continuum placement. tests areproposed. in particular, the sightline to sightline dispersion in meantransmission might provide a useful diagnostic. we express the dispersion interms of the transmission power spectrum, and develop a method to calculate thedispersion for spectra that are longer than the typical simulation box.

astro-ph;0305498	beyond lyman-alpha: constraints and consistency tests from the  lyman-beta forest	absorption between the rest-frame wavelengths of 973 and 1026 angstroms inquasar spectra arises from two sources (apart from occasional metals): one isdue to lyman-alpha (lya) absorption by materials at a low redshift, and theother from lyman-beta (lyb) at a higher redshift. these two sources ofabsorption are to a good approximation uncorrelated because of their widephysical separation. therefore, the two-point correlation of absorption in thisregion of quasar spectra neatly factorizes into two pieces: the lyb correlationat high z, and the lya correlation at low z. the latter can be independentlymeasured from quasar spectra at lower redshifts using current techniques. asimple division then offers a way to statistically separate out the lybtwo-point correlation from the lya correlation. several applications of thistechnique are discussed. first, since the lyb absorption cross-section is lowerthan lya by about a factor of 5, the lyb forest is a better probe of theintergalactic medium (igm) at higher redshifts where lya absorption is oftensaturated. second, for the same reason, the lyb forest allows a bettermeasurement of the equation of state of the igm at higher overdensities,yielding stronger constraints on its slope when used in conjunction with thelya forest. third, models of the lya forest based on gravitational instabilitymake unique predictions for the lyb forest, which can be tested againstobservations. we briefly point out that feedback processes that affect higherdensity regions but leave low density structure intact may be betterconstrained by the lyb forest.

astro-ph;0505138	tightening constraints from the lyman alpha forest with the flux  probability distribution function	the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest of absorption lines in quasar spectrahas emerged as a potentially powerful technique to constrain the linear matterpower spectrum. in most previous work, the amplitude of the ionizing backgroundwas fixed by calibrating simulations to match the observed mean transmittedflux in the lyman-alpha forest. this procedure is undesirable in principle asit requires the estimation of the unabsorbed quasar continuum level, adifficult undertaking subject to various sources of systematic error and bias.we suggest an alternative approach based on measuring the one-point probabilitydistribution function (pdf) of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean,relative to the mean, i.e. the pdf of delta_f = (f - &lt;f&gt;)/&lt;f&gt;. this statistic,while sensitive to the amplitude of the ionizing background, has the virtuethat its measurement does not require an estimate of the unabsorbed continuumlevel. we present a measurement of the pdf of delta_f from seven keck hiresspectra, spanning a redshift range of z = 2.2 - 4.4. to illustrate that ourmethod is useful, we compare our measurements of the pdf of delta_f, andmeasurements of the flux power spectrum from croft et al.

astro-ph;0512159	correlated fluctuations in luminosity distance and the (surprising)  importance of peculiar motion in supernova surveys	large scale structure introduces two different kinds of errors in theluminosity distance estimates from standardizable candles such as supernovae ia(sne) - a poissonian scatter for each sn and a coherent component due tocorrelated fluctuations between different sne. increasing the number of snehelps reduce the first type of error but not the second. the coherent componenthas been largely ignored in forecasts of dark energy parameter estimation fromupcoming sn surveys. for instance it is commonly thought, based on poissonianconsiderations, that peculiar motion is unimportant, even for a low redshift snsurvey such as the nearby supernova factory (snfactory; z = 0.03 - 0.08), whichprovides a useful anchor for future high redshift surveys by determining the snzero-point. we show that ignoring coherent peculiar motion leads to anunderestimate of the zero-point error by about a factor of 2, despite the factthat snfactory covers almost half of the sky. more generally, there are fourtypes of fluctuations: peculiar motion, gravitational lensing, gravitationalredshift and what is akin to the integrated sachs-wolfe effect. peculiar motionand lensing dominates at low and high redshifts respectively. taking intoaccount all significant luminosity distance fluctuations due to large scalestructure leads to a degradation of up to 60% in the determination of the darkenergy equation of state from upcoming high redshift sn surveys, when used inconjunction with a low redshift anchor such as the snfactory. the most relevantfluctuations are the coherent ones due to peculiar motion and the poissonianones due to lensing, with peculiar motion playing the dominant role. we alsodiscuss to what extent the noise here can be viewed as a useful signal, andwhether corrections can be made to reduce the degradation.

astro-ph;0607628	a linear perturbation theory of inhomogeneous reionization	we develop an analytic approach to study inhomogeneous reionization on largescales by solving the equations of ionization balance and radiative transfer tofirst order in perturbations. given the spatial distribution and spectrum ofthe ionizing sources, our formalism can be used to predict the large scalepower spectra of fluctuations in the abundances of hii, hi and radiation. ourapproach avoids common approximations/assumptions in existing analytic methods-- for instance, we do not assume a specific ionization topology from theoutset; nor do we make a step-function bubble-like approximation to the hiidistribution. applying our formalism to sources biased according to thepress-schechter prescription, we find: 1. reionization always proceeds``inside--out'', with dense regions more highly ionized, at least on largescales; 2. on sufficiently large scales, hii, hi and radiation exhibits a scaleindependent bias relative to dark matter; 3. the bias is suppressed on scalescomparable to or smaller than the mean free path of the ionizing photons; 4. ifthe ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently soft, the hii bias closely tracksthe source bias for most of the reionization process but drops precipitouslyafter percolation; 5. if the ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently hard, thehii bias drops in a more steady fashion throughout the reionization process.the tools developed here will be useful for interpreting future 21 cm, cmb andlyman-alpha forest observations, both to learn about the reionizationastrophysics (such as the hardness of the source spectrum and therefore thenature of the ionizing sources) and to possibly extract interestingcosmological information.

astro-ph;0611539	magnification-temperature correlation: the dark side of isw measurements	integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) measurements, which involve cross-correlatingthe cmb with the foreground large-scale structure (e.g. galaxies/quasars), haveproven to be an interesting probe of dark energy. we show that magnificationbias, which is the inevitable modulation of the foreground number counts bygravitational lensing, alters both the shape and amplitude of the observed iswsignal. this is true especially at high redshifts because (1) the intrinsicgalaxy-temperature signal diminishes greatly back in the matter dominated era,(2) the lensing efficiency increases with redshift and (3) the number countslope generally steepens with redshift in a magnitude limited sample. at z &gt;~2, the magnification-temperature correlation dominates over the intrinsicgalaxy-temperature correlation and causes the observed isw signal to increasewith z, despite dark energy subdominance -- a result of the fact thatmagnification probes structures between the observer and the sources. ignoringmagnification bias can then lead to erroneous conclusions about dark energy.while the lensing modulation opens up an interesting high z window for iswmeasurements, high z measurements are not expected to add much new informationto low z ones if dark energy is the cosmological constant. this is becauselensing introduces significant covariance across redshifts. the most compellingreason to pursue high z isw measurements is to look for a potential surprisesuch as early dark energy domination or the signature of modified gravity. weconclude with a discussion of existing measurements, the highest z of which isat the margin of being sensitive to magnification bias. we also develop aformalism which might be of general interest: to predict biases in estimatingparameters when certain physical effects are ignored in interpreting data.

astro-ph;9508114	local approximations to the gravitational collapse of cold matter	we investigate three different local approximations for nonlineargravitational instability in the framework of cosmological lagrangian fluiddynamics of cold dust. they include the zel'dovich approximation (za), the``non-magnetic'' approximation of bertschinger \&amp; jain (1994, nma), and a new``local tidal'' approximation (lta). the lta is exact for any perturbationswhose gravitational and velocity equipotentials have the same constant shapewith time, including spherical, cylindrical, and plane-parallel perturbations.we tested all three local approximations with the collapse of a homogeneoustriaxial ellipsoid, for which an exact solution exists for an ellipsoidembedded in empty space and an excellent approximation is known in thecosmological context. we find that the lta is significantly more accurate ingeneral than the za and the nma. like the za, but unlike the nma, the ltagenerically leads to pancake collapse. for a randomly chosen mass element in aneinstein-de sitter universe, assuming a gaussian random field of initialdensity fluctuations, the lta predicts that at least 78\% of initiallyunderdense regions collapse owing to nonlinear effects of shear and tides.

astro-ph;9612232	equation of state of the photoionized intergalactic medium	we develop an efficient method to study the effects of reionization historyon the temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium in the lowdensity limit (overdensity less than 5). it is applied to the study ofphoto-reionization models in which the amplitude, spectrum and onset epoch ofthe ionizing flux, as well as the cosmology, are systematically varied. we findthat the mean temperature-density relation at z=2-4 is well approximated by apower-law equation of state for uniform reionization models. we deriveanalytical expressions for its evolution and exhibit its asymptotic behavior:it is found that for sufficiently early reionization, imprints of reionizationhistory prior to z=10 on the temperature-density relation are washed out. inthis limit the temperature at cosmic mean density is proportional to (\omega_bh/\sqrt\omega_0)^{1/1.7}. while the amplitude of the radiation flux at theionizing frequency of hi is found to have a negligible effect on thetemperature-density relation as long as the universe reionizes before z=5, thespectrum can change the overall temperature by about 20%, through variations inthe abundances of helium species. however the slope of the mean equation ofstate is found to lie within a narrow range for all reionization models westudy, where reionization takes place before z=5. we discuss the implicationsof these findings for the observational properties of the lyman-alpha forest.in particular, uncertainties in the temperature of the intergalactic medium,due to the uncertain reionization history of our universe, introduces a 30%scaling in the amplitude of the column density distribution while the the slopeof the distribution is only affected by about 5%. finally, we discuss how afluctuating ionizing field affects the above results. we argue that under

astro-ph;9706219	probing the universe with the lyman-alpha forest: i. hydrodynamics of  the low density igm	we introduce an efficient and accurate alternative to full hydrodynamicsimulations, hydro-pm (hpm), for the study of the low column densitylyman-alpha forest. it consists of a particle-mesh solver, modified to compute,in addition to the gravitational potential, an effective potential due to thegas pressure. such an effective potential can be computed from the densityfield because of a tight correlation between density and pressure in the lowdensity limit, which can be calculated for any photo-reionization history by amethod outlined in hui &amp; gnedin (1997). such a correlation exists, in part,because of minimal shock-heating in the low density limit. we compare carefullythe density and velocity fields as well as absorption spectra, computed usinghpm versus hydrodynamic simulations, and find good agreement. we show that hpmis capable of reproducing measurable quantities, such as the column densitydistribution, computed from full hydrodynamic simulations, to a precisioncomparable to that of observations. we discuss how, by virtue of its speed andaccuracy, hpm can enable us to use the lyman-alpha forest as a cosmologicalprobe. we also discuss in detail the smoothing of the gas (or baryon)fluctuation relative to that of the dark matter on small scales due to finitegas pressure. it is shown the conventional wisdom that the linear gasfluctuation is smoothed on the jeans scale is incorrect for generalreionization (or reheating) history; the correct linear filtering scale is ingeneral smaller than the jeans scale after reheating, but larger prior to it.(abridged)

astro-ph;9712074	likelihood analysis of galaxy surveys	one of the major goals of cosmological observations is to test theories ofstructure formation. the most straightforward way to carry out such tests is tocompute the likelihood function l, the probability of getting the data giventhe theory. we write down this function for a general galaxy survey. the fulllikelihood function is very complex, depending on all of the $n$-pointfunctions of the theory under consideration. even in the simplest case, whereonly the two point function is non-vanishing (gaussian perturbations), l cannotbe calculated exactly, primarily because of the poisson nature of the galaxydistribution. here we expand l about the (trivial) zero correlation limit. as afirst application, we take the binned values of the two point function as freeparameters and show that l peaks at $(dd - dr + rr)/dd$. using monte carlotechniques, we compare this estimator with the traditional $dd/dr$ and landy &amp;szalay estimators. more generally, the success of this expansion should pavethe way for further applications of the likelihood function.

astro-ph;9807190	a geometrical test of the cosmological energy contents using the  lyman-alpha forest	in this letter we explore a version of the test of cosmological geometryproposed by alcock and paczynski (1979), using observations of the lyman-alphaforest in the spectra of close quasar pairs. by comparing the correlations inabsorption in one quasar spectrum with correlations between the spectra ofneighboring quasars one can determine the relation of the redshift distancescale to the angle distance scale at the redshift of the absorbers, $z \sim 2 -4$. since this relationship depends on the parameters of the cosmologicalmodel, these parameters may be determined using the lyman-alpha forest. whilethis test is relatively insensitive to the density parameter $\omega_m$ in adust-dominated universe, it is more sensitive to the presence of a mattercomponent with large negative pressure (such as a cosmological constant$\lambda$) and its equation of state. with only 25 pairs of quasar spectra atangular separations $0.5' - 2'$, one can discriminate between an $\omega_m =0.3$ open universe ($\lambda=0$) and an $\omega_m = 0.3$ flat($\lambda$-dominated) universe at the $4-\sigma$ level. the s/n can be enhancedby considering quasar pairs at smaller angular separations, but requires propermodeling of nonlinear redshift space distortions. here the correlations andredshift space distortions are modeled using linear theory.

astro-ph;9810194	biased-estimations of the variance and skewness	nonlinear combinations of direct observables are often used to estimatequantities of theoretical interest. without sufficient caution, this could leadto biased estimations. an example of great interest is the skewness $s_3$ ofthe galaxy distribution, defined as the ratio of the third moment $\xibar_3$and the variance squared $\xibar_2^2$. suppose one is given unbiased estimatorsfor $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_2^2$ respectively, taking a ratio of the two doesnot necessarily result in an unbiased estimator of $s_3$. exactly such anestimation-bias affects most existing measurements of $s_3$. furthermore,common estimators for $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_2$ suffer also from this kind ofestimation-bias themselves: for $\xibar_2$, it is equivalent to what iscommonly known as the integral constraint. we present a unifying treatmentallowing all these estimation-biases to be calculated analytically. they are ingeneral negative, and decrease in significance as the survey volume increases,for a given smoothing scale. we present a re-analysis of some existingmeasurements of the variance and skewness and show that most of the well-knownsystematic discrepancies between surveys with similar selection criteria, butdifferent sizes, can be attributed to the volume-dependent estimation-biases.this affects the inference of the galaxy-bias(es) from these surveys. ourmethodology can be adapted to measurements of analogous quantities in quasarspectra and weak-lensing maps. we suggest methods to reduce the aboveestimation-biases, and point out other examples in lss studies which mightsuffer from the same type of a nonlinear-estimation-bias.

astro-ph;9901099	power spectrum correlations induced by non-linear clustering	gravitational clustering is an intrinsically non-linear process thatgenerates significant non-gaussian signatures in the density field. we considerhow these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensingsurveys. non-gaussian effects not only increase the individual error barscompared to the gaussian case but, most importantly, lead to non-trivialcross-correlations between different band-powers. we calculate thepower-spectrum covariance matrix in non-linear perturbation theory (weaklynon-linear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly non-linear regime), andfrom numerical simulations in real and redshift space. we discuss the impact ofthese results on parameter estimation from power spectrum measurements andtheir dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band-powers. weshow that the non-gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant forscales smaller than the non-linear scale, depending somewhat on powernormalization. furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deterioratethe determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas itsshape is less affected. in weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reducethe importance of non-gaussian effects. even so, for background galaxies atredshift z=1, the non-gaussian contribution rises significantly around l=1000,and could become comparable to the gaussian terms depending upon the powerspectrum normalization and cosmology. the projection has another interestingeffect: the ratio between non-gaussian and gaussian contributions saturates andcan even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the3d field falls faster than 1/k^2.

astro-ph;9902275	weighing the cosmological energy contents with weak gravitational  lensing	bernardeau et al. (1997), using perturbation theory, showed that the skewnessof the large-scale lensing-convergence, or projected mass density, could beused to constrain $\omega_m$, the matter content of the universe. on the otherhand, deep weak-lensing field surveys in the near future will likely measurethe convergence on small angular scales (&lt; 10 arcmin.), where the signal willbe dominated by highly nonlinear fluctuations. we develop a method to computethe small-scale convergence skewness, using a prescription for the highlynonlinear three-point function developed by scoccimarro and frieman (1998).this method gives predictions that agree well with existing results fromray-tracing n-body simulations, but is significantly faster, allowing theexploration of a large number of models. we demonstrate that the small-scaleconvergence skewness is insensitive to the shape and normalization of theprimordial (cdm-type) power spectrum, making it dependent almost entirely onthe cosmological energy contents, through their influence on the globalgeometrical distances and fluctuation growth rate. moreover, nonlinearclustering appears to enhance the differences between predictions of theconvergence skewness for a range of models. hence, in addition to constraining$\omega_m$, the small-scale convergence skewness from future deep several-degree-wide surveys can be used to differentiate between curvature dominatedand cosmological constant ($\lambda$) dominated models, as well as to constrainthe equation of state of a quintessence component, thereby distinguishing$\lambda$ from quintessence as well. finally, our method can be easilygeneralized to other measures such as aperture mass statistics.

0706.1071	anisotropic magnification distortion of the 3d galaxy correlation: i.  real space	it is well known gravitational lensing, mainly via magnification bias,modifies the observed galaxy/quasar clustering. such discussions have largelyfocused on the 2d angular correlation. here and in a companion paper (paper ii)we explore how magnification bias distorts the 3d correlation function andpower spectrum, as first considered by matsubara. the interesting point is: thedistortion is anisotropic. magnification bias preferentially enhances theobserved correlation in the line-of-sight (los) orientation, especially onlarge scales. for example at los separation of ~100 mpc/h, where the intrinsicgalaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can beenhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~0.35. the opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making itpossible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification andmagnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. theanisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiarmotions, as will be discussed in paper ii. the challenge: the magnificationdistortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting dataas precision improves. for instance, the ~100 mpc/h baryon acoustic oscillationscale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the losorientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias,redshift and number count slope. the corresponding shifts in the inferredhubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantlybias measurements of the dark energy equation of state. lastly, magnificationdistortion offers a plausible explanation for the well known excesscorrelations seen in pencil beam surveys.
