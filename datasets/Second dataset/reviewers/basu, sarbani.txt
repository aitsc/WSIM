0905.0651	fresh insights on the structure of the solar core	we present new results on the structure of the solar core, obtained with newsets of frequencies of solar low-degree p modes obtained from the bisonnetwork. we find that different methods used in extracting the different setsof frequencies cause shifts in frequencies, but the shifts are not large enoughto affect solar structure results. we find that the bison frequencies show thatthe solar sound speed in the core is slightly larger than that inferred fromdata from mdi low-degree modes, and the uncertainties on the inversion resultsare smaller. density results also change by a larger amount, and we find thatsolar models now tend to show smaller differences in density compared to thesun. the result is seen at all radii, a result of the fact that conservation ofmass implies that density differences in one region have to cancel out densitydifferences in others, since our models are constructed to have the same massas the sun. the uncertainties on the density results are much smaller too. weattribute the change in results to having more, and lower frequency, low-degreemode frequencies available. these modes provide greater sensitivity toconditions in the core.

0909.0506	determination of stellar radii from asteroseismic data	the nasa kepler mission is designed to find planets through transits.accurate and precise radii of the detected planets depend on knowing the radiusof the host star accurately, which is difficult unless the temperature andluminosity of the star are known precisely. kepler, however, has anasteroseismology programme that will provide seismic variables that cancharacterise stellar radii easily, accurately, and extremely precisely. in thispaper we describe the yale-birmingham (yb) method to determine stellar radiiusing a combination of seismic and conventional variables, and analyse theeffect of these variables on the result. we find that for main-sequence stars,a knowledge of the parallax is not important to get accurate radii using the ybmethod: we can get results to an accuracy and precision of better than a fewpercent if we know the effective temperature and the seismic parameters forthese stars. metallicity does not make much difference either. however, goodestimates of the effective temperature and metallicity, along with those of theseismic parameters, are essential to determine radii of sub giants properly. onthe other hand, for red giants we find that determining radii properly is notpossible without a good estimate of the parallax. we find that the so called"surface term" in the seismic data has minimal effect on the inferred radii.uncertainties in the convective mixing length can matter under somecircumstances and can cause a systematic shift in the inferred radii. blindtests with data simulated to match those expected from the asteroseismic surveyphase of kepler show that it will be possible to infer stellar radiisuccessfully using our method.

0909.2668	new solar composition: the problem with solar models revisited	we construct updated solar models with different sets of solar abundances,including the most recent determinations by asplund et al. (2009). the latterwork predicts a larger ($\sim 10%$) solar metallicity compared to previousmeasurements by the same authors but significantly lower ($\sim 25%$) than therecommended value from a decade ago by grevesse &amp; sauval (1998). we compare theresults of our models with determinations of the solar structure inferredthrough helioseismology measurements. the model that uses the most recent solarabundance determinations predicts the base of the solar convective envelope tobe located at $r_{\rm cz}= 0.724{\rm r_\odot}$ and a surface helium massfraction of $y_{\rm surf}=0.231$. these results are in conflict withhelioseismology data ($r_{\rm cz}= 0.713\pm0.001{\rm r_\odot}$ and $y_{\rmsurf}=0.2485\pm0.0035$) at 5$-\sigma$ and 11$-\sigma$ levels respectively.using the new solar abundances, we calculate the magnitude by which radiativeopacities should be modified in order to restore agreement withhelioseismology. we find that a maximum change of $\sim 15%$ at the base of theconvective zone is required with a smooth decrease towards the core, where thechange needed is $\sim 5%$. the required change at the base of the convectiveenvelope is about half the value estimated previously. we also present thesolar neutrino fluxes predicted by the new models. the most important changesbrought about by the new solar abundances are the increase by $\sim 10%$ in thepredicted $^{13}$n and $^{15}$o fluxes that arise mostly due to the increase inthe c and n abundances in the newly determined solar composition.

0910.1597	solar magnetic field signatures in helioseismic splitting coefficients	normal modes of oscillation of the sun are useful probes of the solarinterior. in this work, we use the even-order splitting coefficients to studythe evolution of magnetic fields in the convection zone over solar cycle 23,assuming that the frequency splitting is only due to rotation and a large scalemagnetic field. we find that the data are best fit by a combination of apoloidal field and a double-peaked near-surface toroidal field. the toroidalfields are centered at r=0.999r_solar and r=0.996r_solar and are confined tothe near-surface layers. the poloidal field is a dipole field. the peakstrength of the poloidal field is 124 +/- 17g. the toroidal field peaks at 380+/- 30g and 1.4 +/- 0.2kg for the shallower and deeper fields respectively. thefield strengths are highly correlated with surface activity. the toroidal fieldstrength shows a hysteresis-like effect when compared to the global 10.7 cmradio flux. the poloidal field strength shows evidence of saturation at highactivity.

1001.0026	detection of solar-like oscillations from kepler photometry of the open  cluster ngc 6819	asteroseismology of stars in clusters has been a long-sought goal because theassumption of a common age, distance and initial chemical composition allowsstrong tests of the theory of stellar evolution. we report results from thefirst 34 days of science data from the kepler mission for the open cluster ngc6819 -- one of four clusters in the field of view. we obtain the first cleardetections of solar-like oscillations in the cluster red giants and are able tomeasure the large frequency separation and the frequency of maximum oscillationpower. we find that the asteroseismic parameters allow us to testcluster-membership of the stars, and even with the limited seismic data inhand, we can already identify four possible non-members despite their having abetter than 80% membership probability from radial velocity measurements. weare also able to determine the oscillation amplitudes for stars that span abouttwo orders of magnitude in luminosity and find good agreement with theprediction that oscillation amplitudes scale as the luminosity to the power of0.7. these early results demonstrate the unique potential of asteroseismologyof the stellar clusters observed by kepler.

1005.3031	characteristics of solar meridional flows during solar cycle 23	we have analyzed available full-disc data from the michelson doppler imager(mdi) on board soho using the "ring diagram" technique to determine thebehavior of solar meridional flows over solar cycle 23 in the outer 2% of thesolar radius. we find that the dominant component of meridional flows duringsolar maximum was much lower than that during the minima at the beginning ofcycles 23 and 24. there were differences in the flow velocities even betweenthe two minima. the meridional flows show a migrating pattern withhigher-velocity flows migrating towards the equator as activity increases.additionally, we find that the migrating pattern of the meridional flow matchesthose of sunspot butterfly diagram and the zonal flows in the shallow layers. ahigh latitude band in meridional flow appears around 2004, well before thecurrent activity minimum. a legendre polynomial decomposition of the meridionalflows shows that the latitudinal pattern of the flow was also different duringthe maximum as compared to that during the two minima. the different componentsof the flow have different time-dependences, and the dependence is different atdifferent depths.

1006.0244	determining the initial helium abundance of the sun	we determine the dependence of the initial helium abundance and thepresent-day helium abundance in the convective envelope of solar models ($\yim$and $\ysm$ respectively) on the parameters that are used to construct themodels. we do so by using reference standard solar models to compute thepower-law coefficients of the dependence of $\yim$ and $\ysm$ on the inputparameters. we use these dependencies to determine the correlation between$\yim$ and $\ysm$ and use this correlation to eliminate uncertainties in $\yim$from all solar model input parameters except the microscopic diffusion rate. wefind an expression for $\yim$ that depends only on $\ysm$ and the diffusionrate. by adopting the helioseismic determination of solar surface heliumabundance, $\ysms= 0.2485\pm0.0035$, and an uncertainty of 20% for thediffusion rate, we find that the initial solar helium abundance, $\yims$, is$0.278 \pm 0.006$ independently of the reference standard solar models (andparticularly on adopted the solar abundances) used in the derivation of thecorrelation between $\yim$ and $\ysm$. when non-standard solar models withextra mixing are used, then we derive $\yims = 0.273 \pm 0.006$. in both cases,the derived $\yims$ value is higher than that directly derived from solar modelcalibrations when the low metalicity solar abundances (e.g. by asplund et al.)are adopted in the models.

1008.1787	solar rotation rate during the cycle 24 minimum in activity	the minimum of solar cycle 24 is significantly different from most otherminima in terms of its duration as well as its abnormally low levels ofactivity. using available helioseismic data that cover epochs from the minimumof cycle 23 to now, we study the differences in the nature of the solarrotation between the minima of cycles 23 and 24. we find that there aresignificant differences between the rotation rates during the two minima. thereare differences in the zonal-flow pattern too. we find that the band of fastrotating region close to the equator bifurcated around 2005 and recombined by2008. this behavior is different from that during the cycle 23 minimum. byauto-correlating the zonal-flow pattern with a time shift, we find that interms of solar dynamics, solar cycle 23 lasted for a period of 11.7 years,consistent with the result of howe et al. (2009). the autocorrelationcoefficient also confirms that the zonal-flow pattern penetrates through theconvection zone.

1009.3018	an in-depth study of grid-based asteroseismic analysis	nasa's kepler mission is providing basic asteroseismic data for hundreds ofstars. one of the more common ways of determining stellar characteristics fromthese data is by so-called "grid based" modelling. we have made a detailedstudy of grid-based analysis techniques to study the errors (anderror-correlations) involved. as had been reported earlier, we find that it isrelatively easy to get very precise values of stellar radii using grid-basedtechniques. however, we find that there are small, but significant, biases thatcan result because of the grid of models used. the biases can be minimized ifmetallicity is known. masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii,and suffer from larger systematic effects. we also find that the errors in massand radius are correlated. a positive consequence of this correlation is thatlog g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost no systematicbiases. radii and log g can be determined with almost no model dependence towithin 5% for realistic estimates of error in asteroseismic and conventionalobservations. errors in mass can be somewhat higher unless accurate metallicityestimates are available. age estimates of individual stars are the most modeldependent. the errors are larger too. however, we find that for star-clusters,it is possible to get a relatively precise age if one assumes that all stars ina given cluster have the same age.

1109.2595	frequency dependence of the large frequency separation of solar-like  oscillators: influence of the helium second-ionization zone	the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive orders in a star is approximately proportional to the square rootof its mean density. to determine the large frequency separation as accuratelyas possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders isoften used. it is, however, known that the large frequency separation varieswith frequency in a second order effect. from observations it has been shownthat this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars thanit is for red-giant stars. here we use yrec models to verify and explain thisobservational result. we find that for stars with r &gt; 8 rsun the effect of thehelium second ionisation zone is relatively small. for these stars the deeplocation of the he ii zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a fewlarge separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to therelatively weak and extended he ii layer, causing a shallow wide depression inthe first adiabatic exponent. for less evolved stars the he ii zone is locatedcloser to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depressionin the first adiabatic exponent. this causes frequency modulations withrelatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducinga relatively large frequency modulation. additionally, we find that for lessevolved stars the he ii zone is stronger and more localised for more massivestars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude ofthe frequency modulation.

1207.2765	calibrating convective properties of solar-like stars in the kepler  field of view	stellar models generally use simple parametrizations to treat convection. themost widely used parametrization is the so-called "mixing length theory" wherethe convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, \alpha, themixing-length parameter. this is a free parameter, and the general practice isto calibrate \alpha using the known properties of the sun and apply that to allstars. using data from nasa's kepler mission we show that using thesolar-calibrated \alpha is not always appropriate, and that in many cases itwould lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than theprimordial helium abundance. kepler data allow us to calibrate \alpha for manyother stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, themixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. we studied thecorrelation between \alpha and stellar properties, and we find that \alphaincreases with metallicity. we therefore conclude that results obtained byfitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed withsolar values of \alpha are likely to have large systematic errors. our resultsalso confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter shouldvary with stellar properties.

1208.5493	thinning of the sun's magnetic layer: the peculiar solar minimum could  have been predicted	the solar magnetic activity cycle causes changes in the sun on timescalesthat are relevant to human lifetimes. the minimum in solar activity thatpreceded the current solar cycle (cycle 24) was deeper and quieter than anyother recent minimum. using data from the birmingham solar-oscillations network(bison), we show that the structure of the solar sub-surface layers during thedescending phase of the preceding cycle (cycle 23) was very different from thatduring cycle 22. this leads us to believe that a detailed examination of thedata would have led to the prediction that the cycle-24 minimum would be out ofthe ordinary. the behavior of the oscillation frequencies allows us to inferthat changes in the sun that affected the oscillation frequencies in cycle 23were localized mainly to layers above about 0.996rsun, depths shallower thanabout 3000 km. in cycle 22, on the other hand, the changes must have alsooccurred in the deeper-lying layers.

0711.4590	helioseismology and solar abundances	helioseismology has allowed us to study the structure of the sun inunprecedented detail. one of the triumphs of the theory of stellar evolutionwas that helioseismic studies had shown that the structure of solar models isvery similar to that of the sun. however, this agreement has been spoiled byrecent revisions of the solar heavy-element abundances. heavy elementabundances determine the opacity of the stellar material and hence, are animportant input to stellar model calculations. the models with the new, lowabundances do not satisfy helioseismic constraints. we review here howheavy-element abundances affect solar models, how these models are tested withhelioseismology, and the impact of the new abundances on standard solar models.we also discuss the attempts made to improve the agreement of the low-abundancemodels with the sun and discuss how helioseismology is being used to determinethe solar heavy-element abundance. a review of current literature shows thatattempts to improve agreement between solar models with low heavy-elementabundances and seismic inference have been unsuccessful so far. thelow-metallicity models that have the least disagreement with seismic datarequire changing all input physics to stellar models beyond their acceptableranges. seismic determinations of the solar heavy-element abundance yieldresults that are consistent with the older, higher values of the solarabundance, and hence, no major changes to the inputs to solar models arerequired to make higher-metallicity solar models consistent with helioseismicdata.

1305.6586	asteroseismic surface gravity for evolved stars	context: asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance indetermining spectroscopic stellar parameters. the independent log(g) value fromasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis toreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. since 2012, a combined analysisof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing fora large survey with sdss/apogee and kepler. therefore, knowledge of anypotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is nowbecoming important. aims: the seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is thefrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). here, we investigate theinfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)values. the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive radial orders (dnu) is often used as an additional constraint forthe determination of log(g). additionally, we checked the influence of smallcorrections applied to dnu on the derived values of log(g). methods we usemethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and dnutogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derivelog(g). results: we find that different approaches to derive oscillationparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases forred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. these biases are well within the quoteduncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). corrections suggested in the literature tothe dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). however somewhatunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the orderof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar referencevalues are used.

1402.1182	the effect of metallicity-dependent t-tau relations on calibrated  stellar models	mixing length theory is the predominant treatment of convection in stellarmodels today. usually described by a single free parameter, alpha, the commonpractice is to calibrate it using the properties of the sun, and apply it toall other stellar models as well. asteroseismic data from kepler and corotprovide precise properties of other stars which can be used to determine alphaas well, and a recent study of stars in the kepler field of view found alpha tovary with metallicity. interpreting alpha obtained from calibrated stellarmodels, however, is complicated by the fact that the value for alpha depends onthe surface boundary condition of the stellar model, or t-tau relation.calibrated models that use typical t-tau relations, which are static andinsensitive to chemical composition, do not include the complete effect ofmetallicity on alpha. we use 3d radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to extractmetallicity-dependent t-tau relations and use them in calibrated stellarmodels. we find the previously reported alpha-metallicity trend to be robust,and not significantly affected by the surface boundary condition of the stellarmodels.

1403.1872	testing the asteroseismic mass scale using metal-poor stars  characterized with apogee and kepler	fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can beinferred using asteroseismology. cool stars with convective envelopes haveturbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. theproperties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass andradius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. stellar properties derivedusing these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities.because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysicalpriors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic massestimates in the low-metallicity regime. we identify nine metal-poor red giants(including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from asample observed by both the kepler space telescope and the sloan digital skysurvey-iii apogee spectroscopic survey. we compare masses inferred usingasteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. although oursample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismicparameters from the apokasc catalog, produce masses that are systematicallyhigher (&lt;{\delta}m&gt;=0.17+/-0.05 msun) than astrophysical expectations. themagnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical correctionsto the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. usingalternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematicshifts at the 0.04 msun level. we also compare published asteroseismic analyseswith scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequencyof maximum power as a constraint. upcoming apokasc observations will provide alarger sample of ~100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismiccharacterization of galactic stellar populations.

1405.1032	the apogee red-clump catalog: precise distances, velocities, and  high-resolution elemental abundances over a large area of the milky way's  disk	the sloan digital sky survey iii's apache point observatory galacticevolution experiment (apogee) is a high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopicsurvey covering all of the major components of the galaxy, including thedust-obscured regions of the inner milky way disk and bulge. here we present asample of 10,341 likely red-clump stars (rc) from the first two years of apogeeoperations, selected based on their position incolor-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature space using a newmethod calibrated using stellar-evolution models and high-qualityasteroseismology data. the narrowness of the rc locus incolor-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the starswith an accuracy of 5 to 10%. the sample extends to typical distances of about3 kpc from the sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and spans a volume ofapproximately 100 kpc^3 over 5 kpc &lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc, |z| &lt;~ 2 kpc, and -15 deg &lt;~galactocentric azimuth &lt;~ 30 deg. the apogee red-clump (apogee-rc) catalogcontains photometry from 2mass, reddening estimates, distances, line-of-sightvelocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances determined from thehigh-resolution apogee spectra, and matches to major proper motion catalogs. wedetermine the survey selection function for this data set and discuss how therc selection samples the underlying stellar populations. we use this sample tolimit any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the ~45degree-wide azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be &lt;= 0.02 dex,which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the radial metallicitygradient. this result constrains coherent non-axisymmetric flows within a fewkpc from the sun.

1405.3659	kepler-93b: a terrestrial world measured to within 120 km, and a test  case for a new spitzer observing mode	we present the characterization of the kepler-93 exoplanetary system, basedon three years of photometry gathered by the kepler spacecraft. the durationand cadence of the kepler observations, in tandem with the brightness of thestar, enable unusually precise constraints on both the planet and its host. weconduct an asteroseismic analysis of the kepler photometry and conclude thatthe star has an average density of 1.652+/-0.006 g/cm^3. its mass of0.911+/-0.033 m_sun renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismicstudy. an analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet kepler-93b,which appears with a period of 4.72673978+/-9.7x10^-7 days, returns aconsistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+0.02-0.28g/cm^3. the agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetaryinterpretation of the transit signal. the achromatic transit depth, as comparedbetween kepler and the spitzer space telescope, supports the same conclusion.we observed seven transits of kepler-93b with spitzer, three of which weconducted in a new observing mode. the pointing strategy we employed to gatherthis subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratior_p/r_star. we find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of0.919+/-0.011 r_sun with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetaryradius of 1.481+/-0.019 r_earth. the uncertainty of 120 km on our measurementof the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measuredplanetary radii outside of the solar system. together with the radius, theplanetary mass of 3.8+/-1.5 m_earth corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3+/-2.6g/cm^3. after applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities ofsimilarly-sized worlds between 1--1.5 r_earth, we find that kepler-93bpossesses an average density within this group.

1408.4284	a theoretical study of acoustic glitches in low-mass main-sequence stars	there are regions in stars, such as ionization zones and the interfacebetween radiative and convective regions, that cause a localized sharpvariation in the sound speed. these are known as "acoustic glitches". acousticglitches leave their signatures on the oscillation frequencies of stars, andhence these signature can be used as diagnostics of these regions. inparticular, the signature of these glitches can be used as diagnostics of theposition of the second helium ionization zone and that of the base of theenvelope convection zone. with the help of stellar models we study theproperties of these acoustic glitches in main-sequence stars. we find that theacoustic glitch due to the helium ionization zone does not correspond to thedip in the adiabatic index \gamma_1 caused by the ionization of heii, but tothe peak in \gamma_1 between the hei and heii ionization zones. we find that itis easiest to study the acoustic glitch due to the helium ionization zone instars with masses in the range 0.9--1.2 m_\odot.

0803.3619	solar rotation rate and its gradients during cycle 23	available helioseismic data now span almost the entire solar activity cycle23 making it possible to study solar-cycle related changes of the solarrotation rate in detail. in this paper we study how the solar rotation rate, inparticular, the zonal flows change with time. in addition to the zonal flowsthat show a well known pattern in the solar convection zone, we also studychanges in the radial and latitudinal gradients of the rotation rate,particularly in the shear layer that is present in the immediate sub-surfacelayers of the sun. in the case of the zonal-flow pattern, we find that the bandindicating fast rotating region close to the equator seems to have bifurcatedaround 2005. our investigation of the rotation-rate gradients show that therelative variation in the rotation-rate gradients is about 20% or more of theiraverage values, which is much larger than the relative variation in therotation rate itself. these results can be used to test predictions of varioussolar dynamo models.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

1506.06678	modeling the asteroseismic surface term across the hr diagram	asteroseismology is a powerful tool that can precisely characterize the mass,radius, and other properties of field stars. however, our inability to properlymodel the near-surface layers of stars creates a frequency-dependent frequencydifference between the observed and the modeled frequencies, usually referredto as the "surface term". this surface term can add significant errors to thederived stellar properties unless removed properly. in this paper we simulatesurface terms across a significant portion of the hr diagram, exploring fourdifferent masses ($m=0.8, 1.0, 1.2$, and $1.5$ m$_\odot$) at five metallicities($[\rm{fe/h}]=0.5, 0.0, -0.5 ,-1.0, and -1.5$) from main sequence to red giantsfor stars with $t_{\rm{eff}}&lt;6500 k$ and explore how well the most common waysof fitting and removing the surface term actually perform. we find that thetwo-term model proposed by ball &amp; gizon (2014) works much better than othermodels across a large portion of the hr diagram, including the red giants,leading us to recommend its use for future asteroseismic analyses.

astro-ph;0511337	10,000 standard solar models: a monte carlo simulation	we have evolved 10,000 solar models using 21 input parameters that arerandomly drawn for each model from separate probability distributions for everyparameter. we use the results of these models to determine the theoreticaluncertainties in the predicted surface helium abundance, the profile of thesound speed versus radius, the profile of the density versus radius, the depthof the solar convective zone, the eight principal solar neutrino fluxes, andthe fractions of nuclear reactions that occur in the cno cycle or in the threebranches of the p-p chains. we also determine the correlation coefficients ofthe neutrino fluxes for use in analysis of solar neutrino oscillations. ourcalculations include the most accurate available input parameters, includingradiative opacity, equation of state, and nuclear cross sections. weincorporate both the recently determined heavy element abundances recommendedby asplund, grevesse &amp; sauval (2005) and the older (higher) heavy elementabundances recommended by grevesse &amp; sauval (1998). we present best-estimatesof many characteristics of the standard solar model for both sets ofrecommended heavy element compositions.

0809.1427	interpreting helioseismic structure inversion results of solar active  regions	helioseismic techniques such as ring-diagram analysis have often been used todetermine the subsurface structural differences between solar active and quietregions. results obtained by inverting the frequency differences between theregions are usually interpreted as the sound-speed differences between them.these in turn are used as a measure of temperature and magnetic-field strengthdifferences between the two regions. in this paper we first show that the"sound-speed" difference obtained from inversions is actually a combination ofsound-speed difference and a magnetic component. hence, the inversion result isnot directly related to the thermal structure. next, using solar models thatinclude magnetic fields, we develop a formulation to use the inversion resultsto infer the differences in the magnetic and thermal structures between activeand quiet regions. we then apply our technique to existing structure inversionresults for different pairs of active and quiet regions. we find that theeffect of magnetic fields is strongest in a shallow region above 0.985r_sun andthat the strengths of magnetic-field effects at the surface and in the deeper(r &lt; 0.98r_sun) layers are inversely related, i.e., the stronger the surfacemagnetic field the smaller the magnetic effects in the deeper layers, and viceversa. we also find that the magnetic effects in the deeper layers are thestrongest in the quiet regions, consistent with the fact that these arebasically regions with weakest magnetic fields at the surface. because thequiet regions were selected to precede or follow their companion activeregions, the results could have implications about the evolution of magneticfields under active regions.

astro-ph;9702105	solar internal sound speed as inferred from combined bison and lowl  oscillation frequencies	observations of the sun with the lowl instrument provide a homogeneous set ofsolar p-mode frequencies from low to intermediate degree which allows one todetermine the structure of much of the solar interior avoiding systematicerrors that are introduced when different data sets are combined, i.e.,principally the effects of solar cycle changes on the frequencies.unfortunately, the lowl data set contains very few of the lowest-degree modes,which are essential for determining reliably the structure of the solar core -in addition, these lowest-degree data have fairly large associateduncertainties. however, observations made by the birmingham solar-oscillationsnetwork (bison) in integrated sunlight provide high-accuracy measurements of alarge number of low-degree modes. in this paper we demonstrate that thelow-degree mode set of the lowl data can be successfully combined with the moreaccurate bison data, provided the observations are contemporaneous for thosefrequencies where the solar-cycle-induced effects are important. we show thatthis leads to a factor-of-two decrease in the error on the inferred sound speedin the solar core. we find that the solar sound speed is higher than in solarmodels for r &lt; 0.2rsun. the density of the solar core is, however, lower thanthat in solar models.

astro-ph;9709083	solar internal rotation rate and the latitudinal variation of the  tachocline	a new set of accurately measured frequencies of solar oscillations are usedto infer the rotation rate inside the sun, as a function of radial distance aswell as latitude. we have adopted a regularized least squares technique withiterative refinement for both 1.5d inversion using the splitting coefficientsand 2d inversion using individual m splittings. the inferred rotation rateagrees well with earlier estimates showing a shear layer just below the surfaceand another one around the base of the convection zone. the tachocline or thetransition layer where the rotation rate changes from differential rotation inthe convection zone to almost latitudinally independent rotation rate in theradiative interior is studied in detail. no compelling evidence for anylatitudinal variation in position and width of tachocline is found though itappears that the tachocline probably shifts to slightly larger radial distanceat higher latitudes and possibly becomes thicker also. however, thesevariations are within the estimated errors and more accurate data would beneeded to make a definitive statement about latitudinal variations.

astro-ph;9808144	line asymmetry of solar p-modes: reversal of asymmetry in intensity  power spectra	the sense of line asymmetry of solar p-modes in the intensity power spectrais observed to be opposite of that seen in the velocity power spectra.theoretical calculations provide a good understanding and fit to the observedvelocity power spectra whereas the reverse sense of asymmetry in the intensitypower spectrum has been poorly understood. we show that when turbulent eddiesarrive at the top of the convection zone they give rise to an observableintensity fluctuation which is correlated with the oscillation they generate,thereby affecting the shape of the line in the p-mode power spectra andreversing the sense of asymmetry (this point was recognized by nigam et al. androxburgh &amp; vorontsov). the addition of the correlated noise displaces thefrequencies of peaks in the power spectrum. depending on the amplitude of thenoise source the shift in the position of the peak can be substantially largerthan the frequency shift in the velocity power spectra. in neither case are thepeak frequencies precisely equal to the eigenfrequencies of p-modes. we suggesttwo observations which can provide a test of the model discussed here.

astro-ph;9809309	ring diagram analysis of near-surface flows in the sun	ring diagram analysis of solar oscillation power spectra obtained from mdidata is carried out to study the velocity fields in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. the three dimensional power spectra are fitted to a modelwhich has a lorentzian profile in frequency and which includes the advection ofthe wave front by horizontal flows, to obtain the two components of thesub-surface flows as a function of the horizontal wave number and radial orderof the oscillation modes. this information is then inverted using ola and rlsmethods to infer the variation in horizontal flow velocity with depth. theaverage rotation velocity at different latitudes obtained by this techniqueagrees reasonably with helioseismic estimates made using frequency splittingdata. the shear layer just below the solar surface appears to consist of twoparts with the outer part up to a depth of 4 mm, where the velocity gradientdoes not show any reversal up to a latitude of 60 degrees. in the deeper partthe velocity gradient shows reversal in sign around a latitude of 55 degrees.the zonal flow velocities inferred in the outermost layers appears to besimilar to those obtained by other measurements. a meridional flow from equatorpolewards is found. it has a maximum amplitude of about 30 m/s near the surfaceand the amplitude is nearly constant in the outer shear layer.

0810.4938	two-dimensional stellar evolution code including arbitrary magnetic  fields. ii. precision improvement and inclusion of turbulence and rotation	in the second paper of this series we pursue two objectives. first, in orderto make the code more sensitive to small effects, we remove many approximationsmade in paper i. second, we include turbulence and rotation in thetwo-dimensional framework. the stellar equilibrium is described by means of aset of five differential equations, with the introduction of a new dependentvariable, namely the perturbation to the radial gravity, that is found when thenon-radial effects are considered in the solution of the poisson equation;following the scheme of the first paper, we write the equations in such a waythat the two-dimensional effects can be easily disentangled. the key conceptintroduced in this series is the equipotential surface. we use the underlyingcause-effect relation to develop a recurrence relation to calculate theequipotential surface functions for uniform rotation, differential rotation,rotation-like toroidal magnetic fields and turbulence. we also develop a moreprecise code to numerically solve the two-dimensional stellar structure andevolution equations based on the equipotential surface calculations. we haveshown that with this formulation we can achieve the precision required byobservations by appropriately selecting the convergence criterion. severalexamples are presented to show that the method works well. since we areinterested in modeling the effects of a dynamo-type field on the detailedenvelope structure and global properties of the sun, the code has beenoptimized for short timescales phenomena (down to 1 yr). the time dependence ofthe code has so far been tested exclusively to address such problems.
