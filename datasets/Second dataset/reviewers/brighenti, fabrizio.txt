0903.0720	hydrodynamical simulations of galactic fountains ii: evolution of  multiple fountains	using 3d hydrodynamical simulations, we studied in detail the fountain flowand its dependence with several factors, such as the galactic rotation, thedistance to the galactic center, and the presence of a hot gaseous halo. wehave considered the observed size-frequency distribution of young stellarclusters within the galaxy in order to appropriately fuel the multiplefountains in our simulations. the present work confirms the localized nature ofthe fountain flows: the freshly ejected metals tend to fall back close to thesame galactocentric region where they are delivered. therefore, the fountainsdo not change significantly the radial profile of the disk chemical abundance.the multiple fountains simulations also allowed to consistently calculate thefeedback of the star formation on the halo gas. finally, we have alsoconsidered the possibility of mass infall from the intergalactic medium and itsinteraction with the clouds that are formed by the fountains. though oursimulations are not suitable to reproduce the slow rotational pattern that istypically observed in the halos around the disk galaxies, they indicate thatthe presence of an external gas infall may help to slow down the rotation ofthe gas in the clouds and thus the amount of angular momentum that theytransfer to the coronal gas, as previously suggested in the literature.

0906.0576	hydrostatic gas constraints on supermassive black hole masses:  implications for hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical modelling in a sample  of early-type galaxies	we present new mass measurements for the supermassive black holes (smbhs) inthe centres of three early-type galaxies. the gas pressure in the surrounding,hot interstellar medium (ism) is measured through spatially resolvedspectroscopy with the chandra x-ray observatory, allowing the smbh mass (mbh)to be inferred directly under the hydrostatic approximation. this techniquedoes not require calibration against other smbh measurement methods and itsaccuracy depends only on the ism being close to hydrostatic, which is supportedby the smooth x-ray isophotes of the galaxies. combined with results from ourrecent study of the elliptical galaxy ngc4649, this brings to four the numberof galaxies with smbhs measured in this way. of these, three already have massdeterminations from the kinematics of either the stars or a central gas disc,and hence join only a handful of galaxies with mbh measured by more than onetechnique. we find good agreement between the different methods, providingsupport for the assumptions implicit in both the hydrostatic and the dynamicalmodels. the stellar mass-to-light ratios for each galaxy inferred by ourtechnique are in agreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesismodels assuming a kroupa initial mass function (imf). this concurrence impliesthat no more than ~10-20% of the ism pressure is nonthermal, unless there is aconspiracy between the shape of the imf and nonthermal pressure. finally, wecompute bondi accretion rates, finding that the two galaxies with the highestrates exhibit little evidence of x-ray cavities, suggesting that thecorrelation with the agn jet power takes time to be established.

0909.0600	agn feedback in galaxy groups: the two interesting cases of awm 4 and  ngc 5044	we present agn feedback in the interesting cases of two groups: awm 4 and ngc5044. awm 4 is characterized by a combination of properties which seems to defythe paradigm for agn heating in cluster cores: a flat inner temperature profileindicative of a past, major heating episode which completely erased the coolcore, as testified by the high central cooling time (&gt; 3 gyrs) and by the highcentral entropy level (~ 50 kev cm^2), and yet an active central radio galaxywith extended radio lobes out to 100 kpc, revealing recent feeding of thecentral massive black hole. a recent chandra observation has revealed thepresence of a compact cool corona associated with the bcg, solving the puzzleof the apparent lack of low entropy gas surrounding a bright radio source, butopening the question of its origin. ngc 5044 shows in the inner 10 kpc a pairof cavities together with a set of bright filaments. the cavities areconsistent with a recent agn outburst as also indicated by the extent of dustand h_alpha emission even though the absence of extended 1.4 ghz emissionremains to be explained. the soft x-ray filaments coincident with h_alpha anddust emission are cooler than those which do not correlate with optical andinfrared emission, suggesting that dust-aided cooling can contribute to theoverall cooling. for the first time sloshing cold fronts at the scale of agalaxy group have been observed in this object.

0911.0720	spitzer observations of passive and star forming early-type galaxies: an  infrared color-color sequence	we describe the infrared properties of a large sample of early type galaxies,comparing data from the spitzer archive with ks-band emission from 2mass. whilemost representations of this data result in correlations with large scatter, wefind a remarkably tight relation among colors formed by ratios of luminositiesin spitzer-mips (24, 70 and 160 um) bands and the ks-band. remarkably, thiscorrelation among e and s0 galaxies follows that of nearby normal galaxies ofall morphological types. in particular, the tight infrared color-colorcorrelation for s0 galaxies alone follows that of the entire hubble sequence ofnormal galaxies, roughly in order of galaxy type from ellipticals to spirals toirregulars. the specific star formation rate of s0 galaxies estimated from the24um luminosity increases with decreasing ks-band luminosity (or stellar mass)from essentially zero, as with most massive ellipticals, to rates typical ofirregular galaxies. moreover, the luminosities of the many infrared-luminous s0galaxies can significantly exceed those of the most luminous (presumablypost-merger) e galaxies. star formation rates in the most infrared-luminous s0galaxies approach 1-10 solar masses per year. consistently with this picture wefind that while most early-type galaxies populate an infrared red sequence,about 24% of the objects (mostly s0s) are in an infrared blue cloud togetherwith late type galaxies. for those early-type galaxies also observed at radiofrequencies we find that the far-infrared luminosities correlate with the massof neutral and molecular hydrogen, but the scatter is large. this scattersuggests that the star formation may be intermittent or that similar s0galaxies with cold gaseous disks of nearly equal mass can have varying radialcolumn density distributions that alter the local and global sf rates.

(b) remove point source confusion in secondaryanisotropy studies with planck and ground-based cmb data. (c) find at least1200 strongly lensed bright sub-mm sources leading to a 2% test of generalrelativity. (d) identify 200 proto-cluster regions at z of 2 and perform anunbiased study of the environmental dependence of star formation.

0709.2427	the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, surface brightness and  color profiles in elliptical galaxies	we describe photometry at mid-infrared passbands (1.2 - 24 microns) for asample of 18 elliptical galaxies. all surface brightness distributions resemblede vaucouleurs profiles, indicating that most of the emission arises from thephotospheres or circumstellar regions of red giant stars. the spectral energydistribution peaks near 1.6 microns, but the half-light or effective radius hasa pronounced minimum near the k band (2.15 microns). apart from the 24 micronpassband, all sample-averaged radial color profiles have measurable slopeswithin about twice the (k band) effective radius. evidently this variationarises because of an increase in stellar metallicity toward the galactic cores.for example, the sampled-averaged color profile (k - 5.8 microns) has apositive slope although no obvious absorption feature is observed in spectra ofelliptical galaxies near 5.8 microns. this, and the minimum in the effectiveradius, suggests that the k band may be anomalously luminous in metal-richstars in galaxy cores. unusual radial color profiles involving the 24 micronpassband may suggest that some 24 micron emission comes from interstellar notcircumstellar dust grains.

1106.3322	tracing the gas to the virial radius (r100) in a fossil group	we present a chandra, suzaku and rosat study of the hot intra group medium(igrm) of the relaxed fossil group/ poor cluster rxj1159+5531. this groupexhibits an advantageous combination of flat surface brightness profile, highluminosity and optimal distance, allowing the gas to be detected out to thevirial radius (rvir=r108=1100 kpc) in a single suzaku pointing, while thecomplementary chandra data reveal a round morphology and relaxed igrm imagedown to kpc scales. we measure the igrm entropy profile over 3 orders ofmagnitude in radius, including 3 data bins beyond 0.5r200 with azimuthalcoverage (&gt;30%). we find no evidence that the profile flattens at large scales(&gt;r500), and when corrected for the enclosed gas fraction, the entropy profileis very close to the predictions from self-similar structure formationsimulations, as seen in massive clusters. within rvir, we measure a baryonfraction of 0.17+/-0.02, consistent with the cosmological value. these resultsare in sharp contrast to the gas behaviour at large scales recently reported inthe virgo and perseus clusters, and indicate that substantial gas clumpingcannot be ubiquitous near rvir, at least in highly evolved (fossil) groups.

1109.3334	evidence for agn feedback in galaxy clusters and groups	the current generation of flagship x-ray missions, chandra and xmm-newton,has changed our understanding of the so-called "cool core" galaxy clusters andgroups. instead of the initial idea that the thermal gas is cooling and flowingtoward the center, the new picture envisages a complex dynamical evolution ofthe intra-cluster medium (icm) regulated by the radiative cooling and thenongravitational heating from the active galactic nucleus (agn). understandingthe physics of the hot gas and its interplay with the relativistic plasmaejected by the agn is key for understanding the growth and evolution ofgalaxies and their central black holes, the history of star formation, and theformation of large-scale structures. it has thus become clear that the feedbackfrom the central black hole must be taken into account in any model of galaxyevolution. in this paper, we draw a qualitative picture of the currentknowledge of the effects of the agn feedback on the icm by summarizing therecent results in this field.

1205.0256	reconciling stellar dynamical and hydrostatic x-ray mass measurements of  an elliptical galaxy with gas rotation, turbulence and magnetic fields	recent hydrostatic x-ray studies of the hot interstellar medium (ism) inearly-type galaxies underestimate the gravitating mass as compared to stellardynamics, implying modest, but significant deviations from exact hydrostaticequilibrium. we present a method for combining x-ray measurements and stellardynamical constraints in the context of bayesian statistics that allows theradial distribution of the implied nonthermal pressure or bulk motions in thehot ism to be constrained. we demonstrate the accuracy of the method withhydrodynamical simulations tailored to produce a realistic galaxy model.applying the method to the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc4649, we find asignificant but subdominant nonthermal pressure fraction (0.27+/-0.06) in thecentral (&lt;5 kpc) part of the galaxy, similar to the level of deviations fromhydrostatic equilibrium expected in galaxy clusters. plausible sources ofsystematic error, if important, may reduce this fraction. this would imply &gt;360km/s random turbulence or a magnetic field b=(39+/-6)(n_e/0.1cm^{-3})^{0.59+/-0.09} mug, whereas gas rotation alone is unlikely to explainthe detailed nonthermal profile. future observations with astro-h will allowturbulence or gas rotation at this level to be detected.

0711.4384	creation of the x-ray cavity jet and its radio lobe in m87/virgo with  cosmic rays; relevance to relic radio sources	young cavities in the x-ray emitting hot gas in galaxy clusters are oftenfilled with radio synchrotron emission and it is widely thought that thecavities are inflated by these cosmic rays. at a later stage of its evolution,when the cavity becomes buoyant, the converging flow of gas beneath the cavityresults in a filament of thermal gas, a cavity jet, that moves radially outwardat large subsonic velocities. as the cavity jet forms, the cosmic ray electronsmay diffuse through the cavity walls, filling a large volume surrounding thecavity jet, as observed in m87/virgo and elsewhere, sometimes referred to asrelic radio sources. we compute the combined evolution of cosmic rays, cavitiesand cavity jets. the observed pattern in m87/virgo can be reached in 100 myrs,matching the synchrotron age of the extended radio source. a 20-30 kpc longcavity jet is surrounded by a quasi-spherical radio lobe 40 kpc in diameter,but the initial cavity has disappeared. at later times the cavity jet will fallback to the origin, leaving only the extended radio source. the combinedjet-lobe evolution in m87/virgo requires a total cosmic ray energy that is morethan 10 times larger than that usually assumed, 4pv.

1303.3350	variation of mid and far-ir luminosities among early-type galaxies:  relation to stellar metallicity and cold dust	the hubble morphological sequence from early to late galaxies corresponds toan increasing rate of specific star formation. the hubble sequence also followsa banana-shaped correlation between 24 and 70 micron luminosities, bothnormalized with the k-band luminosity. we show that this correlation issignificantly tightened if galaxies with central agn emission are removed, butthe cosmic scatter of elliptical galaxies in both 24 and 70 micron luminositiesremains significant along the correlation. we find that the 24 micron variationamong ellipticals correlates with stellar metallicity, reflecting emission fromhot dust in winds from asymptotic giant branch stars of varying metallicity.infrared surface brightness variations in elliptical galaxies indicate that thek - 24 color profile is u-shaped for reasons that are unclear. in someelliptical galaxies cold interstellar dust emitting at 70 and 160 microns mayarise from recent gas-rich mergers. however, we argue that most of the largerange of 70 micron luminosity in elliptical galaxies is due to dust transportedfrom galactic cores by feedback events in (currently ir-quiet) active galacticnuclei. cooler dusty gas naturally accumulates in the cores of ellipticalgalaxies due to dust-cooled local stellar mass loss and may accrete onto thecentral black hole, releasing energy. agn-heated gas can transport dust incores 5-10 kpc out into the hot gas atmospheres where it radiates extended 70micron emission but is eventually destroyed by sputtering. this, and somemodest star formation, defines a cycle of dust creation and destruction.elliptical galaxies evidently undergo large transient excursions in the bananaplot in times comparable to the sputtering time or agn duty cycle, 10 myrs.normally regarded as passive, elliptical galaxies are the most active galaxiesin the ir color-color correlation.

0801.3461	weighing the quiescent central black hole in an elliptical galaxy with  x-ray emitting gas	we present a chandra study of the hot ism in the giant elliptical galaxyngc4649. in common with other group-centred ellipticals, its temperatureprofile rises with radius in the outer parts of the galaxy, from ~0.7kev at2kpc to ~0.9kev by 20kpc. however, within the central ~2kpc the trend reversesand the temperature peaks at ~1.1kev within the innermost 200pc. under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, we demonstrate that the centraltemperature spike arises due to the gravitational influence of a quiescentcentral super-massive black hole. we constrain the black hole mass (mbh) to$(3.35^{+0.67}_{-0.95})\times 10^9$msun (90% confidence), in good agreementwith stellar kinematics measurements. this is the first direct measurement ofmbh based on studies of hydrostatic x-ray emitting gas, which are sensitive tothe most massive black holes, and is a crucial validation of bothmass-determination techniques. this agreement clearly demonstrates the gas mustbe close to hydrostatic, even in the very centre of the galaxy, which isconsistent with the lack of morphological disturbances in the x-ray image.ngc4649 is now one of only a handful of galaxies for which mbh has beenmeasured by more than one method. at larger radii, we were able to decomposethe gravitating mass profile into stellar and dark matter (dm) components.unless one accounts for the dm, a standard virial analysis of the starsdramatically over-estimates the stellar mass of the galaxy. we find themeasured j-band stellar mass-to-light ratio, 1.37+/-0.10 msun/lsun, is in goodagreement with simple stellar population model calculations for this object.

0802.0263	on the evolution of cooling cores in x-ray galaxy clusters	(abridged) to define a framework for the formation and evolution of thecooling cores in x-ray galaxy clusters, we study how the physical propertieschange as function of the cosmic time in the inner regions of a 4 kev and 8 kevgalaxy cluster under the action of radiative cooling and gravity only. thecooling radius, r_cool, defined as the radius at which the cooling time equalsthe universe age at given redshift, evolves from ~0.01 r200 at z&gt;2, where thestructures begin their evolution, to ~0.05 r200 at z=0. the values measured at0.01 r200 show an increase of about 15-20 per cent per gyr in the gas densityand surface brightness and a decrease with a mean rate of 10 per cent per gyrin the gas temperature. the emission-weighted temperature diminishes by about25 per cent and the bolometric x-ray luminosity rises by a factor ~2 after 10gyrs when all the cluster emission is considered in the computation. on thecontrary, when the core region within 0.15 r500 is excluded, the gastemperature value does not change and the x-ray luminosity varies by 10-20 percent only. the cooling time and gas entropy radial profiles are wellrepresented by power-law functions. the behaviour of the inner slopes of thegas temperature and density profiles are the most sensitive and unambiguoustracers of an evolving cooling core. their values after 10 gyrs of radiativelosses, t_gas ~ r^0.4 and n_gas ~ r^(-1.2) for the hot (cool) object, areremarkably in agreement with the observational constraints available for nearbyx-ray luminous cooling core clusters. because our simulations do not considerany agn heating, they imply that the feedback process does not greatly alterthe gas density and temperature profiles as generated by radiative coolingalone.

1407.3235	molecular gas in the x-ray bright group ngc 5044 as revealed by alma	a short 30 minute alma observation of the early-type galaxy ngc 5044, whichresides at the center of an x-ray bright group with a moderate cooling flow,has detected 24 molecular structures within the central 2.5 kpc. the masses ofthe molecular structures vary from 3e5 to 1e7 mo3 and the co(2-1) linewidthsvary from 15 to 65 km/s. given the large co(2-1) linewidths, the observedstructures are likely giant molecular associations (gmas) and not individualmolecular clouds (gmcs). only a few of the gmas are spatially resolved with thecycle 0 alma beam and the average density of these gmas yields a gmc volumefilling factor of about 15%. the observed masses of the resolved gmas areinsufficient for them to be gravitationally bound, however, the most massivegma does contain a less massive component with a linewidth of 5.5 km/s (typicalof an individual virialized gmc). we also show that the gmas cannot be pressureconfined by the hot gas. given the observed co(2-1) linewidths of the gmas(i.e., the velocity dispersion of the embedded gmcs) they will likely disperseon a timescale of about 12 myr, which is less than the central cooling time ofthe hot gas, so the embedded gmcs within a gma must condense out of the hot gasat the same time and arise from local concentrations of thermally unstableparcels of hot gas. there are no indications of any disk-like molecularstructures and all indications suggest that the molecular gas follows ballistictrajectories after condensing out of the thermally unstable hot gas. the 230ghz luminosity of the central continuum source is 500 times greater than itslow frequency radio luminosity and probably reflects a recent accretion eventby the central supermassive black hole. the spectrum of the central continuumsource also exhibits an absorption feature.

1501.03502	agn-stimulated cooling of hot gas in elliptical galaxies	we study the impact of relatively weak agn feedback on the interstellarmedium of intermediate and massive elliptical galaxies. we find that the agnactivity, while globally heating the ism, naturally stimulates some degree ofhot gas cooling on scales of several kpc. this process generates the persistentpresence of a cold ism phase, with mass ranging between 10$^4$ and $\gtrsim$ 5$\times$ 10$^7$ m$_\odot$, where the latter value is appropriate for groupcentered, massive galaxies. widespread cooling occurs where the ratio ofcooling to free-fall time before the activation of the agn feedback satisfies$t_{cool}/t_{ff} \lesssim 70$, that is we find a less restrictive thresholdthan commonly quoted in the literature. this process helps explaining the bodyof observations of cold gas (both ionized and neutral/molecular) in ellipticalsand, perhaps, the residual star formation detected in many early-type galaxies.the amount and distribution of the off-center cold gas vary irregularly withtime. the cold ism velocity field is irregular, initially sharing the(outflowing) turbulent hot gas motion. typical velocity dispersions of the coldgas lie in the range 100-200 km/s. freshly generated cold gas often forms acold outflow and can appear kinematically misaligned with respect to the stars.we also follow the dust evolution in the hot and cold gas. we find that theinternally generated cold ism has a very low dust content, with representativevalues of the dust-to-gas ratio of 10$^{-4}$- 10$^{-5}$. therefore, this coldgas can escape detection in the traditional dust-absorption maps.

1501.07647	hot gaseous atmospheres in galaxy groups and clusters are both heated  and cooled by x-ray cavities	expanding x-ray cavities observed in hot gas atmospheres of many galaxygroups and clusters generate shock waves and turbulence that are primaryheating mechanisms required to avoid uninhibited radiatively cooling flowswhich are not observed. however, we show here that the evolution of buoyantcavities also stimulates radiative cooling of observable masses oflow-temperature gas. during their early evolution, radiative cooling occurs inthe wakes of buoyant cavities in two locations: in thin radial filamentsparallel to the buoyant velocity and more broadly in gas compressed beneathrising cavities. radiation from these sustained compressions removes entropyfrom the hot gas. gas experiencing the largest entropy loss cools first,followed by gas with progressively less entropy loss. most cooling occurs atlate times, $\sim 10^8-10^9$ yrs, long after the x-ray cavities have disruptedand are impossible to detect. during these late times, slightly denser lowentropy gas sinks slowly toward the centers of the hot atmospheres where itcools intermittently, forming clouds near the cluster center. single cavitiesof energy $10^{57}-10^{58}$ ergs in the atmosphere of the ngc 5044 group create$10^8 - 10^9$ $m_{\odot}$ of cooled gas, exceeding the mass of extendedmolecular gas currently observed in that group. the cooled gas clouds wecompute share many attributes with molecular clouds recently observed in ngc5044 with alma: self-gravitationally unbound, dust-free, quasi-randomlydistributed within a few kpc around the group center.

astro-ph;0002385	where do cooling flows cool?	although only about 5 percent of the total baryonic mass in luminouselliptical galaxies is in the form of cooled interstellar gas, it isconcentrated within the optical effective radius r_e where it influences thelocal dynamical mass. the mass of cooled gas must be spatially distributedsince it greatly exceeds the masses of central black holes. we explore here theproposition that a population of low mass, optically dark stars is created fromthe cooled gas. we consider a wide variety of radial distributions for theinterstellar cooling, but only a few are consistent with observed x-ray surfacebrightness profiles. in a region of concentrated interstellar cooling, thex-ray emission can exceed that observed, suggesting the presence of additionalsupport by magnetic stresses or non-thermal pressure. in general we find thatthe mass of cooled gas contributes significantly to stellar dynamical mass tolight ratios which vary with galactic radius. if the stars formed from cooledinterstellar gas are optically luminous, their influence on the the mass tolight ratio would be reduced. the mass of cooled gas inside r_e is sensitive tothe rate that old stars lose mass, which is nearly independent of the initialmass function of the old stellar population.

astro-ph;0003470	why are rotating elliptical galaxies less elliptical at x-ray  frequencies?	if mass and angular momentum were conserved in cooling flows associated withluminous, slowly rotating elliptical galaxies, the inflowing hot gas would spinup, resulting in disks of cold gas and x-ray images that are highly flattenedalong the equatorial plane out to several effective radii. such x-rayflattening is not observed at the spatial resolution currently available tox-ray observations. evidently mass and angular momentum are not in factconserved. if cooling flows are depleted by localized radiative cooling atnumerous sites distributed throughout the flows, then disks of cooled gas donot form and the x-ray images appear nearly circular. however, the distributionof young stars formed from the cooled gas is still somewhat flattened relativeto the stellar light. x-ray images of galactic cooling flows can also becircularized by the turbulent diffusion of angular momentum away from the axisof rotation, but the effective viscosity of known processes -- stellar massloss, supernovae, cooling site evolution, etc. -- is insufficient toappreciably circularize the x-ray images. radial gradients in the interstellariron abundance are unaffected by the expected level of interstellar turbulencesince these gradients are continuously re-established by type ia supernovae.

0705.3710	spitzer observations of transient, extended dust in two elliptical  galaxies: new evidence of recent feedback energy release in galactic cores	spitzer observations of extended dust in two optically normal ellipticalgalaxies provide a new confirmation of buoyant feedback outflow in the hot gasatmospheres around these galaxies. agn feedback energy is required to preventwholesale cooling and star formation in these group-centered galaxies. in ngc5044 we observe interstellar (presumably pah) emission at 8 microns out toabout 5 kpc. both ngc 5044 and 4636 have extended 70 microns emission from colddust exceeding that expected from stellar mass loss. the sputtering lifetime ofthis extended dust in the ~1kev interstellar gas, ~10^7 yrs, establishes thetime when the dust first entered the hot gas. evidently the extended dustoriginated in dusty disks or clouds, commonly observed in elliptical galaxycores, that were disrupted, heated and buoyantly transported outward. thesurviving central dust in ngc 5044 and 4636 has been disrupted into many smallfilaments. it is remarkable that the asymmetrically extended 8 micron emissionin ngc 5044 is spatially coincident with halpha+[nii] emission from warm gas. acalculation shows that dust-assisted cooling in buoyant hot gas moving out fromthe galactic core can cool within a few kpc in about ~10^7 yrs, explaining theoptical line emission observed. the x-ray images of both galaxies aredisturbed. all timescales for transient activity - restoration of equilibriumand buoyant transport in the hot gas, dynamics of surviving dust fragments, anddust sputtering - are consistent with a central release of feedback energy inboth galaxies about 10^7 yrs ago.

astro-ph;0008190	influence of cooled interstellar gas on the fundamental plane for  elliptical galaxies	we explore the possibly important influence of cooled interstellar gas on thefundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. interstellar cooling is described bya parameterized sink term in the equation of continuity. parameters that givethe best fits to the x-ray observations of ngc 4472 are used as a template forthe radial distribution of interstellar cooling in structurally homologouselliptical galaxies of lower mass. gas that cools within an effective radiuscan contribute an additional 10 - 30 percent to the mass of the old stellarpopulation. if the cooled gas forms into stars of very low mass, $\llm_{\odot}$, as is commonly assumed, the cooled mass is optically dark. as aresult, the mass to light ratios determined from stellar velocitiessystematically overestimate that of the old stellar population. moreover, thetotal mass and spatial distribution of the optically dark young stellarpopulation does not scale homologously with galactic luminosity or radius andthe total stellar mass to light ratio varies with galactic radius. weinvestigate the non-homologous perturbations of cooled gas on the mass to lightratio for several idealized homologous elliptical galaxies and show that theyappear to be incompatible with the observed thinness of the fundamental plane.if optically luminous young stars formed from the cooled gas, the disturbanceof the fundamental plane would be lessened.

astro-ph;0101517	entropy evolution in galaxy groups and clusters; a comparison of  external and internal heating	x-ray observations of hot gas in galaxy groups indicate higher entropies thancan be achieved in the accretion shocks as it fell into the dark halos. it hasbeen proposed that this entropy excess results from some universal externalheating process in the early universe - agn, population iii stars, etc. - thatoccurred before most of the gas entered the dark halos. alternatively, the hotgas in groups may be heated internally by type ii supernovae when the galacticstars formed. we investigate here the gas-dynamical consequences of variousamounts of external, high redshift heating and compare with internal supernovaheating. radiative losses and distributed mass dropout are included. we findthat externally heated flows are unsatisfactory; when the heating is highenough to bring the x-ray luminosities into agreement with observations, thegas entropy is too high. flows internally heated by type ii supernovae arepreferred. our results are insensitive to the epoch and spatial distribution ofthe supernova heating process. however, with a salpeter imf a large fraction ofthe energy produced by supernovae must heat the hot gas. alternatively, onlyabout 20 percent of the type ii supernova energy would be required to heat thegas if the initial mass function is flatter than salpeter, as suggested bystellar mass to light ratios.

astro-ph;0101545	spatial diffusion of x-ray emission lines in the m87 cooling flow;  evidence for absorption	recent xmm-newton observations of the cooling flow gas in m87 indicatesharply decreasing oxygen, iron and silicon abundances within $\sim 5$ kpc ofthe galactic center. this result is unexpected since stellar mass loss and typeia supernovae are expected to produce pronounced central abundance maxima forall three elements. however, it has been suggested that many of the strongx-ray lines are optically thick and diffuse to larger radii in the cooling flowbefore escaping, falsifying the central abundances. we verify with radiationtransfer calculations that this effect does indeed occur in the m87 coolingflow, but that it is insufficient to account for the m87 observations. wesuggest that some source of continuous opacity is required to reduce thecentral x-ray line emission, perhaps by warm gas at $t \sim 10^5 - 10^6$ k. theradial surface brightness profiles of x-ray resonance lines are also sensitiveto turbulence in cooling flows which reduces the line center optical depthsconsiderably. turbulence may provide sufficient energy to continuously heat thewarm absorbing gas.

astro-ph;0203409	heated cooling flows	in conventional models of galactic and cluster cooling flows widespreadcooling (mass dropout) is assumed to avoid accumulation of unacceptably largecentral masses. however, recent xmm observations have failed to find spectralevidence for locally cooling gas. this has revived the notion that coolingflows are heated by some process such as an intermittent, low-level agninvolving supermassive black holes in the central galaxy. to explore thishypothesis, we consider the gasdynamical consequences of galactic cooling flowsheated by many different scenarios without specifying the detailed physics ofthe heating process. we are unable to find a single acceptable heated flow inreasonable agreement with well observed hot gas temperature and densityprofiles, even using finely tuned parameters. idealized flows in whichradiative cooling is perfectly balanced by global heating are grosslyincompatible with observations. flows heated by episodic central feedbackgenerate quasi-cyclic changes in the hot gas density profile which are notsupported by current observations. paradoxically, centrally heated (orpressurized) cooling flows experience spontaneous non-linear compressions thatresult in spatially widespread cooling instabilities. therefore, spectralevidence for cooling gas is difficult to avoid by central heating.

astro-ph;0205362	xmm-newton and chandra observations of the galaxy group ngc 5044. i.  evidence for limited multi-phase hot gas	using new xmm and chandra observations we present an analysis of thetemperature structure of the hot gas within a radius of 100 kpc of the brightnearby galaxy group ngc 5044. a spectral deprojection analysis of dataextracted from circular annuli reveals that a two-temperature model (2t) of thehot gas is favored over single-phase or cooling flow (m_dot = 4.5 +/- 0.2m_{sun}/yr) models within the central ~30 kpc. alternatively, the data can befit equally well if the temperature within each spherical shell variescontinuously from ~t_h to t_c ~ t_h/2, but no lower. the high spatialresolution of the chandra data allows us to determine that the temperatureexcursion t_h --&gt; t_c required in each shell exceeds the temperature rangebetween the boundaries of the same shell in the best-fitting single-phasemodel. this is strong evidence for a multi-phase gas having a limitedtemperature range. the cooler component of the 2t model has a temperature (t_c\~ 0.7 kev) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars. the hot phase hasa temperature (t_h ~ 1.4 kev) characteristic of the virial temperature of the\~10^{13} m_{sun} halo expected in the ngc 5044 group. however, in view of themorphological disturbances and x-ray holes visible in the chandra image withinr ~10 kpc, bubbles of gas heated to ~t_h in this region may be formed byintermittent agn feedback. some additional heating at larger radii may beassociated with the evolution of the cold front near r ~50 kpc, as suggested bythe sharp edge in the epic images.

astro-ph;0301283	feedback heating in cluster and galactic cooling flows	cluster cooling flow models that include both thermal conduction and agnheating have lower overall mass cooling rates and simultaneously sustaindensity and temperature profiles similar to those observed with no ad hoc massdropout. to achieve this agreement, the thermal conductivity must be about 0.35+/- 0.10 of the spitzer value, similar to that advocated by narayan &amp; medvedev.however, when applied to galaxy/group scales the synergistic combination of agnheating and conduction is less satisfactory. when the computed density profileand the global cooling rate are lowered by agn heating to match observations ofthese smaller scale flows, the gas temperatures within about 10 kpc are toolarge. in addition, best-fitting flows in galaxy/groups with agn heating andthermal conduction require larger conductivities, about 0.5 - 1.0 of thespitzer value. when the gas density in galaxy/group flows is lowered byheating, the iron enrichment by type ia supernovae is more effective and thehot gas iron abundance greatly exceeds observed values. consequently,galactic/group flows with central heating and conduction require an additionalprocess that removes the iron: failure of type ia ejecta to go into the hotphase, selective cooling, etc.

astro-ph;0301452	dust in hot gas: far infrared emission from three local elliptical  galaxies	we present far-ir iso observations of three early-type galaxies in the virgocluster. the data were recorded using the isophot instrument in both the p32oversampled maps and the p39/37 sparse maps. the maps reach the limitingsensitivity of the isophot instrument at 60, 90, and 180$\mu$m. two of the mostprominent elliptical galaxies in virgo -- ngc 4472 and ngc 4649 -- clearly showno emission at far-ir wavelengths at a level of few tens of mjy, but ngc 4636is detected at all three wavelengths. we have computed the far-ir emission fromdust for ngc4472 and ngc4636 under the assumption that dusty outflows fromevolving red giant stars are continuously supplying dust to the interstellarmedium and that the grains, once diffused into the interstellar medium, aresputtered away by collisions with ions. while the calculated fluxes areconsistent with the observed upper limits for ngc4472, the dust emissiondetected in ngc4636 support the hypothesis that additional dust has beenaccreted in a very recent ($\lta$ few $10^8$ yrs) merger with a dusty, gas-richgalaxy.

astro-ph;0306535	circulation flows: cooling flows with bubble return	the failure of the xmm-newton and chandra x-ray telescopes to detect coolinggas in elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies has led many to adopt theposition that the gas is not cooling at all and that heating by an activenucleus in the central e or cd galaxy is sufficient to offset radiativecooling. in this paper we explore an idealized limiting example of this pointof view in which hot, buoyant bubbles formed near the center return theinflowing, radiatively cooling gas to distant regions in the flow. we show thatidealized steady state, centrally heated non-cooling flows can indeed beconstructed. in addition, the emission-weighted temperature profiles in thesecirculating flows resemble those of normal cooling flows. however, thesesolutions are valid only (1) for a range of bubble parameters for which thereis no independent justification, (2) for a limited spatial region in thecooling flow and (3) for a limited period of time after which cooling seemsinevitable. our exploration of non-cooling flows is set in the context ofgalaxy/group flows.

astro-ph;0309367	stellar orbits and the interstellar gas temperature in elliptical  galaxies	we draw attention to the close relationship between the anisotropy parameterbeta(r) for stellar orbits in elliptical galaxies and the temperature profilet(r) of the hot interstellar gas. for nearly spherical galaxies the gas densitycan be accurately determined from x-ray observations and the stellar luminositydensity can be accurately found from the optical surface brightness. the jeansequation and hydrostatic equilibrium establish a connection between beta(r) andt(r) that must be consistent with the observed stellar velocity dispersion.purely optical observations of the bright elliptical galaxy ngc 4472 indicatebeta(r) &lt; 0.35 within the effective radius. however, the x-ray gas temperatureprofile t(r) for ngc 4472 requires significantly larger anisotropy, beta = 0.6- 0.7, about twice the optical value. this strong preference for radial stellarorbits must be understood in terms of the formation history of massiveelliptical galaxies. conversely, if the smaller, optically determinedanisotropy is indeed correct, we are led to the important conclusion that thetemperature profile t(r) of the hot interstellar gas in ngc 4472 must differfrom that indicated by x-ray observations, or that the hot gas is not inhydrostatic equilibrium.

astro-ph;0404502	three-dimensional simulations of the interstellar medium in dwarf  galaxies - ii. galactic wind	we study the hydrodynamical evolution of galactic winds in disky dwarfgalaxies moving through an intergalactic medium. in agreement with previousinvestigations,we find that when the ram pressure stripping does not disruptthe ism, it usually has a negligible effect on the galactic wind dynamics. onlywhen the igm ram pressure is comparable to the central ism thermal pressure thestripping and the superwind influence each other increasing the gas removalrate. in this case several parameters regulate the ism ejection process, as theoriginal distribution of the ism and the geometry of the igm-galaxyinteraction. when the ism is not removed by the ram pressure or the wind, itloses memory of the starburst episode and recovers almost its pre-burstdistribution in a timescale of 50-200 myr. after this time another starformation episode becomes, in principle, possible. evidently, galactic windsare consistent with a recurrent bursts star formation history.  contrary to the ism content, the amount of the metal-rich ejecta retained bythe galaxy is more sensitive to the ram pressure action. part of the ejecta isfirst trapped in a low density, extraplanar gas produced by the igm-isminteraction, and then pushed back onto the galactic disc. the amount of trappedmetals in a moving galaxy may be up to three times larger than in a galaxy atrest. this prediction may be tested comparing metallicity of dwarf galaxies innearby poor clusters or groups, such as virgo or fornax, with the fieldcounterpart. the sensitivity of the metal entrapment efficiency on the geometryof the interaction may explain part of the observed scatter in themetallicity-luminosity relation for dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0412102	the ages of elliptical galaxies from mid-infrared emission	the mid-infrared (10-20 um) luminosity of elliptical galaxies is dominated bythe integrated emission from circumstellar dust in red giant stars. as a singlestellar population evolves, the rate of dusty mass loss from red giant starsdecreases with time, so the mid-infrared luminosity should also decline withstellar age. to seek such a correlation, we have used archival iso observationsto determine surface brightness profiles and central fluxes at 15 um in 17early-type galaxies for which stellar ages have been determined from opticalspectral indices. the radial surface brightness distributions at 15 umgenerally follow the stellar de vaucouleurs profile as expected. we find thatthe surface brightness ratio mu_{15um}/mu_{i-band} is systematically higher inelliptical galaxies with ages &lt; 5 gyrs and in galaxies that exhibit evidence ofrecent mergers. within the accuracy of our observations, mu_{15um}/mu_{i-band}shows no age dependence for ages &gt; 5 gyrs. the corresponding flux ratiosf_{15um}/f_{i-band} within apertures scaled to the effective radius (r_e/8) areproportional to the mu_{15um}/mu_{i-band} ratios at larger galactic radii,indicating that no 15 um emission is detected from central dust clouds visiblein optical images in some of our sample galaxies. emission at 15 um is observedin non-central massive clouds of dust and cold gas in ngc1316, an ellipticalgalaxy that is thought to have had a recent merger. recent {\it spitzer spacetelescope} data also indicate the presence of pah emission at 8 um. severalellipticals have extended regions of 15 um emission that have no obviouscounterparts at other frequencies.

astro-ph;0610135	the x-ray concentration-virial mass relation	we present the concentration (c)-virial mass (m) relation of 39 galaxysystems ranging in mass from individual early-type galaxies up to the mostmassive galaxy clusters, (0.06-20) x 10^{14} m_sun. we selected for analysisthe most relaxed systems possessing the highest quality data currentlyavailable in the chandra and xmm public data archives. a power-law model fittedto the x-ray c-m relation requires at high significance (6.6 sigma) that cdecreases with increasing m, which is a general feature of cdm models. themedian and scatter of the c-m relation produced by the flat, concordance lcdmmodel (omega_m=0.3, sigma_8=0.9) agrees with the x-ray data provided the sampleis comprised of the most relaxed, early forming systems, which is consistentwith our selection criteria. holding the rest of the cosmological parametersfixed to those in the concordance model the c-m relation requires 0.76&lt; sigma_8&lt;1.07 (99% conf.), assuming a 10% upward bias in the concentrations for earlyforming systems. the tilted, low-sigma_8 model suggested by a new wmap analysisis rejected at 99.99% confidence, but a model with the same tilt andnormalization can be reconciled with the x-ray data by increasing the darkenergy equation of state parameter to w ~ -0.8. when imposing the additionalconstraint of the tight relation between sigma_8 and omega_m from studies ofcluster abundances, the x-ray c-m relation excludes (&gt;99% conf.) both open cdmmodels and flat cdm models with omega_m ~1. this result provides novel evidencefor a flat, low-omega_m universe with dark energy using observations only inthe local (z &lt;&lt; 1) universe. possible systematic errors in the x-ray massmeasurements of a magnitude ~10% suggested by cdm simulations do not change ourconclusions.

astro-ph;0701431	far infrared spitzer observations of elliptical galaxies: evidence for  extended diffuse dust	far-infrared spitzer observations of elliptical galaxies are inconsistentwith simple steady state models of dust creation in red giant stars anddestruction by grain sputtering in the hot interstellar gas at t ~ 10^7 k. theflux at 24 microns correlates with optical fluxes, suggesting that thisrelatively hot dust is largely circumstellar. but fluxes at 70 and 160 micronsdo not correlate with optical fluxes. elliptical galaxies with similar l_b haveluminosities at 70 and 160 microns (l_70 and l_160) that vary over a factor ~100, implying an additional source of dust unrelated to that produced byongoing local stellar mass loss. neither l_70/l_b nor l_160/l_b correlate withthe stellar age or metallicity. optical line fluxes from warm gas at t ~ 10^4 kcorrelate weakly with l_70 and l_160, suggesting that the dust may beresponsible for cooling this gas. many normal elliptical galaxies have emissionat 70 microns that is extended to 5-10 kpc. extended far-infrared emission withsputtering lifetimes of ~10^8 yrs is difficult to maintain by mergers withgas-rich galaxies. instead, we propose that this cold dust is buoyantlytransported from reservoirs of dust in the galactic cores which is supplied bymass loss from stars in the core. intermittent energy outbursts from agns candrive the buoyant outflow.

astro-ph;0703461	serendipitous xmm-newton discovery of a cluster of galaxies at z=0.28	we report the discovery of a galaxy cluster serendipitously detected as anextended x-ray source in an offset observation of the group ngc 5044. thecluster redshift, z=0.281, determined from the optical spectrum of thebrightest cluster galaxy, agrees with that inferred from the x-ray spectrumusing the fe k alpha complex of the hot icm (z=0.27 +/- 0.01). based on the 50ks xmm observation, we find that within a radius of 383 kpc the cluster has anunabsorbed x-ray flux, f_x (0.5-2 kev) = 3.34 (+0.08, -0.13) x 10^{-13}erg/cm^2/s, a bolometric x-ray luminosity, l_x = 2.21 (+0.34, -0.19) x 10^{44}erg/s, kt = 3.57 +/- 0.12 kev, and metallicity, 0.60 +/- 0.09 solar. thecluster obeys the scaling relations for l_x and t observed at intermediateredshift. the mass derived from an isothermal nfw model fit is, m_vir = 3.89+/- 0.35 x 10^{14} solar masses, with a concentration parameter, c = 6.7 +/-0.4, consistent with the range of values expected in the concordancecosmological model for relaxed clusters. the optical properties suggest thiscould be a ``fossil cluster''.

astro-ph;9706089	self-generated magnetic fields in galactic cooling flows	interstellar magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies are assumed to have theirorigin in stellar fields that accompany normal mass loss from an evolvingpopulation of old stars. the seed fields are amplified by interstellarturbulence driven by stellar mass loss and supernova events. these disorderedfields are further amplified by time-dependent compression in the inward movinggalactic cooling flow and are expected to dominate near the galactic core.under favorable circumstances, fields similar in strength to those observed $b\sim 1-10~(r/10~kpc)^{-1.2}\mu$g can be generated solely from these naturalgalactic processes. in general the interstellar field throughout ellipticalgalaxies is determined by the outermost regions in the interstellar gas wherethe turbulent dynamo process can occur. because of the long hydrodynamic flowtimes in galactic cooling flows, currently observed magnetic fields may resultfrom periods of intense turbulent field amplification that occurred in theouter galaxy in the distant past. particularly strong fields in ellipticals mayresult from ancient galactic mergers or shear turbulence introduced at theboundary between the interstellar gas and ambient cluster gas.

astro-ph;9706276	evolution of interstellar gas in rapidly rotating elliptical galaxies:  formation of disks	we describe the evolution of hot interstellar gas in a family of lowluminosity elliptical galaxies all having $m_b = -20$ but with differentdegrees of flattening (e0, e2, and e6) caused by rotation. the interstellar gasis furnished by stellar mass loss. the soft x-ray luminosity lx of the hotinterstellar gas after 15 gyrs decreases dramatically with galactic rotation.the hot gas cools onto a large disk having a size that depends inversely on theassumed supernova rate. although lx of the hot, rotating interstellar gas maybe difficult to observe, the photoionized part of the cooled gaseous disk gascan be observed in optical line emission. the mass of hii gas ($\sim 10^8$$m_{\odot}$) may be much greater than previously realized since large regionsof rotationally supported, low density hii are optically faint. we interpretthe stellar disks that are common in low luminosity ellipticals as stars thathave formed in the non-ionized part of the cold disk gas. the total mass anddistribution of cold disk gas available for star formation are similar to thoseof stellar disks observed. the high stellar h$\beta$ photometric index observedin disky ellipticals can be understood by combining the light of young diskstellar populations with that of the old bulge population.

astro-ph;9707070	x-ray observations and the structure of elliptical galaxies	we compare optical and high quality x-ray data for three bright ellipticalsin the virgo cluster, ngc 4472, 4649, and 4636. the distribution of total massin ngc 4472 and 4649 determined from x-ray data is sensitive to the stellarmass over a considerable range in galactic radius extending to r = r_e, theeffective radius. the agreement of x-ray and optically-determined stellarmasses provides a unique verification of the stellar mass to light ratio whichis essentially constant over 0.1 &lt; r/r_e &lt; 1. however, dark matter in ngc 4636is important at all radii &gt; 0.35r_e. evidently the dark to stellar mass ratiovaries in quite different ways in ellipticals of comparable optical luminosity,implying the radial structure of dark halos may not be universal. there is someevidence in ngc 4636 for additional support of the hot interstellar gas at r &lt;0.35 r_e; either a field b = 10^{-4} g or a small (but mechanically unstable)central region of high gas temperature (t = 10^7 k) is required. the globaltemperature structure in the hot interstellar medium of many recently observedellipticals is very similar, reaching a maximum near 3 - 4 r_e. this feature,which may suggest a new structural scale, is inconsistent with currenttheoretical gas dynamical models.

astro-ph;9710199	recent x-ray observations and the evolution of hot gas in elliptical  galaxies: evidence for circumgalactic gas	x-ray emitting gaseous halos, such as that in elliptical galaxies like ngc4472, cannot have been produced solely from gas expelled from galactic stars.in traditional models for the evolution of hot interstellar gas (cooling flows)in ellipticals, the galaxies are assumed to have been cleared of gas bysnii-driven winds at some early time then gas is subsequently replenished bymass loss from an evolving population of old stars. to test this, we accuratelydetermine the stellar and dark halo mass of ngc 4472 using hydrostaticequilibrium, then solve the standard time-dependent cooling flow equations torecover the observed hot gas temperature and density distributions when evolvedto the present time. this procedure fails: the computed gas density gradient istoo steep, the total gas mass is too low, and the gas temperatures are much toolow. all variants on this basic procedure also fail: increasing the snia rate,using the mass dropout assumption, arbitrarily adjusting uncertaincoefficients, etc. however, agreement is achieved if the galaxy is suppliedwith additional, spatially-extended hot gas early in its evolution. this old``circumgalactic'' gas can be retained to the present time and may be relatedto cosmological ``secondary infall''.

astro-ph;9711103	hot gas and halos in elliptical galaxies	we review recent progress in understanding the evolution of hot interstellargas in the halos of elliptical galaxies. non-homologous variations in thephysical size of the hot gas account for the large variations of x-rayluminosity among ellipticals of similar l_b. by combining rosat and einsteindata we derive the distribution of total mass in ngc 4472. from 0.1r_e to 1r_ethe total mass is identical to the expected stellar mass. therefore stellarmass to light ratios can be determined from x-ray observations! also the widelyused ``mass dropout'' assumption must be incorrect in this important part ofthe cooling flow. recent rosat observations indicate gas temperatures in excessof the virial stellar temperature, totally unlike standard cooling flow models.however, these new results can be understood if an additional massive componentof ``circumgalactic'' gas is assumed to fill the outer galactic halos beyondmost of the stars. this old hot gas, first heated during the epoch of galaxyformation, continues to flow into the stellar parts of ellipticals today,combining with gas expelled from evolving stars. this dual origin of hotinterstellar gas further complicates recent discussions of abundances in thehot interstellar gas.

astro-ph;9806350	cosmological and environmental influences on hot gas observed in  elliptical galaxies	the variation of temperature and density in the hot, x-ray emitting gasaround massive, group dominant elliptical galaxies can be understood as acombination of gas ejected from evolving galactic stars and gas thataccumulates in the outer halo by secondary cosmic infall. beginning with anoverdensity perturbation in a simple flat cosmology, we can duplicate observedproperties of the hot gas. at some early time we form the stellar galaxy andrelease supernova energy, conserving dark and baryonic matter. using apotential appropriate to the large elliptical ngc 4472, we follow the evolutionof intergalactic and interstellar gas to the present time when the computed gasdensity and temperature agree with x-ray observations of ngc 4472. if the hotgas and dark matter halos are subject to differential tidal truncations or massexchanges between group members, then the correlation between $l_x/l_b$ and therelative sizes of galactic x-ray images can be generated. the physicalproperties of hot interstellar gas observed in bright ellipticals today aresensitive to the cosmic baryon fraction, the time of maximum star formation andthe amount of ``feedback'' energy delivered to the gas by type ii supernovae atthe epoch of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;9808175	evolution of hot gas and dark halos in group-dominant elliptical  galaxies: influence of cosmic inflow	we study the complete dynamical evolution of hot interstellar gas in massiveelliptical galaxies born into a simple flat universe beginning with anoverdense perturbation. within the turn-around radius dark matter flows in aself-similar fashion into a stationary navarro-frenk-white halo and thebaryonic gas shocks. after a few gigayears, when enough gas accumulates withinthe accretion shock, the de vaucouleurs stellar system is constructed and theenergy from type ii supernovae is released. the stars and dark halo are matchedto ngc 4472. gas continues to enter the galaxy by secondary infall and bystellar mass loss based on a salpeter imf. after about 13 gyrs the temperatureand density distribution in the hot gas agree quite well with the hotinterstellar gas observed in ngc 4472. as a result of supernova-driven outflow,the present day baryonic fraction has a deep minimum in the outer galactichalo. when relatively gas-rich, x-ray luminous models are spatially truncatedat early times, simulating tidal events that may have occurred during galaxygroup dynamics, the current locus of truncated models lies just along the$l_x$, x-ray size correlation among well-observed ellipticals, providinganother striking confirmation of our simple model of elliptical evolution.

astro-ph;9811258	a comparison of metal enrichment histories in rich clusters and  individual luminous elliptical galaxies	hot, x-ray emitting gaseous halos around massive elliptical galaxies are aresult of both stellar mass loss and inflow toward the overdensity from whichgiant ellipticals and their associated galaxy groups formed. the metalabundance in this gas contains important information about early star formationand past supernova activity. we find that type ii supernovae based on asalpeter imf, plus a small number of additional type ia supernovae, can explainthe the density, temperature and abundance profiles currently observed ingaseous halos around massive ellipticals. within the central, optically brightregions of luminous ellipticals, approximately half of the interstellar iron isproduced by type ia supernovae and half by mass lost from evolving stars whichwere originally enriched by type ii supernovae. however, iron and siliconabundances in the intracluster gas within rich clusters suggest enrichment by alarger number of supernovae per unit optical light than we require for massiveellipticals, either more type ia or more type ii from a flatter imf. since theenrichment histories of massive ellipticals and rich clusters are fundamentallydifferent, e and so galaxies may not be the only sources of metal enrichment inrich cluster gas.

astro-ph;9907364	formation of low mass stars in elliptical galaxy cooling flows	x-ray emission from hot (t = 10^7 k) interstellar gas in massive ellipticalgalaxies indicates that 10^{10} m_sun has cooled over a hubble time, butoptical and radio evidence for this cold gas is lacking. we provide detailedtheoretical support for the hypothesis that this gas has formed into lowluminosity stars. within several kpc of the galactic center, interstellar gasfirst cools to t = 10^4 k where it is heated by stellar uv and emits theobserved diffuse optical line emission. this cooling occurs at a large number(10^6) of isolated sites. after less than a solar mass of gas has accumulated(10^{-6} m_sun/yr) at a typical cooling site, a neutral (hi or h_2) coredevelops in the hii cloud where gas temperatures drop to t = 15 k and theionization level (from thermal x-rays) is very low (x = 10^{-6}). we show thatthe maximum mass of cores that become gravitationally unstable is only about 2m_sun. no star can exceed this mass. fragmentation of collapsing cores producesa population of low mass stars with a bottom-heavy imf and radial orbits.gravitational collapse and ambipolar diffusion are rapid. the total mass ofstar-forming (dust-free) hi or h_2 cores in a typical bright elliptical is only10^6 m_sun, below current observational thresholds.

0812.2594	evidence of star formation in local s0 galaxies: spitzer observations of  the sauron sample	we discuss infrared spitzer observations of early type galaxies in the sauronsample at 24, 60 and 170 microns. when compared with 2mass ks bandluminosities, lenticular (s0) galaxies exhibit a much wider range of mid tofar-infrared luminosities then elliptical (e) galaxies. mid and far-infraredemission from e galaxies is a combination of circumstellar or interstellaremission from local mass-losing red giant stars, dust buoyantly transportedfrom the galactic cores into distant hot interstellar gas and dust accretedfrom the environment. the source of mid and far-ir emission in s0 galaxies isquite different and is consistent with low levels of star formation, 0.02 - 0.2msol/yr, in cold, dusty gaseous disks. the infrared 24micron-70micron color issystematically lower for (mostly s0) galaxies with known molecular disks. ourobservations support the conjecture that cold dusty gas in some s0 galaxies iscreated by stellar mass loss at approximately the same rate that it is consumedby star formation, so the mass depletion of these disks by star formation willbe slow. unlike e galaxies, the infrared luminosities of s0 galaxies correlatewith both the mass of molecular gas and the stellar hbeta spectral index, andall are related to the recent star formation rate. however, star formationrates estimated from the hbeta emission line luminosities l_{hbeta} in saurons0 galaxies are generally much smaller. since l_{hbeta} does not correlate with24 microns emission from dust heated by young stars, optical emission linesappear to be a poor indicator of star formation rates in sauron s0 galaxies.the absence of hbeta emission may be due to a relative absence of ob stars inthe initial mass function or to dust absorption of hbeta emission lines.
