0901.2001	aski: full-sky lensing map making algorithms	within the context of upcoming full-sky lensing surveys, the edge-preservingnon- linear algorithm aski is presented. using the framework of maximum aposteriori inversion, it aims at recovering the full-sky convergence map fromsurveys with masks. it proceeds in two steps: ccd images of crowded galacticfields are deblurred using automated edge-preserving deconvolution; once thereduced shear is estimated, the convergence map is also inverted via an edge-preserving method. for the deblurring, it is found that when the observed fieldis crowded, this gain can be quite significant for realistic ground-basedsurveys when both positivity and edge-preserving penalties are imposed duringthe iterative deconvolution. for the convergence inversion, the quality of thereconstruction is investigated on noisy maps derived from the horizon n-bodysimulation, with and without galactic cuts, and quantified using one-pointstatistics, power spectra, cluster counts, peak patches and the skeleton. it isfound that the reconstruction is able to interpolate and extrapolate within thegalactic cuts/non-uniform noise; its sharpness-preserving penalization avoidsstrong biasing near the clusters of the map; it reconstructs well the shape ofthe pdf as traced by its skewness and kurtosis; the geometry and topology ofthe reconstructed map is close to the initial map as traced by the peak patchdistribution and the skeleton's differential length; the two-points statisticsof the recovered map is consistent with the corresponding smoothed version ofthe initial map; the distribution of point sources is also consistent with thecorresponding smoothing, with a significant improvement when edge preservingprior is applied. the contamination of b-modes when realistic galactic cuts arepresent is also investigated. leakage mainly occurs on large scales.

0902.0679	building merger trees from cosmological n-body simulations	although a fair amount of work has been devoted to growing monte-carlo mergertrees which resemble those built from an n-body simulation, comparativelylittle effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarilyencounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation. to somewhatrevert the tide, this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensivestudy of the problems one faces when following this route. the first step tobuilding merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is toidentify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced bythe simulation. even though we discuss a particular implementation of such analgorithm (called adaptahop) in this paper, we believe that our results do notdepend on the exact details of the implementation but extend to most if not all(sub)structure finders. we then highlight different ways to build mergerhistories from adaptahop haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their variousadvantages and drawbacks. we find that the best approach to (sub)halo merginghistories is through an analysis that goes back and forth betweenidentification and tree building rather than one which conducts astraightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. this is rooted in thecomplexity of the merging trees which have to depict an inherently dynamicalprocess from the partial temporal information contained in the collection ofinstantaneous snapshots available from the n-body simulation.

0905.2615	the effect of baryons on the variance and the skewness of the mass  distribution in the universe at small scales	we study the dissipative effects of baryon physics on cosmic statistics atsmall scales using a cosmological simulation of a (50 mpc/h)^3 volume of theuniverse. the marenostrum simulation was performed using the amr code ramses,and includes most of the physical ingredients which are part of the currenttheory of galaxy formation, such as metal-dependent cooling and uv heating,subgrid modelling of the ism, star formation and supernova feedback. we re-ranthe same initial conditions for a dark matter only universe, as a referencepoint for baryon-free cosmic statistics. in this paper, we present the measuredsmall-scale amplification of sigma^2 and s_3 due to baryonic physics and theirinterpretation in the framework of the halo model. as shown in recent studies,the effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum can be accounted for atscales k &lt;~ 10 h/mpc by modifying the halo concentration parameter. we proposeto extend this result by using a halo profile which is a linear combination ofa nfw profile for the dark matter and an exponential disk profile mimicking thebaryonic component at the heart of the halo. this halo profile form isphysically motivated, and depends on two parameters, the mass fraction f_d ofbaryons in the disk, and the ratio lambda_d of the disk's characteristic scaleto the halo's virial radius. we find this composite profile to reproduce boththe small-scale variance and skewness boosts measured in the simulation up to k~ 10^2 h/mpc for physically meaningful values of the parameters f_d andlambda_d. although simulations like the one presented here usually suffer fromvarious problems when compared to observations, our modified halo model couldbe used as a fitting model to improve the determination of cosmologicalparameters from weak lensing convergence spectra and skewness measurements.

0912.0376	the dusty, albeit ultraviolet bright infancy of galaxies	the largest galaxies acquire their mass early on, when the universe is stillyouthful. cold streams violently feed these young galaxies a vast amount offresh gas, resulting in very efficient star formation. using a well resolvedhydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation, we demonstrate that thesemammoth galaxies are already in place a couple of billion years after the bigbang. contrary to local starforming galaxies, where dust re-emits a large partof the stellar ultraviolet (uv) light at infrared and sub-millimetrewavelengths, our self-consistent modelling of dust extinction predicts that asubstantial fraction of uv photons should escape from primordial galaxies. sucha model allows us to compute reliably the number of high redshift objects as afunction of luminosity, and yields galaxies whose uv luminosities closely matchthose measured in the deepest observational surveys available. this agreementis remarkably good considering our admittedly still simple modelling of theinterstellar medium (ism) physics. the luminosity functions (lf) of virtual uvluminous galaxies coincide with the existing data over the whole redshift rangefrom 4 to 7, provided cosmological parameters are set to their currentlyfavoured values. despite their considerable emission at short wavelengths, weanticipate that the counterparts of the brightest uv galaxies will be detectedby future sub-millimetre facilities like alma

0707.3123	the three dimensional skeleton: tracing the filamentary structure of the  universe	the skeleton formalism aims at extracting and quantifying the filamentarystructure of the universe is generalized to 3d density fields; a numericalmethod for computating a local approximation of the skeleton is presented andvalidated here on gaussian random fields. this method manages to trace well thefilamentary structure in 3d fields such as given by numerical simulations ofthe dark matter distribution on large scales and is insensitive to monotonicbiasing. two of its characteristics, namely its length and differential length,are analyzed for gaussian random fields. its differential length per unitnormalized density contrast scales like the pdf of the underlying densitycontrast times the total length times a quadratic edgeworth correctioninvolving the square of the spectral parameter. the total length scales likethe inverse square smoothing length, with a scaling factor given by 0.21 (5.28+n) where n is the power index of the underlying field. this dependency impliesthat the total length can be used to constrain the shape of the underlyingpower spectrum, hence the cosmology. possible applications of the skeleton togalaxy formation and cosmology are discussed. as an illustration, theorientation of the spin of dark halos and the orientation of the flow near theskeleton is computed for dark matter simulations. the flow is laminar along thefilaments, while spins of dark halos within 500 kpc of the skeleton arepreferentially orthogonal to the direction of the flow at a level of 25%.

0707.3483	observational biases in lagrangian reconstructions of cosmic velocity  fields	lagrangian reconstruction of large-scale peculiar velocity fields can bestrongly affected by observational biases. we develop a thorough analysis ofthese systematic effects by relying on specially selected mock catalogues. forthe purpose of this paper, we use the mak reconstruction method, although anyother lagrangian reconstruction method should be sensitive to the sameproblems. we extensively study the uncertainty in the mass-to-light assignmentdue to luminosity incompleteness, and the poorly-determined relation betweenmass and luminosity. the impact of redshift distortion corrections is analyzedin the context of mak and we check the importance of edge and finite-volumeeffects on the reconstructed velocities. using three mock catalogues withdifferent average densities, we also study the effect of cosmic variance. inparticular, one of them presents the same global features as found inobservational catalogues that extend to 80 mpc/h scales. we give recipes,checked using the aforementioned mock catalogues, to handle these particularobservational effects, after having introduced them into the mock catalogues soas to quantitatively mimic the most densely sampled currently available galaxycatalogue of the nearby universe. once biases have been taken care of, thetypical resulting error in reconstructed velocities is typically about aquarter of the overall velocity dispersion, and without significant bias. wefinally model our reconstruction errors to propose an improved bayesianapproach to measure omega_m in an unbiased way by comparing the reconstructedvelocities to the measured ones in distance space, even though they may beplagued by large errors. we show that, in the context of observational data, anearly unbiased estimator of omega_m may be built using mak reconstruction.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1101.2048	planck early results. vi. the high frequency instrument data processing	we describe the processing of the 336 billion raw data samples from the highfrequency instrument (hfi) which we performed to produce six temperature mapsfrom the first 295 days of planck-hfi survey data. these maps provide anaccurate rendition of the sky emission at 100, 143, 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghzwith an angular resolution ranging from 9.9 to 4.4^2. the white noise level isaround 1.5 {\mu}k degree or less in the 3 main cmb channels (100--217ghz). thephotometric accuracy is better than 2% at frequencies between 100 and 353 ghzand around 7% at the two highest frequencies. the maps created by the hfi dataprocessing centre reach our goals in terms of sensitivity, resolution, andphotometric accuracy. they are already sufficiently accurate andwell-characterised to allow scientific analyses which are presented in anaccompanying series of early papers. at this stage, hfi data appears to be ofhigh quality and we expect that with further refinements of the data processingwe should be able to achieve, or exceed, the science goals of the planckproject.

1102.5707	extreme value statistics of smooth random gaussian fields	we consider the gumbel or extreme value statistics describing thedistribution function p_g(x_max) of the maximum values of a random field xwithin patches of fixed size. we present, for smooth gaussian random fields intwo and three dimensions, an analytical estimate of p_g which is expected tohold in a regime where local maxima of the field are moderately high and weaklyclustered. when the patch size becomes sufficiently large, the negative of thelogarithm of the cumulative extreme value distribution is simply equal to theaverage of the euler characteristic of the field in the excursion x &gt; x_maxinside the patches. the gumbel statistics therefore represents an interestingalternative probe of the genus as a test of non gaussianity, e.g. in cosmicmicrowave background temperature maps or in three-dimensional galaxy catalogs.it can be approximated, except in the remote positive tail, by a negativeweibull type form, converging slowly to the expected gumbel type form forinfinitely large patch size. convergence is facilitated when large scalecorrelations are weaker. we compare the analytic predictions to numericalexperiments for the case of a scale-free gaussian field in two dimensions,achieving impressive agreement between approximate theory and measurements. wealso discuss the generalization of our formalism to non-gaussian fields.

1110.3193	euclid definition study report	euclid is a space-based survey mission from the european space agencydesigned to understand the origin of the universe's accelerating expansion. itwill use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, darkmatter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometryof the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. the missionis optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: weakgravitational lensing (wl) and baryonic acoustic oscillations (bao). the euclidpayload consists of a 1.2 m korsch telescope designed to provide a large fieldof view. it carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of ~0.54 deg2:the visual imager (vis) and the near infrared instrument (nisp) which containsa slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. the euclid wide surveywill cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20deg2 deep fields. for wl, euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxiesper arcmin2 in one broad visible r+i+z band (550-920 nm). the photometricredshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) &lt; 0.05. they arederived from three additional euclid nir bands (y, j, h in the range 0.92-2.0micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived frompublic data or through engaged collaborations. the bao are determined from aspectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. the slitlessspectrometer, with spectral resolution ~250, predominantly detects ha emissionline galaxies. euclid is a medium class mission of the esa cosmic vision2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. this report (alsoknown as the euclid red book) describes the outcome of the phase a study.

1204.1318	planck intermediate results ii: comparison of sunyaev-zeldovich  measurements from planck and from the arcminute microkelvin imager for 11  galaxy clusters	a comparison is presented of sunyaev-zeldovich measurements for 11 galaxyclusters as obtained by planck and by the ground-based interferometer, thearcminute microkelvin imager. assuming a universal spherically-symmetricgeneralised navarro, frenk &amp; white (gnfw) model for the cluster gas pressureprofile, we jointly constrain the integrated compton-y parameter (y_500) andthe scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. our resulting constraints in they_500-theta_500 2d parameter space derived from the two instruments overlapsignificantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendencyfor ami to find the sunyaev-zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size andfainter than planck. significant discrepancies exist for the three remainingclusters in the sample, namely a1413, a1914, and the newly-discovered planckcluster plckesz g139.59+24.18. the robustness of the analysis of both theplanck and ami data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,which also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and fromdiffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for thediscrepancies found. for a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigatedthe dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating theanalysis adopting the best-fitting gnfw profile shape which best matches x-rayobservations. adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the x-ray data doesnot, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of fiveclusters. though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adoptedgnfw model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.

1207.4009	planck intermediate results. vi: the dynamical structure of  plckg214.6+37.0, a planck discovered triple system of galaxy clusters	the survey of galaxy clusters performed by planck through thesunyaev-zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. one of the sz candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,plckg214.6+37.0, was later revealed by xmm-newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. we have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepxmm-newton re-observation. the characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal sz signal of this system with planck data. we partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected sz signal from x-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. we measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the x-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess x-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1301.5839	planck intermediate results. xii: diffuse galactic components in the  gould belt system	we perform an analysis of the diffuse low-frequency galactic components inthe southern part of the gould belt system (130^\circ\leq l\leq 230^\circ and-50^\circ\leq b\leq -10^\circ). strong ultra-violet (uv) flux coming from thegould belt super-association is responsible for bright diffuse foregrounds thatwe observe from our position inside the system and that can help us improve ourknowledge of the galactic emission. free-free emission and anomalous microwaveemission (ame) are the dominant components at low frequencies (\nu &lt; 40 ghz),while synchrotron emission is very smooth and faint. we separate diffusefree-free emission and ame from synchrotron emission and thermal dust emissionby using planck data, complemented by ancillary data, using the "correlatedcomponent analysis" (cca) component separation method and we compare with theresults of cross-correlation of foreground templates with the frequency maps.we estimate the electron temperature t_e from h$\alpha$ and free-free emissionusing two methods (temperature-temperature plot and cross-correlation) and weobtain t_e ranging from 3100 to 5200 k, for an effective fraction of absorbingdust along the line of sight of 30% (f_d=0.3). we estimate the frequencyspectrum of the diffuse ame and we recover a peak frequency (in flux densityunits) of 25.5 \pm 1.5 ghz. we verify the reliability of this result withrealistic simulations that include the presence of biases in the spectral modelfor the ame and in the free-free template. by combining physical models forvibrational and rotational dust emission and adding the constraints from thethermal dust spectrum from planck and iras we are able to get a gooddescription of the frequency spectrum of the ame for plausible values of thelocal density and radiation field.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1303.5090	planck intermediate results. xiii. constraints on peculiar velocities	using \planck\ data combined with the meta catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc), we address the study of peculiar motions bysearching for evidence of the kinetic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). byimplementing various filters designed to extract the ksz generated at thepositions of the clusters, we obtain consistent constraints on the radialpeculiar velocity average, root mean square (rms), and local bulk flowamplitude at different depths. for the whole cluster sample of average redshift0.18, the measured average radial peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation at that redshift, i.e., the ksz monopole,amounts to $72 \pm 60$ km s$^{-1}$. this constitutes less than 1% of therelative hubble velocity of the cluster sample with respect to our local cmbframe. while the linear $\lambda$cdm prediction for the typical cluster radialvelocity rms at $z=0.15$ is close to 230km s$^{-1}$, the upper limit imposed by\planck\ data on the cluster subsample corresponds to 800 km s$^{-1}$ at 95%confidence level, i.e., about three times higher. \planck\ data also set strongconstraints on the local bulk flow in volumes centred on the local group. thereis no detection of bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending tothe maximum redshift covered by the cluster sample. a blind search for bulkflows in this sample has an upper limit of 254 km s$^{-1}$ (95% confidencelevel) dominated by cmb confusion and instrumental noise, indicating that theuniverse is largely homogeneous on gpc scales. in this context, in conjunctionwith supernova observations, \planck\ is able to rule out a large class ofinhomogeneous void models as alternatives to dark energy or modified gravity.the \planck\ constraints on peculiar velocities and bulk flows are thusconsistent with the $\lambda$cdm scenario.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

0801.4335	recovering the topology of the igm at z~2	we investigate how well the 3d density field of neutral hydrogen in theintergalactic medium (igm) can be reconstructed using the lyman-alphaabsorptions observed along lines of sight to quasars separated by arcmindistances in projection on the sky. we use cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations to compare the topologies of different fields: dark matter, gas andneutral hydrogen optical depth and to investigate how well the topology of theigm can be recovered from the wiener interpolation method implemented by pichonet al. (2001). the global statistical and topological properties of therecovered field are analyzed quantitatively through the power-spectrum, theprobability distribution function (pdf), the euler characteristics, itsassociated critical point counts and the filling factor of underdense regions.the local geometrical properties of the field are analysed using the localskeleton by defining the concept of inter-skeleton distance. at scales largerthan ~1.4 &lt;d_los&gt;, where &lt;d_los&gt; is the mean separation between lines of sight,the reconstruction accurately recovers the topological features of the largescale density distribution of the gas, in particular the filamentarystructures. at scales larger than the intrinsic smoothing length of theinversion procedure, the power spectrum of the recovered hi density fieldmatches well that of the original one and the low order moments of the pdf arewell recovered as well as the shape of the euler characteristic. the integralerrors on the pdf and the critical point counts are indeed small, less than 20%for &lt;d_los&gt;~2.5 arcmin. the small deviations between the reconstruction and theexact solution mainly reflect departures from the log-normal behaviour that areascribed to highly non-linear objects in overdense regions.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1411.4983	probing the galaxy-halo connection in ultravista to $z\sim2$	we use percent-level precision photometric redshifts in the ultravista-dr1near-infrared survey to investigate the changing relationship be- tween galaxystellar mass and the dark matter haloes hosting them to $z\sim2$. we achievethis by measuring the clustering properties and abundances of a series ofvolume-limited galaxy samples selected by stellar mass and star-formationactivity. we interpret these results in the framework of a phenomenologicalhalo model and numerical simulations. our measurements span a uniquely largerange in stellar mass and redshift and reach below the characteristic stellarmass to $z\sim2$. our results are: 1. at fixed redshift and scale, clusteringamplitude depends monotonically on sample stellar mass threshold; 2. at fixedangular scale, the projected clustering amplitude decreases with redshift butthe co-moving correlation length remains constant; 3. characteristic halomasses and galaxy bias increase with increasing median stellar mass of thesample; 4. the slope of these relationships is modified in lower mass haloes;5. concerning the passive galaxy population, characteristic halo masses areconsistent with a simply less-abundant version of the full galaxy sample, butat lower redshifts the fraction of satellite galaxies in the passive populationis very different from the full galaxy sample; 6. finally we find that theratio between the characteristic halo mass and median stellar mass at eachredshift bin reaches a peak at ${\log(m_h/m_\odot)}\sim12.2$ and the positionof this peak remains constant out to $z\sim2$. the behaviour of the full andpassively evolving galaxy samples can be understood qualitatively byconsidering the slow evolution of the characteristic stellar mass in theredshift range probed by our survey.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1502.01584	planck 2015 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions, and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). the structure of the paper is similar to that presented inthe 2013 planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalizationand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on measurements performedduring observations of jupiter. by stacking data from seven jupiter transits,the main beam profiles are measured down to -25 db at 30 and 44 ghz, and downto -30 db at 70 ghz. it has been confirmed that the agreement between thesimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequencyband (within the 20 db contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and70 ghz; 0.2% at 44 ghz). simulated polarized beams are used for the computationof the effective beam window functions. the error budget for the windowfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, andaccounts for the radiometer band shapes. the total uncertainties in theeffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively(at $\ell \approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 ghz (at $\ell \approx 1000$).

1502.01586	planck 2015 results. vii. hfi toi and beam processing	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) has observed the full sky at sixfrequencies (100, 143, 217, 353, 545, and 857 ghz) in intensity and at fourfrequencies in linear polarization (100, 143, 217, and 353 ghz). in order toobtain sky maps, the time-ordered information (toi) containing the detector andpointing samples must be processed and the angular response must be assessed.the full mission toi is included in the planck 2015 release. this paperdescribes the hfi toi and beam processing for the 2015 release. hfi calibrationand map-making are described in a companion paper. the main pipeline has beenmodified since the last release (2013 nominal mission in intensity only), byincluding a correction for the non-linearity of the warm readout and byimproving the model of the bolometer time response. the beam processing is anessential tool that derives the angular response used in all the planck sciencepapers and we report an improvement in the effective beam window functionuncertainty of more than a factor 10 relative to the 2013 release. noisecorrelations introduced by pipeline filtering function are assessed usingdedicated simulations. angular cross-power spectra using datasets that aredecorrelated in time are immune to the main systematic effects.

1502.01587	planck 2015 results. viii. high frequency instrument data processing:  calibration and maps	this paper describes the processing applied to the planck high frequencyinstrument (hfi) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometricallycalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. thedata from the entire 2.5 year hfi mission include almost five independentfull-sky surveys. hfi observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from100 to 857 ghz. to obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such alarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. the545 and 857 ghz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmosphericemission. the lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 ghz) are calibrated using thetime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the"orbital dipole". this source of calibration only depends on the satellitevelocity with respect to the solar system. using a cmb temperature of 2.7255+/- 0.0006 k, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the cmbsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \mu k) which is approximatively 1\sigma\ higherthan the wmap measurement with a direction that is consistent between bothexperiments. we describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity andlinear polarization from the hfi timelines, and the scheme used to set the zerolevel of the maps a posteriori. we also summarize the noise characteristics ofthe hfi maps in the 2015 planck data release and present some null tests toassess their quality. finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and inparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors thatleads to spurious polarization signal.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01595	planck 2015 results. xxi. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	this paper presents a study of the isw effect from the planck 2015temperature and polarization data release. the cmb is cross-correlated withdifferent lss tracers: the nvss, sdss and wise catalogues, and the planck 2015convergence lensing map. this cross-correlation yields a detection at$4\,\sigma$, where most of the signal-to-noise is due to the planck lensing andnvss. in fact, the isw effect is detected only from the planck data (throughthe isw-lensing bispectrum) at $\approx 3\,\sigma$, which is similar to thedetection level achieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming fromall the catalogues. this cross-correlation analysis is performed only with theplanck temperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015release do not permit significant improvement of the cmb-lss cross-correlationdetectability. nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalouslylarge isw signal previously reported through the aperture photometry on stackedcmb features at the locations of known superstructures, which is in conflictwith $\lambda$cdm expectations. we find that the current planck polarizationdata do not reject that this signal could be caused by the isw effect. inaddition, the stacking of the planck lensing map on the superstructures'locations exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scalestructures. finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the iswtemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all thepreviously mentioned lss tracers. in particular, we construct a map of the iswsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained fromsimulations. we also explore the reconstruction of the isw anisotropies causedby the lss traced by the 2mpz survey, by directly inverting the density fieldinto the gravitational potential field.

1502.01597	planck 2015 results. xxiv. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  counts	we present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from theplanck full mission data set. our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detectedvia their sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, andis more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 planck cluster cosmologysample. the counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatibleconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. taking advantage of thelarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution inredshift and signal-to-noise. we use mass estimates from two recent studies ofgravitational lensing of background galaxies by planck clusters to providepriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $1-b$. in addition, we use lensing ofcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations by planck clustersas a third independent constraint on this parameter. these various calibrationsimply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations invarying degrees of tension with those coming from planck analysis of primaryfluctuations in the cmb; for the lowest estimated values of $1-b$ the tensionis mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largestestimated value it remains substantial. we also examine constraints onextensions to the base flat $\lambda cdm$ model by combining the cluster andcmb constraints. the combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because itsimultaneously lowers the implied value of the hubble parameter, therebyexacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates.improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-levelto 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide astringent test of the base $\lambda cdm$ model.

1502.01599	planck 2015 results. xxviii. the planck catalogue of galactic cold  clumps	we present the planck catalogue of galactic cold clumps (pgcc), an all-skycatalogue of galactic cold clump candidates detected by planck. this catalogueis the full version of the early cold core (ecc) catalogue, which was madeavailable in 2011 with the early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) andcontained 915 high s/n sources. it is based on the planck 48 months missiondata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. the pgcccatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of galactic coldsources. the three highest planck bands (857, 545, 353 ghz) have been combinedwith iras data at 3 thz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sourcescolder than their local environment. after rejection of possible extragalacticcontaminants, the pgcc catalogue contains 13188 galactic sources spread acrossthe whole sky, i.e., from the galactic plane to high latitudes, following thespatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. the mediantemperature of pgcc sources lies between 13 and 14.5 k, depending on thequality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8to 20 k after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. usingseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as theirmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. the pgcc sources are locatedmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards thegalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.because of this diversity and because the pgcc catalogue contains sources invery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate theevolution from molecular clouds to cores. finally, the catalogue also includes54 additional sources located in the smc and lmc.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1504.07337	vlasov versus n-body: the h\'enon sphere	we perform a detailed comparison of the phase-space density traced by theparticle distribution in gadget simulations to the result obtained with aspherical vlasov solver using the splitting algorithm. the systems consideredare apodized h\'enon spheres with two values of the virial ratio, r ~ 0.1 and0.5. after checking that spherical symmetry is well preserved by the n-bodysimulations, visual and quantitative comparisons are performed. in particularwe introduce new statistics, correlators and entropic estimators, based on thelikelihood of whether n-body simulations actually trace randomly the vlasovphase-space density. when taking into account the limits of both the n-body andthe vlasov codes, namely collective effects due to the particle shot noise inthe first case and diffusion and possible nonlinear instabilities due to finiteresolution of the phase-space grid in the second case, we find a spectacularagreement between both methods, even in regions of phase-space where nontrivialphysical instabilities develop. however, in the colder case, r=0.1, it was notpossible to prove actual numerical convergence of the n-body results after anumber of dynamical times, even with n=10$^8$ particles.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1512.02882	planck intermediate results. xli. a map of lensing-induced b-modes	the lensing-induced $b$-mode signal is a valuable probe of the dark matterdistribution integrated back to the last-scattering surface, with a broadkernel that peaks at $z\simeq2$. it also constitutes an important contaminantfor the extraction of the primary cmb $b$-modes from inflation. combiningall-sky coverage and high resolution and sensitivity, planck provides accuratenearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization $e$-mode signal and theintegrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the cmb gravitationallensing. by combining these two data products, we have produced an all-skytemplate map of the secondary cmb $b$-modes using a real-space algorithm thatminimizes the impact of sky masks. the cross-correlation of this template withan observed (primordial and secondary) $b$-mode map can be used to measure thelensing $b$-mode power spectrum at all angular scales. in particular whencross-correlating with the $b$-mode contribution directly derived from theplanck polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced $b$-mode power spectrummeasurements at a significance of $12\,\sigma$, which are in agreement with thetheoretical expectation derived from the \planck\ best-fit $\lambda$cdm model.this unique nearly all-sky secondary $b$-mode template, which includes thelensing-induced information from intermediate to small ($10\lesssim\ell\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is delivered as part of the planck 2015public data release. it will be particularly useful for experiments searchingfor primordial $b$-modes, such as bicep2/keck array or litebird, since it willenable an estimate to be made of the secondary (i.e., lensing) contribution tothe measured total cmb $b$-modes.

astro-ph;0105196	inversion of the lyman-$\alpha$ forest: 3d investigation of the  intergalactic medium	we discuss the implementation of bayesian inversion methods in order torecover the properties of the intergalactic medium from observations of theneutral hydrogen lyman-$\alpha$ absorptions observed in the spectra of highredshift quasars (the so-called lyman-$\alpha$ forest). we use twocomplementary schemes (i) a constrained gaussian random field linear approachand (ii) a more general non-linear explicit bayesian deconvolution method whichoffers in particular the possibility to constrain the parameters of theequation of state for the gas. while relying on prior assumption for thetwo-point correlation functions, we show how to recover, at leastqualitatively, the 3d topology of the large scale structures in redshift spaceby inverting a suitable network of adjacent, low resolution lines of sight. wealso discuss the inversion of single lines of sight observed at high spectralresolution. our preliminary investigations suggest that the explicit bayesianmethod can be used to derive quantitative information on the physical state ofthe gas. redshift distortion is considered by simultaneous constrainedreconstruction of the velocity and the density field in real space whileassuming statistical correlation between the two fields. the method seems towork well in the strong prior regime where peculiar velocities are assumed tobe the most likely realization in the density field. finally, we investigatethe effect of line of sight separation and number of lines of sight. ouranalyses suggest that multiple low resolution lines of sight could be used toimprove most likely velocity reconstruction on a high resolution line of sight.

astro-ph;0107383	fast clustering analysis of inhomogeneous megapixel cmb maps	szapudi et al (2001) introduced the method of estimating angular powerspectrum of the cmb sky via heuristically weighted correlation functions. partof the new technique is that all (co)variances are evaluated by massive montecarlo simulations, therefore a fast way to measure correlation functions in ahigh resolution map is essential. this letter presents a new algorithm tocalculate pixel space correlation functions via fast spherical harmonicstransforms. our present implementation of the idea extracts correlations from amap-like cmb map (healpix resolution of 512, i.e. $ \simeq 3 \times 10^6$pixels) in about 5 minutes on a 500mhz computer, including $c_\ell$ inversion;the analysis of one planck-like map takes less then one hour. we use heuristicwindow and noise weighting in pixel space, and include the possibility ofadditional signal weighting as well, either in $\ell$ or pixel space. we applythe new code to an ensemble of map simulations, to test the response of ourmethod to the inhomogenous sky coverage/noise of map. we show that theresulting $c_\ell$'s are very close to the theoretical expectations. thehealpix based implementation of the method, spice (spatially inhomogenouscorrelation estimator) will be available to the public from the authors.

astro-ph;0109453	measuring the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble deep field  south	we present an analysis of the evolution of galaxy clustering in the redshiftinterval 0&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hdf-s. the hst optical data are combined with infraredisaac/vlt observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxiesbrighter than i_ab&lt;27.5. the clustering signal is obtained in differentredshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses thebest redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes intoaccount the redshift probability function of each object. this second methodmakes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals wherecontamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. with bothmethods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the hdf-s isconsistent with the previous results in the hdf-n. while at redshift lower thanz~1 the hdf galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b&lt;1) with respect to theunderlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,depending on the cosmological model. these results support previous claimsthat, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. the impact of cosmicerrors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in theclustering measurements in the hdf surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noisein most regimes. future observations with instruments like the acs on hst willimprove the s/n by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of theerrors will be required. in fact, pure shot-noise will give a smallercontribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volumeeffects or non-poissonian discreteness effects.

astro-ph;0302145	the correlation of the lyman-alpha forest in close pairs and groups of  high-redshift quasars: clustering of matter on scales 1-5 mpc	we study the clustering of matter in the intergalactic medium from thelyman-alpha forests seen in the spectra of pairs or groups of z ~ 2 quasarsobserved with fors2 and uves at the vlt-ut2 kueyen eso telescope. the sampleconsists of five pairs with separations 0.6, 1, 2.1, 2.6 and 4.4 arcmin and agroup of four quasars with separations from 2 up to 10 arcmin. thisunprecedented data set allows us to measure the transverse flux correlationfunction for a range of angular scales. correlations are clearly detectable atseparations smaller than 3 arcmin. the shape and correlation length of thetransverse correlation function on these scales is in good agreement with thoseexpected from absorption by the photoionized warm intergalactic mediumassociated with the filamentary and sheet-like structures predicted in cdm-likemodels for structure formation. at larger separation no significant correlationis detected. assuming that the absorbing structures are randomly orientatedwith respect to the line of sight, the comparison of transverse andlongitudinal correlation lengths constrains the cosmological parameters (as amodified version of the alcock &amp; paczy\'nski test). the present sample is toosmall to get significant constraints. using n-body simulations, we investigatethe possibility to constrain ol from future larger samples of qso pairs withsimilar separations. the observation of a sample of 30 pairs at 2, 4.5 and 7.5arcmin should constrain the value of ol at +- 15 % (2 sigma level). we furtheruse the observed spectra of the group of four quasars, to search for underdenseregions in the intergalactic medium. we find a quasi-spherical structure ofreduced absorption with radius 12.5 h^{-1} mpc which we identify as anunderdense region.

astro-ph;0406617	a cloudy vlasov solution	we propose to integrate the vlasov-poisson equations giving the evolution ofa dynamical system in phase-space using a continuous set of local basisfunctions. in practice, the method decomposes the density in phase-space intosmall smooth units having compact support. we call these small units ``clouds''and choose them to be gaussians of elliptical support. fortunately, theevolution of these clouds in the local potential has an analytical solution,that can be used to evolve the whole system during a significant fraction ofdynamical time. in the process, the clouds, initially round, change shape andget elongated. at some point, the system needs to be remapped on round cloudsonce again. this remapping can be performed optimally using a small number oflucy iterations. the remapped solution can be evolved again with the cloudmethod, and the process can be iterated a large number of times without showingsignificant diffusion. our numerical experiments show that it is possible tofollow the 2 dimensional phase space distribution during a large number ofdynamical times with excellent accuracy. the main limitation to this accuracyis the finite size of the clouds, which results in coarse graining thestructures smaller than the clouds and induces small aliasing effects at thesescales. however, it is shown in this paper that this method is consistent withan adaptive refinement algorithm which allows one to track the evolution of thefiner structure in phase space. it is also shown that the generalization of thecloud method to the 4 dimensional and the 6 dimensional phase space is quitenatural.

astro-ph;0504394	spectral and morphological properties of quasar hosts in sph simulations  of agn feeding by mergers	we present a method for generating virtual observations fromsmoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (sph) simulations. this method includes stellarpopulation synthesis models and the reprocessing of starlight by dust toproduce realistic galaxy images. we apply this method and simulate the mergingof two identical giant sa galaxies. the merger remnant is an elliptical galaxy.the merger concentrates the gas content of the two galaxies into the nuclearregion. the gas that flows into the nuclear region refuels the central blackholes of the merging galaxies. we follow the refuelling of the black holesduring the merger semi-analytically.  in the simulation presented in this article, the black holes grow from 3 x10^7 to 1.8x 10^8 solar masses, with a peak agn luminosity of m_b ~ -23.7. westudy how the morphological and spectral properties of the system evolve duringthe merger and work out the predictions of this scenario for the properties ofhost galaxies during the active phase. the peak of agn activity coincides withthe merging of the two galactic nuclei and occurs at a stage when the remnantlooks like a lenticular galaxy. the simulation predicts the formation of acircumnuclear starburst ring/dusty torus with an opening angle of 30-40 degreesand made of clouds with n_h=10^24 cm^-2. the average optical depth of the torusis quite high, but the obscuring medium is patchy, so that there still existlines of sight where the agn is visible in a nearly edge-on view. for the samereason, there are lines of sight where the agn is completely obscured in theface-on view.

astro-ph;9406013	perturbative lagrangian approach to gravitational instability	this paper deals with the time evolution in the matter era of perturbationsin friedman-lemaitre models with arbitrary density parameter $\omega$, witheither a zero cosmological constant, $\lambda = 0$, or with a non-zerocosmological constant in a spatially flat universe. unlike the classicaleulerian approach where the density contrast is expanded in a perturbativeseries, this analysis relies instead on a perturbative expansion of particlestrajectories in lagrangian coordinates. this brings a number of advantages overthe classical analysis. in particular, it enables the description of strongerdensity contrasts. indeed the linear term is the famous zel'dovich approximatesolution (1970). we present here a systematic and detailed account of thisapproach. we give analytical results (or fits to numerical results) up to thethird order. we then proceed to explore the link between the lagrangiandescription and statistical measures. we show in particular that lagrangianperturbation theory provides a natural framework to compute the effect ofredshift distortions, using the skewness of the density distribution functionas an example. finally, we show how well the second order theory does ascompared to other approximat- ions in the case of spherically symmetricperturbations. we also compare this second order approximation and zel'dovichsolution to n-body simulations in the description of large-scale structureformation starting from a power law (n=-2) power spectrum of gaussianperturbation. we find that second order theory is both simple and powerful.

astro-ph;9407049	redshift distortions of clustering: a lagrangian approach	we study the effects of peculiar velocities on statistical measures of galaxyclustering. these effects occur when distances to the galaxies are estimatedfrom their redshifts. it is assumed that the clustering pattern results fromthe gravitational instability of initially gaussian, small-amplitudeperturbations of a friedman-lemaitre cosmological model. explicit expressionsare given for an arbitrary density parameter \omega of the model, both when thecosmological constant, \lambda, is zero, and when the model is spatially flat,\omega + \lambda/3h^2 =1. we show how to compute the skewness, or third momentof the density field, in redshift space, and its fourier space counterpart, thebispectrum. we rely on a perturbative expansion of particle trajectories inlagrangian coordinates. this formalism extends to higher orders the zel'dovichfirst order solution (1970). we show that a physically consistent andquantitatively accurate analysis of the growth skewness in redshift space canbe obtained from second-order lagrangian theory. we also study the effects ofspatial smoothing of the evolved density field. we give analytic expressionsfor the gravitationally induced skewness as a function of the power spectrumand of \omega, for a spherical top-hat and a gaussian smoothing filter. wecompare our analytical predictions with measurements performed in numericalsimulations, and find good agreement. these results should then prove useful inanalyzing large scale redshift surveys. in particular, our results, inconjunction with the recent suggestion of fry (1994), may help to break thecoupling between the bias and the cosmological

0809.2423	the fully connected n-dimensional skeleton: probing the evolution of the  cosmic web	a method to compute the full hierarchy of the critical subsets of a densityfield is presented. it is based on a watershed technique and uses a probabilitypropagation scheme to improve the quality of the segmentation by circumventingthe discreteness of the sampling. it can be applied within spaces of arbitrarydimensions and geometry. this recursive segmentation of space yields, for a$d$-dimensional space, a $d-1$ succession of $n$-dimensional subspaces thatfully characterize the topology of the density field. the final 1d manifold ofthe hierarchy is the fully connected network of the primary critical lines ofthe field : the skeleton. it corresponds to the subset of lines linking maximato saddle points, and provides a definition of the filaments that compose thecosmic web as a precise physical object, which makes it possible to compute anyof its properties such as its length, curvature, connectivity etc... when theskeleton extraction is applied to initial conditions of cosmological n-bodysimulations and their present day non linear counterparts, it is shown that thetime evolution of the cosmic web, as traced by the skeleton, is well accountedfor by the zel'dovich approximation. comparing this skeleton to the initialskeleton undergoing the zel'dovich mapping shows that two effects are competingduring the formation of the cosmic web: a general dilation of the largerfilaments that is captured by a simple deformation of the skeleton of theinitial conditions on the one hand, and the shrinking, fusion and disappearanceof the more numerous smaller filaments on the other hand. other applications ofthe n dimensional skeleton and its peak patch hierarchy are discussed.

astro-ph;9610253	extended perturbation theory for the local density distribution function	perturbation theory makes it possible to calculate the probabilitydistribution function (pdf) of the large scale density field in the smallvariance limit. for top hat smoothing and scale-free gaussian initialfluctuations, the result depends only on the linear variance, sigma_linear, andits logarithmic derivative with respect to the filtering scale-(n_linear+3)=dlog sigma_linear^2/dlog l (bernardeau 1994). in this paper, wemeasure the pdf and its low-order moments in scale-free simulations evolvedwell into the nonlinear regime and compare the results with the abovepredictions, assuming that the spectral index and the variance are adjustableparameters, n_eff and sigma_eff=sigma, where sigma is the true, nonlinearvariance. with these additional degrees of freedom, results from perturbationtheory provide a good fit of the pdfs, even in the highly nonlinear regime. thevalue of n_eff is of course equal to n_linear when sigma &lt;&lt; 1, and it decreaseswith increasing sigma. a nearly flat plateau is reached when sigma &gt;&gt; 1. inthis regime, the difference between n_eff and n_linear increases when n_lineardecreases. for initial power-spectra with n_linear=-2,-1,0,+1, we find n_eff ~-9,-3,-1,-0.5 when sigma^2 ~ 100.

astro-ph;9711087	effects of sampling on statistics of large scale structure	the effects of sampling are investigated on measurements of counts-in-cellsin three-dimensional magnitude limited galaxy surveys, with emphasis on momentsof the underlying smooth galaxy density field convolved with a sphericalwindow. a new estimator is proposed for measuring the k-th order moment &lt; rho^k&gt;: the weighted factorial moment f_k[w], corrected for the effects of thevarying selection function.  the cosmic error on the measurement of f_k[w] is computed via the theformalism of szapudi &amp; colombi (1996), which is generalized to includeselection effects. the integral equation for finding the minimum varianceweight is solved numerically, and an intuitive analytical approximation isderived. the resulting estimator is more accurate than the traditional methodof counts-in-cells in volume limited samples, which discards usefulinformation. as a practical example we consider the case of the future sloandigital sky survey.  optimal (sparse) sampling strategies for designing magnitude limited redshiftsurveys are investigated as well. it is found that the optimal strategy dependsgreatly on the statistics and scales considered.  finally we consider the issue of designing the geometry of a catalog, when itcovers only a small fraction of the sky.
