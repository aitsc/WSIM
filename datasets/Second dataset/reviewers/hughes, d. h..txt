0906.4561	an aztec 1.1 mm survey of the goods-n field -- ii. multi-wavelength  identifications and redshift distribution	we present results from a multi-wavelength study of 29 sources (falsedetection probabilities &lt;5%) from a survey of the great observatories originsdeep survey-north field at 1.1mm using the aztec camera. comparing withexisting 850um scuba studies in the field, we examine differences in the sourcepopulations selected at the two wavelengths. the aztec observations uniformlycover the entire survey field to a 1-sigma depth of ~1mjy. searching deep1.4ghz vla, and spitzer 3--24um catalogues, we identify robust counterparts for21 1.1mm sources, and tentative associations for the remaining objects. theredshift distribution of aztec sources is inferred from available spectroscopicand photometric redshifts. we find a median redshift of z=2.7, somewhat higherthan z=2.0 for 850um-selected sources in the same field, and our lowestredshift identification lies at a spectroscopic redshift z=1.1460. we measurethe 850um to 1.1mm colour of our sources and do not find evidence for `850umdropouts', which can be explained by the low-snr of the observations. we alsocombine these observed colours with spectroscopic redshifts to derive the rangeof dust temperatures t, and dust emissivity indices $\beta$ for the sample,concluding that existing estimates t~30k and $\beta$~1.75 are consistent withthese new data.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0909.3299	the aztec/sma interferometric imaging survey of submillimeter-selected  high-redshift galaxies	we present results from a continuing interferometric survey of high-redshiftsubmillimeter galaxies with the submillimeter array, including high-resolution(beam size ~2 arcsec) imaging of eight additional aztec 1.1mm selected sourcesin the cosmos field, for which we obtain six reliable (peak s/n&gt;5 or peak s/n&gt;4with multiwavelength counterparts within the beam) and two moderatesignificance (peak s/n&gt;4) detections. when combined with previous detections,this yields an unbiased sample of millimeter-selected smgs with completeinterferometric followup. with this sample in hand, we (1) empirically confirmthe radio-submillimeter association, (2) examine the submillimeter morphology -including the nature of submillimeter galaxies with multiple radio counterpartsand constraints on the physical scale of the far infrared - of the sample, and(3) find additional evidence for a population of extremely luminous, radio-dimsubmillimeter galaxies that peaks at higher redshift than previous,radio-selected samples. in particular, the presence of such a population ofhigh-redshift sources has important consequences for models of galaxy formation- which struggle to account for such objects even under liberal assumptions -and dust production models given the limited time since the big bang.

0910.1094	akari and blast observations of the cassiopeia a supernova remnant and  surrounding interstellar medium	we use new large area far infrared maps ranging from 65 - 500 micronsobtained with the akari and the balloon-borne large aperture submillimetertelescope (blast) missions to characterize the dust emission toward thecassiopeia a supernova remnant (snr). using the akari high resolution data wefind a new "tepid" dust grain population at a temperature of ~35k and with anestimated mass of 0.06 solar masses. this component is confined to the centralarea of the snr and may represent newly-formed dust in the unshocked supernovaejecta. while the mass of tepid dust that we measure is insufficient by itselfto account for the dust observed at high redshift, it does constitute anadditional dust population to contribute to those previously reported. we fitour maps at 65, 90, 140, 250, 350, and 500 microns to obtain maps of the columndensity and temperature of "cold" dust (near 16 k) distributed throughout theregion. the large column density of cold dust associated with clouds seen inmolecular emission extends continuously from the surrounding interstellarmedium to project on the snr, where the foreground component of the clouds isalso detectable through optical, x-ray, and molecular extinction. at theresolution available here, there is no morphological signature to isolate anycold dust associated only with the snr from this confusing interstellaremission. our fit also recovers the previously detected "hot" dust in theremnant, with characteristic temperature 100 k.

0910.1595	an aztec 1.1-mm survey for ulirgs in the field of the galaxy cluster ms  0451.6-0305	we have undertaken a deep (sigma~1.1 mjy) 1.1-mm survey of the z=0.54 clusterms 0451.6-0305 using the aztec camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope. wedetect 36 sources with s/n&gt;3.5 in the central 0.10 deg^2 and present the aztecmap, catalogue and number counts. we identify counterparts to 18 sources (50%)using radio, mid-infrared, spitzer irac and submillimeter array data. optical,near- and mid-infrared spectral energy distributions are compiled for the 14 ofthese galaxies with detectable counterparts, which are expected to contain alllikely cluster members. we then use photometric redshifts and colour selectionto separate background galaxies from potential cluster members and test thereliability of this technique using archival observations of submillimetregalaxies. we find two potential ms 0451-03 members, which, if they are bothcluster galaxies have a total star-formation rate (sfr) of ~100 solar massesper year -- a significant fraction of the combined sfr of all the othergalaxies in ms 0451-03. we also examine the stacked rest-frame mid-infrared,millimetre and radio emission of cluster members below our aztec detectionlimit and find that the sfrs of mid-ir selected galaxies in the cluster andredshift-matched field populations are comparable. in contrast, the average sfrof the morphologically classified late-type cluster population is ~3 times lessthan the corresponding redshift-matched field galaxies. this suggests thatthese galaxies may be in the process of being transformed on the red-sequenceby the cluster environment. our survey demonstrates that although theenvironment of ms 0451-03 appears to suppress star-formation in late-typegalaxies, it can support active, dust-obscured mid-ir galaxies and potentiallymillimetre-detected lirgs.

0910.3642	the blast 250-micron selected galaxy population in goods-south	we identify and investigate the nature of the 20 brightest 250-micron sourcesdetected by the blast within the central 150 sq. arcmin of the goods-southfield. aided by the available deep vla radio imaging, reaching s_1.4 = 30micro-jy, we have identified radio counterparts for 17/20 of the 250-micronsources. the resulting enhanced positional accuracy of ~1 arcsec has thenallowed us to exploit the deep multi-frequency imaging of goods-south toestablish secure galaxy counterparts for the 17 radio-identified sources, andplausible galaxy candidates for the 3 radio-unidentified sources. confusion isa serious issue for this deep blast 250-micron survey, due to the large size ofthe beam. nevertheless, we argue that our chosen counterparts are significant,and often dominant contributors to the measured blast flux densities. for allof these 20 galaxies we have been able to determine spectroscopic (8) orphotometric (12) redshifts. the result is the first `complete' redshiftdistribution for a deep 250-micron selected galaxy sample. this reveals that250-micron surveys reaching detection limits of ~30 mjy contain not onlylow-redshift spirals/lirgs, but also the extreme z~2 dust-enshrouded starburstgalaxies previously discovered at sub-millimetre wavelengths. based on theirirac colours, we find that virtually all of the blast galaxy identificationsappear better described as analogues of the m82 starburst galaxy, or scstar-forming discs rather than highly obscured ulirgs. inspection of the laboca870-micron imaging of the goods-south field yields detections of 7/11 of thez&gt;1 blast sources, and reveals 250/870 flux-density ratios consistent with astandard 40k modified black-body fit with a dust emissivity index beta=1.5.

1001.2934	the atacama cosmology telescope: a measurement of the 600&lt; ell &lt;8000  cosmic microwave background power spectrum at 148 ghz	we present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation observed at 148 ghz. the measurement usesmaps with 1.4' angular resolution made with data from the atacama cosmologytelescope (act). the observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,in a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees south. the cmb atarcminute angular scales is particularly sensitive to the silk damping scale,to the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect from galaxy clusters, and to emission byradio sources and dusty galaxies. after masking the 108 brightest point sourcesin our maps, we estimate the power spectrum between 600 &lt; \ell &lt; 8000 using theadaptive multi-taper method to minimize spectral leakage and maximize use ofthe full data set. our absolute calibration is based on observations of uranus.to verify the calibration and test the fidelity of our map at large angularscales, we cross-correlate the act map to the wmap map and recover the wmappower spectrum from 250 &lt; ell &lt; 1150. the power beyond the silk damping tail ofthe cmb is consistent with models of the emission from point sources. wequantify the contribution of sz clusters to the power spectrum by fitting to amodel normalized at sigma8 = 0.8. we constrain the model's amplitude asz &lt; 1.63(95% cl). if interpreted as a measurement of sigma8, this implies sigma8^sz &lt;0.86 (95% cl) given our sz model. a fit of act and wmap five-year data jointlyto a 6-parameter lcdm model plus terms for point sources and the sz effect isconsistent with these results.

1001.3690	unveiling the nature of submillimeter galaxy sxdf850.6	we present an 880 micron submillimeter array (sma) detection of thesubmillimeter galaxy sxdf850.6. sxdf850.6 is a bright source (s(850 micron) = 8mjy) detected in the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades), and hasmultiple possible radio counterparts in its deep radio image obtained at thevla. our new sma detection finds that the submm emission coincides with thebrightest radio emission that is found ~8" north of the coordinates determinedfrom scuba. despite the lack of detectable counterparts in deep uv/opticalimages, we find a source at the sma position in near-infrared and longerwavelength images. we perform sed model fits to uv-optical-ir photometry (u, b,v, r, i', z', j, h, k, 3.6 micron, 4.5 micron, 5.8 micron, and 8.0 micron) andto submm-radio photometry (850 micron, 880 micron, 1100 micron, and 21 cm)independently, and we find both are well described by starburst templates at aredshift of z ~= 2.2 (+/- 0.3). the best-fit parameters from the uv-optical-irsed fit are a redshift of z = 1.87 (+0.15/-0.07), a stellar mass of m_star =2.5 +2.2/-0.3 x 10^11 m_sun, an extinction of a_v = 3.0 (+0.3/-1.0) mag, and anage of 720 (+1880/-210) myr. the submm-radio sed fit provides a consistentredshift of z ~ 1.8-2.5, an ir luminosity of l_ir = (7-26) x 10^12 l_sun, and astar formation rate of 1300-4500 m_sun/yr. these results suggest that sxdf850.6is a mature system already having a massive amount of old stellar populationconstructed before its submm bright phase and is experiencing a dustystarburst, possibly induced by major mergers.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

0708.0845	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- v. submillimetre  properties of near-infrared--selected galaxies in the subaru/xmm--newton deep  field	we have studied the submillimetre (submm) properties of the following classesof near-infrared (nir)-selected massive galaxies at high redshifts:bzk-selected star-forming galaxies (bzks); distant red galaxies (drgs); andextremely red objects (eros). we used the scuba half degree extragalacticsurvey (shades), the largest uniform submm survey to date. partial overlap ofsirius/nir images and shades in sxdf has allowed us to identify 4 submm-brightnir-selected galaxies, which are detected in the mid-infrared, 24 micron, andthe radio, 1.4 ghz. we find that all of our submm-bright nir-selected galaxiessatisfy the bzk selection criteria, except for one galaxy whose b-z and z-kcolours are however close to the bzk colour boundary. two of the submm-brightnir-selected galaxies satisfy all of the selection criteria we considered, i.e.they belong to the bzk-drg-ero overlapping population, or `extremely red' bzks.although these extremely red bzks are rare (0.25 arcmin^{-2}), up to 20 % ofthis population could be submm galaxies. this fraction is significantly higherthan that found for other galaxy populations studied here. via a stackinganalysis, we have detected the 850 micron flux of submm-faint bzks and eros inour scuba maps. while the contribution of z~2 bzks to the submm background isabout 10--15 % and similar to that from eros typically at z~1, bzks have ahigher fraction (~30 %) of submm flux in resolved sources compared with erosand submm sources as a whole. from the sed fitting analysis for bothsubmm-bright and submm-faint bzks, we found no clear signature thatsubmm-bright bzks are experiencing a specifically luminous evolutionary phase,compared with submm-faint bzks. an alternative explanation might be thatsubmm-bright bzks are more massive than submm-faint ones.

1007.5256	the atacama cosmology telescope: extragalactic sources at 148 ghz in the  2008 survey	we report on extragalactic sources detected in a 455 square-degree map of thesouthern sky made with data at a frequency of 148 ghz from the atacamacosmology telescope 2008 observing season. we provide a catalog of 157 sourceswith flux densities spanning two orders of magnitude: from 15 to 1500 mjy.comparison to other catalogs shows that 98% of the act detections correspond tosources detected at lower radio frequencies. three of the sources appear to beassociated with the brightest cluster galaxies of low redshift x-ray selectedgalaxy clusters. estimates of the radio to mm-wave spectral indices anddifferential counts of the sources further bolster the hypothesis that they arenearly all radio sources, and that their emission is not dominated byre-emission from warm dust. in a bright (&gt;50 mjy) 148 ghz-selected sample withcomplete cross-identifications from the australia telescope 20 ghz survey, weobserve an average steepening of the spectra between 5, 20, and 148 ghz withmedian spectral indices of $\alpha_{\rm 5-20} = -0.07 \pm 0.06$, $\alpha_{\rm20-148} = -0.39 \pm0.04$, and $\alpha_{\rm 5-148} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$. when themeasured spectral indices are taken into account, the 148 ghz differentialsource counts are consistent with previous measurements at 30 ghz in thecontext of a source count model dominated by radio sources. extrapolating withan appropriately rescaled model for the radio source counts, the poissoncontribution to the spatial power spectrum from synchrotron-dominated sourceswith flux density less than 20 mjy is $c^{\rm sync} = (2.8 \pm 0.3) \times10^{-6} \micro\kelvin^2$.

1009.1455	detection of an ultra-bright submillimeter galaxy in the  subaru/xmm-newton deep field using aztec/aste	we report the detection of an extremely bright ($\sim$37 mjy at 1100 $\mu$mand $\sim$91 mjy at 880 $\mu$m) submillimeter galaxy (smg),aztec-aste-sxdf1100.001 (hereafter referred to as sxdf1100.001 or orochi),discovered in 1100 $\mu$m observations of the subaru/xmm-newton deep fieldusing aztec on aste. subsequent carma 1300 $\mu$m and sma 880 $\mu$mobservations successfully pinpoint the location of orochi and suggest that ithas two components, one extended (fwhm of $\sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$) and onecompact (unresolved). z-spec on cso has also been used to obtain a wide bandspectrum from 190 to 308 ghz, although no significant emission/absorption linesare found. the derived upper limit to the line-to-continuum flux ratio is0.1--0.3 (2 $\sigma$) across the z-spec band.  based on the analysis of the derived spectral energy distribution fromoptical to radio wavelengths of possible counterparts near the sma/carma peakposition, we suggest that orochi is a lensed, optically dark smg lying at $z\sim 3.4$ behind a foreground, optically visible (but red) galaxy at $z \sim1.4$. the deduced apparent (i.e., no correction for magnification) infraredluminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$) and star formation rate (sfr) are $6 \times 10^{13}$$l_{\odot}$ and 11000 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, assuming that the$l_{\rm ir}$ is dominated by star formation. these values suggest that orochiwill consume its gas reservoir within a short time scale ($3 \times 10^{7}$yr), which is indeed comparable to those in extreme starbursts like the centresof local ulirgs.

1010.0585	aztec/aste 1.1-mm survey of the akari deep field south: source catalogue  and number counts	we present results of a 1.1 mm deep survey of the akari deep field south(adf-s) with aztec mounted on the atacama submillimetre telescope experiment(aste). we obtained a map of 0.25 sq. deg area with an rms noise level of0.32-0.71 mjy. this is one of the deepest and widest maps thus far atmillimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. we uncovered 198 sources with asignificance of 3.5-15.6 sigma, providing the largest catalog of 1.1 mm sourcesin a contiguous region. most of the sources are not detected in thefar-infrared bands of the akari satellite, suggesting that they are mostly at z~ 1.5 given the detection limits. we constructed differential and cumulativenumber counts in the adf-s, the subaru/xmm newton deep field (sxdf), and thessa 22 field surveyed by aztec/aste, which provide currently the tightestconstraints on the faint end. the integration of the best-fit number counts inthe adf-s find that the contribution of 1.1 mm sources with fluxes &gt;=1 mjy tothe cosmic infrared background (cib) at 1.1 mm is 12-16%, suggesting that thelarge fraction of the cib originates from faint sources of which the numbercounts are not yet constrained. we estimate the cosmic star-formation ratedensity contributed by 1.1 mm sources with &gt;=1 mjy using the best-fit numbercounts in the adf-s and find that it is lower by about a factor of 5-10compared to those derived from uv/optically-selected galaxies at z ~ 2-3. thefraction of stellar mass of the present-day universe produced by 1.1 mm sourceswith &gt;=1 mjy at z &gt;= 1 is ~20%, calculated by the time integration of thestar-formation rate density. if we consider the recycled fraction of &gt;0.4,which is the fraction of materials forming stars returned to the interstellarmedium, the fraction of stellar mass produced by 1.1 mm sources decrease to&lt;~10%.

1105.0890	aztec millimeter survey of the cosmos field - iii. source catalog over  0.72 sq. deg. and plausible boosting by large-scale structure	we present a 0.72 sq. deg. contiguous 1.1mm survey in the central area of thecosmos field carried out to a 1sigma ~ 1.26 mjy/beam depth with the azteccamera mounted on the 10m atacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). wehave uncovered 189 candidate sources at a signal-to-noise ratio s/n &gt;= 3.5, outof which 129, with s/n &gt;= 4, can be considered to have little chance of beingspurious (&lt; 2 per cent). we present the number counts derived with this survey,which show a significant excess of sources when compared to the number countsderived from the ~0.5 sq. deg. area sampled at similar depths in the scuba halfdegree extragalactic survey (shades, austermann et al. 2010). they are,however, consistent with those derived from fields that were considered toosmall to characterize the overall blank-field population. we identifydifferences to be more significant in the s &gt; 5 mjy regime, and demonstratethat these excesses in number counts are related to the areas where galaxies atredshifts z &lt; 1.1 are more densely clustered. the positions of optical-irgalaxies in the redshift interval 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.75 are the ones that show thestrongest correlation with the positions of the 1.1mm bright population (s &gt; 5mjy), a result which does not depend exclusively on the presence of richclusters within the survey sampled area. the most likely explanation for theobserved excess in number counts at 1.1mm is galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-grouplensing at moderate amplification levels, that increases in amplitude as onesamples larger and larger flux densities. this effect should also be detectablein other high redshift populations.

1107.3120	aztec 1.1 mm images of 16 radio galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;5.2 and a quasar at  z=6.3	we present 1.1 mm observations for a sample of 16 powerful radio galaxies at0.5&lt;z&lt;5.2 and a radio quiet quasar at z=6.3, obtained using the aztec bolometerarray mounted on the aste or the jcmt. this paper more than doubles the numberof high-z radio galaxies imaged at millimetre/sub-millimetre wavelengths. wedetect probable millimetre-wave counterparts for 11 of the active galaxies. the6 active galaxies which do not have a probable millimetre counterpart in ourimages nevertheless have one or more likely associated millimetric source.thus, we conclude that powerful (radio-loud) active galaxies at high-z arebeacons for finding luminous millimetre/sub-millimetre galaxies at high-z. theflux densities of our aztec counterparts imply star formation rates rangingfrom &lt;200 to ~1300 m./yr. in addition, we find that for the radio galaxoes the1.1 mm flux density is anticorrelated with the largest angular size of theradio source.  we also present new spitzer imaging observations of several active galaxiesin our sample. combining these with archival data, we examine the mid-infraredcolours of our sample. we find that radio galaxies for which we have detected aprobable 1.1 mm counterpart have mid-infrared colours consistent with dustystarbursts, and are usually bluer than high-z spitzer-selected active galaxies.in addition, we find arcs of 24 micron sources extending across ~200-500 kpc,apparently associated with three of the radio galaxies.

1112.6241	aztec 1.1 mm observations of the mbm12 molecular cloud	we present 1.1 mm observations of the dust continuum emission from the mbm12high-latitude molecular cloud observed with the astronomical thermal emissioncamera (aztec) mounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope on mauna kea,hawaii. we surveyed a 6.34 deg$^2$ centered on mbm12, making this the largestarea that has ever been surveyed in this region with submillimeter andmillimeter telescopes. eight secure individual sources were detected with asignal-to-noise ratio of over 4.4. these eight aztec sources can be consideredto be real astronomical objects compared to the other candidates based oncalculations of the false detection rate. the distribution of the detected 1.1mm sources or compact 1.1 mm peaks is spatially anti-correlated with that ofthe 100 micronm emission and the $^{12}$co emission. we detected the 1.1 mmdust continuum emitting sources associated with two classical t tauri stars,lkhalpha262 and lkhalpha264. observations of spectral energy distributions(seds) indicate that lkhalpha262 is likely to be class ii (pre-main-sequencestar), but there are also indications that it could be a late class i(protostar). a flared disk and a bipolar cavity in the models of class isources lead to more complicated seds. from the present aztec observations ofthe mbm12 region, it appears that other sources detected with aztec are likelyto be extragalactic and located behind mbm12. some of these have radiocounterparts and their star formation rates are derived from a fit of the sedsto the photometric evolution of galaxies in which the effects of a dustyinterstellar medium have been included.

1203.2609	the source counts of submillimetre galaxies detected at 1.1 mm	the source counts of galaxies discovered at sub-millimetre and millimetrewavelengths provide important information on the evolution of infrared-brightgalaxies. we combine the data from six blank-field surveys carried out at 1.1mm with aztec, totalling 1.6 square degrees in area with root-mean-squaredepths ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 mjy, and derive the strongest constraints todate on the 1.1 mm source counts at flux densities s(1100) = 1-12 mjy. usingadditional data from the aztec cluster environment survey to extend the countsto s(1100) ~ 20 mjy, we see tentative evidence for an enhancement relative tothe exponential drop in the counts at s(1100) ~ 13 mjy and a smooth connectionto the bright source counts at &gt;20 mjy measured by the south pole telescope;this excess may be due to strong lensing effects. we compare these counts topredictions from several semi-analytical and phenomenological models and findthat for most the agreement is quite good at flux densities &gt; 4 mjy; however,we find significant discrepancies (&gt;3sigma) between the models and the observed1.1 mm counts at lower flux densities, and none of them are consistent with theobserved turnover in the euclidean-normalised counts at s(1100) &lt; 2 mjy. ournew results therefore may require modifications to existing evolutionary modelsfor low luminosity galaxies. alternatively, the discrepancy between themeasured counts at the faint end and predictions from phenomenological modelscould arise from limited knowledge of the spectral energy distributions offaint galaxies in the local universe.

1205.2370	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields - ii.  identifications, redshifts, and evidence for large-scale structure	the aztec 1.1 mm survey of the scuba half degree extragalactic survey(shades) fields is the largest (0.7 deg2) blank-field millimetre-wavelengthsurvey undertaken to date at a resolution of ~18" and a depth of ~1 mjy. wehave used the deep optical-to-radio multi-wavelength data in the shades lockmanhole east and sxdf/uds fields to obtain galaxy identifications for ~64% (~80%with tentative identifications) of the 148 aztec-shades 1.1 mm sources,exploiting deep radio and 24 um data complemented by methods based on 8 umflux-density and red optical-infrared (i-k) colour. this unusually highidentification rate can be attributed to the relatively brightmillimetre-wavelength flux-density threshold, combined with the relatively deepsupporting multi-frequency data. we have further exploited theoptical-mid-infrared-radio data to derive a ~60% (~75% with tentativeidentifications) complete redshift distribution for the aztec-shades sources,yielding a median redshift of z~2.2, with a high-redshift tail extending to atleast z~4. despite the larger area probed by the aztec survey relative to theoriginal scuba shades imaging, the redshift distribution of the aztec sourcesis consistent with that displayed by the scuba sources, and reinforcestentative evidence that the redshift distribution of mm/sub-mm sources in thelockman hole field is significantly different from that found in the sxdf/udsfield. comparison with simulated surveys of similar scale extracted fromsemi-analytic models based on the millennium simulation indicates that this isas expected if the mm/sub-mm sources are massive (m&gt;10^11 mo) star-forminggalaxies tracing large-scale structures over scales of 10-20 mpc. this confirmsthe importance of surveys covering several square degrees (as now underway withscuba2) to obtain representative samples of bright (sub)mm-selected galaxies.

1506.04747	early science with the large millimeter telescope: observations of dust  continuum and co emission lines of cluster-lensed submillimetre galaxies at  z=2.0-4.7	we present early science observations with the large millimeter telescope,aztec 1.1 mm continuum images and wide bandwidth spectra (73-111 ghz) acquiredwith the redshift search receiver, towards four bright lensed submillimetregalaxies identified through the herschel lensing survey-snapshot and thescuba-2 cluster snapshot survey. this pilot project studies the star formationhistory and the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust content ofthe highest redshift galaxies identified through the benefits of gravitationalmagnification. we robustly detect dust continuum emission for the full sampleand co emission lines for three of the targets. we find that one source showsspectroscopic multiplicity and is a blend of three galaxies at differentredshifts (z=2.040, 3.252 and 4.680), reminiscent of previous high-resolutionimaging follow-up of unlensed submillimetre galaxies, but with a completelydifferent search method, that confirm recent theoretical predictions ofphysically unassociated blended galaxies. identifying the detected lines as12co (j_up=2-5) we derive spectroscopic redshifts, molecular gas masses, anddust masses from the continuum emission. the mean h_2 gas mass of the fullsample is (2.0 +- 0.2) x 10^11 m_sun/\mu, and the mean dust mass is (2.0+-0.2)x 10^9 m_sun/\mu, where \mu=2-5 is the expected lens amplification. using theseindependent estimations we infer a gas-to-dust ratio of \delta_gdr=55-75, inagreement with other measurements of submillimetre galaxies. our magnifiedhigh-luminosity galaxies fall on the same locus as other high-redshiftsubmillimetre galaxies, extending the l'_co - l_fir correlation observed forlocal luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies to higher fir and columinosities.

1506.06768	extremely-bright submillimeter galaxies beyond the lupus-i star-forming  region	we report detections of two candidate distant submillimeter galaxies (smgs),mm j154506.4$-$344318 and mm j154132.7$-$350320, which are discovered in theaztec/aste 1.1 mm survey toward the lupus-i star-forming region. the twoobjects have 1.1 mm flux densities of 43.9 and 27.1 mjy, and haveherschel/spire counterparts as well. the submillimeter array counterpart to theformer smg is identified at 890 $\mu$m and 1.3 mm. photometric redshiftestimates using all available data from the mid-infrared to the radio suggestthat the redshifts of the two smgs are $z_{\rm photo} \simeq$ 4-5 and 3,respectively. near-infrared objects are found very close to the smgs and theyare consistent with low-$z$ ellipticals, suggesting that the high apparentluminosities can be attributed to gravitational magnification. the cumulativenumber counts at $s_{\rm 1.1mm} \ge 25$ mjy, combined with other two 1.1-mmbrightest sources, are $0.70 ^{+0.56}_{-0.34}$ deg$^{-2}$, which is consistentwith a model prediction that accounts for flux magnification due to stronggravitational lensing. unexpectedly, a $z &gt; 3$ smg and a galactic densestarless core (e.g., a first hydrostatic core) could be similar in themid-infrared to millimeter spectral energy distributions and spatial structuresat least at $\gtrsim 1"$. this indicates that it is necessary to distinguishthe two possibilities by means of broad band photometry from the optical tocentimeter and spectroscopy to determine the redshift, when a compact object isidentified toward galactic star-forming regions.

astro-ph;0002083	a submillimetre survey of the star-formation history of radio galaxies	we present the results of the first major systematic submillimetre survey ofradio galaxies spanning the redshift range 1 &lt; z &lt; 5. the primary aim of thiswork is to elucidate the star-formation history of this sub-class of ellipticalgalaxies by tracing the cosmological evolution of dust mass. using scuba on thejcmt we have obtained 850-micron photometry of 47 radio galaxies to aconsistent rms depth of 1 mjy, and have detected dust emission in 14 cases. theradio galaxy targets have been selected from a series of low-frequency radiosurveys of increasing depth (3crr, 6ce, etc), in order to allow us to separatethe effects of increasing redshift and increasing radio power on submillimetreluminosity. although the dynamic range of our study is inevitably small, wefind clear evidence that the typical submillimetre luminosity (and hence dustmass) of a powerful radio galaxy is a strongly increasing function of redshift;the detection rate rises from 15 per cent at z &lt; 2.5 to 75 per cent at z &gt; 2.5,and the average submillimetre luminosity rises as (1+z)^3 out to z~4. moreoverour extensive sample allows us to argue that this behaviour is not driven byunderlying correlations with other radio galaxy properties such as radio power,radio spectral index, or radio source size/age. although radio selection mayintroduce other more subtle biases, the redshift distribution of our detectedobjects is in fact consistent with the most recent estimates of the redshiftdistribution of comparably bright submillimetre sources discovered in blankfield surveys. the evolution of submillimetre luminosity found here for radiogalaxies may thus be representative of massive ellipticals in general.

astro-ph;0108122	coupled spheroid and black-hole formation, and the multifrequency  detectability of active galactic nuclei and submillimetre sources	we use a simple model of spheroid formation to explore the relationshipbetween the creation of stars and dust in a massive proto galaxy and the growthof its central black hole. this model predicts that sub-mm luminosity peaksafter only ~ 0.2 gyr. however, without a very massive seed black hole,eddington-limited growth means that a black hole mass of 10^9 solar masses, andhence very luminous agn activity, cannot be produced until &gt; 0.5 gyr after theformation of the first massive stars in the halo. the model thus predicts atime-lag between the peak of sub-mm luminosity and agn luminosity in a massiveproto-elliptical of a few times 10^8 years. for a formation redshift z = 5,this means that powerful agn activity is delayed until z = 3.5, by which timestar formation in the host is 90% complete, and sub-mm luminosity has declinedto ~ 25% of its peak value. this provides a natural explanation for whysuccessful sub-mm detections of luminous radio galaxies are largely confined toz &gt; 2.5. conversely the model also predicts that while all high-redshiftluminous sub-mm-selected sources should contain an active (and growing) blackhole, the typical luminosity of the agn in such objects is ~1000 times smallerthan that of the most powerful agn. this is consistent with the almost completefailure to detect sub-mm selected galaxies with existing x-ray surveys. finallythe model yields a black-hole:spheroid mass ratio which evolves rapidly in thefirst gyr, but asymptotes to ~ 0.001-0.003 in agreement with results at lowredshift. this ratio arises not because the agn terminates star formation, butbecause fueling of the massive black hole is linked to the total mass of gasavailable for star formation in the host.

astro-ph;0108397	quasars, their host galaxies, and their central black holes	we present the final results from our deep hst imaging study of the hosts ofradio-quiet quasars (rqqs), radio-loud quasars (rlqs) and radio galaxies (rgs).we describe new wfpc2 r-band observations for 14 objects and model these imagesin conjunction with the data already reported in mclure et al (1999). we findthat spheroidal hosts become more prevalent with increasing nuclear luminositysuch that, for nuclear luminosities m_v &lt; -23.5, the hosts of both radio-loudand radio-quiet agn are virtually all massive ellipticals. moreover wedemonstrate that the basic properties of these hosts are indistinguishable fromthose of quiescent, evolved, low-redshift ellipticals of comparable mass. thisresult kills any lingering notion that radio-loudness is determined byhost-galaxy morphology, and also sets severe constraints on evolutionaryschemes which attempt to link low-z ulirgs with rqqs. instead, we show that ourresults are as expected given the relationship between black-hole and spheroidmass established for nearby galaxies, and apply this relation to estimate themass of the black hole in each object. the results agree very well withcompletely-independent estimates based on nuclear emission-line widths; all thequasars in our sample have m(bh) &gt; 5 x 10^8 solar masses, while the radio-loudobjects are confined to m(bh) &gt; 10^9 solar masses. this apparent mass-thresholddifference, which provides a natural explanation for why rqqs outnumber rlqs bya factor of 10, appears to reflect the existence of a minimum and maximum levelof black-hole radio output which is a strong function of black-hole mass.finally, we use our results to estimate the fraction of massivespheroids/black-holes which produce quasar-level activity. this fraction is\~0.1% at the present day, rising to &gt; 10% at z = 2-3.

astro-ph;0108400	the coincidence and angular clustering of chandra and scuba sources	we explore the relationship between the hard x-ray and sub-mm populationsusing deep chandra observations of a large, contiguous scuba survey. inagreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap issmall. of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only oneis coincident with a chandra source. the resulting limits imply that themajority of scuba sources are not powered by agn, unless the central engine isobscured by compton-thick material with a low (&lt;1 per cent) scatteredcomponent. furthermore, since chandra detects only ~5 per cent of scubasources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. the x-rayupper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburstsed at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of scuba sources lie at z&gt;1even if they are purely starburst galaxies. despite the low detection rate, wefind evidence for strong angular clustering between the x-ray and sub-mmpopulations. the implication is that agn and scuba sources trace the samelarge-scale structure but do not generally coincide. if bright sub-mm sourcesrepresent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for agiven galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from theperiod of observable quasar activity.

astro-ph;0111547	breaking the redshift deadlock - i: constraining the star formation  history of galaxies with sub-millimetre photometric redshifts	future extragalactic sub-millimetre and millimetre surveys have the potentialto provide a sensitive census of the level of obscured star formation ingalaxies at all redshifts. while in general there is good agreement between thesource counts from existing scuba (850um) and mambo (1.25mm) surveys ofdifferent depths and areas, it remains difficult to determine the redshiftdistribution and bolometric luminosities of the sub-millimetre and millimetregalaxy population. this is principally due to the ambiguity in identifying anindividual sub-millimetre source with its optical, ir or radio counterpartwhich, in turn, prevents a confident measurement of the spectroscopic redshift.additionally, the lack of data measuring the rest-frame fir spectral peak ofthe sub-millimetre galaxies gives rise to poor constraints on their rest-framefir luminosities and star formation rates. in this paper we describemonte-carlo simulations of ground-based, balloon-borne and satellitesub-millimetre surveys that demonstrate how the rest-frame fir-sub-millimetrespectral energy distributions (250-850um) can be used to derive photometricredshifts with an r.m.s accuracy of +/- 0.4 over the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 6. thisopportunity to break the redshift deadlock will provide an estimate of theglobal star formation history for luminous optically-obscured galaxies [l(fir)&gt; 3 x 10^12 lsun] with an accuracy of 20 per cent.

astro-ph;0302572	the far-infrared spectral energy distributions of x-ray-selected active  galaxies	[abridged] we present iso far-infrared (ir) observations of 21 hard x-rayselected agn from the heao-1 a2 sample. we compare the far-ir to x-ray spectralenergy distributions (seds) of this sample with various radio and opticallyselected agn samples. the hard-x-ray selected sample shows a wider range ofoptical/uv shapes extending to redder near-ir colors. the bluer objects areseyfert 1s, while the redder agn are mostly intermediate or type 2 seyferts.this is consistent with a modified unification model in which the amount ofobscuring material increases with viewing angle and may be clumpy. such ascenario, already suggested by differing optical/near-ir spectroscopic andx-ray agn classifications, allows for different amounts of obscuration of thecontinuum emission in different wavebands and of the broad emission line regionwhich results in a mixture of behaviors for agn with similar optical emissionline classifications. the resulting limits on the column density of obscuringmaterial through which we are viewing the redder agn are 100 times lower thanfor the standard optically thick torus models. the resulting decrease inoptical depth of the obscuring material allows the agn to heat more dust atlarger radial distances. we show that an agn-heated, flared, dusty disk withmass 10^9 solar and size of few hundred pc is able to generate optical-far-irseds which reproduce the wide range of seds present in our sample with no needfor an additional starburst component to generate the long-wavelength, coolerpart of the ir continuum.

astro-ph;0304178	2-point anisotropies in wmap and the cosmic quadrupole	large-scale modes in the temperature anisotropy power spectrum c_l measuredby the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap), seem to have loweramplitudes (c_2, c_3 and c_4) than that expected in the so called concordancelcdm model. in particular, the quadrupole c_2 is reported to have a smallervalue than allowed by cosmic variance. this has been interpreted as a possibleindication of new physics. in this paper we re-analyse the wmap data using the2-point angular correlation and its higher-order moments. this method, whichrequires a full covariance analysis, is more direct and provides bettersampling of the largest modes than the standard harmonic decomposition. we showthat the wmap data is in good agreement (~ 30% probability) with a lcdm modelwhen the wmap data is considered as a particular realization drawn from a setof realistic lcdm simulations with the corresponding covariance. this is alsotrue for the higher-order moments, shown here up to 6th order, which areconsistent with the gaussian hypothesis. the sky mask plays a major role inassessing the significance of these agreements. we recover the best fit modelfor the low-order multipoles based on the 2-point correlation with differentassumptions for the covariance. assuming that the observations are a fairsample of the true model, we find c_2 = 123 +/- 233, c_3= 217 +/- 241 and c_4 =212 +/- 162 (in mu k^2). the errors increase by about a factor of 5 if weassume the \lcdm model. if we exclude the galactic plane |b|&lt;30 from ouranalysis, we recover very similar values within the errors (ie c_2=172, c_3=89, c_4=129). this indicates that the galactic plane is not responsible for thelack of large-scale power in the wmap data.

astro-ph;0611869	a broadband spectroscopic search for co line emission in hdf850.1: the  brightest submillimetre object in the hubble deep field north	using the 100-m green bank telescope, we have conducted a cm-wavelengthsearch for co j=1-0 line emission towards the high-redshift, far-infraredluminous object, hdf850.1 over the redshift interval 3.3&lt;z&lt;5.4. despite thewealth of existing multi-wavelength observations, and the recent identificationof a galaxy counterpart in deep k' band (2.2 um) imaging, an unambiguousspectroscopic redshift has not yet been obtained for this object. afar-infrared-to-radio wavelength photometric redshift technique however,predicts a ~90% probability that the redshift is in the range, 3.3&lt;z&lt;5.4(equivalent to an observed redshifted co j=1-0 emission line frequency,26.5&gt;nu(obs)&gt;18.0 ghz), making hdf850.1 a potential occupent of the`high-redshift tail' of submm selected galaxies. we have also conducted asearch for co j=2-1 line emission over the narrower redshift range, 3.9&lt;z&lt;4.3.although we do not detect any co line emission in this object, our limits tothe co line luminosity are in broad agreement with the median value measured inthe current sample of high-redshift, submm selected objects detected in high-jco line emission, but not sufficient to fully test the validity of thephotometric redshift technique.

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.

astro-ph;9809030	a comparative hst imaging study of the host galaxies of radio-quiet  quasars, radio-loud quasars and radio galaxies: paper i	we present the first results from a major hst wfpc2 imaging study aimed atproviding the first statistically meaningful comparison of the morphologies,luminosities, scalelengths and colours of the host galaxies of radio-quietquasars, radio-loud quasars, and radio galaxies. we describe the design of thisstudy and present the images which have been obtained for the first half of our33-source sample. we find that the hosts of all three classes of luminous agnare massive elliptical galaxies, with scalelengths ~=10 kpc, and r-k coloursconsistent with mature stellar populations. most importantly this is the thefirst unambiguous evidence that, just like radio-loud quasars, essentially allradio-quiet quasars brighter than m_r = -24 reside in massive ellipticals. thisresult removes the possibility that radio `loudness' is directly linked to hostgalaxy morphology, but is however in excellent accord with theblack-hole/spheroid mass correlation recently highlighted by magorrian et al.(1998). we apply the relations given by magorrian et al. to infer the expectededdington luminosity of the putative black hole at the centre of each of thespheroidal host galaxies we have uncovered. comparison with the actual nuclearr-band luminosities suggests that the black holes in most of these galaxies areradiating at a few percent of the eddington luminosity; the brightest hostgalaxies in our low-z sample are capable of hosting quasars with m_r = -28,comparable to the most luminous quasars at z = 3. finally we discuss ourhost-derived black-hole masses in the context of theradio-luminosity:black-hole mass correlation recently uncovered for nearbygalaxies by franceschini et al. (1998), and the resulting implications for thephysical origin of radio loudness.

astro-ph;9810253	cosmological evolution of the submillimetre luminosity of high-redshift  radio galaxies	a systematic survey measuring the submillimetre continuum luminosity in radiogalaxies between redshifts z ~ 0.1 - 5 is currently in progress. the firstresults from observations with the bolometer array scuba on the jcmt suggest atrend of increasing submillimetre luminosity with redshift out to z ~ 4.assuming the continuum emission at 850um is dominated by thermal radiation fromdust heated by young, massive stars, the straightforward interpretation ofthese data implies that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources, presumablyellipticals or their progenitors, exhibit increased star formation activitywith increasing redshift. however a severe bias may distort the true picturesince only a subset of 30 galaxies have been observed, which represent the mostluminous radio sources (p_(151 mhz) &gt; 10^27.5 w hz^-1 sr^-1), whilst thecomplete sample covers ~4 decades in radio power (10^25 - 10^29 w hz^-1 sr^-1).this on-going observational programme continues to improve coverage of theradio power-redshift plane in an attempt to remove this potential bias towardshigher agn activity and hence understand more fully the relationship betweenhigh-z agn, their level of starformation, and the evolutionary status of theirhost galaxies.

astro-ph;9912231	starburst galaxies and structure in the submillimetre background towards  the hubble deep field	we use an 850-micron scuba map of the hdf to study the dust properties ofoptically-selected starburst galaxies at high redshift. although the 850-micronmap does not allow detection of the majority of individual sources, we showthat the galaxies with the highest uv star-formation rates are detectedstatistically, with a flux density of about s_{850}=0.2 mjy for an apparent uvstar-formation rate of 1 h^{-2} msun yr^{-1}. this level of submillimetreoutput indicates that the total star-forming activity is on average a factor ofapproximately 6 times larger than the rate inferred from the uv output of thesegalaxies. the general population of optical starbursts is then predicted tocontribute at least 25 per cent of the 850-micron background. we carry out apower-spectrum analysis of the map, which yields some evidence for angularclustering of the background source population, but at a level lower than thatseen in lyman-break galaxies. together with other lines of argument,particularly from the nicmos hdf data, this suggests that the 850-micronbackground originates over an extremely wide range of redshifts -- perhaps 1 &lt;z &lt; 6.

0812.0814	aztec millimetre survey of the cosmos field - ii. source count  overdensity and correlations with large-scale structure	we report an over-density of bright sub-millimetre galaxies (smgs) in the0.15 sq. deg. aztec/cosmos survey and a spatial correlation between the smgsand the optical-ir galaxy density at z &lt;~ 1.1. this portion of the cosmos fieldshows a ~ 3-sigma over-density of robust smg detections when compared to abackground, or "blankfield", population model that is consistent with smgsurveys of fields with no extragalactic bias. the smg over-density is mostsignificant in the number of very bright detections (14 sources with measuredfluxes s(1.1mm) &gt; 6 mjy), which is entirely incompatible with sample variancewithin our adopted blank-field number densities and infers an over-densitysignificance of &gt;&gt; 4. we find that the over-density and spatial correlation tooptical-ir galaxy density are most consistent with lensing of a background smgpopulation by foreground mass structures along the line of sight, rather thanphysical association of the smgs with the z &lt;~ 1.1 galaxies/clusters. the smgpositions are only weakly correlated with weak-lensing maps, suggesting thatthe dominant sources of correlation are individual galaxies and the moretenuous structures in the region and not the massive and compact clusters.these results highlight the important roles cosmic variance and large-scalestructure can play in the study of smgs.
