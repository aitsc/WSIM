0706.3222	the first-2mass red quasar survey	combining radio observations with optical and infrared color selection --demonstrated in our pilot study to be an efficient selection algorithm forfinding red quasars -- we have obtained optical and infrared spectroscopy for120 objects in a complete sample of 156 candidates from a sky area of 2716square degrees. consistent with our initial results, we find our selectioncriteria -- j-k&gt;1.7, r-k&gt;4.0 -- yield a ~50% success rate for discoveringquasars substantially redder than those found in optical surveys. comparisonwith uvx- and optical color-selected samples shows that &gt;~ 10% of the quasarsare missed in a magnitude-limited survey. simultaneous two-frequency radioobservations for part of the sample indicate that a synchrotron continuumcomponent is ruled out as a significant contributor to reddening the quasars'spectra. we go on to estimate extinctions for our objects assuming their redcolors are caused by dust. continuum fits and balmer decrements suggest e(b-v)values ranging from near zero to 2.5 magnitudes. correcting the k-bandmagnitudes for these extinctions, we find that for k &lt;= 14.0, red quasars makeup between 25% and 60% of the underlying quasar population; owing to theincompleteness of the 2mass survey at fainter k-band magnitudes, we can onlyset a lower limit to the radio-detected red quasar population of &gt;20-30%.

0708.0828	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. ii. statistical lens  sample from the third data release	we report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensedquasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). among 46,420 quasars from the sdss data release 3 (~4188 deg^2),we select a subsample of 22,683 quasars that are located at redshifts between0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the galactic extinction corrected i-bandmagnitude of 19.1. we identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample,for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in opticaland near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasarsample at image separations between 1'' and 20'' and flux ratios of faint tobright lensed images larger than 10^{-0.5}. we construct a statistical sampleof 11 lensed quasars. ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small imageseparations (~1''-2'') and one is a large separation (15'') system which isproduced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statisticalsample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. thedata release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasarsoutside the statistical sample.

1005.1572	variable radio sources in the galactic plane	using three epochs of vla observations of the galactic plane in the firstquadrant taken ~15 years apart, we have conducted a search for a population ofvariable galactic radio emitters in the flux density range 1-100 mjy at 6 cm.we find 39 variable sources in a total survey area of 23.2 sq deg. correctingfor various selection effects and for the extragalactic variable population ofactive galactic nuclei, we conclude there are ~1.6 galactic sources per sq degwhich vary by more than 50% on a time scale of years (or shorter). we show thatthese sources are much more highly variable than extragalactic objects; morethan 50% show variability by a factor &gt;2 compared to &lt;10% for extragalacticobjects in the same flux density range. we also show that the fraction ofvariable sources increases toward the galactic center (another indication thatthis is a galactic population), and that the spectral indices of many of thesesources are flat or inverted. a small number of the variables are coincidentwith mid-ir sources and two are coincident with x-ray emitters, but most haveno known counterparts at other wavelengths. intriguingly, one lies at thecenter of a supernova remnant, while another appears to be a very compactplanetary nebula; several are likely to represent activity associated with starformation regions. we discuss the possible source classes which couldcontribute to the variable cohort and followup observations which could clarifythe nature of these sources.

0708.2578	a survey of z~6 quasars in the sdss deep stripe: i. a flux-limited  sample at z_{ab}&lt;21	we present the discovery of five quasars at z~6 selected from 260 deg^2 ofthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) southern survey, a deep imaging surveyobtained by repeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. the fivequasars with 20&lt;z_{ab}&lt;21 are 1-2 magnitudes fainter than the luminous z~6quasars discovered in the sdss main survey. one of them was independentlydiscovered by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey. these quasars, combined withanother z~6 quasar known in this region, make a complete flux- limited quasarsample at z_{ab}&lt;21. the sample spans the redshift range 5.85&lt;z&lt;6.12 and theluminosity range -26.5&lt;m_{1450}&lt;-25.4 (h_0=70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1},omega_{m}=0.3, and omega_{lambda}=0.7). we use the 1/v_{a} method to determinethat the comoving quasar spatial density at &lt;z&gt;=6.0 and &lt;m_{1450}&gt;=-25.8 is(5.0+/-2.1) x 10^{-9} mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}. we model the bright-end quasarluminosity function (qlf) at z~6 as a power law phi(l_{1450}) \proptol_{1450}^{beta}. the slope beta calculated from a combination of our sample andthe luminous sdss quasar sample is -3.1+/-0.4, significantly steeper than theslope of the qlf at z~4. based on the derived qlf, we find that the quasar/agnpopulation cannot provide enough photons to ionize the intergalactic medium(igm) at z~6 unless the igm is very homogeneous and the luminosity (l*_{1450})at which the qlf power law breaks is very low.

1201.1340	a tiled-table convention for compressing fits binary tables	this document describes a convention for compressing fits binary tables thatis modeled after the fits tiled-image compression method (white et al. 2009)that has been in use for about a decade. the input table is first optionallysubdivided into tiles, each containing an equal number of rows, then everycolumn of data within each tile is compressed and stored as a variable-lengtharray of bytes in the output fits binary table. all the header keywords fromthe input table are copied to the header of the output table and remainuncompressed for efficient access. the output compressed table contains thesame number and order of columns as in the input uncompressed binary table.there is one row in the output table corresponding to each tile of rows in theinput table. in principle, each column of data can be compressed using adifferent algorithm that is optimized for the type of data within that column,however in the prototype implementation described here, the gzip algorithm isused to compress every column.

1203.1088	the sloan digital sky survey quasar lens search. vi. constraints on dark  energy and the evolution of massive galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the final lens sample from the sloandigital sky survey quasar lens search (sqls). the number distribution of acomplete subsample of 19 lensed quasars selected from 50,836 source quasars iscompared with theoretical expectations, with particular attention to theselection function. assuming that the velocity function of galaxies does notevolve with redshift, the sqls sample constrains the cosmological constant to\omega_\lambda=0.79^{+0.06}_{-0.07}(stat.)^{+0.06}_{-0.06}(syst.) for a flatuniverse. the dark energy equation of state is found to be consistent with w=-1when the sqls is combined with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation(bao) measurements or results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap). we also obtain simultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters andredshift evolution of the galaxy velocity function, finding no evidence forredshift evolution at z&lt;1 in any combinations of constraints. for instance,number density evolution quantified as \nu_n=d\ln\phi_*/d\ln(1+z) and thevelocity dispersion evolution \nu_\sigma=d\ln\sigma_*/d\ln(1+z) are constrainedto \nu_n=1.06^{+1.36}_{-1.39}(stat.)^{+0.33}_{-0.64}(syst.) and\nu_\sigma=-0.05^{+0.19}_{-0.16}(stat.)^{+0.03}_{-0.03}(syst.) respectivelywhen the sqls result is combined with bao and wmap for flat models with acosmological constant. we find that a significant amount of dark energy ispreferred even after fully marginalizing over the galaxy evolution parameters.thus the statistics of lensed quasars robustly confirm the accelerated cosmicexpansion.

1203.3809	foreground predictions for the cosmic microwave background power  spectrum from measurements of faint inverted radio sources at 5 ghz	we present measurements of a population of matched radio sources at 1.4 and 5ghz down to a flux limit of 1.5 mjy in 7 sq. degs. of the noao deep fieldsouth. we find a significant fraction of sources with inverted spectral indicesthat all have 1.4 ghz fluxes less than 10 mjy, and are therefore too faint tohave been detected and included in previous radio source count models that arematched at multiple frequencies. combined with the matched source population at1.4 and 5 ghz in 1 sq. deg. in the atesp survey, we update models for the 5 ghzdifferential number counts and distributions of spectral indices in 5 ghz fluxbins that can be used to estimate the unresolved point source contribution tothe cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies. we find a shallowerlogarithmic slope in the 5 ghz differential counts than in previously publishedmodels for fluxes &lt; 100 mjy as well as larger fractions of inverted spectralindices at these fluxes. because the planck flux limit for resolved sources islarger than 100 mjy in all channels, our modified number counts yield at most a10% change in the predicted poisson contribution to the planck temperaturepower spectrum. for a flux cut of 5 mjy with the south pole telescope and aflux cut of 20 mjy with the atacama cosmology telescope we predict a ~30% and~10% increase, respectively, in the radio source poisson power in the lowestfrequency channels of each experiment relative to that predicted by previousmodels.

0711.1495	v838 monocerotis: a geometric distance from hubble space telescope  polarimetric imaging of its light echo	following the outburst of the unusual variable star v838 monocerotis in 2002,a spectacular light echo appeared. a light echo provides the possibility ofdirect geometric distance determination, because it should contain a ring ofhighly linearly polarized light at a linear radius of ct, where t is the timesince the outburst. we present imaging polarimetry of the v838 mon light echo,obtained in 2002 and 2005 with the advanced camera for surveys onboard thehubble space telescope, which confirms the presence of the highly polarizedring. based on detailed modeling that takes into account the outburst lightcurve, the paraboloidal echo geometry, and the physics of dust scattering andpolarization, we find a distance of 6.1+-0.6 kpc. the error is dominated by thesystematic uncertainty in the scattering angle of maximum linear polarization,taken to be theta_{max}=90^o +- 5^o. the polarimetric distance agreesremarkably well with a distance of 6.2+-1.5 kpc obtained from the entirelyindependent method of main-sequence fitting to a sparse star cluster associatedwith v838 mon. at this distance, v838 mon at maximum light had m_v\simeq-9.8,making it temporarily one of the most luminous stars in the local group. ourvalidation of the polarimetric method offers promise for measurement ofextragalactic distances using supernova light echoes.

1304.3463	millijansky radio variability in sdss stripe 82	we report on a blind survey for extragalactic radio variability that wascarried out by comparing two epochs of data from the first survey with a thirdepoch from a new 1.4 ghz survey of sdss stripe 82. the three epochs are spacedseven years apart and have an overlapping area of 60 deg^2. we uncover 89variable sources down to the millijansky level, 75 of which arenewly-identified, and we find no evidence for transient phenomena. this newsample of variable sources allows us to infer an upper limit to the meancharacteristic timescale of agn radio variability of 14 years. we find thatonly 1% of extragalactic sources have fractional variability f_var &gt;3, while44% of galactic sources vary by this much. the variable sample contains alarger fraction of quasars than a comparable non-variable control sample,though the majority of the variable sources appear to be extended galaxies inthe optical. this implies that either quasars are not the dominant contributorto the variability of the sample, or that the deep optical data allow us todetect the host galaxies of some low-z quasars. we use the new, higherresolution data to report on the morphology of the variable sources. finally,we show that the fraction of sources that are variable remains constant orincreases at low flux densities. this may imply that next generation radiosurveys with telescopes like the australian square kilometer array pathfinderand meerkat will see a constant or even increasing fraction of variable sourcesdown into the submillijansky regime.

1501.01556	simulating deep hubble images with semi-empirical models of galaxy  formation	we simulate deep images from the hubble space telescope (hst) usingsemi-empirical models of galaxy formation with only a few basic assumptions andparameters. we project our simulations all the way to the observational domain,adding cosmological and instrumental effects to the images, and analyze them inthe same way as real hst images ("forward modeling"). this is a powerful toolfor testing and comparing galaxy evolution models, since it allows us to makeunbiased comparisons between the predicted and observed distributions of galaxyproperties, while automatically taking into account all relevant selectioneffects.  our semi-empirical models populate each dark matter halo with a galaxy ofdetermined stellar mass and scale radius. we compute the luminosity andspectrum of each simulated galaxy from its evolving stellar mass using stellarpopulation synthesis models. we calculate the intrinsic scatter in the stellarmass-halo mass relation that naturally results from enforcing a monotonicallyincreasing stellar mass along the merger history of each halo. the simulatedgalaxy images are drawn from cutouts of real galaxies from the sloan digitalsky survey, with sizes and fluxes rescaled to match those of the modelgalaxies.  the distributions of galaxy luminosities, sizes, and surface brightnessesdepend on the adjustable parameters in the models, and they agree well withobservations for reasonable values of those parameters. measured galaxymagnitudes and sizes have significant magnitude-dependent biases, with bothbeing underestimated near the magnitude detection limit. the fraction ofgalaxies detected and fraction of light detected also depend sensitively on thedetails of the model.

astro-ph;0006368	discovery of a classic fr-ii broad absorption line quasar from the first  survey	we have discovered a remarkable quasar, first j101614.3+520916, whose opticalspectrum shows unambiguous broad absorption features while its double-lobedradio morphology and luminosity clearly indicate a classic fanaroff-riley typeii radio source. its radio luminosity places it at the extreme of the recentlyestablished class of radio-loud broad absorption line quasars (becker et al.1997, 2000; brotherton et al. 1998). because of its hybrid nature, we speculatethat first j101614.3+520916 is a typical fr-ii quasar which has beenrejuvenated as a broad absorption line (bal) quasar with a compact steepspectrum core. the direction of the jet axis of first j101614.3+520916 can beestimated from its radio structure and optical brightness, indicating that weare viewing the system at a viewing angle of &gt; 40 degrees. the position anglesof the radio jet and optical polarization are not well-aligned, differing by 20to 30 degrees. when combined with the evidence presented by becker et al.(2000) for a sample of 29 bal quasars showing that at least some bal quasarsare viewed along the jet axis, the implication is that no preferred viewingorientation is necessary to observe bal systems in a quasar's spectrum. this,and the probable young nature of compact steep spectrum sources, leadsnaturally to the alternate hypothesis that bals are an early stage in the livesof quasars.

astro-ph;0008259	the intrinsic absorber in qso 2359-1241: keck and hst observations	we present detailed analyses of the absorption spectrum seen in qso 2359-1241(nvss j235953-124148). keck hires data reveal absorption from twentytransitions arising from: he i, mg i, mg ii, ca ii, and fe ii. hst data showbroad absorption lines (bals) from al iii 1857, c iv 1549, si iv 1397, and n v1240. absorption from excited fe ii states constrains the temperature of theabsorber to 2000k &lt; t &lt; 10,000k and puts a lower limit of 10^5 cm^{-3} on theelectron number density. saturation diagnostics show that the real columndensities of he i and fe ii can be determined, allowing to derive meaningfulconstraints on the ionization equilibrium and abundances in the flow. theionization parameter is constrained by the iron, helium and magnesium data to-3.0 &lt; log(u) &lt; -2.5 and the observed column densities can be reproducedwithout assuming departure from solar abundances. from comparison of the he iand fe ii absorption features we infer that the outflow seen in qso 2359-1241is not shielded by a hydrogen ionization front and therefore that the existenceof low-ionization species in the outflow (e.g., mg ii, al iii, fe ii) does notnecessitate the existence of such a front. we find that the velocity width ofthe absorption systematically increases as a function of ionization and to alesser extent with abundance. complementary analyses of the radio andpolarization properties of the object are discussed in a companion paper(brotherton et al. 2000).

astro-ph;0010230	keck hires observations of the qso first j104459.6+365605: evidence for  a large scale outflow	this paper presents an analysis of a keck hires spectrum of the qso firstj104459.6+365605. the line of sight towards the qso contains two clusters ofoutflowing clouds that give rise to broad blue shifted absorption lines. theoutflow velocities of the clouds range from -200 to -1200 km/s and from -3400to -5200 km/s, respectively. the width of the individual absorption linesranges from 50 to more than 1000 km/s. the most prominent absorption lines arethose of mg ii, mg i, and fe ii. the low ionization absorption lines occur atthe same velocities as the most saturated mg ii lines, showing that the fe ii,mg i and mg ii line forming regions must be closely associated. many absorptionlines from excited states of fe ii are present, allowing a determination of thepopulation of several low lying energy levels. from this we determine anelectron density in the fe ii line forming regions of 4000 per cubic cm.modelling the ionization state of the absorbing gas with this value of theelectron density as a constraint, we find that the distance between the fe iiand mg i line forming region and the continuum source is of order 700 parsec.  from the correspondence in velocity between the fe ii, mg i and mg ii lineswe infer that the mg ii lines must be formed at the same distance. the mg iiabsorption fulfills the criteria for broad absorption lines defined by weymannet al. (1991). this large distance is surprising, since bals are generallythought to be formed in outflows at a much smaller distance from the nucleus.

astro-ph;0107441	the reddest quasars	in a survey of quasar candidates selected by matching the first and 2masscatalogs, we have found two extraordinarily red quasars. first j013435.7-093102is a 1 jy source at z=2.216 and has b-k &gt; 10, while first j073820.1+275045 is a2.5 mjy source at z=1.985 with b-k = 8.4. first j073820.1+275045 has strongabsorption lines of mgii and civ in the rest frame of the quasar and is highlypolarized in the rest frame ultraviolet, strongly favoring the interpretationthat its red spectral energy distribution is caused by dust reddening local tothe quasar. first j073820.1+275045 is thus one of the few low radio-luminosity,highly dust-reddened quasars known. the available observational evidence forfirst j013435.7-093102 leads us to conclude that it too is reddened by dust. weshow that first j013435.7-093102 is gravitationally lensed, increasing thenumber of known lensed, extremely dust-reddened quasars to at least three,including mg0414-0534 and pks1830-211. we discuss the implications of whetherthese objects are reddened by dust in the host or lensing galaxies. if reddenedby their local environment, then we estimate that between 10 and 20% of theradio-loud quasar population is reddened by dust in the host galaxy. thediscovery of first j073820.1+275045 and objects now emerging from x-ray surveyssuggests the existence of an analogous radio-quiet red quasar population. suchobjects will be entirely missed by standard radio or optical quasar surveys. ifdust in the lensing galaxies is primarily responsible for the extreme rednessof the lensed quasars, then an untold number of gravitationally lensed quasarsare being overlooked.

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0110437	optical counterparts for 70,000 radio sources: apm identifications for  the first radio survey	we describe a program to identify optical counterparts to radio sources fromthe vla first survey using the cambridge apm scans of the poss-i plates. we useradio observations covering 4150 square degrees of the north galactic cap to a20 cm flux density threshold of 1.0 mjy; the 382,892 sources detected all havepositional uncertainties of &lt;1" (radius of 90% confidence). our description ofthe apm catalog, derived from the 148 poss-i o and e plates covering thisregion, includes an assessment of its astrometric and photometric accuracy, aphotometric recalibration using the minnesota aps catalog, a discussion of theclassification algorithm, and quantitative tests of the catalog's reliabilityand completeness. we go on to show how the use of first sources as astrometricstandards allows us to improve the absolute astrometry of the poss plates bynearly an order of magnitude to ~0.15" rms. matching the radio and opticalcatalogs yields counterparts for over 70,000 radio sources; we include detaileddiscussions of the reliability and completeness of these identifications as afunction of optical and radio morphology, optical magnitude and color, andradio flux density. an analysis of the problem of radio sources with complexmorphologies (e.g., double-lobed radio galaxies) is included. we conclude witha brief discussion of the source classes represented among the radio sourceswith identified counterparts.

astro-ph;0111184	evolution of the ionizing background and the epoch of reionization from  the spectra of z~6 quasars	we study the process of cosmic reionization and estimate the ionizingbackground in the igm using the lyman series absorption in the spectra of thefour quasars at 5.7&lt;z&lt;6.3 discovered by the sdss. we derive the evolution ofthe ionizing background at high redshifts, using both semi-analytic techniquesand cosmological simulations to model the density fluctuations in the igm. theexistence of the complete ly alpha gunn-peterson trough in the spectrum of thez=6.28 quasar sdss 1030+0524 indicates a photoionization rate gamma_{-12} atz~6 lower than 0.08, at least a factor of 6 smaller than the value at z~3. thely beta and ly gamma gunn-peterson troughs give an even stronger limitgamma_{-12}&lt;0.02 due to their smaller oscillator strengths, indicating that theionizing background in the igm at z~6 is more than 20 times lower than that atz~3. meanwhile, the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction increases from10^{-5} at z~3 to &gt;10^{-3} at z~6. at this redshift, the mass-averaged neutralhydrogen fraction is larger than 1%; the mildly overdense regions (delta &gt; 3)are still mostly neutral and the comoving mean free path of ionizing photons isshorter than 8 mpc. comparison with simulations of cosmological reionizationshows that the observed properties of the igm at z~6 are typical of those inthe era at the end of the overlap stage of reionization when the individual hiiregions merge. thus, z~6 marks the end of the reionization epoch. the redshiftof reionization constrains the small scale power of the mass densityfluctuations and the star forming efficiency of the first generation ofobjects.

astro-ph;0201447	first 0747+2739: a first/2mass quasar with an overabundance of c iv  absorption systems	we present a keck esi spectrum of first 074711.2+273904, a k=15.4 quasar withredshift 4.11 that is detected by both first and 2mass. the spectrum containsat least 14 independent c iv absorption systems longward of the ly-alphaforest. these systems are found over a path length of delta z = 0.984,constituting one of the highest densities per unit redshift of c iv absorptionever observed. one of the c iv systems is trough-like and resembles a weakbal-type outflow. two of the c iv are ``associated'' absorption systems with|v|&lt;3000 km/s. of the 11 remaining systems with v&gt;3000 km/s, eight are eitherresolved or require multiple discrete systems to fit the line profiles. inaddition to c iv absorption, there are two low-ionization mg ii absorptionsystems along with two damped ly-alpha systems, at least one of which may be ac iv system. the overdensity of c iv absorption spans a redshift range of deltaz=1. superclusters along the line of sight are unlikely to cause an overdensitystretching over such a long redshift path, thus the absorption may be anexample of narrow, high-velocity, intrinsic absorption that originates from thequasar. we suggest that this quasar is a member of a transitional class of balquasars where we are just barely seeing the spatial, density, or temporal edgeof the bal-producing region (or period); the multiple high-velocity absorptionsystems may be the remnants (or precursors) of a stronger bal outflow. ifcorrect, then some simpler absorption line complexes in other quasars may alsobe due to outflowing rather than intervening material.

astro-ph;0206163	an felobal binary quasar	in an ongoing infrared imaging survey of quasars at keck observatory, we havediscovered that the z=1.285 quasar sdss j233646.2-010732.6 comprises two pointsources with a separation of 1.67". resolved spectra show that one component isa standard quasar with a blue continuum and broad emission lines; the other isa broad absorption line (bal) quasar, specifically, a bal qso with prominentabsorption from mgii and metastable feii, making it a member of the ``felobal''class. the number of known felobals has recently grown dramatically from asingle example to more than a dozen, including a gravitationally lensed exampleand the binary member presented here, suggesting that this formerly rare objectmay be fairly common. additionally, the presence of this bal quasar in arelatively small separation binary adds to the growing evidence that the balphenomenon is not due to viewing a normal quasar at a specific orientation, butrather that it is an evolutionary phase in the life of many, if not all,quasars, and is particularly associated with conditions found in interactingsystems.

astro-ph;0208383	first j102347.6+003841: the first radio-selected cataclysmic variable	we have identified the 1.4 ghz radio source first j102347.6+003841 (hereafterfirst j1023+0038) with a previously unknown 17th-mag galactic cataclysmicvariable (cv). the optical spectrum resembles that of a magnetic (am herculis-or dq herculis-type) cv. five nights of optical ccd photometry showedvariations on timescales of minutes to hours, along with rapid flickering. are-examination of the first radio survey data reveals that the radio detectionwas based on a single 6.6 mjy flare; on two other occasions the source wasbelow the ~1 mjy survey limit. several other magnetic cvs are known to bevariable radio sources, suggesting that first j1023+0038 is a new member ofthis class (and the first cv to be discovered on the basis of radio emission).however, first j1023+0038 is several optical magnitudes fainter than the otherradio-detected magnetic cvs. it remains unclear whether the source simply had avery rare and extraordinarily intense radio flare at the time of the firstobservation, or is really an unusually radio-luminous cv; thus furtherobservations are urged.

astro-ph;0208422	a young blue tidal stream in ngc 5128	stellar streams in galaxy halos are the natural consequence of a history ofmerging and accretion. we present evidence for a blue tidal stream of youngstars in the nearest giant elliptical galaxy, ngc 5128 (centaurus a). usingoptical ubvr color maps, unsharp masking, and adaptive histogram equalization,we detect a blue arc in the northwest portion of the galaxy that traces apartial ellipse with an apocenter of 8 kpc. we also report the discovery ofnumerous young star clusters that are associated with the arc. the brightest ofthese clusters is spectroscopically confirmed, has an age of 350 myr, and maybe a proto-globular cluster. it is likely that this arc, which is distinct fromthe surrounding shell system and the young jet-related stars in the northeast,is a tidally disrupted stellar stream orbiting the galaxy. both the age derivedfrom the integrated optical colors of the stream and its dynamical disruptiontimescale have values of 200-400 myr. we propose that this stream of youngstars was formed when a dwarf irregular galaxy, or similar sized gas fragment,underwent a tidally triggered burst of star formation as it fell into ngc 5128and was disrupted 300 myr ago. the stars and star clusters in this stream willeventually disperse and become part of the main body of ngc 5128, suggestingthat the infall of gas-rich dwarfs plays a role in the building of stellarhalos and globular cluster systems.

astro-ph;0212407	discovery of a high-redshift (z=0.96) cluster of galaxies using a first  wide-angle tailed radio source	using a combination of near-infrared and optical photometry, along withmulti-object spectroscopy, we have confirmed the existence of a high-redshiftcluster of galxies at z = 0.96. the cluster was found using a wide-angle tailedradio source selected from the vla first survey as a cluster signpost. thesetypes of radio sources are often found in clusters, and are thought to attaintheir c-shaped morphologies from the relative motion between the radio sourcehost galaxy and the intracluster medium. we present optical/near-infraredcolor-magnitude diagrams which show a concentration of cluster galaxies incolor space. we also include spectroscopic results obtained from the keck iilris. ten galaxies are confirmed at the cluster redshift, with a line-of-sightvelocity dispersion of 530 +190/-90 km/s, typical of an abell richness class 0cluster. using data from the rosat public archive, we limit the x-rayluminosity for the cluster to less than 3 x 10^{44} erg/s, consistent with thevalue expected from the l_x - sigma relation.

astro-ph;0301135	a survey of z&gt;5.7 quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ii: discovery  of three additional quasars at z&gt;6	we present the discovery of three new quasars at z&gt;6 in 1300 deg^2 of sdssimaging data, j114816.64+525150.3 (z=6.43), j104845.05+463718.3 (z=6.23) andj163033.90+401209.6 (z=6.05). the first two objects have weak ly alpha emissionlines; their redshifts are determined from the positions of the lyman break.they are only accurate to 0.05 and could be affected by the presence of broadabsorption line systems. the last object has a ly alpha strength more typicalof lower redshift quasars. based on a sample of six quasars at z&gt;5.7 that cover2870 deg^2 presented in this paper and in paper i, we estimate the comovingdensity of luminous quasars at z 6 and m_{1450} &lt; -26.8 to be (8 +/-3)x10^{-10} mpc^{-3} (for h_0 = 50 km/s/mpc, omega = 1). hst imaging of twoz&gt;5.7 quasars and high-resolution ground-based images (seeing 0.4'') of threeadditional z&gt;5.7 quasars show that none of them is gravitationally lensed. theluminosity distribution of the high-redshfit quasar sample suggests the brightend slope of the quasar luminosity function at z 6 is shallower than psil^{-3.5} (2-sigma), consistent with the absence of strongly lensed objects.

astro-ph;0303476	probing the ionization state of the universe at z&gt;6	we present high signal-to-noise ratio keck esi spectra of the two quasarsknown to have gunn-peterson absorption troughs, sdss j1030+0524 (z=6.28) andsdss j1148+5251 (z=6.37). the ly alpha and ly beta troughs for sdss j1030+0524are very black and show no evidence for any emission over a redshift intervalof ~0.2 starting at z=6. on the other hand, sdss j1148+5251 shows a number ofemission peaks in the ly beta gunn-peterson trough along with a single weakpeak in the ly alpha trough. the ly alpha emission has corresponding ly betaemission, suggesting that it is indeed a region of lower optical depth in theintergalactic medium at z=6.08.  the stronger ly beta peaks in the spectrum of sdss j1148+5251 couldconceivably also be the result of "leaks" in the igm, but we suggest that theyare instead ly alpha emission from an intervening galaxy at z=4.9. thishypothesis gains credence from a strong complex of c iv absorption at the sameredshift and from the detection of continuum emission in the ly alpha trough atthe expected brightness. if this proposal is correct, the quasar light hasprobably been magnified through gravitational lensing by the interveninggalaxy. the stromgren sphere observed in the absorption spectrum of sdssj1148+5251 is significantly smaller than expected based on its brightness,which is consistent with the hypothesis that the quasar is lensed.  if our argument for lensing is correct, the optical depths derived from thetroughs of sdss j1148+5251 are only lower limits (albeit still quite strong,with tau(lya)&gt;16 inferred from the ly beta trough.) the ly beta absorptiontrough of sdss j1030+0524 gives the single best measurement of the igmtransmission at z&gt;6, with an inferred optical depth tau(lya)&gt;22.

astro-ph;0304028	an i-band-selected sample of radio-emitting quasars: evidence for a  large population of red quasars	we present a new sample of 35 quasars selected from the first radio surveyand the deeprange i-band survey (postman et al. 1998, 2002). a comparison withthe first bright quasar survey samples reveals that this i-band selected sampleis redder by 0.25-0.5 mag in b-r, and that the color difference is notexplained by the higher mean redshift of this sample but must be intrinsic. oursmall sample contains five quasars with unusually red colors, including threethat appear very heavily reddened. our data are fitted well with normal bluequasar spectra attenuated by more than 2.5 magnitudes of extinction in thei-band.  the red quasars are only seen at low redshifts (z&lt;1.3). even with a magnitudelimit i&lt;20.5, our survey is deep enough to detect only the most luminous ofthese red quasars at z~1; similar objects at higher redshifts would fall belowour in i-band limit. indeed, the five most luminous objects (using dereddenedmagnitudes) with z&lt;1.3 are all red. our data strongly support the hypothesisthat radio quasars are dominated by a previously undetected population of red,heavily obscured objects. unless highly reddened quasars are preferentiallyalso highly luminous, there must be an even larger, as yet undiscovered,population of red quasars at lower luminosity. we are likely to be finding onlythe most luminous tip of the red quasar iceberg.  five of our six z&lt;1 quasars are associated with deeprange cluster candidatesof similar estimated redshifts. this association is very unlikely to be theresult of chance. it has some surprising implications, including thepossibility that up to half of the deeprange clusters at z~1 have associatedquasars.

astro-ph;0304377	sdss j092455.87+021924.9: an interesting gravitationally lensed quasar  from the sloan digital sky survey	we report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the sloandigital sky survey, sdss j092455.87+021924.9 (sdss j0924+0219). this object wasselected from among known sdss quasars by an algorithm that was designed toselect another known sdss lensed quasar (sdss 1226-0006a,b). five separatecomponents, three of which are unresolved, are identified in photometricfollow-up observations obtained with the magellan consortium's 6.5m walterbaade telescope at las campanas observatory. two of the unresolved components(designated a and b) are confirmed to be quasars with z=1.524; the velocitydifference is less than 100 km sec^{-1} according to spectra taken with the w.m. keck observatory's keck ii telescope on mauna kea. a third stellarcomponent, designated c, has the colors of a quasar with redshift similar tocomponents a and b. the maximum separation of the point sources is 1.78". theother two sources, designated g and d, are resolved. component g appears to bethe best candidate for the lensing galaxy. although component d is near theexpected position of the fourth lensed component in a four image lens system,its properties are not consistent with being the image of a quasar at z~1.5.nevertheless, the identical redshifts of components a and b and the presence ofcomponent c strongly suggest that this object is a gravitational lens. ourobservations support the idea that a foreground object reddens the fourthlensed component and that another unmodeled effect (such as micro- ormilli-lensing) demagnificates it, but we cannot rule out the possibility thatsdss0924+0219 is an example of the relatively rare class of ``three component''lens systems.

astro-ph;0307371	sdss j0903+5028: a new gravitational lens	we report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the sloandigital sky survey, sdss j090334.92+502819.2. this object was targeted for sdssspectroscopy as a luminous red galaxy (lrg), but manual examination of thespectrum showed the presence of a quasar at z= 3.6 in addition to a red galaxyat z=0.388, and the sdss image showed a second possible quasar image nearby.follow-up imaging and spectroscopy confirmed the lensing hypothesis. in imagestaken at the arc 3.5-meter telescope, two quasars are separated by 2.8arc-seconds; the lensing galaxy is clearly seen and is blended with one of thequasar images. spectroscopy taken at the keck ii telescope shows that thequasars have identical redshifts of z=3.6 and both show the presence of thesame broad absorption line-like troughs. we present simple lens models whichaccount for the geometry and magnifications. the lens galaxy lies near twogroups of galaxies and may be a part of them. the models suggest that thegroups may contribute considerable shear and may have a strong effect on thelens configuration.

astro-ph;0402345	microlensing of the broad emission line region in the quadruple lens  sdss j1004+4112	we present seven epochs of spectroscopy on the quadruply imaged quasar sdssj1004+4112, spanning observed-frame time delays from 1 to 322 days. the spectrareveal differences in the emission lines between the lensed images.specifically, component a showed a strong enhancement in the blue wings ofseveral high-ionization lines relative to component b, which lasted at least 28days (observed frame) then faded. since the predicted time delay between a andb is &lt;30 days, our time coverage suggests that the event was not intrinsic tothe quasar. we attribute these variations to microlensing of part of the broademission line region of the quasar, apparently resolving structure in thesource plane on a scale of ~10^{16} cm at z=1.734. in addition, we observedsmaller differences in the emission line profiles between components a and bthat persisted throughout the time span, which may also be due to microlensingor millilensing. further spectroscopic monitoring of this system holdsconsiderable promise for resolving the structure of the broad emission lineregion in quasars.

0808.3668	the first-2mass red quasar survey ii: an anomalously high fraction of  lobals in searches for dust-reddened quasars	we present results on a survey to find extremely dust-reddened type-1quasars. combining the first radio survey, the 2mass infrared survey and thesloan digital sky survey, we have selected a candidate list of 122 potentialred quasars. with more than 80% spectroscopically identified objects, well over50% are classified as dust-reddened type 1 quasars, whose reddenings (e(b-v))range from approximately 0.1 to 1.5 magnitudes. they lie well off the colorselection windows usually used to detect quasars and many fall within thestellar locus, which would have made it impossible to find these objects withtraditional color selection techniques. the reddenings found are much moreconsistent with obscuration happening in the host galaxy rather than stemmingfrom the dust torus. we find an unusually high fraction of broad absorptionline (bal) quasars at high redshift, all but one of them belonging to the lowionization bal (lobal) class and many also showing absorption the metastablefeii line (felobal). the discovery of further examples of dust-reddened lobalquasars provides more support for the hypothesis that bal quasars (at leastlobal quasars) represent an early stage in the lifetime of the quasar. the factthat we see such a high fraction of bals could indicate that the quasar is in ayoung phase in which quasar feedback from the bal winds is suppressing starformation in the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0411195	hubble advanced camera for surveys observations of the z=6.42 quasar  sdss 1148+5251: a leak in the gunn-peterson trough	the hubble advanced camera for surveys has been used to obtain a narrow-bandimage of the weak emission peak seen at lambda=7205 a in the gunn-peterson lybeta absorption trough of the highest redshift quasar, sdss j1148+5251. theemission looks perfectly point-like; there is no evidence for the interveninggalaxy that we previously suggested might be contaminating the quasar spectrum.we derive a more accurate astrometric position for the quasar in the twofilters and see no indication of gravitational lensing. we conclude that thelight in the ly beta trough is leaking through two unusually transparent,overlapping windows in the igm absorption, one in the ly beta forest at z ~ 6and one in the ly alpha forest at z ~ 5.  if there are significant optical depth variations on velocity scales smallcompared with our spectral resolution (~150 km/s), the ly alpha trough becomesmore transparent for a given ly beta optical depth. such variations can onlystrengthen our conclusion that the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igmincreases dramatically at z&gt;6. we argue that the transmission in the ly betatrough is not only a more sensitive measure of the neutral fraction than is lyalpha, it also provides a less biased estimator of the neutral hydrogenfraction than does the ly alpha transmission.

astro-ph;0512082	constraining the evolution of the ionizing background and the epoch of  reionization with z ~ 6 quasars ii: a sample of 19 quasars	we study the evolution of the ionization state of the igm at the end of thereionization epoch using spectra of a sample of nineteen quasars at 5.74&lt;z&lt;6.42discovered in the sdss. three methods are used to trace igm properties: (a) theevolution of the gunn-peterson optical depth in the ly alpha,beta, and gamma;(b) the distribution of dark absorption gaps, and (c) the size of hii regionsaround quasars. we find that the evolution of the igm accelerated at z&gt;5.7: theoptical depth evolution changes from tau ~ (1+z)^{4.3} to (1+z)^{&gt;11}, and theaverage length of dark gaps with tau&gt;3.5 increases from &lt;10 to &gt;80 comovingmpc. the dispersion of igm properties along different lines of sight alsoincreases rapidly, implying fluctuations by a factor of &gt;4 in the uv backgroundat z&gt;6, when the mean free path of uv photons is comparable to the correlationlength of galaxies. the mean length of dark gaps shows the most dramaticincrease at z~6, as well as the largest varianace. we suggest using dark gapstatistics as a powerful probe of the ionization state of the igm at yet higherredshift. the sizes of hii regions around quasars decrease rapidly towardshigher redshift, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the igm has increasedby a factor of &gt;10 from z=5.7 to 6.4. the mass-averaged neutral fraction is1-4% at z~6.2 based on the gp optical depth and hii region sizes. theobservations suggest that z~6 is the the end of the overlapping stage ofreionization, and are inconsistent with a neutral igm at z~6, as indicated bythe finite length of dark absorption gaps.

astro-ph;0607140	mass determination and detection of the onset of chromospheric activity  for the sub-stellar object in ef eridani	ef eri is a magnetic cataclysmic variable that has been in a low accretionstate for the past nine years. low state optical spectra reveal the underlyingzeeman-split white dwarf absorption lines. these features are used to determinea value of 13-14 mg as the white dwarf field strength. recently, 5-7 years intothe low state, balmer and other emission lines have appeared in the optical. ananalysis of the h$\alpha$ emission line yields the first radial velocitysolution for ef eri, leading to a spectroscopic ephemeris for the binary and,using the best available white dwarf mass of 0.6m${\odot}$, a mass estimate forthe secondary of 0.055m${\odot}$. for a white dwarf mass of 0.95m${\odot}$, theaverage for magnetic white dwarfs, the secondary mass increases to0.087m${\odot}$. at ef eri's orbital period of 81 minutes, this higher masssecondary could not be a normal star and still fit within the roche lobe. thesource of the balmer and other emission lines is confirmed to be from thesub-stellar secondary and we argue that it is due to stellar activity. wecompare ef eri's emission line spectrum and activity behavior to that recentlyobserved in am her and vv pup and attributed to stellar activity. we exploreobservations and models originally developed for v471 tau, for the rs cvnbinaries, and for extra-solar planets. we conclude that irradiation of thesecondary in ef eri and similar systems is unlikely and, in polars, themagnetic field interaction between the two stars (with a possible tidalcomponent) is a probable mechanism which would concentrate chromosphericactivity on the secondary near the sub-stellar point of the white dwarf.

astro-ph;0607335	signals from the noise: image stacking for quasars in the first survey	we present a technique to explore the radio sky into the nanojansky regime byemploying image stacking using the first survey. we first discuss thenon-intuitive relationship between the mean and median values of a distributionthat is dominated by noise, followed by an analysis of the systematic effectspresent in first's 20cm vla snapshot images. image stacking allows us torecover the properties of source populations with fluxes a factor of 30 or morebelow the rms noise level. mean estimates of radio flux density, luminosity,etc., are derivable for any source class having arcsecond positional accuracy.  we use this technique to compute the mean radio properties for 41,295 quasarsfrom the sdss dr3 catalog. there is a tight correlation between optical andradio luminosity, with the radio luminosity increasing as the 0.85 power ofoptical luminosity. this implies declining radio-loudness with opticalluminosity: the most luminous objects (m=-28.5) have average radio-to-opticalratios 3 times lower than the least luminous objects (m=-20). there is also astriking correlation between optical color and radio loudness: quasars that areeither redder or bluer than the norm are brighter radio sources, with objects0.8 magnitudes redder than the sdss composite spectrum having radio-loudnessratios that are higher by a factor of 10. we explore the longstanding questionof whether a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy exists in quasars, finding thatoptical selection effects probably dominate the distribution function of radioloudness, which has at most a modest (~20%) inflection between the radio-loudand radio-quiet ends of the distribution. we also find, surprisingly, thatbroad absorption line quasars have higher mean radio flux densities, with thegreatest disparity arising in the rare low-ionization bal subclass.

astro-ph;0609526	high resolution mid-infrared imaging of radio ultra-compact hii regions	we present data from mid-infrared keck telescope imaging of 18 radio-selectedultra-compact hii region candidates at diffraction-limited resolution. the goalof these observations is to determine the sizes, luminosities, and morphologiesof the mid-infrared emitting dust surrounding the stellar sources. all 18sources were imaged at 11.7um and at 17.65um, and 10 of them were imaged alsoat 24.5um. all the sources were resolved. we have generated dust temperatureand optical depth maps and combine them with radial velocity measurements andradio data (1.4 and 5 ghz) to constrain the properties of these star-formingregions. half of our objects are excited by b-stars, and all our objects havederived types that are later than an o6 star. we find a significant correlationbetween infrared and radio flux densities, and a weaker one between infrareddiameters and the central source ionizing photon rates. this latter correlationsuggests that the more compact sources result from later spectral types ratherthan young age. our new data may suggest a revision to infrared color selectioncriteria of ultra-compact hii regions at resolutions &lt;1". these 18 sources arepart of a sample of 687 sources dominated by ultra-compact hii regions selectedby matching radio and infrared maps of the first galactic quadrant by giveonand coworkers. the new mid-infrared images constitute a significant improvementin resolving sub-structure at these wavelengths. if applied to all of thissample our analysis will improve our understanding of embedded star-formationin the galaxy.

astro-ph;9604148	the first bright qso survey	the first radio survey provides a new resource for constructing a largequasar sample. with source positions accurate to better than 1\arcsec\ and apoint source sensitivity limit of 1 mjy, it reaches 50 times deeper thanprevious radio catalogs. we report here on the results of the pilot phase for afirst bright quasar survey (fbqs). based on matching the radio catalog from theinitial 300 deg$^2$ of first coverage with the optical catalog from theautomated plate machine (apm) digitization of palomar sky survey plates, wehave defined a sample of 219 quasar candidates brighter than e = 17.50. we haveobtained optical spectroscopy for 151 of these and classified 25 others fromthe literature, yielding 69 quasars or seyfert~1 galaxies, of which 51 are newidentifications. the brightest new quasar has an e magnitude of 14.6 and z =0.91; four others are brighter than e = 16. the redshifts range from z=0.12 to3.42. half of the detected objects are radio quiet with l$_{\rm 21cm} &lt;10^{32.5}$ ergs/s. we use the results of this pilot survey to establishcriteria for the fbqs that will produce a quasar search program which will be70\% efficient and 95\% complete to a 21-cm flux density limit of 1.0 mjy.

astro-ph;9702012	the first radio-loud broad absorption line qso and evidence for a hidden  population of quasars	we have discovered two low-ionization broad absorption line quasars inprograms to obtain optical spectra for radio-selected quasar candidates fromthe vla first survey (becker, white, &amp; helfand 1995). both belong to theextremely rare class of bal qsos that exhibit narrow absorption lines frommetastable excited levels of fe ii and fe iii. until now, there was just asingle object in this class, 0059-2735 (hazard et al. 1987). in addition, oneof our new objects is the first known radio-loud bal qso. the properties ofthese three unusual objects suggest a trend of increasing radio luminosity withthe amount of absorption to the quasar, and are perhaps transition objectsbetween radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars. the two new objects are from aradio-selected sample comprising less than 200 quasars; one is heavilyattenuated at optical wavelengths in the observed frame. these objects would beeasily overlooked by most optical qso searches; their abundance in the radiosample suggests that they may be representatives of a largely undetectedcomponent of the quasar population, perhaps as numerous as ordinarylow-ionization bal qsos which constitute 1-2% of all qsos.

astro-ph;9709174	constraining omega_0 with the angular-size redshift relation of  double-lobed quasars in the first survey	in previous attempts to measure omega_0 from the angular size-redshift(theta-z) relation of double-lobed radio sources, the observed data have beenconsistent with a static euclidean universe, rather than with friedmann models,and past authors have disagreed as to what effects are responsible. theseresults may be due to a variety of selection effects, different sampledefinitions, and inconsistencies in the analysis undermining the results. usingthe vla first survey, we investigate the theta-z relation for a new sample of103 double-lobed quasars, carefully addressing the various potential problemswhich, we believe, have compromised past work. before focusing on cosmologicalconstraints, we investigate the possible impact of correlations among theintrinsic properties of these sources over the entire assumed range of allowedcosmological parameter values. for all cases, we find only mild apparent sizeevolution which is found to arise mainly from a power-size correlation coupledwith a power-redshift correlation; intrinsic size evolution is consistent withzero. we also find that in all cases, an evolution-free subsample can bedefined, whose theta-z relation should arise mainly from cosmological effects.contrary to past work, we find that the observed theta-z relation for oursample is more consistent with standard friedmann models than with a staticeuclidean universe. in particular, we find that a flat, matter-dominateduniverse, a flat universe with a cosmological constant, and an open universeall provide comparably good fits to the data, with the latter two models bothyielding omega_0 \approx 0.35 with 1-sigma ranges including values between \sim0.25 and 1.0; the evolution-free subsamples yield values of omega_0 near unity,though with even greater error ranges.

astro-ph;9903140	what determines the depth of bals? keck hires observations of balqso  1603+300	we find that the depth and shape of the broad absorption lines (bals) inbalqso 1603+3002 are determined largely by the fraction of the emitting sourcewhich is covered by the bal flow. in addition, the observed depth of the balsis poorly correlated with their real optical depth. the implication of thisresult is that abundance studies based on direct extraction of column densitiesfrom the depth of the absorption troughs are unreliable. our conclusion isbased on analysis of unblended absorption features of two lines from the sameion (in this case the si iv doublet), which allows unambiguous separation ofcovering factor and optical depth effects. the complex morphology of thecovering factor as a function of velocity suggests that the bals are producedby several physically separated outflows. the covering factor is ion dependentin both depth and velocity width. we also find evidence that in balqso1603+3002 the flow does not cover the broad emission line region.
