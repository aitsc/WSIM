0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

1001.5042	the host galaxies of core-collapse supernovae and gamma ray bursts	we present a comparative study of the galactic and small scale environmentsof gamma-ray bursts (grb) and core collapse supernovae (ccsn). we use a sampleof 34 grb hosts at z&lt;1.2, and a comparison sample of 58 supernova hosts locatedwithin the great observatories origins deep survey footprint. we fit templatespectra to the available photometric data, which span the range 0.45-24 micron,and extract absolute magnitudes, stellar masses and star formation rates fromthe resulting fits. our results broadly corroborate previous findings, butoffer significant enhancements in spectral coverage and a factor 2-3 increasein sample size. specifically, we find that ccsn occur frequently in massivespirals (spiral fraction ~50%). in contrast grbs occur in small, relatively lowmass galaxies with high specific and surface star formation rates, and have aspiral fraction of only ~10%. a comparison of the rest frame absolutemagnitudes of the grb and ccsn sample is less conclusive than found in previouswork, suggesting that while grb hosts are typically both smaller and bluer thanthose of ccsn their total blue light luminosities are only slightly lower. wesuggest this is likely due to rapid periods of intensified star formationactivity, as indicated by the high specific star formation rates, which bothcreate the grb progenitors and briefly significantly enhance the host galaxyblue luminosity. finally, our analysis of local environments of grbs and ccsnshows that grbs are highly concentrated on their host light, and further occurin regions of higher absolute surface luminosity than ccsn.

1002.3164	do wolf-rayet stars have similar locations in hosts as type ib/c  supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts?	aims: we study the distribution of wolf-rayet (wr) stars and their subtypeswith respect to their host galaxy light distribution. we thus want toinvestigate whether wr stars are potential progenitors of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae (sne) and/or long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs).methods: we derived the relative surface brightness (fractional flux) at thelocations of wr stars and compared with similar results for lgrbs and sne. weexamined two nearby galaxies, m 83 and ngc 1313, for which a comprehensivestudy of the wr population exists. these two galaxies contain a sufficientlylarge number of wr stars and sample different metallicities. to enable thecomparison, the images of the galaxies were processed to make them appear asthey would look at a higher redshift. the robustness of our results againstseveral sources of uncertainty was investigated with the aid of monte carlosimulations. results: we find that the wc star distribution favours brighterpixels than the wn star population. wc stars are more likely drawn from thesame distribution as sne ic than from other sn distributions, while wn starsshow a higher degree of association with sne ib. it can also not be excludedthat wr (especially wc) stars are related to lgrbs. some differences betweenthe two galaxies do exist, especially in the subtype distributions, and maystem from differences in metallicity. conclusions: although a conclusive answeris not possible, the expectation that wr stars are the progenitors of sne ib/cand lgrbs survives this test. the trend observed between the distributions ofwn and wc stars, as compared to those of sne ib and ic, is consistent with thetheoretical picture that sne ic result from progenitors that have been strippedof a larger part of their envelope.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1007.2185	the unusual x-ray emission of the short swift grb 090515: evidence for  the formation of a magnetar?	the majority of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to originate fromthe merger of compact binary systems collapsing directly to form a black hole.however, it has been proposed that both sgrbs and long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs)may, on rare occasions, form an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) prior tofinal collapse. grb 090515, detected by the swift satellite was extremelyshort, with a t_90 of 0.036 +/- 0.016 s, and had a very low fluence of 2 x10^-8 erg cm^-2 and faint optical afterglow. despite this, the 0.3 - 10 kevflux in the first 200 s was the highest observed for a sgrb by the swift x-raytelescope (xrt). the x-ray light curve showed an unusual plateau and steepdecay, becoming undetectable after ~500 s. this behaviour is similar to thatobserved in some long bursts proposed to have magnetars contributing to theiremission. in this paper, we present the swift observations of grb 090515 andcompare it to other gamma-ray bursts (grbs) in the swift sample. additionally,we present optical observations from gemini, which detected an afterglow ofmagnitude 26.4 +/- 0.1 at t+ 1.7 hours after the burst. we discuss potentialcauses of the unusual 0.3 - 10 kev emission and suggest it might be energyinjection from an unstable millisecond pulsar. using the duration and flux ofthe plateau of grb 090515, we place constraints on the millisecond pulsar spinperiod and magnetic field.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

0704.2525	a case of mistaken identity? grb 060912a and the nature of the long --  short grb divide	we investigate the origin of the grb 060912a, which has observationalproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burstambiguous. short duration grbs (sgrbs) are thought to have typically lowerenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populationsof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the longduration bursts. however, it has become clear that duration alone isinsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. grb060912a had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, lowredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been thehost, which would favour it being a short-burst. however, our deep opticalimaging and spectroscopy of the location of grb 060912a using the vlt showsthat grb 060912a more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy atz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst. this demonstrates the risk inidentifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given grbs without furthersupporting evidence. further, it implies that, in the absence of secureidentifications, "host" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely ongalaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any givengrb.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1203.1919	the metal-enriched host of an energetic gamma-ray burst at z ~ 1.6	(abridged) long gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies might open a short-cut tothe characteristics of typical star-forming galaxies throughout the history ofthe universe. due to the absence of near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy, however,detailed investigations, specifically a determination of the gas-phasemetallicity of gamma-ray burst hosts, was largely limited to redshifts z &lt; 1 todate. here, we report observations of the galaxy hosting grb 080605 at z = 1.64using optical/nir spectroscopy and high-resolution hst/wfc3 imaging. we availof vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy to measure the metallicity, electron density,star-formation rate (sfr), and reddening of the host. specifically, we usedifferent strong-line diagnostics based on [n ii] to robustly measure thegas-phase metallicity for the first time for a grb host at this redshift. thehost of the energetic (e_iso ~ 2 x 10^53 erg) grb 080605 is a morphologicallycomplex, vigorously star-forming galaxy with an h\alpha-derived sfr of 31m_sun/yr. its ism is significantly enriched with metals with an oxygenabundance between 8.3 and 8.6 depending on the adopted strong-line calibrator.this corresponds to values in the range of 0.4-0.8 times the solar value. forits measured stellar mass of 8 x 10^9 m_sun and sfr this value is consistentwith the fundamental metallicity relation defined by star-forming fieldgalaxies. our observations directly illustrate that grb hosts are notnecessarily metal-poor, both on absolute scales as well as relative to theirstellar mass and sfr. grb hosts could thus be fair tracers of the population ofordinary star-forming galaxies as a whole at high redshift.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1205.4239	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. vi. radio observations  at z&lt;1 and consistency with typical star-forming galaxies	the objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured starformation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb)hosts; and to test the hypothesis that grb hosts have properties consistentwith those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. we present a radiocontinuum survey of all z&lt;1 grb hosts in the optically unbiased grb host(tough) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-swift) grb-snhosts discovered before october 2006. we present new radio data for 22 objectsand have obtained a detection for three of them (grb 980425, 021211, 031203;none in the tough sample), increasing the number of radio-detected grb hostsfrom two to five. the star formation rate (sfr) for the grb 021211 host of ~825mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a grb host, places it in the categoryof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. we found that at least 63% of grb hostshave sfr &lt; 100 mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have sfr &gt; 500 mo yr^-1. for theundetected hosts the mean radio flux (&lt;35 ujy 3sigma) corresponds to an averagesfr &lt; 15 mo yr^-1. moreover, ~88% of the z&lt;1 grb hosts have ultraviolet dustattenuation a_uv &lt; 6.7 mag (visual attenuation a_v &lt; 3 mag). hence we did notfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of grb hosts. finally,we found that the distributions of sfrs and a_uv of grb hosts are consistentwith those of lyman break galaxies, halpha emitters at similar redshifts and ofgalaxies from cosmological simulations. the similarity of the grb populationwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that grbs, aleast at z&lt;1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are thereforeless biased indicators than once thought.

1207.6088	galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z sub-dlas/dlas and mgii  absorbers towards gamma-ray bursts	we present the first search for galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z(2&lt;z&lt; 3.6) sub-dlas and dlas towards grbs. our final sample comprises of fiveintervening sub-dlas and dlas in four grb fields. to identify candidate galaxycounterparts of the absorbers we use deep optical and near-infrared imaging,and low-, mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy acquired with 6 to 10-m classtelescopes, the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes. furthermore, we usethe spectroscopic information and spectral-energy-distribution fittingtechniques to study them in detail. our main result is the detection andspectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy counterpart of the intervening dla atz=3.096 in the field of grb 070721b (z_grb=3.6298) as proposed by otherauthors. we also identify good candidates for the galaxy counterparts of thetwo strong mgii absorbers at z=0.6915 and 1.4288 towards grb 050820a(z_grb=2.615). the properties of the detected dla galaxy are typical forlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at similar redshifts; a young, highly starforminggalaxy that shows evidence for a galactic outflow. this supports the hypothesisthat a dla can be the gaseous halo of an lbg. in addition, we report a redshiftcoincidence of different objects associated with metal lines in the same field,separated by 130-161 kpc. the high detection rate of three correlatedstructures on a length scale as small as ~150 kpc in two pairs of lines ofsight is intriguing. the absorbers in each of these are most likely not part ofthe same gravitationally bound structure. they more likely represent groups ofgalaxies.

1209.4654	illuminating the darkest gamma-ray bursts with radio observations	we present x-ray, optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of grbs110709b and 111215a, as well as optical and near-ir observations of their hostgalaxies. the combination of x-ray detections and deep optical/near-infraredlimits establish both bursts as "dark". sub-arcsecond positions enabled byradio detections lead to robust host galaxy associations, with opticaldetections that indicate z &lt; 4 (110709b) and 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 2.7 (111215a). using theradio and x-ray data for each burst we find that grb 110709b requires a_v &gt; 5.3mag and grb 111215a requires a_v &gt; 8.5 mag (z=2), among the largest extinctionvalues inferred for dark bursts to-date. the two bursts also exhibit largeneutral hydrogen column densities (n_h &gt; 10^22/cm^2; z=2) as inferred fromtheir x-ray spectra, in agreement with the trend for dark grbs. finally, wefind that for both bursts the afterglow emission is best explained by acollimated outflow with a total beaming-corrected energy of e_gamma+e_k ~ 7-9 x10^51 erg (z=2) expanding into a wind medium with a high density (n~100-350cm^-3 at 10^17 cm). while the energy release is typical of long grbs, theinferred density may be indicative of larger mass loss rates for grbprogenitors in dusty (and hence metal rich) environments. this studyestablishes the critical role of radio observations in determining the originand properties of dark grbs. observations with the jvla and alma will provide asample with sub-arcsecond positions and robust host associations that will helpshed light on obscured star formation and the role of metallicity in grbprogenitors.

1301.0629	signatures of magnetar central engines in short grb lightcurves	a significant fraction of the long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) in the swiftsample have a plateau phase showing evidence of ongoing energy injection. wesuggest that many short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) detected by the swiftsatellite also show evidence of energy injection. explaining this observationwithin the typical sgrb progenitor model is challenging as late time accretion,often used to explain plateaus in lgrbs, is likely to be absent from the sgrbpopulation. alternatively, it is predicted that the remnant of ns-ns mergersmay not collapse immediately to a bh (or even collapse at all), forming insteadan unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) which powers a plateau phase in thex-ray lightcurve. by fitting the magnetar model to all of the swift sgrbsobserved until may 2012, we find that about half can be clearly fitted with amagnetar plateau phase while the rest are consistent with forming a magnetarbut the data are insufficient to prove a plateau phase. more data, both atearly times and a larger sample, are required to confirm this. this model canbe tested by detecting the gravitational wave emission from events using thenext generation gravitational wave observatories.

0712.2186	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts. i. comparing pre-swift and  swift era long/soft (type ii) grb optical afterglows	we have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of swift-era gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows including grbs up toseptember 2009, for a total of 76 grbs, and present an additional threepre-swift grbs not included in an earlier sample. furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 grb afterglows,including large data sets for grbs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820a, 050922c,060418, 080413a and 080810. we analyzed the light curves of all grbs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-swift afterglows. theresults of a former study, which showed that grb afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. we found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(swift-era and pre-swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. we derived bolometric isotropic energies for all grbs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the grb in thez=1 system. a comparative study of the optical luminosities of grb afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

1301.5903	a population of massive, luminous galaxies hosting heavily dust-obscured  gamma-ray bursts: implications for the use of grbs as tracers of cosmic star  formation	we present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavilydust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swift satellite duringthe years 2005-2009, representing all grbs with an unambiguous host-frameextinction of a_v&gt;1 mag from this period. deep observations with keck, gemini,vlt, hst, and spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establishspectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us toprovide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellarmasses, and mean extinctions. compared to the hosts of unobscured grbs atsimilar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured grbs are (onaverage) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidlystar-forming and dust-obscured. while this demonstrates that grbs populate alltypes of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems atz~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall grb population continues to show ahighly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference forlow-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely sfr-selectedgalaxy sample. this supports the notion that the grb rate is strongly dependenton metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the universeunderwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 gyr ago. we alsoconclude that, based on the absence of unobscured grbs in massive galaxies andthe absence of obscured grbs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions ofthe lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, whileintermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 m_sun) have diverse internal properties.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1303.0844	x-ray absorption evolution in gamma-ray bursts: intergalactic medium or  evolutionary signature of their host galaxies?	the intrinsic x-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is often found to beabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. the extracomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the hostgalaxy of the grb itself. there is an apparent correlation between theequivalent column density of hydrogen, n(h,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at thegrb redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z&gt;6 grbs showing the greatestintrinsic column densities. we investigate the n(h,intrinsic) - z relationusing a large sample of swift grbs, as well as active galactic nuclei (agn) andquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energydistributions of the two highest redshift grbs. various possible sample biasesand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and weconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. this may indicateeither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contributionfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) orintervening absorbing clouds. employing a more realistic model for igmabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of theobserved opacity at z&gt;~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 k and10^6.5 k, and moderately metal enriched, z~0.2 z_sun. this material couldtherefore constitute the warm hot intergalactic medium. however, a comparablelevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of interveningcold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to saywhich, if either, dominates. at lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in thehost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed x-rayabsorption.

1304.1173	superluminous x-rays from a superluminous supernova	the discovery of a population of superluminous supernovae (slsne), with peakluminosities a factor of ~100 brighter than normal sne (typically slsne havem_v &lt;-21), has shown an unexpected diversity in core-collapse supernovaproperties. numerous models have been postulated for the nature of theseevents, including a strong interaction of the shockwave with a densecircumstellar environment, a re-energizing of the outflow via a central engine,or an origin in the catastrophic destruction of the star following a loss ofpressure due to pair production in an extremely massive stellar core (so-calledpair instability supernovae). here we consider constraints that can be placedon the explosion mechanism of hydrogen-poor slsne (slsne-i) via x-rayobservations, with xmm-newton, chandra and swift, and show that at least oneslsne-i is likely the brightest x-ray supernovae ever observed, with l_x ~10^45 ergs/s, ~150 days after its initial discovery. this is a luminosity 3orders of magnitude higher than seen in other x-ray supernovae powered viacircumstellar interactions. such high x-ray luminosities are sufficient toionize the ejecta and markedly reduce the optical depth, making it possible tosee deep into the ejecta and any source of emission that resides there.alternatively, an engine could have powered a moderately relativistic jetexternal to the ejecta, similar to those seen in gamma-ray bursts. if thedetection of x-rays does require an engine it implies that these sne do createcompact objects, and that the stars are not completely destroyed in a pairinstability event. future observations will determine which, if any, of thesemechanisms are at play in superluminous supernovae.

1306.4971	a "kilonova" associated with short-duration gamma-ray burst 130603b	short-duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are intense flashes of cosmicgamma-rays, lasting less than ~2 s, whose origin is one of the great unsolvedquestions of astrophysics today. while the favoured hypothesis for theirproduction, a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellarobjects (specifically, two neutron stars, ns-ns, or a neutron star and a blackhole, ns-bh), is supported by indirect evidence such as their host galaxyproperties, unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. mergers ofthis kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-richradioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient in the daysfollowing the burst, a so-called "kilonova". indeed, it is speculated that thismechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in theuniverse. recent calculations suggest much of the kilonova energy should appearin the near-infrared (nir) due to the high optical opacity created by theseheavy r-process elements. here we report strong evidence for such an eventaccompanying sgrb 130603b. if this simplest interpretation of the data iscorrect, it provides (i) support for the compact object merger hypothesis ofsgrbs, (ii) confirmation that such mergers are likely sites of significantr-process production and (iii) quite possibly an alternative, un-beamedelectromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection ofgravitational waves.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1407.4456	connecting grbs and ulirgs: a sensitive, unbiased survey for radio  emission from gamma-ray burst host galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5	luminous infrared galaxies and submillimeter galaxies contributesignificantly to stellar mass assembly and the frequency of grbs in thesesystems provides an important test of the connection between the gamma-rayburst rate and that of overall cosmic star-formation. we present sensitive 3ghz radio observations using the karl g. jansky very large array of 32uniformly-selected grb host galaxies spanning a redshift range from 0 &lt; z &lt;2.5, providing the first fully dust- and sample-unbiased measurement of thefraction of grbs originating from the universe's most bolometrically luminousgalaxies. four galaxies are detected, with inferred radio star-formation ratesranging between 50-300 msun/yr. three of the four detections correspond toevents consistent with being optically-obscured "dark" bursts. our overalldetection fraction implies that between 9-23% of grbs between 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5occur in galaxies with s_3ghz &gt; 10 ujy, corresponding to sfr &gt;50 msun/yr at z~1or &gt;250 msun/yr at z~2. similar galaxies contribute approximately 10-30% of allcosmic star-formation, so our results are consistent with a grb rate which isnot strongly biased with respect to the total star-formation rate of a galaxy.however, all four radio-detected hosts have modest stellar masses (~few x 10^10msun), significantly lower than ir/submillimeter-selected field galaxies ofsimilar luminosities. we suggest that the grb rate may be suppressed inmetal-rich environments but independently enhanced in intense starbursts,producing a strong efficiency dependence on mass but little net dependence onbulk galaxy star-formation rate.

1408.2520	alma observations of the host galaxy of grb090423 at z=8.23: deep limits  on obscured star formation 630 million years after the big bang	we present rest-frame far-infrared (fir) and optical observations of the hostgalaxy of grb090423 at z=8.23 from the atacama large millimeter array (alma)and the spitzer space telescope, respectively. the host remains undetected to3-sigma limits of fnu(222 ghz)&lt;33 microjy and fnu(3.6 micron)&lt;81 njy. the firlimit is about 20 times fainter than the luminosity of the local ulirg arp220,and comparable to the local starburst m82. comparing to model spectral energydistributions we place a limit on the ir luminosity of l_ir(8-1000 micron)&lt;3e10lsun, corresponding to a limit on the obscured star formation rate of sfr_ir&lt;5msun/yr; for comparison, the limit on the unobscured star formation rate fromhubble space telescope rest-frame uv observations is sfr_uv&lt;1 msun/yr. we alsoplace a limit on the host galaxy stellar mass of &lt;5e7 msun (for a stellarpopulation age of 100 myr and constant star formation rate). finally, wecompare our millimeter observations to those of field galaxies at z&gt;4 (lymanbreak galaxies, ly-alpha emitters, and submillimeter galaxies), and find thatour limit on the fir luminosity is the most constraining to date, although thefield galaxies have much larger rest-frame uv/optical luminosities than thehost of grb090423 by virtue of their selection techniques. we conclude that grbhost galaxies at z&gt;4, especially those with measured interstellar mediummetallicities from afterglow spectroscopy, are an attractive sample for futurealma studies of high redshift obscured star formation.

0803.4017	grb 070306: a highly extinguished afterglow	we report on the highly extinguished afterglow of grb 070306 and theproperties of the host galaxy. an optical afterglow was not detected at thelocation of the burst, but in near-infrared a doubling in brightness during thefirst night and later power-law decay in the k band provided a clear detectionof the afterglow. the host galaxy is relatively bright, r ~ 22.8. an opticallow resolution spectrum revealed a largely featureless host galaxy continuumwith a single emission line. higher resolution follow-up spectroscopy showsthis emission to be resolved and consisting of two peaks separated by 7 aa,suggesting it to be [o ii] at a redshift of z = 1.49594 +- 0.00006. theinfrared color h-k = 2 directly reveals significant reddening. by modeling theoptical/x-ray spectral energy distribution at t = 1.38 days with anextinguished synchrotron spectrum, we derive a_v = 5.5 +- 0.6 mag. this isamong the largest values ever measured for a grb afterglow and visualextinctions exceeding unity are rare. the importance of early nir observationsis obvious and may soon provide a clearer view into the once elusive 'darkbursts'.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

0705.1705	on the nature of the short duration grb 050906	we present deep optical and infrared observations of the short duration grb050906. although no x-ray or optical/ir afterglow was discovered to deeplimits, the error circle of the grb (as derived from the swift bat) is unusualincontaining the relatively local starburst galaxy ic328. this makes grb 050906a candidate burst from a soft-gamma repeater, similar to the giant flare fromsgr 1806-20. the probability of chance alignment of a given bat position withsuch a galaxy is small (&lt;1%), although the size of the error circle (2.6arcminute radius) is such that a higher-z origin can't be ruled out. indeed,the error circle also includes a moderately rich galaxy cluster at z=0.43,which is a plausible location for the burst given the apparent preference thatshort grbs have for regions of high mass density. no residual optical orinfrared emission has been observed, either in the form of an afterglow orlater time emission from any associated supernova-like event. we discuss theconstraints these limits place on the progenitor of grb 050906 based on theexpected optical signatures from both sgrs and merging compact object systems.

1503.04246	the optically unbiased gamma-ray burst host (tough) survey. vii. the  host galaxy luminosity function: probing the relationship between grbs and  star formation to redshift $\sim6$	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) offer a route to characterizing star-forming galaxiesand quantifying high-$z$ star formation that is distinct from the approach oftraditional galaxy surveys: grb selection is independent of dust and probeseven the faintest galaxies that can evade detection in flux-limited surveys.however, the exact relation between the grb rate and the star formation rate(sfr) throughout all redshifts is controversial. the optically unbiased grbhost (tough) survey includes observations of all grb hosts (69) in an opticallyunbiased sample of swift grbs and we utilize these to constrain the evolutionof the uv grb-host-galaxy luminosity function (lf) between $z=0$ and $z=4.5$,and compare this with lfs derived from both lyman-break galaxy (lbg) surveysand simulation modeling. at all redshifts we find the grb hosts to be mostconsistent with a luminosity function derived from sfr weighted modelsincorporating grb production via both metallicity-dependent and independentchannels with a relatively high level of bias toward low metallicity hosts. inthe range $1&lt;z&lt;3$ an sfr weighted lbg derived (i.e., non-metallicity biased) lfis also a reasonable fit to the data. between $z\sim3$ and $z\sim6$, we observean apparent lack of uv bright hosts in comparison with lbgs, though thesignificance of this shortfall is limited by nine hosts of unknown redshift.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

0806.1182	photometry and spectroscopy of grb 060526: a detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst	aims: with this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (grb) 060526 at $z=3.221$.methods: we present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for agrb afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. the data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. the afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.the absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of grb 060526. results: thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. it shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. the broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. the metallicity derived from\ion{s}{ii} and \ion{fe}{ii} of [s/h] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [fe/h] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other grb hosts at similar redshifts. at the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to f775w(ab) = 28.5 mag with the hst,implying an absolute magnitude of the host m(1500 \aa{})$&gt;$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the grb may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

1511.00667	high metallicity lgrb hosts	we present our imaging and spectroscopic observations of the host galaxies oftwo dark long bursts with anomalously high metallicities, lgrb 051022 and lgrb020819b, which in conjunction with another lgrb event with an optical afterglowcomprise the three lgrbs with high metallicity host galaxies in the graham &amp;fruchter (2013) sample. in graham &amp; fruchter (2013), we showed that lgrbsexhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicityenvironments (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.4 in the kk04 scale) in spite of these threecases with abundances of about solar and above. these exceptions however areconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparablebrightness &amp; redshift. this is surprising: even among a preselected sample ofhigh metallicity lgrbs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for theseobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typicalmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. therefore wededuce that it is possible to form an lgrb in a high metallicity environmentalthough with greater rarity.  from this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for thepresence of the lgrbs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)lgrbs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in highmetallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments thathave become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remainunenriched. (2) the lgrb formation mechanism while preferring low metallicityenvironments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline inburst formation with increasing metallicity. (3) the typical low metallicitylgrbs and the few high metallicity cases are the result of physically differentburst formation pathways with only the former affected by the metallicity andthe later occurring much more infrequently.

astro-ph;0107529	a comparison of da white dwarf temperatures and gravities from lyman and  balmer line studies	we present measurements of the effective temperatures and surface gravitiesfor a sample of hot da white dwarfs, using the lyman line data available fromthe hut, orfeus and fuse far-uv space missions. comparing the results withthose from the standard balmer line technique, we find that there is a generalgood overall agreement between the two methods. however, significantdifferences are found for a number of stars, but not always of a consistentnature in that sometimes the balmer temperature exceeds that derived from thelyman lines and in other instances is lower. we conclude that, with the latestmodel atmosphere calculations, these discrepancies probably do not arise froman inadequate theoretical treatment of the lyman lines but rather fromsystematic effects in the observation and data reduction processes, whichdominate the statistical errors in these spectra. if these systematic datareduction effects can be adequately controlled, the lyman line temperature andgravity measurements are consistent with those obtained from the balmer lineswhen allowance is made for reasonable observational uncertainties.

0808.2610	grb 070714b - discovery of the highest spectroscopically confirmed short  burst redshift	we detect the optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 070714b. ourobservations of the afterglow show an initial plateau in the lightcurve forapproximately the first 5 to 25 minutes, then steepening to a powerlaw decaywith index alpha= 0.86 +/- 0.10 for the period between 1 to 24 hours postburst. this is consistent with the x-ray light-curve which shows an initialplateau followed by a similar subsequent decay. at late time, we detect a hostgalaxy at the location of the optical transient. gemini nod &amp; shufflespectroscopic observations of the host show a single emission line at 7167angstroms which, based on a grizjhk photometric redshift, we conclude is the3727 angstrom [o ii] line. we therefore find a redshift of z=0.923. thisredshift, as well as a subsequent probable spectroscopic redshift determinationof grb 070429b at z=0.904 by two other groups, significantly exceeds theprevious highest spectroscopically confirmed short burst redshift of z=0.546for grb 051221. this dramatically moves back the time at which we know shortbursts were being formed, and suggests that the present evidence for an oldprogenitor population may be observationally biased.

astro-ph;0306077	a comparison of da white dwarf temperatures and gravities from fuse  lyman line and ground-based balmer line observations	observation of the strengths and profiles of the hydrogen balmer absorptionseries is an established technique for determining the effective temperatureand surface gravity of hot h-rich white dwarf stars. in principle, the lymanseries lines should be equally useful but, lying in the far-uv, are onlyaccessible from space. nevertheless, there are situations (for example, wherethe optical white dwarf spectrum is highly contaminated by the presence of acompanion) in which use of the lyman series may be essential. therefore, it isimportant to establish whether or not the lyman lines provide an equally validmeans of measurement. we have already made a first attempt to study thisproblem, comparing lyman line measurements from a variety of far-uv instrumentswith ground-based balmer line studies. within the measurement uncertainties wefound the results from each line series to be broadly in agreement. however, wenoted a number of potential systematic effects that could bias eithermeasurement. with the availability of the fuse data archive and observationsfrom our own guest observer programmes, we now have an opportunity of examiningthe use of the lyman series in more detail from observations of 16 da whitedwarfs. the new results partially reproduce the earlier study, showing thatbalmer and lyman line determined temperatures are in good agreement up to\~50000k. however, above this value there is an increasing systematicdifference between the lyman and balmer line results, the former yielding thehigher temperature.

astro-ph;0412222	a near-ir spectroscopic search for very-low-mass cool companions to  notable da white dwarfs	we have undertaken a detailed near-ir spectroscopic analysis of eight notablewhite dwarfs, predominantly of southern declination. in each case the spectrumfailed to reveal compelling evidence for the presence of a spatiallyunresolved, cool, late-type companion. therefore, we have placed an approximatelimit on the spectral-type of a putative companion to each degenerate. fromthese limits we conclude that if gd659, gd50, gd71 or wd2359-434 possesses anunresolved companion then most probably it is substellar in nature(m&lt;0.072msun). furthermore, any spatially unresolved late-type companion to rej0457-280, re j0623-374, re j0723-274 or re j2214-491 most likely hasm&lt;0.082msun. these results imply that if weak accretion from a nearby late-typecompanion is the cause of the unusual photospheric composition observed in anumber of these degenerates then the companions are of very low mass, beyondthe detection thresholds of this study. furthermore, these results do notcontradict a previously noted deficit of very-low-mass stellar and brown dwarfcompanions to main sequence f,g,k and early-m type primaries (a&lt;1000au).

astro-ph;0508011	grb050223: a faint gamma-ray burst discovered by swift	grb050223 was discovered by the swift gamma-ray burst explorer on 23 february2005 and was the first gamma-ray burst to be observed by both swift andxmm-newton. at the time of writing (may 2005), it has one of the faintest grbafterglows ever observed. the spacecraft could not slew immediately to theburst, so the first x-ray and optical observations occurred approximately 45minutes after the trigger. although no optical emission was found by anyinstrument, both swift and xmm-newton detected the fading x-ray afterglow.combined data from both of these observatories show the afterglow to be fadingmonotonically as 0.99 +0.15/-0.12 over a time frame between 45 minutes to 27hours post-burst. spectral analysis, allowed largely by the higher through-putof xmm-newton, implies a power-law with a slope of gamma=1.75 +0.19/-0.18 andshows no evidence for absorption above the galactic column of 7 x 10^20 cm^-2.  from the x-ray decay and spectral slopes, a low electron power-law index of p= 1.3-1.9 is derived; the slopes also imply that a jet-break has not occured upto 27 hours after the burst. the faintness of grb050223 may be due to a largejet opening or viewing angle or a high redshift.

astro-ph;0509167	an origin in the local universe for some short gamma-ray bursts	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) divide into two classes: "long", which typically haveinitial durations of t90&gt;2s, and "short", with durations of t90&lt;2s (where t90is the time to detect 90% of the observed fluence). long bursts, which onaverage have softer gamma-ray spectra, are known to be associated with withstellar core-collapse events-- in some cases simultaneously producing powerfultype ic supernovae. in contrast, the origin of short bursts has remainedmysterious until recently. a subsecond intense "spike" of gamma-rays during agiant flare from the galactic soft gamma-ray repeater, sgr 1806-20, reopened anold debate over whether some short grbs could be similar events seen ingalaxies out to ~70mpc (redshift z=0.016). shortly after that, localizations ofa few short grbs (with optical afterglows detected in two cases) have shown anapparent association with a variety of host galaxies at moderate redshifts.here we report a correlation between the locations of previously observed shortbursts and the positions of galaxies in the local universe, indicating thatbetween 10 and 25 per cent of short grbs originate at low redshifts (z&lt;0.025).

astro-ph;0602444	probing cosmic chemical evolution with gamma-ray bursts: grb060206 at  z=4.048	aim: we present early optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-rayburst grb 060206 with the aim of determining the metallicity of the grbabsorber and the physical conditions in the circumburst medium. we also discusshow grbs may be important complementary probes of cosmic chemical evolution.method: absorption line study of the grb afterglow spectrum. results: wedetermine the redshift of the grb to be z=4.04795+/-0.00020. based on themeasurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped lyman-alphaline and the metal content from weak, unsaturated sii lines we derive ametallicity of [s/h] =-0.84+/-0.10. this is one of the highest metallicitiesmeasured from absorption lines at z~4. from the very high column densities forthe forbidden siii*, oi*, and oi** lines we infer very high densities and lowtemperatures in the system. there is evidence for the presence of h$_2$molecules with logn(h_2) ~ 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of logf\~ -3.5 with f=2n(h_2)/(2n(h_2)+ n(hi)). even if grbs are only formed by singlemassive stars with metallicities below ~0.3z(solar), they could still be fairlyunbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z&gt;2. hence, metallicitiesas derived for grb060206 here for a complete sample of grb afterglows willdirectly show the distribution of metallicities for representative star-forminggalaxies at these redshifts.

astro-ph;0603282	the faint afterglow and host galaxy of the short-hard grb 060121	we present optical and x-ray observations of the afterglow and host galaxy ofthe short-hard grb 060121. the faint r-band afterglow is seen to decline ast^(-0.66) while the x-ray falls as t^-1.18, indicating the presence of thecooling break between the two frequencies. however, the r-band afterglow isvery faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the x-ray afterglow tothe optical regime (specifically, beta_ox ~ 0.2), while the k-band isconsistent with this extrapolation (beta_kx ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppressionof the optical flux. late time {\it hst} observations place stringent limits onthe afterglow r-band flux implying a break in the r-band lightcurve. they alsoshow that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which mostlikely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous opticallyidentified short-duration bursts. several neighboring galaxies also have veryred colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. we considerpossible explanations for the faintness and color of the burst. our preferredmodel is that the burst occurred at moderately high redshift and wassignificantly obscured; however, it is also possible that the burst lies at z &gt;4.5 in which case the faintness of the r-band afterglow could be attributed tothe lyman-break. we discuss the implications that either scenario would havefor the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0610071	soft gamma repeaters and short gamma ray bursts: making magnetars from  wd-wd mergers	recent progress on the nature of short duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) hasshown that a fraction of them originate in the local universe. these systemsmay well be the result of giant flares from soft gamma repeaters (sgrs)believed to be magnetars (neutron stars with extremely large magnetic fields &gt;=10^14 g). if these magnetars are formed via the core collapse of massive stars,then it would be expected that the bursts should originate from predominantlyyoung stellar populations. however, correlating the positions of batse shortbursts with structure in the local universe reveals a correlation with allgalaxy types, including those with little or no ongoing star formation. this isa natural outcome if, in addition to magnetars forming via the core collapse ofmassive stars, they also form via accretion induced collapse following themerger of two white dwarfs, one of which is magnetic. we investigate thispossibility and find that the rate of magnetar production via wd-wd mergers inthe milky way is comparable to the rate of production via core collapse.however, while the rate of magnetar production by core collapse is proportionalto the star formation rate, the rate of production via wd-wd mergers (whichhave long lifetimes) is proportional to the stellar mass density, which isconcentrated in early-type systems. therefore magnetars produced via wd-wdmergers may produce sgr giant flares which can be identified with early typegalaxies. we also comment on the possibility that this mechanism could producea fraction of the observed short duration grb population at low redshift.

astro-ph;0611554	the early and late-time spectral and temporal evolution of grb 050716	we report on a comprehensive set of observations of gamma ray burst 050716,detected by the swift satellite and subsequently followed-up rapidly in x-ray,optical and near infra-red wavebands. the prompt emission is typical oflong-duration bursts, with two peaks in a time interval of t90 = 68 seconds (15- 350 kev). the prompt emission continues at lower flux levels in the x-rayband, where several smaller flares can be seen, on top of a decaying lightcurve that exhibits an apparent break around 220 seconds post trigger. thistemporal break is roughly coincident with a spectral break. the latter can berelated to the extrapolated evolution of the break energy in the promptgamma-ray emission, and is possibly the manifestation of the peak flux breakfrequency of the internal shock passing through the observing band. a possible3 sigma change in the x-ray absorption column is also seen during this time.the late-time afterglow behaviour is relatively standard, with an electrondistribution power-law index of p = 2 there is no noticable temporal break outto at least 10 days. the broad-band optical/nir to x-ray spectrum indicates aredshift of z ~&gt; 2 for this burst, with a host-galaxy extinction value ofe(b-v) ~ 0.7 that prefers an smc-like extinction curve.

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.
