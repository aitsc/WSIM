0910.3611	x-ray emitting ghz-peaked spectrum galaxies: testing a  dynamical-radiative model with broad-band spectra	in a dynamical-radiative model we recently developed to describe the physicsof compact, ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) sources, the relativistic jets propagateacross the inner, kpc-sized region of the host galaxy, while the electronpopulation of the expanding lobes evolves and emits synchrotron andinverse-compton (ic) radiation. interstellar-medium gas clouds engulfed by theexpanding lobes, and photoionized by the active nucleus, are responsible forthe radio spectral turnover through free-free absorption (ffa) of thesynchrotron photons. the model provides a description of the evolution of thespectral energy distribution (sed) of gps sources with their expansion,predicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the x-ray to thegamma-ray frequency domain. here, we test this model with the broad-band sedsof a sample of eleven x-ray emitting gps galaxies with compact-symmetric-object(cso) morphology, and show that: (i) the shape of the radio continuum atfrequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for bythe ffa mechanism; (ii) the observed x-ray spectra can be interpreted asnon-thermal radiation produced via ic scattering of the local radiation fieldsoff the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal,accretion-disk dominated scenario. we also show that the relation between thehydrogen column densities derived from the x-ray (n_h) and radio (n_hi) data ofthe sources is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, if confirmed byfuture observations, would provide further support to our scenario ofhigh-energy emitting lobes.

1004.2124	first detection of vhe gamma-rays from sn 1006 by h.e.s.s	recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (vhe)luminosity of sn 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously publishedh.e.s.s. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of thissource. deep observations at vhe energies (above 100 gev) were carried out withthe high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) of cherenkov telescopes from2003 to 2008. more than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected toan improved analysis procedure. observations resulted in the detection of vhegamma-rays from sn 1006. the measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with apower-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the crabnebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established h.e.s.s. upperlimit. the source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlatedwith non-thermal x-rays. because the thickness of the vhe-shell is compatiblewith emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likelyto be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. the measured flux level can beaccounted for by inverse compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includesleptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matterdensity inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description ofthe multi-wavelength spectrum.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1204.5690	h.e.s.s. observations of the carina nebula and its enigmatic colliding  wind binary eta carinae	the massive binary system eta carinae and the surrounding hii complex, thecarina nebula, are potential particle acceleration sites from whichvery-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission could be expected. thispaper presents data collected during vhe \gamma-ray observations with theh.e.s.s. telescope array from 2004 to 2010, which cover a full orbit of etacarinae. in the 33.1-hour data set no hint of significant \gamma-ray emissionfrom eta carinae has been found and an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of7.7 x 10-13 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level) is derived above the energythreshold of 470 gev. together with the detection of high-energy (he; 0.1 gev &gt;e &gt; 100 gev) \gamma-ray emission by the fermi-lat up to 100 gev, and assuming acontinuation of the average he spectral index into the vhe domain, theseresults imply a cut-off in the \gamma-ray spectrum between the he and vhe\gamma-ray range. this could be caused either by a cut-off in the acceleratedparticle distribution or by severe \gamma-\gamma\ absorption losses in the windcollision region. furthermore, the search for extended \gamma-ray emission fromthe carina nebula resulted in an upper limit on the \gamma-ray flux of 4.2 x10-12 ph cm-2 s-1 (99% confidence level). the derived upper limit of ~23 on thecosmic-ray enhancement factor is compared with results found for the old-agemixed-morphology supernova remnant w 28.

1304.8071	h.e.s.s. discovery of vhe gamma-rays from the quasar pks 1510-089	the quasar pks 1510-089 (z=0.361) was observed with the h.e.s.s. array ofimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes during high states in the optical andgev bands, to search for very high energy (vhe, defined as e &gt;= 0.1 tev)emission. vhe \gamma-rays were detected with a statistical significance of 9.2standard deviations in 15.8 hours of h.e.s.s. data taken during march and april2009. a vhe integral flux of i(0.15 tev &lt; e &lt; 1.0 tev) = (1.0 +- 0.2 (stat) +-0.2 (sys) x 10^{-11} cm^{-2}s^{-1} is measured. the best-fit power law to thevhe data has a photon index of \gamma=5.4 +- 0.7 (stat) +- 0.3 (sys). the gevand optical light curves show pronounced variability during the period ofh.e.s.s. observations. however, there is insufficient evidence to claimstatistically significant variability in the vhe data. because of itsrelatively high redshift, the vhe flux from pks 1510-089 should sufferconsiderable attenuation in the intergalactic space due to the extragalacticbackground light (ebl). hence, the measured \gamma-ray spectrum is used toderive upper limits on the opacity due to ebl, which are found to be comparablewith the previously derived limits from relatively-nearby bl lac objects.unlike typical vhe-detected blazars where the broadband spectrum is dominatedby non-thermal radiation at all wavelengths, the quasar pks 1510-089 has abright thermal component in the optical to uv frequency band. among all vhedetected blazars, pks 1510-089 has the most luminous broad line region (blr).the detection of vhe emission from this quasar indicates a low level of\gamma-\gamma absorption on the internal optical to uv photon field.

1409.0253	long-term monitoring of pks 2155$-$304 with atom and h.e.s.s.:  investigation of optical/$\gamma$-ray correlations in different spectral  states	in this paper we report on the analysis of all the available optical and veryhigh-energy $\gamma$-ray ($&gt;$200 gev) data for the bl lac object pks2155$-$304, collected simultaneously with the atom and h.e.s.s. telescopes from2007 until 2009. this study also includes x-ray (rxte, swift) and high-energy$\gamma$-ray (fermi-lat) data. during the period analysed, the source wastransitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and wascharacterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on thetimescales of days and months. a flattening of the optical continuum with anincreasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but onlyoccasionally and only at higher flux levels. we did not find any universalrelation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes onthe timescales from days and weeks up to several years. on the other hand, wenoted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks inthe optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. the obtained results therefore indicate acomplex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of pks2155$-$304, with different correlation patterns holding at different epochs,and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux andcolour rather than a flux alone.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

astro-ph;0606049	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71: ii. a search for intra-day variability at  millimetre wavelengths with the iram 30 m telescope	we report on a densely time sampled polarimetric flux density monitoring ofthe bl lac object s5 0716+71 at 86 ghz and 229 ghz with the iram 30 m telescopewithin a coordinated broad spectral band campaign, centred around an integralobservation during november 10 to 16, 2003. our aim was to search forsignatures of inverse-compton "catastrophes". at 86 ghz, making use of a newcalibration strategy, we reach a relative rms accuracy of the flux densitymeasurements of 1.2%. at this frequency, s5 0716+71 showed no intra-dayvariability, but showed remarkable inter-day variability with a flux densityincrease of 34% during the first four observing days, which can not beexplained by source extrinsic causes. the 86 ghz linear polarization fractionof s5 0716+71 was unusually large 15.0+-1.8%. inter-day variability in linearpolarization at 86 ghz, with significance level &gt;~95%; sigma_p/&lt;p&gt;=15% andsigma_chi=6 deg., was also observed. from the emission variations at thesynchrotron turnover frequency (~86 ghz) we compute an apparent brightnesstemperature t_b,app&gt;1.4x10^14k at a redshift of 0.3, which exceeds by twoorders of magnitude the inverse-compton limit. a relativistic correction fort_b,app with a doppler factor delta &gt; 7.8 brings the observed brightnesstemperature down to the inverse compton limit. a more accurate lower limit ofdelta &gt; 14.0, is obtained from the comparison of the 86 ghz synchrotron fluxdensity and the upper limits for the synchrotron self-compton flux densityobtained from the integral observations. the relativistic beaming of theemission by this high doppler factor explains the non-detection of"catastrophic" inverse-compton avalanches by integral.

astro-ph;0607023	disentangling the synchrotron and inverse compton variability in the  x-ray emission of the intermediate bl lac object s5 0716+71	the possibility to detect simultaneously in the x-ray band the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic)emission of intermediate bl lac objects offers theunique opportunity to study contemporaneously the low- and high-energy tails ofthe electron distribution in the jets of these sources. we attempted todisentangle the x-ray spectral variability properties of both the low- andhigh-energy ends of the synchrotron and inverse compton emission of theintermediate bl lac object s5 0716+71. we carried out spectral, temporal andcross-correlation analyses of the data from a long xmm-newton pointing of s50716+71 and we compared our findings with previous results from past x-rayobservations. strong variability was detected during the xmm exposure.both thesynchrotron and inverse compton components were found to vary on time scales ofhours, implying a size of the emitting region of $r\la 0.7\delta /(1+z)$light-hours. the synchrotron emission was discovered to become dominant duringepisodes of flaring activity, following a harder-when-brighter trend. tightcorrelations were observed between variations in different energy bands. upperlimits on time lags between the soft and hard x-ray light curves are of theorder of a few hundred seconds.

0809.2227	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71, iii. rapid and correlated flux density  variability from radio to sub-mm bands	the bl lac object s5 0716+71 was observed in a global multi-frequencycampaign to search for rapid and correlated flux density variability andsignatures of an inverse-compton (ic) catastrophe during the states of extremeapparent brightness temperatures. the observing campaign involved simultaneousmonitoring at radio to ir/optical wavelengths centered around a 500-ks integralpointing (november 10-17, 2003). we present the combined analysis and resultsof the cm- to sub-mm observations including a detailed study of the inter- tointra-day variability and spectral characteristics of 0716+714. we furtherconstrain the variability brightness temperatures (t_b) and doppler factors(delta) comparing the radio-bands with the hard x-ray emission (3-200 kev).0716+714 was in an exceptionally high state (outburst) and different (slower)phase of short-term variability. the flux density variability in the cm- tomm-bands is dominated by a correlated, ~4 day time scale amplitude increase ofup to ~35% systematically more pronounced towards shorter wavelengths. thiscontradicts expectations from standard interstellar scintillation (iss) andsuggests a source-intrinsic origin of the variability. the derived lower limitsto t_b exceed the 10^12 k ic-limit by up to 3-4 orders of magnitude. assumingrelativistic boosting, we obtain robust and self-consistent lower limits ofdelta &gt;= 5-33, in good agreement with delta_vlbi obtained from vlbi studies andthe ic-doppler factors delta_ic &gt; 14-16 obtained from the integral data. sincea strong contribution from iss can be excluded and a simultaneous iccatastrophe was not observed, we conclude that relativistic doppler boostingnaturally explains the apparent violation of the theoretical limits withinstandard synchrotron-self-compton (ssc) jet models of agn.

astro-ph;9610007	an intense gamma-ray flare of pks1622-297	we report the observation by the compton gamma ray observatory of aspectacular flare of radio source pks 1622-297. a peak flux of 17e-6 cm^-2 s^-1(e &gt; 100 mev) was observed. the corresponding isotropic luminosity is 2.9e49erg/s. we find that pks 1622-297 exhibits gamma-ray intra-day variability. aflux increase by a factor of at least 3.6 was observed to occur in less than7.1 hours (with 99% confidence). assuming an exponential rise, thecorresponding doubling time is less than 3.8 hours. a significant flux decreaseby a factor of ~2 in 9.7 hours was also observed. without beaming, the rapidflux change and large isotropic luminosity are inconsistent with theelliot-shapiro condition (assuming that gas accretion is the immediate sourceof power for the gamma-rays). this inconsistency suggests that the gamma-rayemission is beamed. a minimum doppler factor of 8.1 is implied by the observedlack of pair-production opacity (assuming x-rays are emitted co-spatially withthe gamma-rays). simultaneous observation by egret and osse finds a spectrumadequately fit by a power law with photon index of -1.9. although thesignificance is not sufficient to establish this beyond doubt, the high-energygamma-ray spectrum appears to evolve from hard to soft as a flare progresses.

astro-ph;9709116	intraday variability in x-ray selected bl lacertae objects	we present a study of the intraday variability behaviour of two samples ofx-ray selected bl lac objects, the emss and exosat samples consisting of 22 and11 sources, respectively. in both samples we were able to detect intradayvariability in less than 40% of the sources only. the duty cycle (the fractionof time, when a bl lac object is variable) in x-ray selected bl lac objects is0.4 or less. the typical peak-to-peak amplitudes of the variability are 10%.typical time-scales and an activity parameter for our variable bl lac objectswere inferred from structure function and autocorrelation function analyses. inonly 4 bl lac objects we were able to measure a characteristic time-scale,which was in the range between 1.3 and 2.7 days. comparison with our previousstudy of a complete sample of radio-selected bl lac objects from the 1 jycatalogue shows that x-ray and radio-selected bl lac objects differ in theirduty cycle by a factor of 2 and the typical peak-to-peak amplitudes by a factorof 3. the observed time-scales are similar. we also found that the samemechanism may be responsible for the observed variability in the x-ray selectedand radio-selected bl lac objects. the expectations of the various schemeslinking x-ray selected and radio-selected bl lac objects have been compared toour observations. consistency is found for a scenario, where x-ray selected bllac objects have on average stronger magnetic fields and are seen underrelatively larger viewing angles than the radio-selected bl lac objects.however, the suggestion that x-ray selected bl lac objects have deceleratingjets and radio-selected bl lac objects accelerating jets can also not be ruledout.

astro-ph;9801007	markarian 501 in x-ray bright state - rxte observations	mrk 501 has been in a state of very high flux in x-rays and vhe gamma-raysduring 1997. in july 1997 near its hitherto maximum x-ray brightness intensemultifrequency observations of mrk 501 have been performed at radio, nearinfrared, optical, x-ray, and vhe gamma-ray frequencies.  here we report on rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) observations carried outin 1997 between july 11 and july 16. the x-ray spectrum has been well detectedup to 100 kev and is best described by a broken power law with spectral indicesalpha1=0.70 and alpha2=0.94 below and above the break energy 5.8 kev.  the x-ray flux from mrk 501 declined and flared by about 30% within about 3days each, showing an unusual anti-correlation between flux and spectralhardening of both power law components. the break energy remained constant.  the observed broad band and x-ray spectra confirm recent observations, thatthe synchrotron component in mrk 501 can extend up to energies of 100 kev withthe maximum power being emitted at hard x-rays. on longer time-scales thecut-off frequency of the synchrotron spectrum changes by more than two ordersof magnitude.

astro-ph;9811014	a study of high energy emission from the tev blazar mrk 501 during  multiwavelength observations in 1996	we present the results of a multiwavelength campaign for mrk 501 performed inmarch 1996 with asca, egret, whipple, and optical telescopes. in the x-rayband, a spectral break was observed around 2 kev. we report here for the firsttime the detection of high-energy gamma-ray flux from mrk 501 with egret with3.5 sigma significance (e&gt;100 mev). higher flux was also observed in april/may1996, with 4.0 sigma significance for e&gt;100 mev, and 5.2 sigma significance fore&gt;500 mev. the gamma-ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of thegamma-ray blazars. we find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistentwith that calculated from a one-zone ssc model in a homogeneous region. in thecontext of this model, we investigate the values of the magnetic field strengthand the beaming factor allowed by the observational results. we compare themarch 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in april 1997.between these two epochs, the tev flux increase is well correlated with thatobserved in kev range. the kev and tev amplitudes during the april 1997 flareare accurately reproduced, assuming that the population of synchrotron photonsin 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons, havingmaximum energies of g_max = 6.0e6. however, the tev spectrum observed duringmarch 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models. we find that thiscannot be explained by either higher order comptonization or the contributionof the `seed' ir photons from the host galaxy for the first-order externalradiation comptonization.

astro-ph;9902261	unusual radio variability in the bl lac object 0235+164	we present radio observations at three frequencies and contemporaneousoptical monitoring of the peculiar bl lac object ao 0235+164. during athree-week campaign with the vla we observed intraday variability in thissource and found a distinct peak which can be identified throughout the radiofrequencies and tentatively connected to the r-band variations. this event ischaracterized by unusual properties: its strength increases, and its durationdecreases with wavelength, and it peaks earlier at 20cm than at 3.6 and 6cm. wediscuss several generic models (a `standard' shock-in-jet model, a precessingbeam, free-free-absorption in a foreground screen, interstellar scattering, andgravitational microlensing), and explore whether they can account for ourobservations. most attempts at explaining the data on 0235+164 require anextremely small source size, which can be reconciled with the $10^{12}$ kinverse compton limit only when the doppler factor of the bulk flow is of order100. however, none of the models is completely satisfactory, and we suggestthat the observed variability is due to a superposition of intrinsic andpropagation effects.

0811.2964	modelling the broad-band spectra of x-ray emitting gps galaxies	the study of the broad-band emission of ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) radiogalaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the physical processes taking placein the central, kpc-sized region of their active hosts, where the jetspropagate and the lobes expand, interacting with the surrounding interstellarmedium (ism). we recently developed a new dynamical-radiative model to describethe evolution of the gps phenomenon (stawarz et al. 2008): as the relativisticjets propagate through the ism, gradually engulfing narrow-line emitting gasclouds along their way, the electron population of the expanding lobes evolves,emitting synchrotron light, as well as inverse-compton radiation viaup-scattering of the photon fields from the host galaxy and its active nucleus.the model, which successfully reproduces the key features of the gps radiosources as a class, provides a description of the evolution of their spectralenergy distribution (sed) with the lobes' expansion, predicting significant andcomplex x-ray to gamma-ray emission. we apply here the model to the broad-bandsed's of a sample of known, x-ray emitting gps galaxies, and show that: (i) thefree-free absorption mechanism enables us to reproduce the radio continuum atfrequencies below the turnover; (ii) the lobes' non-thermal, inverse-comptonemission can account for the observed x-ray spectra, providing a viablealternative to the thermal, accretion-dominated scenario. we also show that, inour sample, the relationship between the x-ray and radio hydrogen columndensitities, n_h and n_hi, is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, ifconfirmed, would support the scenario of high-energy emitting lobes.
