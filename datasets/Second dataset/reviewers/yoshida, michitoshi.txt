0906.3762	a massive substellar companion to the massive giant hd 119445	we detected a brown dwarf-mass companion around the intermediate-mass giantstar hd 119445 (g6iii) using the doppler technique. this discovery is the firstresult from a korean-japanese planet search program based on precise radialvelocity measurements. the radial velocity of this star exhibits a periodickeplerian variation with a period, semi-amplitude and eccentricity of 410.2days, 413.5 m/s and 0.082, respectively. adopting a stellar mass of 3.9m_solar, we were able to confirm the presence of a massive substellar companionwith a semimajor axis of 1.71 au and a minimum mass of 37.6 m_jup, which fallsin the middle of the brown dwarf-mass region. this substellar companion is themost massive ever discovered within 3 au of a central intermediate-mass star.the host star also ranks among the most massive stars with substellarcompanions ever detected by the doppler technique. this result supports thecurrent view of substellar systems that more massive substellar companions tendto exist around more massive stars, and may further constrain substellar systemformation mechanisms.

0707.3161	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds). iv. evolution of lya emitters  from z=3.1 to 5.7 in the 1 deg^2 field: luminosity functions and agn	we present luminosity functions (lfs) and various properties of lya emitters(laes) at z=3.1, 3.7, and 5.7, in a 1 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey (sxds) field. we obtain a photometric sample of 858 lae candidates basedon deep subaru/suprime-cam imaging data, and a spectroscopic sample of 84confirmed laes from subaru/focas and vlt/vimos spectroscopy in a survey volumeof ~10^6 mpc^3 with a limiting lya luminosity of ~3x10^42 erg/s. we derive thelfs of lya and uv-continuum (~1500 \aa) for each redshift, taking into accountthe statistical error and the field-to-field variation. we find that theapparent lya lf shows no significant evolution between z=3.1 and 5.7 withinfactors of 1.8 and 2.7 in l* and phi*, respectively. on the other hand, the uvlf of laes increases from z=3.1 to 5.7, indicating that galaxies with lyaemission are more common at earlier epochs. we identify six laes with agnactivities from our spectra combined with vla, spitzer, and xmm-newton data.among the photometrically selected laes at z=3.1 and 3.7, only ~1 % show agnactivities, while the brightest laes with logl(lya) &gt;~ 43.4-43.6 erg/s appearto always host agns. our laes are bluer in uv-continuum color than dropoutgalaxies, suggesting lower extinction and/or younger stellar populations. ourstacking analyses provide upper limits to the radio luminosity and thef(heii)/f(lya) line fraction, and constrain the hidden star formation(+low-luminosity agn) and the primordial population in laes.

1007.2961	statistics of 207 lya emitters at a redshift near 7: constraints on  reionization and galaxy formation models	we present lya luminosity function (lf), clustering measurements, and lyaline profiles based on the largest sample, to date, of 207 lya emitters (laes)at z=6.6 on the 1-deg^2 sky of subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. ourz=6.6 lya lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best-fit schechterparameters of phi*=8.5 +3.0/-2.2 x10^(-4) mpc^(-3) and l*(lya)=4.4 +/-0.6x10^42 erg s^(-1) with a fixed alpha=-1.5, and indicates a decrease from z=5.7at the &gt;~90% confidence level. however, this decrease is not large, only =~30%in lya luminosity, which is too small to be identified in the previous studies.a clustering signal of z=6.6 laes is detected for the first time. we obtain thecorrelation length of r_0=2-5 h^(-1) mpc and bias of b=3-6, and find nosignificant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at z=6.6. the averagehosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is 10^10-10^11 mo, and dutycycle of lae population is roughly ~1% albeit with large uncertainties. theaverage of our high-quality keck/deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of251 +/-16 km s^(-1). we find no large evolution of lya line profile from z=5.7to 6.6, and no anti-correlation between lya luminosity and line width at z=6.6.the combination of various reionization models and our observational resultsabout the lf, clustering, and line profile indicates that there would exist asmall decrease of igm's lya transmission owing to reionization, but that thehydrogen igm is not highly neutral at z=6.6. our neutral-hydrogen fractionconstraint implies that the major reionization process took place at z&gt;~7.

1008.0432	optical and near-infrared photometry of nova v2362 cyg : rebrightening  event and dust formation	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry of a classical nova,v2362 cyg (= nova cygni 2006). v2362 cyg experienced a peculiar rebrighteningwith a long duration from 100 to 240 d after the maximum of the nova. ourmulticolor observation indicates an emergence of a pseudophotosphere with aneffective temperature of 9000 k at the rebrightening maximum. after therebrightening maximum, the object showed a slow fading homogeneously in all ofthe used bands for one week. this implies that the fading just after therebrightening maximum ( less or equal 1 week ) was caused by a slowly shrinkingpseudophotosphere. then, the nir flux drastically increased, while the opticalflux steeply declined. the optical and nir flux was consistent with blackbodyradiation with a temperature of 1500 k during this nir rising phase. thesefacts are likely to be explained by dust formation in the nova ejecta. assumingan optically thin case, we estimate the dust mass of 10^(-8) -- 10^(-10)m_solar, which is less than those in typical dust-forming novae. these resultssupport the senario that a second, long-lasting outflow, which caused therebrightening, interacted with a fraction of the initial outflow and formeddust grains.

1008.2843	early spectroscopy of the 2010 outburst of u scorpii	we present early spectroscopy of the recurrent nova u~sco during the outburstin 2010. we successfully obtained time-series spectra at $t_{\rmd}=$0.37--0.44~d, where $t_{\rm d}$ denotes the time from the discovery of thepresent outburst. this is the first time-resolved spectroscopy on the firstnight of u sco outbursts. at $t_{\rm d}\sim 0.4$~d the h$\alpha$ line consistsof a blue-shifted ($-5000$ km s$^{-1}$) narrow absorption component and a wideemission component having triple peaks, a blue ($\sim -3000$ km s$^{-1}$), acentral ($\sim 0$ km s$^{-1}$) and a red ($\sim +3000$ km s$^{-1}$) ones. theblue and red peaks developed more rapidly than the central one during the firstnight. this rapid variation would be caused by the growth of aspherical windproduced during the earliest stage of the outburst. at $t_{\rm d}=1.4$~d theh$\alpha$ line has a nearly flat-topped profile with weak blue and red peaks at$\sim \pm 3000$ km s$^{-1}$. this profile can be attributed to a nearlyspherical shell, while the asphericity growing on the first night stillremains. the wind asphericity is less significant after $t_{\rm d}=9$ d.

1012.1503	spectropolarimetry of the superwind filaments of the starburst galaxy  m82: kinematics of dust outflow	spectropolarimetry results for the starburst galaxy m82 are presented. theoptical emission lines of the filaments in the energetic outflow ("superwind")from the nuclear starburst region of m82 are substantially polarized. theh-alpha polarization degrees and angles measured by our study are consistentwith previous narrowband imaging polarimetry data. the polarized emission linesare redshifted with respect to the emission lines in the total light andsystemic motion of the galaxy. the emission line intensity ratios [nii]/h-alphaand [sii]/h-alpha in the polarized light are similar to those of the nuclearstar-forming region. in addition, the electron density n_e derived fromthe[sii]6731/6717 line ratio of the polarized light is 600 - 1000 cm^-3 at adistance of more than 1 kpc from the nucleus, whereas the n_e derived from thetotal light are less than 300 cm^-3. these facts strongly suggest that theemission from the nuclear starburst of m82 is scattered by dust grainsentrained and transported outward by the superwind. a simple hollow biconicaloutflow model shows that the velocity of the outflowing dust grains, v_d,ranges from 100 to 200 km/s near the nucleus, decreases monotonically with thedistance from the nucleus, and reaches about 10 km/s at around 1 kpc. themotion of the dust is substantially slower than that of both ionized gas (~600km/s) and molecular gas (~200 km/s) at the same distance from the nucleus ofm82. this indicates that dust grains in the superwind are kinematicallydecoupled from both gas components at large radii. since the dust velocity v_dis much less than the escape velocity of m82 (~170 km/s at 1.5 kpc from thenucleus), most of the dust entrained by the superwind cannot escape tointergalactic space, and may fall back into the galaxy disk without anyadditional acceleration mechanisms (such as radiation pressure).

1101.4108	korean-japanese planet search program: substellar companions around  intermediate-mass giants	a korean-japanese planet search program has been carried out using the 1.8mtelescope at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory (boao) in korea, and the1.88m telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory (oao) in japan to searchfor planets around intermediate-mass giant stars. the program aims to show theproperties of planetary systems around such stars by precise doppler survey ofabout 190 g or k type giants together with collaborative surveys of theeast-asian planet search network. so far, we detected two substellar companionsaround massive intermediate-mass giants in the korean-japanese planet searchprogram. one is a brown dwarf-mass companion with 37.6 $m_{\mathrm{j}}$orbiting a giant hd 119445 with 3.9 $m_{\odot}$, which is the most massivebrown dwarf companion among those found around intermediate-mass giants. theother is a planetary companion with 1.8 $m_{\mathrm{j}}$ orbiting a giant starwith 2.4 $m_{\odot}$, which is the lowest-mass planetary companion among thosedetected around giant stars with $&gt;$ 1.9 $m_{\odot}$. plotting these systems oncompanion mass vs. stellar mass diagram, there seem to exist two unpopulatedregions of substellar companions around giants with 1.5--3 $m_{\odot}$ andplanetary companions orbiting giants with 2.4--4 $m_{\odot}$. the existence ofthese possible unpopulated regions supports a current characteristic view thatmore massive substellar companions tend to exist around more massive stars.

1105.0255	photopolarimetric monitoring of blazars in the optical and near-infrared  bands with the kanata telescope. i. correlations between flux, color, and  polarization	we report on the correlation between the flux, color and polarizationvariations on time scales of days--months in blazars, and discuss theiruniversal aspects. we performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical andnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using trispec attached to the "kanata"1.5-m telescope. we found that 28 blazars exhibited "bluer-when-brighter"trends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. this corresponds to88% of objects that were observed for &gt;10 days. thus, our observationunambiguously confirmed that the "bluer-when-brighter" trend is common in theemission from blazar jets. this trend was apparently generated by a variationcomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying redcomponent. prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended toexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decayphases around the flare maxima. in contrast to the strong flux--colorcorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relativelyweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. rotations ofpolarization were detected only in three objects: pks 1510-089, 3c 454.3, andpks 1749+096, and possibly in s5 0716+714. we also investigated the dependenceof the degree of variability on the luminosity and the synchrotron peakfrequency, \nu_peak. as a result, we found that lower luminosity and higher\nu_peak objects had smaller variations in their amplitudes both in the flux,color, and polarization degree. our observation suggests the presence ofseveral distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,colors, and polarizations. we propose that the energy injection by, forexample, internal shocks in relativistic shells is a major factor for blazarvariations on time scales of both days and months.

(2)107p/wilson-harrington is not a tumbler. the sidereal rotation period is 0.2979day. the shape is nearly spherical but slightly hexagonal with a short axismode (sam) of l1:l2:l3 = 1.5:1.5:1.0. the pole orientation is around {\lambda}= 330{\deg}, {\beta} = -27{\deg}. in addition, the model includes thepossibility of binary hosting. for both models, the sense of rotation isretrograde. furthermore, multiband photometry indicates that the taxonomy classof 107p/wilson-harrington is c-type. no clear rotational color variations areconfirmed on the surface.

1201.3029	multiband optical observation of p/2010 a2 dust tail	an inner main-belt asteroid, p/2010 a2, was discovered on january 6th, 2010.based on its orbital elements, it is considered that the asteroid belongs tothe flora collisional family, where s-type asteroids are common, whilst showinga comet-like dust tail. although analysis of images taken by the hubble spacetelescope and rosetta spacecraft suggested that the dust tail resulted from arecent head-on collision between asteroids (jewitt et al. 2010; snodgrass etal. 2010), an alternative idea of ice sublimation was suggested based on themorphological fitting of ground-based images (moreno et al. 2010). here, wereport a multiband observation of p/2010 a2 made on january 2010 with a 105 cmtelescope at the ishigakijima astronomical observatory. three broadbandfilters, $g'$, $r_c$, and $i_c$, were employed for the observation. the uniquemultiband data reveals that the reflectance spectrum of the p/2010 a2 dust tailresembles that of an sq-type asteroid or that of ordinary chondrites ratherthan that of an s-type asteroid. due to the large error of the measurement, thereflectance spectrum also resembles the spectra of c-type asteroids, eventhough c-type asteroids are uncommon in the flora family. the reflectancesrelative to the $g'$-band (470 nm) are 1.096$\pm$0.046 at the $r_c$-band (650nm) and 1.131$\pm$0.061 at the $i_c$-band (800 nm). we hypothesize that theparent body of p/2010 a2 was originally s-type but was then shattered uponcollision into scaterring fresh chondritic particles from the interior, thusforming the dust tail.

1203.0344	candidates of halpha emitting regions in magellanic stream iv cloud	from h\alpha narrow band observations, we identified three h\alpha emittingregions in the direction of magellanic stream iv (ms iv). they consist of threeparallel filaments with 2 arcmin width and 6 -- 30 arcmin length at 12 arcminintervals. the mean surface brightness of them is $\sim 2 \times 10^{-18}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. because of their low surface brightness, theregions were not detected in previous h\alpha surveys. in hi map, the positionof the filaments overlap ms, suggesting that they are parts of ms, but therealso exists a local hi structure. if the filaments associate with ms, the sizesare 30 pc $\times$ 100 -- 500 pc. the filaments lie at the leading edge of adownstream cloud, which supports a shock heating and its propagation (shockcascade) model for the ionizing source. if they are local objects, on the otherhand, fossil str\"omgren trails of more than two stars is a possibleinterpretation, and the sizes would be 0.1 pc $\times$ 0.3 -- 1.5 pc at 180 pcdistance. the positional information of the h\alpha filaments presented in thisletter enables us future spectroscopic observations to clarify their nature.

1308.5760	multi-wavelength studies of spectacular ram pressure stripping of a  galaxy: discovery of an x-ray absorption feature	we report the detection of an x-ray absorption feature near the galaxy m86 inthe virgo cluster. the absorber has a column density of 2-3 e20 /cm^2, and itsposition coincides with the peak of an intracluster hi cloud which was removedfrom the galaxy ngc 4388 presumably by ram pressure. these results indicatethat the hi cloud is located in front of m86 along the line-of-sight, andsuggest that the stripping was primarily created by an interaction between ngc4388 and the hot plasmas of the virgo cluster, not the m86 halo. by calculatingan x-ray temperature map, we further detected an x-ray counterpart of the hicloud up to about 3' south of m86. it has a temperature of 0.89 kev and a massof ~4.5 e8 solar mass, exceeding the estimated hi gas mass. the highhot-to-cold gas ratio in the cloud indicates a significant evaporation of thehi gas, probably by thermal conduction from the hotter cluster plasma with asub-spitzer rate.

1402.6192	extremely high polarization in 2010 outburst of blazar 3c 454.3	the gamma-ray-detected blazar 3c 454.3 exhibits dramatic flux andpolarization variations in the optical and near-infrared bands. in december2010, the object emitted a very bright outburst. we monitored it forapproximately four years (including the 2010 outburst) by optical andnear-infrared photopolarimetry. during the 2010 outburst, the object emittedtwo rapid, redder brightenings, at which the polarization degrees (pds) in bothbands increased significantly and the bands exhibited a frequency-dependentpolarization. the observed frequency-dependent polarization leads us to proposethat the polarization vector is composed of two vectors. therefore, we separatethe observed polarization vectors into short and long-term components that weattribute to the emissions of the rapid brightenings and the outburst thatvaried the timescale of days and months, respectively. the estimated pd of theshort-term component is greater than the maximum observed pd and is close tothe theoretical maximum pd. we constrain the bulk lorentz factors andinclination angles between the jet axis and the line of sight from theestimated pds. in this case, the inclination angle of the emitting region ofshort-term component from the first rapid brightening should be equal to90$^{\circ}$, because the estimated pd of the short-term component wasapproximately equal to the theoretical maximum pd. thus, the doppler factor atthe emitting region of the first rapid brightening should be equal to the bulklorentz factor.

1507.08424	discovery of a highly polarized optical microflare in the blazar s5  0716+714 during 2014 webt campaign	the occurrence of low-amplitude flux variations in blazars on hourlytimescales, commonly known as microvariability, is still a widely debatedsubject in high-energy astrophysics. several competing scenarios have beenproposed to explain such occurrences, including various jet plasmainstabilities leading to the formation of shocks, magnetic reconnection sites,and turbulence. in this letter we present the results of our detailedinvestigation of a prominent, five-hour-long optical microflare detected duringrecent webt campaign in 2014, march 2-6 targeting the blazar 0716+714. afterseparating the flaring component from the underlying base emission continuum ofthe blazar, we find that the microflare is highly polarized, with thepolarization degree $\sim (40-60)\%$$\pm (2-10)\%$, and the electric vectorposition angle $\sim (10 - 20)$deg$\pm (1-8)$deg slightly misaligned withrespect to the position angle of the radio jet. the microflare evolution in the$(q,\,u)$ stokes parameter space exhibits a looping behavior with acounter-clockwise rotation, meaning polarization degree decreasing with theflux (but higher in the flux decaying phase), and approximately stablepolarization angle. the overall very high polarization degree of the flare, itssymmetric flux rise and decay profiles, and also its structured evolution inthe $q-u$ plane, all imply that the observed flux variation corresponds to asingle emission region characterized by a highly ordered magnetic field. asdiscussed in the paper, a small-scale but strong shock propagating within theoutflow, and compressing a disordered magnetic field component, provides anatural, though not unique, interpretation of our findings.

1512.08797	monitoring observations of the jupiter-family comet 17p/holmes during  2014 perihelion passage	we performed a monitoring observation of a jupiter-family comet, 17p/holmes,during its 2014 perihelion passage to investigate its secular change inactivity. the comet has drawn the attention of astronomers since its historicoutburst in 2007, and this occasion was its first perihelion passage sincethen. we analyzed the obtained data using aperture photometry package andderived the afrho parameter, a proxy for the dust production rate. we foundthat afrho showed asymmetric properties with respect to the perihelion passage:it increased moderately from 100 cm at the heliocentric distance r_h=2.6-3.1 auto a maximal value of 185 cm at r_h = 2.2 au (near the perihelion) during theinbound orbit, while dropping rapidly to 35 cm at r_h = 3.2 au during theoutbound orbit. we applied a model for characterizing dust production rates asa function of r_h and found that the fractional active area of the cometarynucleus had dropped from 20%-40% in 2008-2011 (around the aphelion) to0.1%-0.3% in 2014-2015 (around the perihelion). this result suggests that adust mantle would have developed rapidly in only one orbital revolution aroundthe sun. although a minor eruption was observed on ut 2015 january 26 at r_h =3.0 au, the areas excavated by the 2007 outburst would be covered with a layerof dust (&lt;~ 10 cm depth) which would be enough to insulate the subsurface iceand to keep the nucleus in a state of low activity.

1512.09208	giant h$\alpha$ nebula surrounding the starburst merger ngc 6240	we revealed the detailed structure of a vastly extended h$\alpha$-emittingnebula ("h$\alpha$ nebula") surrounding the starburst/merging galaxy ngc 6240by deep narrow-band imaging observations with the subaru suprime-cam. theextent of the nebula is $\sim$90 kpc in diameter and the total h$\alpha$luminosity amounts to $\approx 1.6 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the volumefilling factor and the mass of the warm ionized gas are$\sim$10$^{-4}$--10$^{-5}$ and $\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ $m_\odot$, respectively.the nebula has a complicated structure, which includes numerous filaments,loops, bubbles, and knots. we found that there is a tight spatial correlationbetween the h$\alpha$ nebula and the extended soft x-ray-emitting gas, both inlarge and small scales. the overall morphology of the nebula is dominated byfilamentary structures radially extending from the center of the galaxy. alarge-scale bi-polar bubble extends along the minor axis of the main stellardisk. the morphology strongly suggests that the nebula was formed by intenseoutflows - superwinds - driven by starbursts. we also found three bright knotsembedded in a looped filament of ionized gas that show head-tail morphologiesin both emission-line and continuum, suggesting close interactions between theoutflows and star forming regions. based on the morphology and surfacebrightness distribution of the h$\alpha$ nebula, we propose the scenario thatthree major episodes of starburst/superwind activities which were initiated$\sim$10$^2$ myr ago formed the extended ionized gas nebula of ngc 6240.

astro-ph;0001451	superwind-driven intense h_2 emission in ngc 6240	we have performed a long-slit k band spectroscopic observation of theluminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240. the peak position of the h_2 v=1-0 s(1)emission in the slit is located ~0.3" - 0.4" north of the southern nucleus. itis almost the midpoint between the southern nucleus and the peak position ofthe ^12co j=1-0 emission. based on the line-ratio analyses, we suggest theexcitation mechanism of h_2 is pure thermal at most positions. in the southernregion we find the following three velocity components in the h_2 emission: theblueshifted shell component (~-250 km s^-1 with respect to v_sys) which isrecognized as a distinct c-shape distortion in the velocity field around thesouthern nucleus, the high-velocity blueshifted ``wing'' component (~-1000 kms^-1 with respect to v_sys), and the component indicating possible linesplitting of ~500 km s^-1. the latter two components are extended to the southfrom the southern nucleus. we show that the kinematic properties of these threecomponents can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structurearound the southern nucleus. the offset peak position of the h_2 emission canbe understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts withthe extragalactic molecular gas. at the interface between the shell and themolecular gas concentration the cloud-crushing mechanism proposed by cowie etal. (1981) may work efficiently, and the intense h_2 emission is thus expectedthere. all these findings lead us to propose a model that the most h_2 emissionis attributed to the shock excitation driven by the superwind activity of thesouthern nucleus.

astro-ph;0002344	color-magnitude sequence in the clusters at z$\sim$1.2 near the radio  galaxy 3c 324	we have investigated the optical and near-infrared colors of k'-selectedgalaxies in clusters at z ~ 1.2 near to the radio galaxy 3c 324 using imagesobtained with the subaru telescope and archival hst data. the distribution ofcolors of the galaxies in the cluster region is found to be fairly broad, andit may imply significant scatter in their star-formation histories, althoughthe effect of contamination of field galaxies is uncertain. the red sequence ofgalaxies whose r-k colors are consistent with passive evolution models for oldgalaxies is found to be truncated at k' ~ 20 mag, and there are few faintergalaxies with similar red colors in the cluster region. we find that thebulge-dominated galaxies selected by quantitative morphological classificationform a broad sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, whose slope is muchsteeper than that expected from metallicity variations within a passivelyevolving coeval galaxy population. we argue that the observed color-magnitudesequence can be explained by metallicity and age variations, and the faintergalaxies with k' &gt; 20 mag may be 1-2 gyr younger than the brighter galaxies.some spatial segregation of the color and k'-band luminosity is seen in the skydistribution; the redder and the brighter objects tend to be located near 3c324.

astro-ph;0002390	high-resolution near-infrared imaging of the powerful radio galaxy 3c  324 at z = 1.21 with the subaru telescope	we have obtained high-resolution k'-band images of the powerful z=1.206 radiogalaxy 3c 324 with the subaru telescope under seeing conditions of 0.3--0.4arcsec. we clearly resolved the galaxy and directly compared it to the opticalimages obtained with the hubble space telescope. the host galaxy of 3c 324 isrevealed to be a moderately luminous elliptical galaxy with a smooth lightprofile. the effective radius of the galaxy, as determined by profile fitting,is 1.3+-0.1 arcsec (1.2 kpc), which is significantly smaller than the value of2.2 arcsec, published in best et al. (1998, mnras, 292, 758). the peak of thek'-band light coincides with the position of the radio core, which implies thatthe powerful agn lies at the nucleus of the host galaxy. the peak alsocoincides with the gap in the optical knotty structures which may be a dustlane hiding the uv-optical emission of the agn from our line of sight; it isvery likely that we are seeing the obscuring structure almost edge-on. weclearly detected the `aligned component' in the k'-band image by subtracting amodel elliptical galaxy from the observed image. the red r_f702w-k color of theouter region of the galaxy avoiding the aligned component indicates that thenear infrared light of the host galaxy is dominated by an old stellarpopulation.

(2000) in spite of our much larger survey volume. thissuggests that large and luminous extended ly-alpha objects like the two labsare very rare and are clustered in overdense regions.

astro-ph;9910285	extended high-ionization nuclear emission-line region in the seyfert  galaxy ngc 4051	we present an optical spectroscopic analysis of the well-known seyfert galaxyngc 4051. the high-ionization nuclear emission-line region (hiner) traced by[fe x]6374 is found to be spatially extended to a radius of 3a rcseconds (150pc) west and southwest from the nucleus; ngc 4051 is the third example whichhas an extended hiner.  the nuclear spectrum shows that the flux of [fe x]6374 is stronger than thatof [fe vii] 6087 in our observation. this property cannot be interpreted interms of a simple one-zone photoionization model.  in order to understand what happens in the nuclear region in ngc 4051, weinvestigate the physical condition of the nuclear emission-line region indetail using new photoionization models in which the following threeemission-line components are taken into account; (1) optically thick,ionization-bounded clouds; (2) optically thin, matter-bounded clouds; and (3) acontamination component which emits h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ lines. here theobserved extended hiner is considered to be associated with the low-density,matter-bounded clouds. candidates of the contamination component are either thebroad-line region (blr) or nuclear star forming regions or both. the complexityof the excitation condition found in ngc 4051 can be consistently understood ifwe take account of these contamination components.
