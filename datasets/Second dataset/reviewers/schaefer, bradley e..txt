0903.1349	orbital periods for three recurrent novae	i report on the discovery of the orbital periods of three recurrent novae inour galaxy. v745 sco has an orbital period of 510+-20 days with ellipsoidalmodulations, based on smarts photometry from 2004-2008. v3890 sgr has anorbital period of 519.7+-0.3 days with ellipsoidal modulations and a shalloweclipse, based primarily on smarts and aavso photometry from 1995-2008, butalso extending back to 1899 with archival plates. in addition, a sinusoidalmodulation of amplitude 0.2 mag and period 103.8+-0.4 days is seen mainly inthe red, with this attributed to ordinary pulsations in the giant companionstar. v394 cra has an orbital period equal to twice its primary photometricperiod (p_orb=1.515682+-0.000008 days), as based on photometry extending from1989-2008. i use all available information (including the ubvrijhk spectralenergy distributions) to get distances to the four rne with red giantcompanions as 800+-140 pc for t crb, 4300+-700 pc for rs oph, 7300+-1200 pc forv745 sco, and 6000+-1000 pc for v3890 sgr. further, the red giant in the rs ophsystem has a mass loss rate of close to 3.7x10^-8 m_sun/yr as based on manyconfident measures, and this is too weak (by a factor of 100,000) to supply thewhite dwarf with mass at the known rate of 3.9x10^-6 m_sun/yr. thus, the onlyway to get matter onto the white dwarf fast enough is through roche lobeoverflow, and this confidently demonstrates that the distance to rs oph is&gt;~3000 pc.

0904.2566	are swift long-lag gamma-ray bursts in the local supercluster?	a sample of 18 long-lag (tau_{lag} &gt; 1 s) gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has beendrawn from our catalog of all swift long grbs. four different tests are done onthis sample to test the prediction that a large fraction of long-lag grbs arefrom our local supercluster. the results of these four tests come out that: (1)the distribution of these grbs shows no tendency towards the supergalacticplane; (2) the distribution shows no tendency towards the virgo or comacluster; (3) no associated bright host galaxies (m &lt;=15) in the localsupercluster are found for any of the 18 grbs; (4) 17 of these 18 grbs haveredshifts of z&gt;0.5, which are too far to be in the local supercluster. allthese results disproved the hypothesis that any significant fraction oflong-lag grbs are from local supercluster. hence these long-lag grbs can not becounted in the calculation of ligo detection rates. an explanation of why wecan detect long-lag grbs at high redshift is presented.

0906.0933	the nova shell and evolution of the recurrent nova t pyxidis	t pyxidis is the prototypical recurrent nova (rn) with a mysterious novashell. we report new observations of the shell with hst. the knots in the shellare expanding with velocities 500-715 km/s, for a distance of 3500 pc. thefractional expansion of the knots is constant, and this implies no significantdeceleration. hence, the knots were ejected by an eruption close to the year1866. knots have turned on after 1995, and this demonstrates that the knots arepowered by shocks from the collision of the 1866 ejecta with fast ejecta fromlater rn eruptions. the 1866 ejecta has a total mass of 10^-4.5 msun, whichwith the low ejection velocity shows that the 1866 event was an ordinary novaeruption, not a rn eruption. the accretion rate before the ordinary nova eventmust have been low (around the 4x10^-11 msun/yr expected for gravitationalradiation alone) and the matter accumulated on the surface of the white dwarffor ~750,000 years. the current accretion rate (&gt;10^-8 msun/yr) is 1000x higherthan expected for a system below the period gap, with the plausible reasonbeing that the 1866 event started a continuing supersoft source that drives theaccretion. a key fact about t pyx is that its accretion rate has been secularlydeclining since before the 1890 eruption, with the current rate being only 3%of its earlier rate. the decline in the observed accretion rate shows that thesupersoft source is not self-sustaining, and we calculate that the accretion int pyx will effectively stop in upcoming decades. with this, t pyx will enter astate of hibernation, lasting for an estimated 2,600,000 years, beforegravitational radiation brings the system into contact again. thus, t pyx hasan evolutionary cycle going from an ordinary cv state, to its current rn state,to a future hibernation state, and then repeating this cycle.

0908.2143	discovery of a second nova eruption of v2487 ophiuchi	a directed search for previously-undiscovered nova eruptions was conducted inthe astronomical plate archives at harvard college observatory and sonnebergobservatory. we found that an eruption of v2487 oph (nova oph 1998) occurred on1900 june 20. v2487 oph was previously classified as a classical nova, which weidentified as a probable recurrent nova based on its large expansion velocitiesand the presence of high excitation lines in the outburst spectrum. the eventwas recorded on harvard plate am 505, at a b magnitude of 10.27 +/- 0.11, whichis near peak. the outburst can only be seen on one plate, but the image has acharacteristic dumbbell shape (caused by a double exposure) that is identicalto the other star images on the plate, and thus is not a plate defect. weconclude that this is in fact a previously-undiscovered nova outburst of v2487oph, confirming our prediction that it is a recurrent nova. we also examine thediscovery efficiency for eruptions of the system and conclude that arandomly-timed outburst has, on average, a 30% chance of being discovered inthe past century. using this, we deduce a recurrence time for v2487 oph ofapproximately 18 years, which implies that the next eruption is expected around2016.

0909.1357	x- and gamma-ray flashes from type ia supernovae?	we investigate two potential mechanisms that will produce x-ray and gamma-rayflashes from type ia supernovae (sn-ia). the mechanisms are the breakout of thethermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf andthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. basedon the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculationwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 secondflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50erg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. the x- and gamma-rayvisibility of a sn-ia will depend strongly on self absorption within theprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and itsorientation towards the observer. such x-ray and gamma-ray flashes could bedetected as triggered events by gamma-ray burst (grb) detectors on satellites,with events in current grb catalogs. we have searched through the grb catalogs(for the batse, hete, and swift experiments) for grbs that occur at theextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known type iasupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s. for batse about12.9+-3.6 nearby sne ia should have been detected, but only 0.8+-0.7non-coincidental matches have been found. with the hete and swift satellites,we expect to see 5.6+-1.3 sn-ia flashes from known nearby sne ia but, yet, nosn-ia flashes were detected. these place observational limits that thebolometric peak luminosity of sn-ia flashes must be less ~10^46 erg/s. weattribute the difference between theory and observational limits to theabsorption of the x- and gamma-rays by the accretion disk of large scale heightor common envelope that would be smothering the white dwarf.

0909.4289	the behavior of novae light curves before eruption	in 1975, e. r. robinson conducted the hallmark study of the behavior ofclassical nova light curves before eruption, and this work has now become partof the standard knowledge of novae. he made three points; that 5 out of 11novae showed pre-eruption rises in the years before eruption, that one nova(v446 her) showed drastic changes in the variability across eruptions, and thatall but one of the novae (excepting bt mon) have the same quiescent magnitudesbefore and after the outburst. this work has not been tested since it came out.we have now tested these results by going back to the original archivalphotographic plates and measuring large numbers of pre-eruption magnitudes formany novae using comparison stars on a modern magnitude scale. we find inparticular that four out of five claimed pre-eruption rises are due to simplemistakes in the old literature, that v446 her has the same amplitude ofvariations across its 1960 eruption, and that bt mon has essentially unchangedbrightness across its 1939 eruption. out of 22 nova eruptions, we find twoconfirmed cases of significant pre-eruption rises (for v533 her and v1500 cyg),while t crb has a deep pre-eruption dip. these events are a challenge totheorists. we find no significant cases of changes in variability across 27nova eruptions beyond what is expected due to the usual fluctuations seen innovae away from eruptions. for 30 classical novae plus 19 eruptions from 6recurrent novae, we find that the average change in magnitude from before theeruption to long after the eruption is 0.0 mag. however, we do find five novae(v723 cas, v1500 cyg, v1974 cyg, v4633 sgr, and rw umi) that have significantlylarge changes, in that the post-eruption quiescent brightness level is over tentimes brighter than the pre-eruption level.

0910.4945	estimating redshifts for long gamma-ray bursts	we are constructing a program to estimate the redshifts for grbs from theoriginal swift light curves and spectra, aiming to get redshifts for the swiftbursts \textit{without} spectroscopic or photometric redshifts. we derive theluminosity indicators from the light curves and spectra of each burst,including the lag time between low and high photon energy light curves, thevariability of the light curve, the peak energy of the spectrum, the number ofpeaks in the light curve, and the minimum rise time of the peaks. theseluminosity indicators can each be related directly to the luminosity, and wecombine their independent luminosities into one weighted average. then with ourcombined luminosity value, the observed burst peak brightness, and theconcordance redshift-distance relation, we can derive the redshift for eachburst. in this paper, we test the accuracy of our method on 107 bursts withknown spectroscopic redshift. the reduced $\chi^2$ of our best redshifts($z_{best}$) compared with known spectroscopic redshifts ($z_{spec}$) is 0.86,and the average value of $log_{10}(z_{best}/z_{spec})$ is 0.01, with thisindicating that our error bars are good and our estimates are not biased. therms scatter of $log_{10}(z_{best}/z_{spec})$ is 0.26. for swift bursts measuredover a relatively narrow energy band, the uncertainty in determining the peakenergy is one of the main restrictions on our accuracy. although the accuracyof our $z_{best}$ values are not as good as that of spectroscopic redshifts, itis very useful for demographic studies, as our sample is nearly complete andthe redshifts do not have the severe selection effects associated with opticalspectroscopy.

0912.1888	phase curves of nine trojan asteroids over a wide range of phase angles	we have observed well-sampled phase curves for nine trojan asteroids in b-,v-, and i-bands. these were constructed from 778 magnitudes taken with the1.3-m telescope on cerro tololo as operated by a service observer for thesmarts consortium. over our typical phase range of 0.2-10 deg, we find ourphase curves to be adequately described by a linear model, for slopes of0.04-0.09 mag/deg with average uncertainty less than 0.02 mag/deg. (the oneexception, 51378 (2001 at33), has a formally negative slope of -0.02 +- 0.01mag/deg.) these slopes are too steep for the opposition surge mechanism to beshadow hiding (sh), so we conclude that the dominant surge mechanism must becoherent backscattering (cb). in a detailed comparison of surface properties(including surge slope, b-r color, and albedo), we find that the trojans havesurface properties similar to the p and c class asteroids prominent in theouter main belt, yet they have significantly different surge properties (at aconfidence level of 99.90%). this provides an imperfect argument against thetraditional idea that the trojans were formed around jupiter's orbit. we alsofind no overlap in trojan properties with either the main belt asteroids orwith the small icy bodies in the outer solar system. importantly, we find thatthe trojans are indistinguishable from other small bodies in the outer solarsystem that have lost their surface ices (such as the gray centaurs, grayscattered disk objects, and dead comets). thus, we find strong support for theidea that the trojans originally formed as icy bodies in the outer solarsystem, were captured into their current orbits during the migration of the gasgiant planets, and subsequently lost all their surface ices.

1002.1401	novae with long-lasting supersoft emission that drive a high accretion  rate	we identify a new class of novae characterized by the post-eruption quiescentlight curve being more than roughly a factor of ten brighter than thepre-eruption light curve. eight novae (v723 cas, v1500 cyg, v1974 cyg, gq mus,cp pup, t pyx, v4633 sgr, and rw umi) are separated out as being significantlydistinct from other novae. this group shares a suite of uncommon properties,characterized by the post-eruption magnitude being much brighter than beforeeruption, short orbital periods, long-lasting supersoft emission following theeruption, a highly magnetized white dwarf, and secular declines during thepost-eruption quiescence. we present a basic physical picture which shows whyall five uncommon properties are causally connected. most novae do not haveadequate accretion for continuous hydrogen burning, but some can achieve thisif the companion star is nearby (with short orbital period) and a magneticfield channels the matter onto a small area on the white dwarf so as to producea locally high accretion rate. the resultant supersoft flux irradiates thecompanion star and drives a higher accretion rate (with a brighterpost-eruption phase), which serves to keep the hydrogen burning and thesupersoft flux going. the feedback loop cannot be perfectly self-sustaining, sothe supersoft flux will decline over time, forcing a decline in the accretionrate and the system brightness. we name this new group after the prototype,v1500 cyg. v1500 cyg stars are definitely not progenitors of type iasupernovae. the v1500 cyg stars have similar physical mechanisms andappearances as predicted for nova by the hibernation model, but with this groupaccounting for only 14% of novae.

1003.4207	on the orbital period change in the recurrent nova u scorpii	the orbital period of the recurrent nova u sco has been observed to decreaseduring the 1999 outburst. in an outburst mass is ejected from the surface ofthe white dwarf. the separation of the binary system widens and the orbitalperiod increases. we find that magnetic braking between outbursts, masstransfer to the companion, and frictional angular momentum losses duringoutbursts are all too small to account for this unexpected change. we find,however, that if the secondary has a sufficiently strong magnetic field,b=8x10^3 g, then the ejected material can couple to it and corrotate with thesystem. the ejected material gains angular momentum while the binary systemloses it and the period decreases. if such a strong magnetic field is indeedpresent, then we predict that a period decrease should be observed also duringthe current 2010 outburst. if, however, the presence of such a field can beruled out observationally, then the cause for the period decrease (ifconfirmed) remains unknown.

0708.1331	are there any redshift &gt;8 gamma-ray bursts in the batse catalog?	several luminosity indicators have been found for gamma-ray bursts (grbs)wherein measurable light curve and spectral properties are well-correlated withthe peak luminosity. several papers have each applied one different luminosityrelation to find redshifts for batse grbs and claim to identify specific burstswith z&gt;8. the existence of such high redshift events is not surprising, asbatse has enough sensitivity to see them and grbs are expected out to theredshift of the first star formation. to improve results we used fiveluminosity relations with updated calibrations to determine redshifts witherror bars. combining these relations, we calculated the redshifts of 36 batsegrbs with claimed z&gt;8. our results include 13 bursts with our derived bestredshift z_best&gt;8, which looks promising at first. but the calculated redshiftuncertainties are significantly large in these selected cases. with only oneexception, all of our bursts have z_1siglow&lt;9. the one exception (batse trigger2035) is likely a short duration burst at z&gt;~4. our best case for a very highredshift event is batse trigger 3142 with z_best&gt;20 and z_1siglow=8.9, howeverwe can only say z&gt;4.1 at the two-sigma confidence level. in all, we cannotpoint toward any one batse burst as confidently having z&gt;8. one implication isto greatly weaken prior claims that grbs have a steeply rising rate-density outto high redshifts.

1101.1285	the total errors in measuring epeak for gamma-ray bursts	while epeak has been extensively used in the past, for example withluminosity indicators, it has not been thoroughly examined for possible sourcesof scatter. in the literature, the reported error bars for epeak are the simplepoisson statistical errors. additional uncertainties arise due to the choicesmade by analysts in determining epeak (e.g., the start and stop times ofintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, differentenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit thespectra. we examine the size of these individual sources of scatter bycomparing many independent pairs of published epeak values for the same bursts.indeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often withthe same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. wemeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is28%, i.e., 0.12 in log10(epeak), with the resultant errors always beingpresent. the errors associated with the detector response are negligibly small.the variations caused by commonly-used alternative definitions of epeak (suchas present in all papers and in all compiled burst lists) is typically 23%-46%,although this varies substantially with the application. the implications ofthis are: (1) even the very best measured epeak values will have systematicuncertainties of 28%. (2) thus, grbs have a limitation in accuracy for a singleevent, with this being reducible by averaging many bursts. (3) the typicalone-sigma total uncertainty for collections of bursts is 55%. (4) we also findthat the width of the distribution for epeak in the burst frame must be nearzero, implying that some mechanism must exist to thermostat grbs. (5) ourcommunity can only improve on this situation by using collections of burstswhich all have identical definitions for the epeak calculation.

0709.4531	a problem with the clustering of recent measures of the distance to the  large magellanic cloud	the distance to the large magellanic cloud (lmc) has long been of keyimportance for the distance ladder and the distances to all galaxies, and assuch many groups have provided measurements of its distance modulus (\mu) withmany methods and various means of calibrating each method. before the year2001, the many measures spanned a wide range (roughly 18.1 &lt; \mu &lt; 18.8) withthe quoted error bars being substantially smaller than the spread, and hencethe consensus conclusion being that many of the measures had theiruncertainties being dominated by unrecognized systematic problems. in 2001, thehubble space telescope key project (hstkp) on the distance scale made anextensive analysis of earlier results and adopted the reasonable conclusionthat the distance modulus is 18.50+-0.10 mag, and the community has generallyaccepted this widely popularized value. after 2002, 31 independent papers havereported new distance measures to the lmc, and these cluster tightly around\mu=18.50 mag. indeed, these measures cluster too tightly around the hstkpvalue, with 68% of the measures being within 0.5-sigma of 18.50 mag. akolmogorov-smirnov test proves that this concentration deviates from theexpected gaussian distribution at a &gt;3-sigma probability level. thisconcentration is a symptom of a worrisome problem. interpretations consideredinclude correlations between papers, widespread over-estimation of error bars,and band-wagon effects. this note is to alert workers in the field that this isa serious problem that should be addressed.

1112.4347	a significant problem with using the amati relation for cosmological  purposes	we consider the distribution of many samples of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) whenplotted in a diagram with their bolometric fluence (sbolo) versus the observedphoton energy of peak spectral flux (epeak,obs). in this diagram, bursts thatobey the amati relation must lie above some limiting line, althoughobservational scatter is expected to be substantial. we confirm that earlybursts with spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with this limit. but, wefind that the bursts from batse, swift, suzaku, and konus are all greatly inviolation of the limit. in the sbolo-epeak,obs diagram, we find that everysatellite has a greatly different distribution. this requires that selectioneffects are dominating these distributions, which we identify. for detectorselections, the trigger threshold and the threshold to measure epeak,obscombine to make a diagonal cutoff with the position of this cutoff varyinggreatly detector to detector. for selection effects due to the intrinsicproperties of the burst population, the distribution of epeak,obs makes forbursts with low and high values to be rare, while the fluence distributionmakes bright bursts uncommon. for a poor threshold, the combination ofselection effects serves to allow only bursts within a region along the limitto be measured; these bursts will then appear to follow an amati relation.therefore, the amati relation is an artifact of selection effects within theburst population and the detector. therefore, the amati relation should not beused for cosmological tasks. this failure is in no way prejudicial against theother luminosity relations.

1303.1833	the thousand star magnitudes in the catalogues of ptolemy, al sufi, and  tycho are all corrected for atmospheric extinction	three pre-telescopic star catalogues contain about a thousand star magnitudeseach (with magnitudes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), with these reported brightnessesas the original basis for what has become the modern magnitude scale. thesecatalogues are those of ptolemy (c. 137, from alexandria at a latitude of31.2), al sufi (c. 960, from isfahan at a latitude of 32.6), and tycho brahe(c. 1590, from the island of hven at a latitude of 55.9). previously, extensivework has been made on the positions of the catalogued stars, but only scantattention has been paid to the magnitudes as reported. these magnitudes will beaffected by a variety of processes, including the dimming of the light by ourearth's atmosphere (atmospheric extinction), the quantization of thebrightnesses into magnitude bins, and copying or influence from priorcatalogues. this paper provides a detailed examination of these effects.indeed, i find all three catalogues to report magnitudes that have near-zeroextinction effects, so the old observers in some way extinction corrected theirobservations.

1306.6933	the recurrent nova t crb did not erupt in 1842	the recurrent nova t crb was one of the first well observed nova eruptions in1866, and 80 years later it erupted again in 1946. just after the 1866eruption, sir john herschel reported to the monthly notices that he had seenthe same star in his naked-eye charting of the sky on 1842 june 9, implyingthat there was a prior eruption 24 years earlier. unfortunately, the chart inthe monthly notices was ambiguous and misleading, so it has long been unclearwhether t crb did indeed have an eruption in 1842. to resolve this, i havesearched the various archives with herschel material, and have found hisoriginal correspondence. in one letter from 1866 to william huggins, herschelenclosed his own copy of his original observations, and with this all theambiguities are resolved. it turns out that herschel's indicated star was atthe same position as a steady background star (bd+25{\deg}3020, v=7.06, g8v)and not that of t crb, and herschel regularly was seeing stars as faint asv=7.5 mag because he was using an opera glass. with this, there is no evidencefor a t crb eruption in 1842.

1405.0246	identifying and quantifying recurrent novae masquerading as classical  novae	recurrent novae (rne) are cataclysmic variables with two or more novaeruptions within a century. classical novae (cne) are similar systems with onlyone such eruption. many of the so-called 'cne' are actually rne for which onlyone eruption has been discovered. since rne are candidate type ia supernovaprogenitors, it is important to know whether there are enough in our galaxy toprovide the supernova rate, and therefore to know how many rne are masqueradingas cne. to quantify this, we collected all available information on the lightcurves and spectra of a galactic, time-limited sample of 237 cne and the 10known rne, as well as exhaustive discovery efficiency records. we recognize rneas having (a) outburst amplitude smaller than 14.5 - 4.5 * log(t_3), (b)orbital period &gt;0.6 days, (c) infrared colors of j-h &gt; 0.7 mag and h-k &gt; 0.1mag, (d) fwhm of h-alpha &gt; 2000 km/s, (e) high excitation lines, such as fe xor he ii near peak, (f) eruption light curves with a plateau, and (g) whitedwarf mass greater than 1.2 m_solar. using these criteria, we identify v1721aql, de cir, cp cru, kt eri, v838 her, v2672 oph, v4160 sgr, v4643 sgr, v4739sgr, and v477 sct as strong rn candidates. we evaluate the rn fraction amongstthe known cne using three methods to get 24% +/- 4%, 12% +/- 3%, and 35% +/-3%. with roughly a quarter of the 394 known galactic novae actually being rne,there should be approximately a hundred such systems masquerading as cne.

0805.2097	pluto's light curve in 1933-1934	we are reporting on a new accurate photographic light curve of pluto for1933-1934 when the heliocentric distance was 40 au. we used 43 b-band andv-band images of pluto on 32 plates taken on 15 nights from 19 march 1933 to 10march 1934. most of these plates were taken with the mount wilson 60" and 100"telescopes, but 7 of the plates (now at the harvard college observatory) weretaken with the 12" and 16" metcalf doublets at oak ridge. the plates weremeasured with an iris diaphragm photometer, which has an average one-sigmaphotometric error on these plates of 0.08 mag as measured by the repeatabilityof constant comparison stars. the modern b and v magnitudes for the comparisonstars were measured with the lowell observatory hall 1.1-m telescope. themagnitudes in the plate's photographic system were converted to the johnson b-and v-system after correction with color terms, even though they are small insize. we find that the average b-band mean opposition magnitude of pluto in1933-1934 was 15.73 +- 0.01, and we see a roughly sinusoidal modulation on therotational period (6.38 days) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.11 +- 0.03mag. with this, we show that pluto darkened by 5% from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955.this darkening from 1933-1934 to 1953-1955 cannot be due to changing viewinggeometry (as both epochs had identical sub-earth latitudes), so ourobservations must record a real albedo change over the southern hemisphere. thelater darkening trend from 1954 to the 1980s has been explained by changingviewing geometry (as more of the darker northern hemisphere comes into view).thus, we now have strong evidence for albedo changes on the surface of pluto,and these are most easily explained by the systematic sublimation of frostsfrom the sunward pole that led to a drop in the mean surface albedo.

(1)nereid displays large-amplitude brightness variations with a total amplitude of1.83 mag on time scales ranging from a few hours to roughly a year. (2) theamplitude as well as the time scale of variation changes greatly from year toyear. (3) nereid's variability is caused by high contrast albedo features alongwith rotational modulation. (4) the changing amplitudes and time scalesdemonstrate that the direction and magnitude of nereid's rotational angularmomentum vector is not constant. (5) such changes are predicted to arise fromchaotic rotation during every periapse passage provided that nereid is morethan about 1% nonspherical and is spinning slowly. the match between predictionand observation could be taken as strong evidence for chaotic rotation ofnereid. however, the intranight variability cannot be readily explained bychaotic rotation. (6) the colors of nereid are u-v=0.84+-0.05, b-v=0.71+-0.04,v-r=0.44+-0.03, v-i=0.72+-0.05, and v-k=1.6.

astro-ph;0101461	redshifts and luminosities for 112 gamma ray bursts	two different luminosity indicators have recently been proposed for gamma raybursts that use gamma-ray observations alone. they relate the burst luminosity(l) with the time lag between peaks in hard and soft energies, and thespikiness or variability of the burst's light curve (v). these relations arecurrently justified and calibrated with only 6 or 7 bursts with known redshifts. we have examined batse data for the lag and v for 112 bursts. (1) astrong correlation between the lag and v exists, and it is exactly as predictedfrom the two proposed relations. this is proof that both luminosity indicatorsare reliable. (2) grb830801 is the all-time brightest burst, yet with a small vand a large lag, and hence is likely the closest known event being perhaps asclose as 3.2 mpc. (3) we have combined the luminosities as derived from bothindicators as a means to improve the statistical and systematic accuracy whencompared with the accuracy from either method alone. the result is a list of112 bursts with good luminosities and hence red shifts. (4) the burst averagedhardness ratio rises strongly with the luminosity of the burst. (5) the burstluminosity function is a broken power law, with the break at l = 2x10^{52}erg/s. the luminosity function has power law indices of -2.8+-0.2 above thebreak and -1.7+-0.1 below the break. (6) the number density of grbs varies withred shift roughly as (1+z)^(2.5+-0.3) between 0.2&lt;z&lt;5. excitingly, this resultalso provides a measure of the star formation rate out to z~5 with no effectsfrom reddening, and the rate is rising uniformly for red shifts above 2.

(2) a second shell producesabsorption lines with a relative velocity of 560 km/s, and this is associatedwith the shell created by the fast massive star wind blowing a bubble in thepreceding slow wind at a radial distance of order 10 pc. (3) more distantclouds within the host galaxy lie between 30-2500 pc, where they have beenionized by the burst. (4-6) the massive star wind has clumps with radii andover-densities of 0.022, 0.063, and 0.12 parsecs and 50%, 10%, and 10%respectively. the immediate progenitor of the burster could either be a wc-typewolf-rayet star or a highly evolved star whose original mass was just too smallfor it to become a wn-type wolf-rayet star.

astro-ph;0212453	explaining the gamma-ray burst e_peak distribution	the characteristic photon energy for gamma ray bursts, e_peak, has aremarkably narrow distribution for bursts of similar peak flux, with valuesbetween 150 and 600 kev for most faint bursts. this result is surprising withinthe framework of internal shock models, since spectral shifts associated withthe jet's blue shift (by a lorentz factor of gamma) and the cosmological redshift (by a factor of 1+z) should cause substantial smearing in thedistribution of the spectral peak in the jet's co-moving frame, e_rest. for thegeneral case where the luminosity (l) varies as gamma^n and e_rest varies asgamma^m, then the observed e_peak will vary as l^{(m+1)/n}(1+z)^{-1}. for twoindependent set of 20 and 84 bursts, e_peak(1+z) varies as a power law of theluminosity with an index of (m+1)/n=0.36+-0.03. with this measured value, theabove functional dependence of e_peak on l and z results in e_peak beingroughly constant for bursts of similar peak flux, p_256. thus, the kinematicsmearing will be small, hence allowing the e_peak distribution to be narrow.this model also predicts that bright bursts will have high e_peak valuesbecause they all have some combination of high luminosity (and hence a largeblue shift gamma) and a nearby distance (and hence a small cosmological redshift). quantitatively, e_peak should vary roughly as p_256^0.36, and thismodel prediction is strikingly confirmed with batse data by mallozzi et al. aprediction of this model is that grbs at very high red shift z~10 should allappear with e_peak at ~200 kev. a further prediction of this model is thatnormal bursts with p_256 below the batse trigger threshold will appear as x-rayflashes with e_peak~70 kev; just as is reported by kippen et al. and heise etal.

astro-ph;0605745	the diverse solar phase curves of distant icy bodies. part i:  photometric observations of 18 trans-neptunian objects, 7 centaurs, and  nereid	we have measured the solar phase curves in b, v, and i for 18 trans-neptunianobjects, 7 centaurs, and nereid and determined the rotation curves for 10 ofthese targets. for each body, we have made ~100 observations uniformly spreadover the entire visible range. we find that all the targets except nereid havelinear phase curves at small phase angles (&lt; 2 deg) with widely varying phasecoefficients (0.0 to 0.4 mag/deg). at phase angles &gt; 3 deg, the centaurs(54598) bienor and (32532) thereus have phase curves that flatten. the recentlydiscovered pluto-scale bodies (2003 ub313, 2005 fy9, and 2003 el61), likepluto, have neutral colors compared to most tnos and small phase coefficients(&lt; 0.1 mag/deg). together these two properties are a likely indication forlarge tnos of high-albedo, freshly coated icy surfaces. we find several bodieswith significantly wavelength-dependent phase curves. the tnos (50000) quaoar,(120348) 2004 ty364 (47932), and 2000 gn171 have unusually high i-band phasecoefficients (0.290+/-0.038, 0.413+/-0.064, 0.281+/-0.033 mag/deg,respectively) and much lower coefficients in the b and v bands. their phasecoefficients increase in proportion to wavelength by 0.5 - 0.8 mag/deg/um. thephase curves for tnos with small b-band phase coefficients (&lt; 0.1 mag/deg) havea similar but weaker wavelength dependence. coherent backscatter is the likelycause for the wavelength dependence for all these bodies. we see no suchdependence for the centaurs, which have visual albedos ~0.05.

astro-ph;0608441	grb060614 is at high redshift, so no new class of gamma-ray bursts is  required	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been strongly connected with corecollapse supernovae, so it was surprising when the recent grb060614 (with areported redshift of 0.125) was found to have no visible supernova to deeplimits. three separate groups have reached the same conclusion that this eventforces the existence of a new previously-unsuspected class of grbs. the problemwith this conclusion is that the redshift is not secure, as the measured galaxyemission lines simply give the redshift of the brightest galaxy near theline-of-sight to the grb afterglow. fortunately, eight different luminosityindicators are known which can give the luminosity (and hence redshift) of thegrb itself. in combination, these luminosity indicators have already proven togive redshifts with average one-sigma errors of 26% as based on 69 grbs withspectroscopic redshifts. for grb060614, the luminosity indicators all uniformlygive a high luminosity for the burst which implies a high redshift. this can beseen by the spiky many-peaked light curve, the high e_{peak} value, thenear-zero spectral lag, and the timing of the jet break. quantitatively, wederive a redshift of 1.97 (1.44&lt;z&lt;2.81 one-sigma) from the eight luminosityindicators. additional information from the detection of the afterglow in allswift uvot bands further constrains the redshift to be &lt;1.71, so the finalrange of allowed redshift is 1.44&lt;z&lt;1.71, which readily explains why nosupernova was visible. thus, grb060614 is at high redshift and is certainly notevidence for a new class of grbs.

astro-ph;0612285	the hubble diagram to redshift &gt;6 from 69 gamma-ray bursts	one of the few ways to measure the properties of dark energy is to extend thehubble daigram (hd) to higher redshifts with gamma-ray bursts (grbs). grbs haveat least five properties (their spectral lag, variability, spectral peak photonenergy, time of the jet break, and the minimum rise time) which havecorrelations to the luminosity of varying quality. in this paper, i construct agrb hd with 69 grbs over a redshift range of 0.17 to &gt;6, with half the burstshaving a redshift larger than 1.7. this paper uses over 3.6 times as many grbsand 12.7 times as many luminosity indicators as any previous grb hd work. forthe gravitational lensing and malmquist biases, i find that the biases aresmall, with an average of 0.03 mag and an rms scatter of 0.14 mag in thedistance modulus. the grb hd is well-behaved and nicely delineates the shape ofthe hd. the reduced chi-square for the fit to the concordance model is 1.05 andthe rms scatter about the concordance model is 0.65 mag. this accuracy is justa factor of 2.0 times that gotten for the same measure from all the bigsupernova surveys. i fit the grb hd to a variety of models, including where thedark energy has its equation of state parameter varying as w(z)=w_0 + w_az/(1+z). i find that the concordance model is consistent with the data. thatis, the dark energy can be described well as a cosmological constant that doesnot change with time.

astro-ph;0701548	generalized tests for eight grb luminosity relations	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have eight luminosity relations whereobservable burst properties can yield the burst luminosity and hence distance.this turns grbs into useful tools of cosmology. recently, two tests have beenproposed (by nakar &amp; piran and by li) for which one of the eight relations isclaimed to have significant problems. in this paper, we generalize these testsand apply them to all eight grb luminosity relations. (a) all eight relationspass the nakar &amp; piran test after accounting for the uncertainties on the dataand the dispersions of the correlations. (b) all eight relations are good whenthe grb redshifts are known, for example for calibration of the relations andfor grb hubble diagram purposes. (c) we confirm the earlier results that thee_gamma,iso - e_peak amati relation must produce very large error bars wheneveran unknown redshift being sought is &gt;1.4. (d) the e_gamma - e_peak relation ofghirlanda et al. must produce very large error bars whenever an unknownredshift being sought is &gt;3.4. (e) the other six relations have no problem atall from the ambiguity test of li.

astro-ph;9704278	gamma-ray burster counterparts: hst blue and ultraviolet data	the surest solution of the gamma ray burst (grb) mystery is to find anunambiguous low-energy quiescent counterpart. however, to date no reasonablecandidates have been identified in the x-ray, optical, infrared, or radioranges. the hubble space telescope (hst) has now allowed for the first deepultraviolet searches for quiescent counterparts. this paper reports onmultiepoch ultraviolet searches of five grb positions with hst. we found nosources with significant ultraviolet excesses, variability, parallax, or propermotion in any of the burst error regions. in particular, we see no sourcessimilar to that proposed as a counterpart to the grb970228. while this negativeresult is disappointing, it still has good utility for its strict limits on theno-host-galaxy problem in cosmological models of grbs. for most cosmologicalmodels (with peak luminosity 6x10^50 erg/s), the absolute b magnitude of anypossible host galaxy must be fainter than -15.5 to -17.4. these smallest boxesfor some of the brightest bursts provide the most critical test, and our limitsare a severe problem for all published cosmological burst models.

astro-ph;9806010	time dilation in the peak-to-peak time scale of grbs	we present strong evidence of time stretching in the peak-to-peak time scalesin the light curves of batse gamma ray bursts (grbs). extensive tests areperformed on artificially dilated bursts to verify that the procedure forextracting the peak-to-peak time scales correctly recovers the stretching ofbursts. the resulting robust algorithm is then applied to the 4b grb database.we derive a stretching factor of $1.92 \pm 0.13$ between the brightest burstgroup ($p &gt; 7.7 photon \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$) and the dimmest burst group($p = 1.0 \sim 1.4 photon \cdot cm^{-2} \cdot s^{-1}$) with several independentpeak-to-peak time scale definitions and they agree within uncertainties. suchan agreement strongly supports the interpretation of the observed timestretching as time dilation caused by the cosmological expansion, rather thanphysical selection effects. we fit the result to cosmological models with$\lambda = 0$, $\omega_{0}$ from 0.2 to 1.0, and contrained the standard candleluminosity to be $l_{0}= 7.0 \pm 2.0 \pm 2.7 \times 10^{56} photons \cdots^{-1}$. our luminosity value is fully consistent with the value from thecombined pvo and batse logn-logp curve with the batse bright bursts at lowredshifts of $z_{bright} = 0.11 \pm 0.02 \pm 0.025$. this luminosity fit isdefinitely inconsistent with the the larger distance scale implied fromassociating burst density with star formation rates.

astro-ph;9810271	gamma ray bursts have millisecond variability	we have performed searches for isolated flares and for steady flickering ingamma ray burst light curves on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. twobursts out of our sample of 20 revealed four isolated flares with time scalesfrom $256 \mu s$ to $2048 \mu s$. a wavelet analysis for our sample showed lowlevel flickering for all bursts on time scales from $256 \mu s$ to 33 ms, withthe majority of bursts containing rise times faster than four milliseconds and30% having rise times faster than one millisecond. these results show thatmillisecond variability is common in classical bursts and not some exceptionalactivity by a possibly separate class of bursts. these fast rise times can beused to place severe limits on burst models: (1) the characteristic thicknessof the energy generation region must be less than 1200 km along the line ofsight. (2) the angular size of the gamma ray emission region as subtended fromthe central source must be less than 42 arc-seconds. (3) the expanding ejectamust have a range of lorentz factors along a radius line with a dispersion ofless than roughly 2%.

astro-ph;9810424	severe new limits on the host galaxies of gamma ray bursts	the nature of gamma ray bursts (grbs) remains a complete mystery, despite therecent breakthrough discovery of low energy counterparts, although it is nowgenerally believed that at least most grbs are at cosmological distances.virtually all proposed cosmological models require bursters to reside inordinary galaxies. this can be tested by looking inside the smallest grb errorboxes to see if ordinary galaxies appear at the expected brightness levels.this letter reports on an analysis of the contents of 26 of the smallestregions, many from the brightest bursts. these events will have $z &lt; 0.4$ andsmall uncertainties about luminosity functions, k corrections and galaxyevolutions; whereas the recent events with optical transients are much fainterand hence have high redshifts and grave difficulties in interpretation. thisanalysis strongly rejects the many models with peak luminosities of $10^{57}photons \cdot s^{-1}$ as deduced from the $logn-logp$ curve with no evolution.indeed, the lower limit on acceptable luminosities is $6 \times 10^{58} photons\cdot s^{-1}$. the only possible solution is to either place grbs atunexpectedly large distances (with $z &gt; 5.9$ for the faint batse bursts) or torequire bursters to be far outside any normal host galaxy.

astro-ph;9912454	gamma ray burst host galaxies have `normal' luminosities	the galactic environment of gamma ray bursts can provide good evidence aboutthe nature of the progenitor system, with two old arguments implying that theburst host galaxies are significantly subluminous. new data and new analysishave now reversed this picture: (a) even though the first two known hostgalaxies are indeed greatly subluminous, the next eight hosts have absolutemagnitudes typical for a population of field galaxies. a detailed analysis ofthe 16 known hosts (ten with red shifts) shows them to be consistent with aschechter luminosity function with $r^{*} = -21.8 \pm 1.0$ as expected fornormal galaxies. (b) bright bursts from the interplanetary network aretypically 18 times brighter than the faint bursts with red shifts, however thebright bursts do not have galaxies inside their error boxes to limits deeperthan expected based on the luminosities for the two samples being identical. anew solution to this dilemma is that a broad burst luminosity function alongwith a burst number density varying as the star formation rate will require theaverage luminosity of the bright sample ($&gt;$$6 \times 10^{58} ph \cdot s^{-1}$or $&gt;$$1.7 \times 10^{52} \cdot erg \cdot s^{-1}$) to be much greater than theaverage luminosity of the faint sample ($\sim 10^{58} ph \cdot s^{-1}$ or $\sim3 \times 10^{51} erg \cdot s^{-1}$). this places the bright bursts at distancesfor which host galaxies with a normal luminosity will not violate the observedlimits. in conclusion, all current evidence points to grb host galaxies beingnormal in luminosity.

0810.0965	the diverse solar phase curves of distant icy bodies. ii. the cause of  the opposition surges and their correlations	we collect well-measured opposition surge properties for many icy bodiesorbiting the sun (mostly from our own observations) plus for many icy moons,resulting in a data base of surface and orbital properties for 52 icy bodies.(1) we put forward four criteria for determining whether the surge is beingdominated by shadow hiding (sh) or coherent backscattering (cb) based onreadily measured quantities. the cb surge mechanism dominates if the surge iscolor dependent, the phase curve is steeper than 0.04 mag/deg, the phase curveshape matches the cb model of hapke, or if the albedo is higher than roughly40%. (2) we find that virtually all of our sample have their phase curvesdominated by cb at low phase angles. (3) we present a graphical method todetermine the hapke surge parameters b_c0 and h_c. (4) the kuiper belt objects(kbos) and centaurs have relatively high surge amplitudes, b_c0 &gt; ~0.5 andwidths with h_c ~ 3 deg. (5) we find highly significant but loose correlationsbetween surge properties and the colors, albedos, and inclinations. weinterpret this as young surfaces tending to have low surge slopes, high albedo,and gray colors. (6) nereid has its surface properties similar to other icymoons and greatly different from kbos and centaurs, so we conclude that nereidis likely a nearly-ejected inner neptunian moon rather than a captured kbo.
