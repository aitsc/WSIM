0902.0004	the nuclear outflows and feedback in the seyfert 2 galaxy markarian 573	we present a study of outflow and feedback in the well-known seyfert 2 galaxymarkarian 573 using high angular resolution long-slit spectrophotometryobtained with the hubble space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis). throughanalysis of the kinematics and ionization state of a biconical outflow regionemanating from the nucleus, we find that the outflow does not significantlyaccelerate the surrounding host-galaxy interstellar gas and is too weak to be astrong ionization mechanism in the extended emission regions. instead, theexcitation of the extended regions is consistent with photoionization by theactive nucleus. from energetics arguments we show that the nuclear outflow isslow and heavy and has a mechanical luminosity that is only ~1% of theestimated bolometric luminosity of the system. the energy in the outflow isable to mildly shape the gas in the extended regions but appears to beinsufficient to unbind it, or even to plausibly disrupt star formation. theseresults are at odds with the picture of strong agn feedback that has beeninvoked to explain certain aspects of galaxy evolution.

0906.1843	the evolution of active galactic nuclei in clusters of galaxies to  redshift 1.3	we have measured the luminous agn population in a large sample of clusters ofgalaxies and find evidence for a substantial increase in the cluster agnpopulation from z~0.05 to z~1.3. the present sample now includes 32 clusters ofgalaxies, including 15 clusters above z=0.4, which corresponds to a three-foldincrease compared to our previous work at high redshift. at z&lt;0.4 we haveobtained new observations of agn candidates in six additional clusters andfound no new luminous agn in cluster members. our total sample of 17low-redshift clusters contains only two luminous agn, while at high redshiftsthere are 18 such agn, or an average of more than one per cluster. we havecharacterized the evolution of luminous x-ray agn as the fraction of galaxieswith m_r &lt; m_r^*(z)+1 that host agn with rest-frame, hard x-ray [2--10 kev]luminosities l_x,h &gt;= 10^43 \ergs. the agn fraction increases from f_a =0.134^{+0.18}_{-0.087} percent at a median z=0.19 to f_a = 1.00^{+0.29}_{-0.23}percent at a median z=0.72. our best estimate of the evolution is a factor ofeight increase to z=1 and the statistical significance of the increase is3.8sigma. this dramatic evolution is qualitatively similar to the evolution ofthe star-forming galaxy population in clusters known as the butcher-oemlereffect. we discuss the implications of this result for the coevolution of blackholes and galaxies in clusters, the evolution of agn feedback, searches forclusters with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect, and the possible detection ofenvironment-dependent downsizing.

0911.0392	active galactic nuclei in groups and clusters of galaxies: detection and  host morphology	the incidence and properties of active galactic nuclei (agn) in the field,groups, and clusters can provide new information about how these objects aretriggered and fueled, similar to how these environments have been employed tostudy galaxy evolution. we have obtained new xmm-newton observations of sevenx-ray selected groups and poor clusters with 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.06 for comparisonwith previous samples that mostly included rich clusters and optically-selectedgroups. our final sample has ten groups and six clusters in this low-redshiftrange (split at a velocity dispersion of $\sigma = 500$ km/s). we find that thex-ray selected agn fraction increases from $f_a(l_x&gt;10^{41}; m_r&lt;m_r^*+1) =0.047^{+0.023}_{-0.016}$ in clusters to $0.091^{+0.049}_{-0.034}$ for thegroups (85% significance), or a factor of two, for agn above an 0.3-8kev x-rayluminosity of $10^{41}$ erg/s hosted by galaxies more luminous than $m_r^*+1$.the trend is similar, although less significant, for a lower-luminosity hostthreshold of $m_r = -20$ mag. for many of the groups in the sample we have alsoidentified agn via standard emission-line diagnostics and find that these agnare nearly disjoint from the x-ray selected agn. because there are substantialdifferences in the morphological mix of galaxies between groups and clusters,we have also measured the agn fraction for early-type galaxies alone todetermine if the differences are directly due to environment, or indirectly dueto the change in the morphological mix. we find that the agn fraction inearly-type galaxies is also lower in clusters $f_{a,n&gt;2.5}(l_x&gt;10^{41};m_r&lt;m_r^*+1) = 0.048^{+0.028}_{-0.019}$ compared to $0.119^{+0.064}_{-0.044}$for the groups (92% significance), a result consistent with the hypothesis thatthe change in agn fraction is directly connected to environment.

1004.0252	the lick agn monitoring project: the mbh - sigma relation for  reverberation-mapped active galaxies	(abridged) to investigate the black hole mass (mbh) vs. stellar velocitydispersion relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions ofa sample of local seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined mbhusing reverberation mapping. for most objects, velocity dispersions weremeasured from high s/n ratio optical spectra centered on the ca ii tripletregion (~8500 a), obtained at the keck, palomar, and lick observatories. fortwo objects, in which the ca ii triplet region was contaminated by nuclearemission, the measurement was based on high-quality h-band spectra obtainedwith the osiris at the keck-ii telescope. combining our new measurements withdata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies withstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based mbh measurements in therange of black hole mass 10^6&lt;mbh/m_sun&lt;10^9. we use this sample to obtainreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of them-sigma relation of active galaxies. assuming a constant virial coefficient ffor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60and the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log(mbh/m_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those foundfor quiescent galaxies. we derive an updated value of the virial coefficient fby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreementwith the m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent m-sigmarelation determined by gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with anintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. the uncertainty of the virial coefficientremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole massdeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epochspectroscopic estimates of mbh in active galaxies.

1010.2497	properties of bulgeless disk galaxies. i. atomic gas	we study the neutral hydrogen properties of a sample of 20 bulgeless diskgalaxies (sd - sdm hubble types), an interesting class that can be used toconstrain galaxy formation and evolution, especially the role of mergers versusinternal processes. our sample is composed of nearby (within 32 mpc),moderately inclined galaxies that bracket the circular velocity of 120 km/s,which has been found to be associated with a transition in dust scale heightsin edge-on, late-type disks. here we present hi channel maps, line profiles,and integrated intensity maps. we also derive kinematic parameters, includingthe circular velocity, from rotation curve analyses and calculate theintegrated hi flux and hi mass for each galaxy in the sample. three of the 20galaxies in our sample have kinematically distinct outer components with majoraxes that differ by 30 - 90 degrees from the main disk. these distinct outercomponents may be due to a recent interaction, which would be somewhatsurprising because the disks do not contain bulges. we will use the dataproducts and derived properties in subsequent investigations into starformation and secular evolution in bulgeless disks with circular velocitiesabove and below 120 km/s.

1101.0812	a multi-wavelength study of low redshift clusters of galaxies i.  comparison of x-ray and mid-infrared selected agns	clusters of galaxies have long been used as laboratories for the study ofgalaxy evolution, but despite intense, recent interest in feedback between agnsand their hosts, the impact of environment on these relationships remainspoorly constrained. we present results from a study of agns and their hostgalaxies found in low-redshift galaxy clusters. we fit model spectral energydistributions (seds) to the combined visible and mid-infrared (mir) photometryof cluster members and use these model seds to determine stellar masses andstar-formation rates (sfrs). we identify two populations of agns, the firstbased on their x-ray luminosities (x-ray agns) and the second based on thepresence of a significant agn component in their model seds (ir agns). we findthat the two agn populations are nearly disjoint; only 8 out of 44 agns areidentified with both techniques. we further find that ir agns are hosted bygalaxies with similar masses and sfrs but higher specific sfrs (ssfrs) thanx-ray agn hosts. the relationship between agn accretion and host star-formationin cluster agn hosts shows no significant difference compared to therelationship between field agns and their hosts. the projected radialdistributions of both agn populations are consistent with the distribution ofother cluster members. we argue that the apparent dichotomy between x-ray andir agns can be understood as a combination of differing extinction due to coldgas in the host galaxies of the two classes of agns and the presence of weakstar-formation in x-ray agn hosts.

0709.2167	the lifetime of friis in groups and clusters: implications for  radio-mode feedback	we determine the maximum lifetime t_max of 52 frii radio sources found in 26central group galaxies from cross correlation of the berlind sdss group catalogwith the vla first survey. mock catalogs of frii sources were produced to matchthe selection criteria of first and the redshift distribution of our parentsample, while an analytical model was used to calculate source sizes andluminosities. the maximum lifetime of frii sources was then determined via acomparison of the observed and model projected length distributions. weestimate the average frii lifetime is 1.5x10^7 years and the duty cycle is~8x10^8 years. degeneracies between t_max and the model parameters: jet powerdistribution, axial ratio, energy injection index, and ambient densityintroduce at most a factor of two uncertainty in our lifetime estimate. inaddition, we calculate the radio active galactic nuclei (agn) fraction incentral group galaxies as a function of several group and host galaxyproperties. the lifetime of radio sources recorded here is consistent with thequasar lifetime, even though these friis have substantially sub-eddingtonaccretion. these results suggest a fiducial time frame for energy injectionfrom agn in feedback models. if the morphology of a given extended radio sourceis set by large-scale environment, while the lifetime is determined by thedetails of the accretion physics, this frii lifetime is relevant for allextended radio sources.

1201.1291	hot and cold galactic gas in the ngc 2563 galaxy group	the role of environmentally induced gas stripping in driving galaxy evolutionin groups remains poorly understood. here we present extensive chandra and verylarge array mosaic observations of the hot and cold interstellar medium withinthe members of the nearby, x-ray bright ngc 2563 group, a prime target forstudies of the role of gas stripping and interactions in relatively small hosthalos. our observations cover nearly all group members within a projectedradius of 1.15 mpc (~1.4 r_vir) of the group center, down to a limiting x-rayluminosity and hi mass of 3e39 erg/s and 2e8 m_sun, respectively. the x-raydata are consistent with efficient ram pressure stripping of the hot gas halosof early-type galaxies near the group core, but no x-ray tails are seen and thelimited statistics preclude strong conclusions. the hi results suggest moderatehi mass loss from the group members when compared to similar field galaxies.six of the 20 hi-detected group members show hi evidence of ongoinginteractions with other galaxies or with the intragroup medium. suggestiveevidence is further seen for galaxies with close neighbors in position-velocityspace to show relatively low hi content, consistent with tidal removal of hi.the results thus indicate removal of both hot and cold gas from the groupmembers via a combination of ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions. wealso find that 16 of the 20 hi detections occur on one side of the group,reflecting an unusual morphological segregation whose origin remains unclear.

1201.2957	a multi-wavelength study of low redshift cluster of galaxies ii.  environmental impact on galaxy growth	galaxy clusters provide powerful laboratories for the study of galaxyevolution, particularly the origin of correlations of morphology and starformation rate (sfr) with density. we construct visible to mir spectral energydistributions (seds) of cluster galaxies and use them to measure stellar massesand sfrs in eight low redshift clusters, which we examine as a function ofenvironment. a partial correlation analysis indicates that sfr depends stronglyon r/r200 (&gt;99.9% confidence) and is independent of projected local density atfixed radius. sfr also shows no residual dependence on stellar mass. wetherefore conclude that interactions with the intra-cluster medium drive theevolution of sfrs in cluster galaxies. a merged sample of galaxies from thefive most complete clusters shows &lt;sfr&gt;\propto(r/r200)^(1.3+/-0.7) for galaxieswith r/r200&lt;0.4. a decline in the fraction of sfgs toward the cluster centercontributes most of this effect, but it is accompanied by a reduction in sfrsamong star-forming galaxies (sfgs) near the cluster center. the increase in thefraction of sfgs toward larger r/r200 and the isolation of sfgs with reducedsfrs near the cluster center are consistent with ram pressure stripping as themechanism to truncate star formation in galaxy clusters. we conclude thatstripping drives the properties of sfgs over the range of radii we examine. wealso find that galaxies near the cluster center are more massive than galaxiesfarther out in the cluster at ~3.5\sigma, which suggests that cluster galaxiesexperience dynamical relaxation during the course of their evolution.

1202.0824	measurement of the mass and stellar population distribution in m82 with  the lbt	we present a k-band spectroscopic study of the stellar and gas kinematics,mass distribution, and stellar populations of the archetypical starburst galaxym82. our results are based on a single spectrum at a position angle of 67.5degrees through the k-band nucleus. we used the co stellar absorption band headat 2.29 {\mu}m (co_2.29) to measure the rotation curve out to nearly 4 kpcradius on both the eastern and western sides of the galaxy. our data show thatthe rotation curve is flat from 1 - 4 kpc. this stands in sharp contrast tosome previous studies, which have interpreted h i and co emission-lineposition-velocity diagrams as evidence for a declining rotation curve. thekinematics of the br\gamma, h_2, and he i emission lines are consistent with,although characterized by slightly higher velocities than, the stellarkinematics. we derived m82's mass distribution from our stellar kinematicmeasurements and estimate its total dynamical mass is ~10^10 msun. we measuredthe equivalent width of co_2.29 (w_2.29) as a function of distance from thecenter of the galaxy to investigate the spatial extent of the red supergiant(rsg) population. the variation in w_2.29 with radius clearly shows that rsgsdominate the light inside 500 pc radius. m82's superwind is likely launchedfrom this region, where we estimate the enclosed mass is &lt;= 2 x 10^9 msun.

1204.1555	properties of bulgeless disk galaxies ii. star formation as a function  of circular velocity	we study the relation between the surface density of gas and star formationrate in twenty moderately-inclined, bulgeless disk galaxies (sd-sdm hubbletypes) using co(1-0) data from the iram 30m telescope, hi emission line datafrom the vla/evla, h-alpha data from the mdm observatory, and pah emission dataderived from spitzer irac observations. we specifically investigate theefficiency of star formation as a function of circular velocity (v_circ).previous work found that the vertical dust structure and disk stability ofedge-on, bulgeless disk galaxies transition from diffuse dust lanes with largescale heights and gravitationally-stable disks at v_circ &lt; 120 km/s (m_star &lt;~10^10 m_sun) to narrow dust lanes with small scale heights andgravitationally-unstable disks at v_circ &gt; 120 km/s. we find no transition instar formation efficiency (sigma_sfr/sigma_hi+h2) at v_circ = 120 km/s, or atany other circular velocity probed by our sample (v_circ = 46 - 190 km/s).contrary to previous work, we find no transition in disk stability at anycircular velocity in our sample. assuming our sample has the same duststructure transition as the edge-on sample, our results demonstrate that scaleheight differences in the cold interstellar medium of bulgeless disk galaxiesdo not significantly affect the molecular fraction or star formationefficiency. this may indicate that star formation is primarily affected byphysical processes that act on smaller scales than the dust scale height, whichlends support to local star formation models.

0704.3455	the distribution of agn in clusters of galaxies	we present a study of the distribution of agn in clusters of galaxies with auniformly selected, spectroscopically complete sample of 35 agn in eightclusters at z = 0.06 to 0.31. we find that the 12 agn with l_x &gt; 10^42 erg/s ingalaxies more luminous than a rest-frame m_r &lt; -20 mag are more centrallyconcentrated than typical cluster galaxies of this luminosity, although theseagn have comparable velocity and substructure distributions to other clustermembers. in contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster agn with l_x &gt; 10^41 erg/sdo not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, norevidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. as we do seeclear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the bluebutcher-oemler and red galaxy populations, any difference in the agn andinactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these twopairs of populations. comparison of the agn fraction selected via x-rayemission in this study to similarly-selected agn in the field indicates thatthe agn fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to agnidentified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to theapproximately constant radio-selected agn fraction in clusters and the field.we also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explorethe dependence of cluster agn fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion,cluster substructure, and butcher-oemler fraction. while we see weak evidencefor several trends, correlations between these four parameters in our smallsample precludes identification of which one(s) most strongly influence thecluster agn fraction.

1211.3418	the mass-metallicity relation with the direct method on stacked spectra  of sdss galaxies	the relation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity is asensitive diagnostic of the main processes that drive galaxy evolution, namelycosmological gas inflow, metal production in stars, and gas outflow viagalactic winds. we employed the direct method to measure the metallicities of~200,000 star-forming galaxies from the sdss that were stacked in bins of (1)stellar mass and (2) both stellar mass and star formation rate (sfr) tosignificantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the weak [o iii] 4363 and [oii] 7320, 7330 auroral lines required to apply the direct method. thesemetallicity measurements span three decades in stellar mass fromlog(mstar/msun) = 7.4-10.5, which allows the direct method mass-metallicityrelation to simultaneously capture the high-mass turnover and extend a fulldecade lower in mass than previous studies that employed more uncertain strongline methods. the direct method mass-metallicity relation rises steeply at lowmass (o/h ~ mstar^{1/2}) until it turns over at log(mstar/msun) = 8.9 andasymptotes to 12 + log(o/h) = 8.8 at high mass. the direct methodmass-metallicity relation has a steeper slope, a lower turnover mass, and afactor of two to three greater dependence on sfr than strong linemass-metallicity relations. furthermore, the sfr-dependence appears monotonicwith stellar mass, unlike strong line mass-metallicity relations. we alsomeasure the n/o abundance ratio, an important tracer of star formation history,and find the clear signature of primary and secondary nitrogen enrichment. n/ocorrelates tightly with oxygen abundance, and even more so with stellar mass.

1302.5124	the origin of dust in early-type galaxies and implications for accretion  onto supermassive black holes	we have conducted an archival spitzer study of 38 early-type galaxies (etgs)in order to determine the origin of the dust in approximately half of thispopulation. our sample galaxies generally have good wavelength coverage from3.6um to 160um, as well as visible-wavelength hst images. we use the spitzerdata to estimate dust masses, or establish upper limits, and find that all ofthe etgs with dust lanes in the hst data are detected in all of the spitzerbands and have dust masses of ~10^{5-6.5} msun, while galaxies without dustlanes are not detected at 70um and 160um and typically have &lt;10^5 msun of dust.the apparently dust-free galaxies do have 24um emission that scales with theshorter wavelength flux, yet substantially exceeds the expectations ofphotospheric emission by approximately a factor of three. we conclude thisemission is dominated by hot, circumstellar dust around evolved stars that doesnot survive to form a substantial interstellar component. the order ofmagnitude variations in dust masses between galaxies with similar stellarpopulations rules out a subtantial contribution from continual, internalproduction in spite of the clear evidence for circumstellar dust. wedemonstrate that the interstellar dust is not due to purely external accretion,unless the product of the merger rate of dusty satellites and the dust lifetimeis at least an order of magnitude higher than expected. we propose that dust inetgs is seeded by external accretion, yet the accreted dust is maintained bycontinued growth in externally-accreted cold gas beyond the nominal lifetime ofindividual grains. the several gyr depletion time of the cold gas is longenough to reconcile the fraction of dusty etgs with the merger rate of gas-richsatellites. as the majority of dusty etgs are also low-luminosity agn andlikely fueled by this cold gas, their lifetime should similarly be several gyr.

0807.1337	the origin of the intrinsic scatter in the relation between black hole  mass and bulge luminosity for nearby active galaxies	we investigate the origin of the intrinsic scatter in the correlation betweenblack hole mass (mbh) and bulge luminosity [l(bulge)] in a sample of 45massive, local (z &lt; 0.35) type~1 active galactic nuclei (agns). we derive mbhfrom published optical spectra assuming a spherical broad-line region, andl(bulge) from detailed two-dimensional decomposition of archival optical hubblespace telescope images. agns follow the mbh-l(bulge) relation of inactivegalaxies, but the zero point is shifted by an average of \delta log mbh ~ -0.3dex. we show that the magnitude of the zero point offset, which is responsiblefor the intrinsic scatter in the mbh-l(bulge) relation, is correlated withseveral agn and host galaxy properties, all of which are ultimately related to,or directly impact, the bh mass accretion rate. at a given bulge luminosity,sources with higher eddington ratios have lower mbh. the zero point offset canbe explained by a change in the normalization of the virial product used toestimate mbh, in conjunction with modest bh growth (~ 10%--40%) during the agnphase. galaxy mergers and tidal interactions appear to play an important rolein regulating agn fueling in low-redshift agns.

astro-ph;0002384	quasar clustering and the lifetime of quasars	although the population of luminous quasars rises and falls over a period of10^9 years, the typical lifetime of individual quasars is uncertain by severalorders of magnitude. we show that quasar clustering measurements cansubstantially narrow the range of possible lifetimes with the assumption thatluminous quasars reside in the most massive host halos. if quasars arelong-lived, then they are rare phenomena that are highly biased with respect tothe underlying dark matter, while if they are short-lived they reside in moretypical halos that are less strongly clustered. for a given quasar lifetime, wecalculate the minimum host halo mass by matching the observed space density ofquasars, using the press-schechter approximation. we use the results of mo &amp;white to calculate the clustering of these halos, and hence of the quasars theycontain, as a function of quasar lifetime. a lifetime of t_q = 4 x 10^7 years,the e-folding timescale of an eddington luminosity black hole with accretionefficiency eps=0.1, corresponds to a quasar correlation length r_0 ~ 10 mpc/hin low-density cosmological models at z=2-3; this value is consistent withcurrent clustering measurements, but these have large uncertainties.high-precision clustering measurements from the 2df and sloan quasar surveyswill test our key assumption of a tight correlation between quasar luminosityand host halo mass, and if this assumption holds then they should determine t_qto a factor of three or better. an accurate determination of the quasarlifetime will show whether supermassive black holes acquire most of their massduring high-luminosity accretion, and it will show whether the black holes inthe nuclei of typical nearby galaxies were once the central engines ofhigh-luminosity quasars.

(3) scuba sub-mmobservations of 3 fields detect 2 quasars and 2 galaxies with seds best fit ashighly reddened galaxies at the quasar z. (4) h-band adaptive optics (ao)imaging is used to estimate redshifts for 2 red, bulge-dominated galaxies usingthe kormendy relation. both have structural redshifts foreground to the quasar,but these are not confirmed by photometric redshifts, possibly because theiroptical photometry is corrupted by scattered light from the ao guidestar. (5)we use quantitative sed fits to constrain the photometric redshifts z_ph forsome galaxies. most galaxies near q0835+580 are consistent with being at itsredshift, including a candidate very old passively evolving galaxy. many very &amp;extremely red objects have z_ph z_q, and dust reddening is required to fit mostof them, including many objects whose fits also require relatively old stellarpopulations. large reddenings of e(b-v)~0.6 are required to fit four j-kselected eros, though all but one of them have best-fit z_ph&gt;z_q. these objectsmay represent a population of dusty high-z galaxies underrepresented inoptically selected samples.

astro-ph;0212391	circumnuclear dust in nearby active and inactive galaxies. ii. bars,  nuclear spirals, and the fueling of active galactic nuclei	(abridged) we present a detailed study of the relation between circumnucleardust morphology, host galaxy properties, and nuclear activity in nearbygalaxies. we use our sample of 123 nearby galaxies with visible--near-infraredcolormaps from the hubble space telescope to create well-matched, "paired"samples of 28 active and 28 inactive galaxies, as well as 19 barred and 19unbarred galaxies, that have the same host galaxy properties. comparison of thebarred and unbarred galaxies shows that grand design nuclear dust spirals areonly found in galaxies with a large-scale bar. tightly wound nuclear dustspirals, in contrast, show a strong tendency to avoid galaxies with large-scalebars. comparison of the agn and inactive samples shows that nuclear dustspirals, which may trace shocks and angular momentum dissipation in the ism,occur with comparable frequency in both active and inactive galaxies. the onlydifference between the active and inactive galaxies is that several inactivegalaxies appear to completely lack dust structure in their circumnuclearregion, while none of the agn lack this structure. the comparable frequency ofnuclear spirals in active and inactive galaxies, combined with previous workthat finds no significant differences in the frequency of bars or interactionsbetween well-matched active and inactive galaxies, suggests that no universalfueling mechanism for low-luminosity agn operates at spatial scales greaterthan ~100 pc radius from the galactic nuclei. the similarities instead suggestthat the lifetime of nuclear activity is less than the characteristic inflowtime from these spatial scales. an order-of-magnitude estimate of this inflowtime is the dynamical timescale. this sets an upper limit of several millionyears to the lifetime of an individual episode of nuclear activity.

astro-ph;0304009	qso lifetimes	the qso lifetime t_q is one of the most fundamental quantities forunderstanding black hole and qso evolution, yet it remains uncertain by severalorders of magnitude. if t_q is long, then only a small fraction of galaxieswent through a luminous qso phase. in contrast, a short lifetime would requiremost galaxies today to have undergone a qso phase in their youth. the currentbest estimates or constraints on t_q from black hole demographics and theradiative properties of qsos vary from at least 10^6 to 10^8 years. this broadrange still allows both possibilities: that qsos were either a rare or a commonstage of galaxy evolution. these constraints also do not rule out thepossibility that qso activity is episodic, with individual active periods muchshorter than the total active lifetime.  in the next few years a variety of additional observational constraints onthe lifetimes of qsos will become available, including clustering measurementsand the proximity effect. these new constraints can potentially determine t_qto within a factor of 3 and therefore answer one of the most fundamentalquestions in black hole evolution: do they shine as they grow? this precisionwill also test the viability of our current model for accretion physics,specifically the radiative efficiency and need for super-eddington luminositiesto explain the black hole population.

astro-ph;0502241	a physical model for the origin of quasar lifetimes	we propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which observational quasarlifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are stronglydistinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part ofthe accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities poweringaccretion. in this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but thequasar is buried. eventually, feedback from accretion energy dispersessurrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observableoptically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required tomaintain a quasar luminosity. we model this process and measure the unobscuredand intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxymerger. the source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,calculated from local gas properties. we calculate the column density ofhydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these columndensities and gas metallicities to determine b-band attenuation of the source.defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observedb-band luminosity above some limit l_b,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 myr forl_b,min=10^11 l_sun (m_b=-23), in good agreement with observationallydetermined quasar lifetimes. this is significantly smaller than the intrinsiclifetime ~100 myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. the ratio of observedto intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosityand the observed frequency.

astro-ph;0504190	black holes in galaxy mergers: evolution of quasars	based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a modelin which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassiveblack holes in galaxies. nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collisiontriggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the durationof the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas anddust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and uvwavelengths. eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas andexpels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. between buried and deadphases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminousquasar. because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution ofobscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of thisphase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposedluminosity threshold. we determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as afunction of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10myr for bright quasars in the optical b-band, in good agreement with empiricalestimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 myr,naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. however,observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the ir and hard x-ray bandsas attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. weobtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which thequasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agreesremarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution fromthe sdss for appropriate luminosity thresholds.

astro-ph;0506038	the evolution of the m-sigma relation	(abridged) we examine the evolution of the black hole mass - stellar velocitydispersion (m-sigma) relation over cosmic time using simulations of galaxymergers that include feedback from supermassive black hole growth. we considermergers of galaxies varying the properties of the progenitors to match thoseexpected at redshifts z=0-6. we find that the slope of the resulting m-sigmarelation is the same at all redshifts considered. for the same feedbackefficiency that reproduces the observed amplitude of the m-sigma relation atz=0, there is a weak redshift-dependence to the normalization that results froman increasing velocity dispersion for a given galactic stellar mass. we developa formalism to connect redshift evolution in the m-sigma relation to thescatter in the local relation at z=0. we show that the scatter in the localrelation places severe constraints on the redshift evolution of both thenormalization and slope of the m-sigma relation. furthermore, we demonstratethat cosmic downsizing introduces a black hole mass-dependent dispersion in them-sigma relation and that the skewness of the distribution about the locallyobserved m-sigma relation is sensitive to redshift evolution in thenormalization and slope. in principle, these various diagnostics provide amethod for differentiating between theories for producing the m-sigma relation.in agreement with existing constraints, our simulations imply that hierarchicalstructure formation should produce the relation with small intrinsic scatter.

astro-ph;0509568	spatially-resolved narrow line region kinematics in active galactic  nuclei	we have analyzed hst spectroscopy of 24 nearby agns to investigatespatially-resolved gas kinematics in the narrow line region (nlr). theseobservations effectively isolate the nuclear line profiles on less than 100 pcscales and are used to investigate the origin of the substantial scatterbetween the widths of strong nlr lines and the stellar velocity dispersionsigma_* of the host galaxy, a quantity which relates with substantially lessscatter to the mass of the central, supermassive black hole, and more generallycharacterize variations in the nlr velocity field with radius. we find thatline widths measured with stis at a range of spatial scales systematicallyunderestimate both sigma_* and the line width measured from ground-basedobservations, although they do have comparably large scatter to the relationbetween ground-based nlr line width and sigma_*. there are no obvious trends inthe residuals when compared with a range of host galaxy and nuclear properties.the widths and asymmetries of [oiii] 5007 and [sii] 6716, 6731 as a function ofradius exhibit a wide range of behavior. some of the most common phenomena aresubstantial width increases from the stis to the large-scale, ground-basedaperture and almost no change in line profile between the unresolved nuclearspectrum and ground-based measurements. we identify asymmetries in asurprisingly large fraction of low-ionization [sii] line profiles and severalexamples of substantial red asymmetries in both [oiii] and [sii]. these resultsunderscore the complexity of the circumnuclear material that constitutes thenlr and suggest that the scatter in the nlr width and sigma_* correlation cannot be substantially reduced with a simple set of empirical relations.

astro-ph;0602496	spectroscopic confirmation of a large agn population in clusters of  galaxies	we have completed a spectroscopic survey of x-ray point sources in eightlow-redshift clusters of galaxies (0.05&lt;z&lt;0.31) and have identified 40 clustermembers with broad-band (0.3-8 kev) x-ray luminosities between l_x = 8x10^{40}and 4x10^{43} erg/s. there are between two and ten x-ray sources per cluster.we use visible-wavelength emission lines, x-ray spectral shapes, andmultiwavelength flux ratios to determine that at least 35 of these galaxies areactive galactic nuclei (agn). from our spectroscopic survey of other candidatecluster members we estimate that the agn fraction f_a is ~5% for clustergalaxies more luminous than m_r = -20 mag hosting agn with broad-band x-rayluminosities above l_x = 10^{41} erg/s, or f_a(m_r&lt;-20;l_x&gt;10^{41}) ~ 5%. westress that additional, lower-luminosity agn are expected to be present in them_r &lt; -20 mag cluster members. our data unambiguously demonstrate that clustergalaxies host agn more frequently than previously expected. only four of thesegalaxies have obvious visible-wavelength agn signatures, even though theirx-ray luminosities are too high for their x-ray emission to be due topopulations of low-mass x-ray binaries or hot, gaseous halos. we attribute thesignificant difference in visible and x-ray agn identification to dilution oflow-luminosity agn spectral signatures by host galaxy starlight and/orobscuration of accretion onto the central, supermassive black hole.

astro-ph;0606460	the connection between barstrength and circumnuclear dust structure	we present a comparison of barstrength qb and circumnuclear dust morphologyfor 75 galaxies in order to investigate how bars affect the centers ofgalaxies. we trace the circumnuclear dust morphology and amount of duststructure with structure maps generated from visible-wavelength hst data,finding that tightly wound nuclear dust spirals are primarily found in weaklybarred galaxies. while strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand designstructure within the central 10 percent of d25, this structure rarely extendsto within ~10 pc of the galaxy nucleus. in some galaxies, these spiral armsterminate at a circumnuclear starburst ring. galaxies with circumnuclear ringsare generally more strongly barred than galaxies lacking rings. within theserings, the dust structure is fairly smooth and usually in the form of a looselywound spiral. these data demonstrate that multiple nuclear morphologies arepossible in the most strongly barred galaxies: chaotic central dust structureinconsistent with a coherent nuclear spiral, a grand design spiral that losescoherence before reaching the nucleus, or a grand design spiral that ends in acircumnuclear ring. these observations may indicate that not all strong barsare equally efficient at fueling material to the centers of their hostgalaxies. finally, we investigate the longstanding hypothesis that sb(s)galaxies have weak bars and sb(r) galaxies have strong bars, finding theopposite to be the case: namely, sb(r) galaxies are less strongly barred andhave less dust structure than sb(s) galaxies. in general, more strongly barredgalaxies tend to have higher nuclear dust contrast.

astro-ph;0606461	chandra observations of candidate "true" seyfert 2 nuclei	the unification model for active galactic nuclei posits that seyfert 2s areintrinsically like seyfert 1s, but that their broad-line regions (blrs) arehidden from our view. a seyfert 2 nucleus that truly lacked a blr, instead ofsimply having it hidden, would be a so-called "true" seyfert 2. no object hasas yet been conclusively proven to be one. we present a detailed analysis offour of the best "true" seyfert 2 candidates discovered to date: ic 3639, ngc3982, ngc 5283, and ngc 5427. none of the four has a broad h-alpha emissionline, either in direct or polarized light. all four have rich, high-excitationspectra, blue continua, and hubble space telescope (hst) images showing them tobe unresolved sources with no host-galaxy obscuration. to check for possibleobscuration on scales smaller than that resolvable by hst, we obtained x-rayobservations using the chandra x-ray observatory. all four objects showevidence of obscuration and therefore could have hidden blrs. the picture thatemerges is of moderate to high, but not necessarily compton-thick, obscurationof the nucleus, with extra-nuclear soft emission extended on thehundreds-of-parsecs scale that may originate in the narrow-line region. sincethe extended soft emission compensates, in part, for the nuclear soft emissionlost to absorption, both absorption and luminosity are likely to be severelyunderestimated unless the x-ray spectrum is of sufficient quality todistinguish the two components. this is of special concern where the source istoo faint to produce a large number of counts, or where the source is too faraway to resolve the extended soft x-ray emitting region.

astro-ph;0610380	a strong correlation between circumnuclear dust and black hole accretion  in early-type galaxies	we present a detailed investigation of the incidence of circumnuclear duststructure in a large, well-matched sample of early-type galaxies with andwithout active galactic nuclei (agn). all 34 early-type agn hosts in our samplehave circumnuclear dust, while dust is only observed in 26% (nine) of apair-matched sample of 34 early-type, inactive galaxies. this resultdemonstrates a strong correlation between the presence of circumnuclear dustand accretion onto the central, supermassive black hole in elliptical andlenticular galaxies. this correlation is not present at later hubble types,where a sample of 31 active and 31 inactive galaxies all contain circumnucleardust. these archival, hst observations reveal a wide range of mostly chaoticdust morphologies. current estimates suggest the dust settling or destructiontime is on order of 10^8 years and therefore the presence of dust in ~ 50% ofearly-type galaxies requires frequent replenishment and similarly frequentfueling of their central, supermassive black holes. the observed dust could beinternally-produced (via stellar winds) or externally-accreted, although thereare observational challenges for both of these scenarios. our analysis alsoreveals that approximately a third of the early-type galaxies withoutcircumnuclear dust have nuclear stellar disks. these nuclear stellar disks mayprovide a preferred kinematic axis to externally-accreted material and thismaterial may in turn form new stars in these disks. the observed incidence ofnuclear stellar disks and circumnuclear dust suggests that episodicreplenishment of nuclear stellar disks occurs and is approximately concurrentwith the fueling of the central agn.

astro-ph;0703794	the stellar populations of seyfert 2 nuclei	we present a preliminary analysis of the stellar populations in the centralparsecs of a sample of 22 seyfert 2 galaxies, based on a careful separation ofnebular emission and stellar light in high-spatial resolution hst-stis spectra.10% of the surveyed nuclei display stellar populations of intermediate age, 1-2gyr old, whereas the remaining targets appear to be evenly split betweenobjects showing only very old stellar populations and nuclei requiring also anadditional blue featureless component, which we characterise by means of veryyoung, few-myr-old stars.  the small fraction of stellar population of intermediate age seems to argueagainst the presence of such a young component, however, since the shortlifetime of o-stars would imply recurrent star-formation episodes and thebuild-up over the last 1-2 gyr of a detectable intermediate-age population.  additionally, a correlation between the luminosity of such a blue componentand the emission from highly-ionised species, together with the general absenceof wolf-rayet features, further suggests that the featureless continuum arisesfrom the central engine rather than from star-forming regions.  we discuss our results in the framework of the unification paradigm and ofmodels for star formation close to supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;9704182	the optical/near-ir colors of broad absorption line quasars, including  the candidate radio-loud bal quasar 1556+3517	a candidate radio-loud broad absorption line quasar (rlbal) has been reportedby becker et al. (1997). we present jhk observations of this object and threeother radio-detected bals taken with the new michigan-dartmouth-mit/ohiostate/aladdin ir camera (mosaic) on the kpno 4-meter. the candidate rlbal1556+3517 has b-k=6.63, redder than all but one or two known z&gt;1 quasars. thisstrongly suggests the observed continuum of this quasar is reddened by dust.even when this extreme reddening is taken into account 1556+3517 is stillprobably radio-loud, although near-ir spectroscopy to measure its balmerdecrement will be needed to verify this. in addition, since it is aflat-spectrum object, vlbi observations to determine the extent (if any) towhich beaming affects our estimate of its radio luminosity will be neededbefore 1556+3517 can be unequivocally declared a radio-loud bal. we also useour data and data from the literature to show that optically selected bals as aclass have b-k colors consistent with the observed distribution for opticallyselected quasars as a whole. thus there is currently no evidence that thetendency of optically selected bals to be preferentially radio-intermediate(hooper, francis, &amp; impey 1993) is due to extinction artificially loweringestimated bal optical luminosities. however, as most quasar surveys, both radioand optical, would be insensitive to a population of reddened radio-quiet bals,the existence of a large population of reddened bals similar to 1556+3517cannot yet be ruled out.

astro-ph;9705102	the giant branches of open and globular clusters in the infrared as  metallicity indicators: a comparison with theory	we apply the giant branch slope-[fe/h] relation derived by kuchinski et al.[aj, 109, 1131 (1995)] to a sample of open clusters. we find that the slope ofthe giant branch in k vs. (j-k) color-magnitude diagrams correlates with [fe/h]for open clusters as it does for metal-rich globular clusters but that the opencluster data are systematically shifted to less negative values of giant branchslope, at constant [fe/h]. we use isochrone models to examine the theoreticalbasis for this relationship and find that for a given value of [fe/h], theslope of the relationship remains constant with decreasing population age butthe relation shifts to less negative values of giant branch slope withdecreasing age. both of these theoretical predictions agree with the trendsfound in the data. finally, we derive new coefficients for the giant branchslope-[fe/h] relation for specific members of 3 populations, metal-richglobular clusters, bulge stars and open clusters.

astro-ph;9808020	quasar candidates in the hubble deep field	we focus on the search for unresolved faint quasars and agn in the crudecombine images using a multicolor imaging analysis that has proven verysuccessful in recent years. quasar selection was carried out both in multicolorspace and in "profile space," defined as the multi-parameter space formed bythe radial profiles of the objects in the different images. by combining thedither frames available for each filter, we were able to obtain well-sampledradial profiles of the objects and measure their deviation from that of astellar source. we also generated synthetic quasar spectra in the range 1.0 &lt; z&lt; 5.5 and computed expected quasar colors. we determined that the data are 90%complete for point sources at 26.2, 28.0, 27.8, 26.8 in the f300w, f450w, f606wand f814w filters, respectively. we find 41 compact objects in the hdf: 8pointlike objects with colors consistent with quasars or stars, 18 stars, and15 slightly resolved objects, 12 of which have colors consistent with quasarsor stars. we estimate the upper limit of unresolved and slightly resolvedquasars/agns with v &lt; 27.0 and z &lt; 3.5 to be 20 objects (16,200 per deg^2). wefind good agreement among authors on the number of stars and the lack of quasarcandidates with z &gt; 3.5. we find more quasar candidates than previous workbecause of our more extensive modeling and use of all of the available colorinformation.

astro-ph;9905016	nova sagittarii 1994 #1 (v4332 sagittarii): the discovery and evolution  of an unusual luminous red variable star	we report photometry and spectroscopy of the evolution of nova sagittarii1994 #1 (v4332 sagittarii) during outburst. we compare the photometric andspectral evolution of this outburst to known classes of outbursts -- includingclassical novae and outbursts occurring on symbiotic stars -- and find thisobject does not conform to any known class of outburst. the closest match tothe behavior of this unusual object is m31 rv, an extremely luminous and redvariable object discovered in the bulge of m31 in 1988. however, the temporalbehavior and maximum luminosity of the two events differ by several orders ofmagnitude, requiring substantial intrinsic variation if these two events aremembers the same type of outburst.  our model of the spectroscopic evolution of this outburst shows that theeffective temperature cooled from 4400 k to 2300 k over the three month span ofour observations. in combination with line diagnostics in our later spectra,including [oi] lambda 5577 and the dramatic increase in the halpha to hbetaratio, we infer the existence of a cool, dense (n_e ~ 10^{8-9} cm^{-3})envelope that is optically thick in the hydrogen balmer recombination lines(case c). we suggest that a nuclear event in a single star, in which a slowshock drove the photosphere outwards, can power the observed luminosityevolution and the emission spectrum.

astro-ph;9905028	near-infrared spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen emission in four  reflection nebulae: ngc 1333, ngc 2023, ngc 2068, and ngc 7023	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of fluorescent molecular hydrogen (h_2)emission from ngc 1333, ngc 2023, ngc 2068, and ngc 7023 and derive thephysical properties of the molecular material in these reflection nebulae. ourobservations of ngc 2023 and ngc 7023 and the physical parameters we derive forthese nebulae are in good agreement with previous studies. both ngc 1333 andngc 2068 have no previously-published analysis of near-infrared spectra. ourstudy reveals that the rotational-vibrational states of molecular hydrogen inngc 1333 are populated quite differently from ngc 2023 and ngc 7023. wedetermine that the relatively weak uv field illuminating ngc 1333 is theprimary cause of the difference. further, we find that the density of theemitting material in ngc 1333 is of much lower density, with n ~ 10^2 - 10^4cm^-3. ngc 2068 has molecular hydrogen line ratios more similar to those of ngc7023 and ngc 2023. our model fits to this nebula show that the bright,h_2-emitting material may have a density as high as n ~ 10^5 cm^-3, similar towhat we find for ngc 2023 and ngc 7023. our spectra of ngc 2023 and ngc 7023show significant changes in both the near-infrared continuum and h_2 intensityalong the slit and offsets between the peaks of the h_2 and continuum emission.we find that these brightness changes may correspond to real changes in thedensity and temperatures of the emitting region, although uncertainties in thetotal column of emitting material along a given line of sight complicates theinterpretation. the spatial difference in the peak of the h_2 and near-infraredcontinuum peaks in ngc 2023 and ngc 7023 shows that the near-infrared continuumis due to a material which can survive closer to the star than h_2 can.

astro-ph;9909032	hubble space telescope observations of the cfa seyfert 2s: the fueling  of active galactic nuclei	we present an investigation of possible fueling mechanisms operating in theinner kiloparsec of seyfert galaxies. we analyze visible and near-infraredhubble space telescope images of 24 seyfert 2s from the cfa redshift surveysample. in particular, we are searching for the morphological signatures ofdynamical processes reponsible for transporting gas from kiloparsec scales intothe nucleus. the circumnuclear regions are very rich in gas and dust, oftentaking the form of nuclear spiral dust lanes on scales of a few hundredparsecs. while these nuclear spirals are found in 20 of our 24 seyferts, wefind only 5 nuclear bars among the entire sample, strongly reinforcing theconclusions of other investigators that nuclear bars are not the primary meansof transporting this material into the nucleus. an estimate of the gas densityin the nuclear spirals based on extinction measurements suggests that thenuclear spiral dust lanes are probably shocks in nuclear gas disks that are notstrongly self-gravitating. since shocks can dissipate energy and angularmomentum, these spiral dust lanes may be the channels by which gas from thehost galaxy disks is being fed into the central engines.

0706.0209	first measurement of a rapid increase in the agn fraction in  high-redshift clusters of galaxies	we present the first measurement of the agn fraction in high-redshiftclusters of galaxies (z~0.6) with spectroscopy of one cluster and archival datafor three additional clusters. we identify 8 agn in all four of these clustersfrom the chandra data, which are sensitive to agn with hard x-ray (2-10kev)luminosity l_{x,h} &gt; 10^43 erg/s in host galaxies more luminous than a restframe m_r &lt; -20 mag. this stands in sharp contrast to the one agn with l_{x,h}&gt; 10^43 erg/s we discovered in our earlier study of eight low-redshift clusterswith z=0.06-0.31 (average z~0.2). three of the four high-redshift clusterdatasets are sensitive to nearly l_{x,h} &gt; 10^42 erg/s and we identify sevenagn above this luminosity limit, compared to two in eight, low-redshiftclusters. based on membership estimates for each cluster, we determine that theagn fraction at z~0.6 is f_a(l_x&gt;10^42;m_r&lt;-20) = 0.028 (+0.019/-0.012) andf_a(l_x&gt;10^43;m_r&lt;-20) = 0.020 (+0.012/-0.008). these values are approximatelya factor of 20 greater than the agn fractions in lower-redshift (average z~0.2)clusters of galaxies and represent a substantial increase over the factors of1.5 and 3.3 increase, respectively, in the measured space density evolution ofthe hard x-ray luminosity function over this redshift range. potentialsystematic errors would only increase the significance of our result. thecluster agn fraction increases more rapidly with redshift than the field andthe increase in cluster agn indicates the presence of an agn butcher-oemlereffect.
