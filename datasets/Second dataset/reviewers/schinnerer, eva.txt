0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0907.5199	massive galaxies in cosmos: evolution of black hole versus bulge mass  but not versus total stellar mass over the last 9 gyrs?	we constrain the ratio of black hole (bh) mass to total stellar mass oftype-1 agn in the cosmos survey at 1&lt;z&lt;2. for 10 agn at mean redshift z~1.4with both hst/acs and hst/nicmos imaging data we are able to compute totalstellar mass m_(*,total), based on restframe uv-to-optical host galaxy colorswhich constrain mass-to-light ratios. all objects have virial bh mass-estimatesavailable from the cosmos magellan/imacs and zcosmos surveys. we find zerodifference between the m_bh--m_(*,total)-relation at z~1.4 and them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation in the local universe.  our interpretation is: (a) if our objects were purely bulge-dominated, them_bh--m_(*,bulge)-relation has not evolved since z~1.4. however, (b) since wehave evidence for substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies(logm_(*,total)=11.1+-0.25 or logm_bh~8.3+-0.2) must have grown over the last 9gyrs predominantly by redistribution of disk- into bulge-mass. since allnecessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation oraddition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.induced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. merging, inaddition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both bh andstellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final m_bh/m_(*,bulge)ratio.  since the overall cosmic stellar and bh mass buildup trace each other tightlyover time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independentof any strong bh-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling bh and bulgemass until the present is very indirect.

0910.1091	blast: the far-infrared/radio correlation in distant galaxies	we investigate the correlation between far-infrared (fir) and radioluminosities in distant galaxies, a lynchpin of modern astronomy. we use datafrom the balloon-borne large aperture submillimetre telescope (blast), spitzer,the large apex bolometer camera (laboca), the very large array (vla) and thegiant metre-wave radio telescope (gmrt) in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs). for a catalogue of blast 250-micron-selected galaxies, were-measure the 70--870-micron flux densities at the positions of their mostlikely 24-micron counterparts, which have a median [interquartile] redshift of0.74 [0.25, 1.57]. from these, we determine the monochromatic flux densityratio, q_250 = log_10 (s_250micron / s_1400mhz), and the bolometric equivalent,q_ir. at z ~= 0.6, where our 250-micron filter probes rest-frame 160-micronemission, we find no evolution relative to q_160 for local galaxies. we alsostack the fir and submm images at the positions of 24-micron- andradio-selected galaxies. the difference between q_ir seen for 250-micron- andradio-selected galaxies suggests star formation provides most of the irluminosity in ~&lt; 100-ujy radio galaxies, but rather less for those in the mjyregime. for the 24-micron sample, the radio spectral index is constant across 0&lt; z &lt; 3, but q_ir exhibits tentative evidence of a steady decline such thatq_ir is proportional to (1+z)^(-0.15 +/- 0.03) - significant evolution,spanning the epoch of galaxy formation, with major implications for techniquesthat rely on the fir/radio correlation. we compare with model predictions andspeculate that we may be seeing the increase in radio activity that gives riseto the radio background.

0910.1099	millimetre observations of a sample of high-redshift obscured quasars	we present observations at 1.2 mm with mambo-ii of a sample of z&gt;~2radio-intermediate obscured quasars, as well as co observations of two sourceswith the plateau de bure interferometer. five out of 21 sources (24%) aredetected at a significance of &gt;=3sigma. stacking all sources leads to astatistical detection of &lt;s_1.2mm&gt;= 0.96+-0.11 mjy and stacking only thenon-detections also yields a statistical detection, with &lt;s_1.2mm&gt;= 0.51+-0.13mjy. this corresponds to a typical far-infrared luminosity l_fir~4x10^12 lsol.if the far-infrared luminosity is powered entirely by star-formation, and notby agn-heated dust, then the characteristic inferred star-formation rate is~700 msol yr-1. this far-infrared luminosity implies a dust mass ofm_dust~3x10^8 msol. we estimate that such large dust masses on kpc scales canplausibly cause the obscuration of the quasars. we present dust seds for oursample and derive a mean sed for our sample. this mean sed is not well fittedby clumpy torus models, unless additional extinction and far-infraredre-emission due to cool dust are included. there is a hint that the hostgalaxies of obscured quasars must have higher far-infrared luminosities andcool-dust masses and are therefore often found at an earlier evolutionary phasethan those of unobscured quasars. for one source at z=2.767, we detect theco(3-2) transition, with s_co delta nu=630+-50 mjy km s-1, corresponding tol_co(3-2)= 3.2x10^7 lsol, or l'_co(3-2)=2.4x10^10 k km s-1 pc2. for anothersource at z=4.17, the lack of detection of the co(4-3) line yields a limit ofl'_co(4-3)&lt;1x10^10 k km s-1 pc2. molecular gas masses, gas depletion timescalesand gas-to-dust ratios are estimated (abridged).

0708.1020	evidence for a population of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies from  interferometric imaging	we have used the submillimeter array to image a flux limited sample of sevensubmillimeter galaxies, selected by the aztec camera on the jcmt at 1.1 mm, inthe cosmos field at 890um with 2" resolution. all of the sources - tworadio-bright and five radio-dim - are detected as single point-sources at highsignificance (&gt; 6\sigma), with positions accurate to 0.2" that enablecounterpart identification at other wavelengths observed with similarly highangular resolution. all seven have irac counterparts, but only two have securecounterparts in deep hst/acs imaging. as compared to the two radio-brightsources in the sample, and those in previous studies, the five radio-dimsources in the sample (1) have systematically higher submillimeter-to-radioflux ratios, (2) have lower irac 3.6-8.0um fluxes, and (3) are not detected at24um. these properties, combined with size constraints at 890um (\theta &lt;1.2"), suggest that the radio-dim submillimeter galaxies represent a populationof very dusty starbursts, with physical scales similar to local ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, and an average redshift higher than radio-bright sources.

1008.0389	a massive molecular gas reservoir in the z=5.3 submillimeter galaxy  aztec-3	we report the detection of co 2-1, 5-4, and 6-5 emission in thehighest-redshift submillimeter galaxy (smg) aztec-3 at z=5.298, using theexpanded very large array and the plateau de bure interferometer. theseobservations ultimately confirm the redshift, making aztec-3 the mostsubmillimeter-luminous galaxy in a massive z=5.3 protocluster structure in thecosmos field. the strength of the co line emission reveals a large moleculargas reservoir with a mass of 5.3e10 (alpha_co/0.8) msun, which can maintain theintense 1800 msun/yr starburst in this system for at least 30 myr, increasingthe stellar mass by up to a factor of six in the process. this gas mass iscomparable to `typical' z~2 smgs, and constitutes &gt;~80% of the baryonic mass(gas+stars) and 30%-80% of the total (dynamical) mass in this galaxy. themolecular gas reservoir has a radius of &lt;4 kpc and likely consists of a`diffuse', low-excitation component, containing (at least) 1/3 of the gas mass(depending on the relative conversion factor alpha_co), and a `dense',high-excitation component, containing ~2/3 of the mass. the likely presence ofa substantial diffuse component besides highly-excited gas suggests differentproperties between the star-forming environments in z&gt;4 smgs and z&gt;4 quasarhost galaxies, which perhaps trace different evolutionary stages. the discoveryof a massive, metal-enriched gas reservoir in a smg at the heart of a largez=5.3 protocluster considerably enhances our understanding of early massivegalaxy formation, pushing back to a cosmic epoch where the universe was lessthan 1/12 of its present age.

1010.2497	properties of bulgeless disk galaxies. i. atomic gas	we study the neutral hydrogen properties of a sample of 20 bulgeless diskgalaxies (sd - sdm hubble types), an interesting class that can be used toconstrain galaxy formation and evolution, especially the role of mergers versusinternal processes. our sample is composed of nearby (within 32 mpc),moderately inclined galaxies that bracket the circular velocity of 120 km/s,which has been found to be associated with a transition in dust scale heightsin edge-on, late-type disks. here we present hi channel maps, line profiles,and integrated intensity maps. we also derive kinematic parameters, includingthe circular velocity, from rotation curve analyses and calculate theintegrated hi flux and hi mass for each galaxy in the sample. three of the 20galaxies in our sample have kinematically distinct outer components with majoraxes that differ by 30 - 90 degrees from the main disk. these distinct outercomponents may be due to a recent interaction, which would be somewhatsurprising because the disks do not contain bulges. we will use the dataproducts and derived properties in subsequent investigations into starformation and secular evolution in bulgeless disks with circular velocitiesabove and below 120 km/s.

1011.6370	the star formation history of mass-selected galaxies in the cosmos field	we explore the evolution of the specific star formation rate (ssfr) for3.6um-selected galaxies of different m_* in the cosmos field. the average sfrfor sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4ghz radio continuumemission. we separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (sf)that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frameoptical sed. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;3 both populations show a strong and m_*-independentdecrease in their ssfr towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for sf sources. the decrease appears tohave started at z&gt;2, at least above 4x10^10m_sun where our conclusions are mostrobust. we find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, ssfr (m_*)^beta,between ssfr and m_* at all z. it tends to flatten below ~10^10m_sun ifquiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_sfg-0.4 fits the correlation. on average, higher m_* objects always have lowerssfrs, also among sf galaxies. at z&gt;1.5 there is tentative evidence for anupper ssfr-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. it is suggested by aflattening of the ssfr-m_* relation (also for sf sources), but affects massive(&gt;10^10m_sun) galaxies only at the highest z. below z=1.5 there thus is nodirect evidence that galaxies of higher m_* experience a more rapid waning oftheir ssfr than lower m_* sf systems. in this sense, the data rule out anystrong 'downsizing'. we combine our results with recent measurements of thegalaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass ofa sf galaxy (m_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)m_sun). in this sense, too, there is no'downsizing'. our analysis constitutes the most extensive sfr densitydetermination with a single technique to z=3. recent herschel results areconsistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

1012.0749	the thick disk in the galaxy ngc 4244 from s4g imaging	if thick disks are ubiquitous and a natural product of disk galaxy formationand/or evolution processes, all undisturbed galaxies which have evolved duringa significant fraction of a hubble time should have a thick disk. the late-typespiral galaxy ngc 4244 has been reported as the only nearby edge-on galaxywithout a confirmed thick disk. using data from the spitzer survey of stellarstructure in galaxies (s4g) we have identified signs of two disk components inthis galaxy. the asymmetries between the light profiles on both sides of themid-plane of ngc 4244 can be explained by a combination of the galaxy not beingperfectly edge-on and a certain degree of opacity of the thin disk. we arguethat the subtlety of the thick disk is a consequence of either a limitedsecular evolution in ngc 4244, a small fraction of stellar material in thefragments which built the galaxy, or a high amount of gaseous accretion afterthe formation of the galaxy.

1101.2869	new constraints on mass-dependent disruption of star clusters in m51	we use ubvi,ha images of the whirlpool galaxy, m51, taken with the acs andwfpc2 cameras on the hubble space telescope (hst) to select star clusters, andto estimate their masses and ages by comparing their observed colors withpredictions from population synthesis models. we construct the mass function ofintermediate age (1-4x10^8 yr) clusters, and find that it is well described bya power law, psi(m) propto m^beta, with beta=-2.1 +/- 0.2, for clusters moremassive than approximately 6x10^3 msun. this extends the mass function ofintermediate age clusters in m51 to masses lower by nearly a factor of fiveover previous determinations. the mass function does not show evidence forcurvature at either the high or low mass end. this shape indicates that thereis no evidence for the earlier disruption of lower mass clusters compared withtheir higher mass counterparts (i.e., no mass-dependent disruption) over theobserved range of masses and ages, or for a physical upper mass limit mc withwhich clusters in m51 can form. these conclusions differ from previoussuggestions based on poorer-quality hst observations. we discuss theirimplications for the formation and disruption of the clusters. ages of clustersin two "feathers," stellar features extending from the outer portion of aspiral arm, show that the feather with a larger pitch angle formed earlier, andover a longer period, than the other.

1103.1913	a deep chandra acis study of ngc 4151. iii. the line emission and  spectral analysis of the ionization cone	this paper is the third in a series in which we present deep chandra acis-simaging spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151, devoted to study itscomplex circum-nuclear x-ray emission. emission features in the soft x-rayspectrum of the bright extended emission (l[0.3-2kev]~10^40 erg/s) at r&gt;130 pc(2") are consistent with the brighter ovii, oviii, and neix lines seen in thechandra hetgs and xmm-newton rgs spectra below 2 kev. we construct emissionline images of these features and find good morphological correlations with thenarrow line region clouds mapped in [oiii]5007a. self-consistentphotoionization models provide good descriptions of the spectra of the largescale emission, as well as resolved structures, supporting the dominant role ofnuclear photoionization, although displacement of optical and x-ray featuresimplies a more complex medium. collisionally ionized emission is estimated tobe &lt;12% of the extended emission. presence of both low and high ionizationspectral components and extended emission in the x-ray image perpendicular tothe bicone indicates leakage of nuclear ionization, likely filtered throughwarm absorbers, instead of being blocked by a continuous obscuring torus. theratios of [oiii]/soft x-ray flux are approximately constant (~15) for the 1.5kpc radius spanned by these measurements, indicating a relatively constantionization parameter, consistent with the photoionized outflow of a wind-likedensity profile. using spatially resolved features, we estimate that the massoutflow rate in ngc 4151 is ~2msun/yr at 130 pc and the kinematic power of theionized outflow is 1.7x10^41 erg/s, approximately 0.3% of the bolometricluminosity of ngc 4151.

1106.2092	star and dust formation activities in aztec-3: a starburst galaxy at z =  5.3	analyses of high-redshift ultraluminous infrared (ir) galaxies traditionallyuse the observed optical to submillimeter spectral energy distribution (sed)and estimates of the dynamical mass as observational constraints to derive thestar formation rate (sfr), the stellar mass, and age of these objects. animportant observational constraint neglected in the analysis is the mass ofdust giving rise to the ir emission. in this paper we add this constraint tothe analysis of aztec-3. adopting an upper limit to the mass of stars and abolometric luminosity for this object, we construct stellar and chemicalevolutionary scenarios, constrained to produce the inferred dust mass andobserved luminosity before the associated stellar mass exceeds theobservational limit. we find that the model with a top heavy imf provided themost plausible scenario consistent with the observational constraints. in thisscenario the dust formed over a period of ~200 myr, with a sfr of ~500 msun/yr.these values for the age and sfr in aztec-3 are significantly higher and lower,respectively, from those derived without the dust mass constraint. however,this scenario is not unique, and others cannot be completely ruled out becauseof the prevailing uncertainties in the age of the galaxy, its bolometricluminosity, and its stellar and dust masses. a robust result of our models isthat all scenarios require most of the radiating dust mass to have beenaccreted in molecular clouds. our new procedure highlights the importance of amultiwavelength approach, and of the use of dust evolution models inconstraining the age and the star formation activity and history in galaxies.

1106.4022	the emission by dust and stars of nearby galaxies in the herschel  kingfish survey	using new far-infrared imaging from the herschel space observatory withancillary data from ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths, we estimate thetotal emission from dust and stars of 62 nearby galaxies in the kingfish surveyin a way that is as empirical and model-independent as possible. we collect andexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions(seds) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated bydust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. by including spiredata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previousanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dusttemperatures and masses.  the dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the seds, has arange of nearly three decades. the inclusion of spire data shows that estimatesbased on data not reaching these far-ir wavelengths are biased low. we findthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total irluminosity. we also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phasemetallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. the substantialscatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that theformer is a poor proxy of the latter. comparing the dust/stellar flux ratiosand dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmertemperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intenseinterstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.finally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strongcorrelation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formationrate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-ir emission of some ofthese galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field fromolder stars.

1107.0529	the unusual vertical mass distribution of ngc 4013 seen through the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	ngc 4013 is a nearby sb edge-on galaxy known for its "prodigious" hi warp andits "giant" tidal stream. previous work on this unusual object shows that itcannot be fitted satisfactorily by a canonical thin+thick disk structure. wehave produced a new decomposition of ngc 4013, considering three stellarflattened components (thin+thick disk plus an extra and more extendedcomponent) and one gaseous disk. all four components are considered to begravitationally coupled and isothermal. to do so, we have used the 3.6micronimages from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). we findevidence for ngc4013 indeed having a thin and a thick disk and an extraflattened component. this smooth and extended component (scaleheight z_ec kpc)could be interpreted as a thick disk or as a squashed ellipsoidal halo andcontains ~20% of the total mass of all three stellar components. we argue it isunlikely to be related to the ongoing merger or due to the off-plane stars froma warp in the other two disk components. instead, we favor a scenario in whichthe thick disk and the extended component were formed in a two-stage process,in which an initially thick disk has been dynamically heated by a merger soonenough in the galaxy history to have a new thick disk formed within it.

1107.4109	complex radio spectral energy distributions in luminous and  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we use the expanded very large array to image radio continuum emission fromlocal luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) in 1 ghzwindows centered at 4.7, 7.2, 29, and 36 ghz. this allows us to probe theintegrated radio spectral energy distribution (sed) of the most energeticgalaxies in the local universe. the 4-8 ghz flux densities agree well withprevious measurements. they yield spectral indices \alpha \approx -0.67 (wheref_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha) with \pm 0.15 (1\sigma) scatter, typical ofnonthermal (synchrotron) emission from star-forming galaxies. the contrast ofour 4-8 ghz data with literature 1.5 and 8.4 ghz flux densities gives furtherevidence for curvature of the radio sed of u/lirgs. the sed appears flatternear \sim 1 ghz than near \sim 6 ghz, suggesting significant optical deptheffects at the lower frequencies. the high frequency (28-37 ghz) flux densitiesare low compared to extrapolations from the 4-8 ghz data. we confirm and extendto higher frequency a previously observed deficit of high frequency radioemission for luminous starburst galaxies.

1108.1786	molecular gas around low-luminosity agn in late-type spirals	we have studied the molecular gas in the vicinity of low-luminosity activegalactic nuclei (agns) in three bulge-less spiral galaxies: ngc 1042, ngc 4178,and ngc 4395. the (1-0) and (2-1) transitions of gaseous carbon monoxide (co)are clearly detected within the central kpc of all three galaxies. in the caseof ngc 4395, this constitutes the first reported detection of co. in general,the co emission is faint, as may be expected from their less-than-spectacularstar formation activity. interestingly, however, both face-on galaxies in oursample (which allow an unimpeded view of their nucleus) show an elevatedintensity ratio co(2-1)/co(1-0) when compared to similar late-type spiralswithout an agn. we discuss that this is unlikely due to a very compact cosource. instead, we speculate that even energetically weak agn can impact thephysical state of the surrounding gas. we do not detect any tracers of densemolecular gas such as hcn or hco+, but the sensitivity of our observationsallows us to establish upper limits that lie at the low end of the rangeobserved in more energetic agn. the derived gas density is less thann(h2)\approx 2e03 cm^-3 which is significantly lower than in most other nearbygalaxies. the scarcity of dense gas suggests that the conditions for starformation are poor in these nuclei.

0710.4552	evolution of the bar fraction in cosmos: quantifying the assembly of the  hubble sequence	we have analyzed the redshift-dependent fraction of galactic bars over0.2&lt;z&lt;0.84 in 2,157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the cosmos 2-squaredegree field. our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in anyprevious investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data thanthat available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxymorphology. we find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly withredshift. whereas in the local universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxiescontain bars (sb+sab), at z ~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. over thisredshift range the fraction of strong (sb) bars drops from about 30% to under10%. it is clear that when the universe was half its present age, the census ofgalaxies on the hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of thepresent day. a major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emergedfrom our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is astrong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. the barfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84whereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshiftbeyond z=0.3. there is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominatedsystems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards theco-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes. our results thus have importantramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggestingthat massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as aresult of the regulation of their star formation rate.

1203.0467	the s4g perspective on circumstellar dust extinction of agb stars in  m100	we examine the effect of circumstellar dust extinction on the near-ircontribution of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in intermediate-ageclusters throughout the disk of m100. for our sample of 17 agb-dominatedclusters we extract optical-to-mid-ir seds and find that nir brightness iscoupled to the mid-ir dust emission in such a way that a significant reductionof agb light, of up to 1 mag in k-band, follows from extinction by the dustshell formed during this stage. since the dust optical depth varies with agbchemistry (c-rich or o-rich), our results suggest that the contribution of agbstars to the flux from their host clusters will be closely linked to themetallicity and the progenitor mass of the agb star, to which dust chemistryand mass-loss rate are sensitive. our sample of clusters--each the analogue ofa ~1 gyr old post-starburst galaxy--has implications within the context of massand age estimation via sed modelling at high z: we find that the average ~0.5mag extinction estimated here may be sufficient to reduce the agb contributionin (rest-frame) k-band from ~70%, as predicted in the latest generation ofsynthesis models, to ~35%. our technique for selecting agb-dominated clustersin nearby galaxies promises to be effective for discriminating theuncertainties associated with agb stars in intermediate-age populations thatplague age and mass estimation in high-z galaxies.

1204.1555	properties of bulgeless disk galaxies ii. star formation as a function  of circular velocity	we study the relation between the surface density of gas and star formationrate in twenty moderately-inclined, bulgeless disk galaxies (sd-sdm hubbletypes) using co(1-0) data from the iram 30m telescope, hi emission line datafrom the vla/evla, h-alpha data from the mdm observatory, and pah emission dataderived from spitzer irac observations. we specifically investigate theefficiency of star formation as a function of circular velocity (v_circ).previous work found that the vertical dust structure and disk stability ofedge-on, bulgeless disk galaxies transition from diffuse dust lanes with largescale heights and gravitationally-stable disks at v_circ &lt; 120 km/s (m_star &lt;~10^10 m_sun) to narrow dust lanes with small scale heights andgravitationally-unstable disks at v_circ &gt; 120 km/s. we find no transition instar formation efficiency (sigma_sfr/sigma_hi+h2) at v_circ = 120 km/s, or atany other circular velocity probed by our sample (v_circ = 46 - 190 km/s).contrary to previous work, we find no transition in disk stability at anycircular velocity in our sample. assuming our sample has the same duststructure transition as the edge-on sample, our results demonstrate that scaleheight differences in the cold interstellar medium of bulgeless disk galaxiesdo not significantly affect the molecular fraction or star formationefficiency. this may indicate that star formation is primarily affected byphysical processes that act on smaller scales than the dust scale height, whichlends support to local star formation models.

1204.2552	extended x-ray emission from non-thermal sources in the cosmos field: a  detailed study of a large radio galaxy at z=1.168	x-ray selected galaxy group samples are usually generated by searching forextended x- ray sources that reflect the thermal radiation of the intragroupmedium. on the other hand, large radio galaxies that regularly occupy galaxygroups also emit in the x-ray window, and their contribution to x-ray selectedgroup samples is still not well understood. in order to investigate theirrelative importance, we have carried out a systematic search for non-thermalextended x-ray sources in the cosmos field. based on the morphologicalcoincidence of x-ray and radio extensions, out of 60 radio galaxies, and \sim300 extended x-ray sources, we find only one candidate where the observedextended x-ray emission arises from non- thermal processes related to radiogalaxies. we present a detailed analysis of this source, and its environment.our results yield that external inverse compton emission of the lobes is thedominant process that generates the observed x-ray emission of our extendedx-ray candidate, with a minor contribution from the gas of the galaxy grouphosting the radio galaxy. finally, we show that finding only one potentialcandidate in the cosmos field (in a redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 6 and with radioluminosity between 1025 and 1030 w/hz) is consistent with expected x-ray-countsarising from synchrotron lobes. this implies that these sources are not aprominent source of contamination in samples of x-ray selected clusters/groups,but they could potentially dominate the z &gt; 1 cluster counts at the bright end(s_x &gt; 7 \cdot 10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^2).

1204.3879	early type galaxies with tidal debris and their scaling relations in the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	tidal debris around galaxies can yield important clues on their evolution. wehave identified tidal debris in 11 early type galaxies (t \leq 0) from a sampleof 65 early types drawn from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s4g). the tidal debris includes features such as shells, ripples andtidal tails. a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional decompositionof galactic structures, was used to quantify the residual tidal features. thetidal debris contributes ~3 - 10% to the total 3.6 {\mu}m luminosity of thehost galaxy. structural parameters of the galaxies were estimated usingtwo-dimensional profile fitting. we investigate the locations of galaxies withtidal debris in the fundamental plane and kormendy relation. we find thatgalaxies with tidal debris lie within the scatter of early type galaxieswithout tidal features. assuming that the tidal debris is indicative of recentgravitational interaction or merger, this suggests that these galaxies haveeither undergone minor merging events so that the overall structural propertiesof the galaxies are not significantly altered, or they have undergone a majormerging events but already have experienced sufficient relaxation andphase-mixing so that their structural properties become similar to those of thenon-interacting early type galaxies.

1204.5480	gas and dust in a z=2.8 obscured quasar	we present new detections of the co(5-4), co(7-6), [ci](1-0) and [ci](2-1)molecular and atomic line transitions towards the unlensed, obscured quasarams12 (z=2.7672), observed with the iram pdbi. this is the first unlensed, highredshift source to have both [ci] transitions detected. continuum measurementsbetween 70 $\mu$m and 3 mm are used to constrain the fir sed, and we find abest fit fir luminosity of log[lfir/lsol] = 13.5+/-0.1, dust temperature t_d =88+/-8 k and emissivity index {\beta} = 0.6+/-0.1. the highly-excited moleculargas probed by co(3-2), (5-4) and (7-6), is modelled with large velocitygradient (lvg) models. the gas kinetic temperature t_g, density n(h2), and thecharacteristic size r0, are determined using the dust temperature from the firsed as a prior for the gas temperature. the best fitting parameters are t_g =90+/-8 k, n(h2) = 10^(3.9+/-0.1) cm^(-3) and r0 = 0.8+/-0.04 kpc. the ratio ofthe [ci] lines gives a [ci] excitation temperature of 43+/-10 k, indicating the[ci] and the high-excitation co are not in thermal equilibrium. the [ci]excitation temperature is below that of t_d and t_g of the high-excitation co,perhaps because [ci] lies at a larger radius where there may also be a largereservoir of co at a cooler temperature, perhaps detectable through theco(1-0). using the [ci](1-0) line we can estimate the strength of the co(1-0)line and hence the gas mass. this suggests that a significant fraction (~30%)of the molecular gas is missed from the high-excitation line analysis. theeddington limited black hole mass is found from the bolometric luminosity to bembh &gt;~ 1.5x10^9 msol. along with the stellar mass of 3x10^11 msol, these give ablack hole - bulge mass ratio of mbh/mbulge &gt;~ 0.005. this is in agreement withstudies on the evolution of the mbh/mbulge relationship at high redshifts,which find a departure from the local value ~0.002.

1206.2925	the heating of dust by old stellar populations in the bulge of m31	we use new herschel multi-band imaging of the andromeda galaxy to analyze howdust heating occurs in the central regions of galaxy spheroids that areessentially devoid of young stars. we construct a dust temperature map of m31through fitting modified blackbody seds to the herschel data, and find that thetemperature within 2 kpc rises strongly from the mean value in the disk of 17pm 1k to \sim35k at the centre. uv to near-ir imaging of the central few kpcshows directly the absence of young stellar populations, delineates the radialprofile of the stellar density, and demonstrates that even the near-uv dustextinction is optically thin in m31's bulge. this allows the direct calculationof the stellar radiation heating in the bulge, u\ast(r), as a function ofradius. the increasing temperature profile in the centre matches that expectedfrom the stellar heating, i.e. that the dust heating and cooling rates trackeach other over nearly two orders of magnitude in u\ast. the modelled dustheating is in excess of the observed dust temperatures, suggesting that it ismore than sufficient to explain the observed ir emission. together with thewavelength dependent absorption cross section of the dust, this demonstratesdirectly that it is the optical, not uv, radiation that sets the heating rate.this analysis shows that neither young stellar populations nor stellar near-uvradiation are necessary to heat dust to warm temperatures in galaxy spheroids.rather, it is the high densities of gyr-old stellar populations that provide asufficiently strong diffuse radiation field to heat the dust. to the extentwhich these results pertain to the tenuous dust found in the centres ofearly-type galaxies remains yet to be explored.

1209.1099	disclosing the radio loudness distribution dichotomy in quasars: an  unbiased monte carlo approach applied to the sdss-first quasar sample	we investigate the dichotomy in the radio loudness distribution of quasars bymodelling their radio emission and various selection effects using a montecarlo approach. the existence of two physically distinct quasar populations,the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, is controversial and over the lastdecade a bimodal distribution of radio loudness of quasars has been bothaffirmed and disputed. we model the quasar radio luminosity distribution withsimple unimodal and bimodal distribution functions. the resulting simulatedsamples are compared to a fiducial sample of 8,300 quasars drawn from the sdssdr7 quasar catalog and combined with radio observations from the first survey.our results indicate that the sdss-first sample is best described by a radioloudness distribution which consists of two components, with 12+/-1 % ofsources in the radio-loud component. on the other hand, the evidence for alocal minimum in the loudness distribution (bimodality) is not strong and wefind that previous claims for its existence were probably affected by theincompleteness of the first survey close to its faint limit. we alsoinvestigate the redshift and luminosity dependence of the radio loudnessdistribution and find tentative evidence that at high redshift radio-loudquasars were rarer, on average "louder", and exhibited a smaller range in radioloudness. in agreement with other recent work, we conclude that the sdss-firstsample strongly suggests that the radio loudness distribution of quasars is nota universal function, and that more complex models than presented here areneeded to fully explain available observations.

1304.1586	clumping and the interpretation of kpc-scale maps of the interstellar  medium: smooth hi and clumpy, variable h2 surface density	many recent models consider the structure of individual interstellar medium(ism) clouds as a way to explain observations of large parts of galaxies. tocompare such models to observations, one must understand how to translatebetween surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales andsurface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which aretreated by models. we define a "clumping factor" that captures this translationas the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantityof physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.we use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of co and hi emission from nearbygalaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. themolecular and atomic ism exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. asa result, the ratio h2/hi measured at ~kpc resolution cannot be triviallyinterpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities. hi emission appearsvery smooth, with a clumping factor of only ~1.3. based on the scarce andheterogeneous high resolution data available, co emission is far more clumpedwith a widely variable clumping factor, median ~7 for our heterogeneous data.our measurements do not provide evidence for a universal mass-weighted surfacedensity of molecular gas, but also cannot conclusively rule out such ascenario. we suggest that a more sophisticated treatment of molecular ismstructure, one informed by high spatial resolution co maps, is needed to linkcloud-scale models to kpc-scale observations of galaxies.

1304.1801	the pdbi arcsecond whirlpool survey (paws). i. a  cloud-scale/multi-wavelength view of the interstellar medium in a  grand-design spiral galaxy	the pdbi (plateau de bure interferometer) arcsecond whirlpool survey (paws)has mapped the molecular gas in the central ~9kpc of m51 in its 12co(1-0) lineemission at cloud-scale resolution of ~40pc using both iram telescopes. weutilize this dataset to quantitatively characterize the relation of moleculargas (or co emission) to other tracers of the interstellar medium (ism), starformation and stellar populations of varying ages. using 2-dimensional maps, apolar cross-correlation technique and pixel-by-pixel diagrams, we find: (a)that (as expected) the distribution of the molecular gas can be linked todifferent components of the gravitational potential, (b) evidence for aphysical link between co line emission and radio continuum that seems not to becaused by massive stars, but rather depend on the gas density, (c) a closespatial relation between the pah and molecular gas emission, but no predictivepower of pah emission for the molecular gas mass,(d) that the i-h color map isan excellent predictor of the distribution (and to a lesser degree thebrightness) of co emission, and (e) that the impact of massive (uv-intense)young star-forming regions on the bulk of the molecular gas in central ~9kpccan not be significant due to a complex spatial relation between molecular gasand star-forming regions that ranges from co-spatial to spatially offset toabsent. the last point, in particular, highlights the importance of galacticenvironment -- and thus the underlying gravitational potential -- for thedistribution of molecular gas and star formation.

1304.7910	gas kinematics on gmc scales in m51 with paws: cloud stabilization  through dynamical pressure	we use the high spatial and spectral resolution of the paws co(1-0) survey ofthe inner 9 kpc of the iconic spiral galaxy m51 to examine the effect of gasstreaming motions on the star-forming properties of individual gmcs. we compareour view of gas flows in m51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetryin the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- withthe global pattern of star formation as traced by halpha and 24\mu m emission.we find that the dynamical environment of gmcs strongly affects their abilityto form stars, in the sense that gmcs situated in regions with large streamingmotions can be stabilized, while similarly massive gmcs in regions withoutstreaming go on to efficiently form stars. we argue that this is the result ofreduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient mediumundergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse. indeed, thevariation in gas depletion time expected based on the observed streamingmotions throughout the disk of m51 quantitatively agrees with the variation inobserved gas depletion time scale. the example of m51 shows that streamingmotions, triggered by gravitational instabilities in the form of bars andspiral arms, can alter the star formation law; this can explain the variationin gas depletion time among galaxies with different masses and morphologies. inparticular, we can explain the long gas depletion times in spiral galaxiescompared to dwarf galaxies and starbursts. we suggest that adding a dynamicalpressure term to the canonical free-fall time produces a single star formationlaw that can be applied to all star-forming regions and galaxies, across cosmictime.

1305.6317	the pa{\alpha} luminosity function of hii regions in nearby galaxies  from hst/nicmos	the hii region luminosity function (lf) is an important tool for deriving thebirthrates and mass distribution of ob associations, and is an excellent tracerof the newly formed massive stars and associations. to date, extensive work(predominantly in h{\alpha}) has been done from the ground, which is hinderedby dust extinction and the severe blending of adjacent (spatially or inprojection) hii regions. reliably measuring the properties of hii regionsrequires a linear resolution &lt;40 pc, but analyses satisfying this requirementhave been done only in a handful of galaxies, so far. as the first space-basedwork using a galaxy sample, we have selected 12 galaxies from our hst nicmospa{\alpha} survey and studied the luminosity function and size distribution ofhii regions both in individual galaxies and cumulatively, using a virtuallyextinction-free tracer of the ionizing photon rate. the high angular resolutionand low sensitivity to diffuse emission of nicmos also offer an advantage overground-based imaging by enabling a higher degree of de-blending of the hiiregions. we do not confirm the broken power-law lfs found in ground-basedstudies. instead, we find that the lfs, both individual and co-added, follow asingle power law dn(l)/dlnl ~ l^-1, consistent with the mass function of starclusters in nearby galaxies, and in agreement with the results of the existinganalyses with hst data. the individual and co-added size distribution of hiiregions are both roughly consistent with dn(d)/dlnd ~ d^-3, but the power-lawscaling is probably contaminated by blended regions or complexes.

1310.6362	an alma survey of submillimetre galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the far-infrared properties of smgs	we exploit alma 870um (345ghz) observations of submillimetre sources in theextended chandra deep field south to investigate the far-infrared properties ofhigh-redshift submillimetre galaxies (smgs). using the precisely located 870umalma positions of 99 smgs, together with 24um and radio imaging of this field,we deblend the herschel/spire imaging of this region to extract theirfar-infrared fluxes and colours. the median photometric redshifts for alma less(aless) smgs which are detected in at least two spire bands increases withwavelength of the peak in their seds, with z=2.3+/-0.2, 2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5for the 250, 350 and 500-um peakers respectively. we find that 34 aless smgs donot have a &gt;3-sigma counterpart at 250, 350 or 500-um. these galaxies have amedian photometric redshift of z=3.3+/-0.5, which is higher than the full alesssmg sample; z=2.5+/-0.2. using the photometric redshifts together with the250-870um photometry, we estimate the far-infrared luminosities andcharacteristic dust temperature of each smg. the median infrared luminosity ofthe s_870um&gt;2mjy smgs is l_ir=(3.0+/-0.3)x10^{12}lo(sfr=300+/-30mo/yr). at afixed luminosity, the characteristic dust temperature of these high-redshiftsmgs is 2-3k lower than comparably luminous galaxies at z=0, reflecting themore extended star formation occurring in these systems. by extrapolating the870um number counts to s_ 870um=1mjy, we show that the contribution ofs_870um&gt;1mjy smgs to the cosmic star formation budget is 20% of the total overthe redshift range z~1-4. we derive a median dust mass for these smgs ofm_d=(3.6+/-0.3)x10^8mo and by adopting an appropriate gas-to-dust ratio, weestimate an average molecular mass of m_h2=(4.2+/-0.4)x10^{10}mo. finally, weuse our estimates of the h2 masses to show that smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy contain~10% of the z~2 volume-averaged h2 mass density at this epoch.

1411.2870	confirming the quiescent galaxy population out to $z=3$: a stacking  analysis of mid-, far-infrared and radio data	we present stringent constraints on the average mid-, far-infrared and radioemissions of $\sim$14200 quiescent galaxies (qgs), identified out to $z=3$ inthe cosmos field via their rest-frame nuv$-$r and r$-$j colors, and withstellar masses $m_{\star}=10^{9.8-12.2} \,m_{\odot} $. stacking in deep spitzer(mips $24\,\mu$m), herschel (pacs and spire), and vla (1.4 ghz) maps revealsextremely low dust-obscured star formation rates for qgs (sfr$&lt;0.1-3\,m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at $z \leqslant 2$ and $&lt;6-18\,m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$at $z &gt; 2$), consistent with the low unobscured sfrs($&lt;0.01-1.2\,m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) inferred from modeling theirultraviolet-to-near-infrared photometry. the average sfrs of qgs are$&gt;10\times$ below those of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) within the $m_{\star}$-and $z$-ranges considered. the stacked 1.4 ghz signals (s/n $&gt; 5$) are, ifattributed solely to star formation, in excess of the total (obscured plusunobscured) sfr limits, suggestive of a widespread presence of low-luminosityactive galactic nuclei (agn) among qgs. our results reaffirm the existence of asignificant population qgs out to $z = 3$, thus corroborating the need forpowerful quenching mechanism(s) to terminate star formation in galaxies atearlier epochs.

1411.2975	dust continuum emission as a tracer of gas mass in galaxies	we use a sample of 36 galaxies from the kingfish (herschel ir), heracles(iram co), and things (vla hi) surveys to study empirical relations betweenherschel infrared (ir) luminosities and the total mass of the interstellar gas(h2+hi). such a comparison provides a simple empirical relationship withoutintroducing the uncertainty of dust model fitting. we find tight correlations,and provide fits to these relations, between herschel luminosities and thetotal gas mass integrated over entire galaxies, with the tightest, almostlinear, correlation found for the longest wavelength data (spire500). however,we find that accounting for the gas-phase metallicity (affecting thedust-to-gas ratio) is crucial when applying these relations to low-mass, andpresumably high-redshift, galaxies. the molecular (h2) gas mass is found to bebetter correlated with the peak of the ir emission (e.g. pacs160), drivenmostly by the correlation of stellar mass and mean dust temperature. whenexamining these relations as a function of galactocentric radius we find thesame correlations, albeit with a larger scatter, up to a radius of 0.7 r_25(within which most of the galaxy's baryonic mass resides). however, beyond thisradius the same correlations no longer hold, with the gas mass (predominantlyhi) increasing relative to the infrared emission. the tight relations found forthe bulk of the galaxy's baryonic content suggest that the total gas masses ofdisk-like (non-merging) galaxies can be inferred from far-infrared continuummeasurements in situations where only the latter are available, e.g. in almacontinuum observations of high-redshift galaxies.

1412.5677	the astrophysics of star formation across cosmic time at $\gtrsim$10 ghz  with the square kilometre array	in this chapter, we highlight a number of science investigations that areenabled by the inclusion of band~5 ($4.6-13.8$ ghz) for ska1-mid scienceoperations, while focusing on the astrophysics of star formation over cosmictime. for studying the detailed astrophysics of star formation athigh-redshift, surveys at frequencies $\gtrsim$10 ghz have the distinctadvantage over traditional $\sim$1.4 ghz surveys as they are able to yieldhigher angular resolution imaging while probing higher rest frame frequenciesof galaxies with increasing redshift, where emission of star-forming galaxiesbecomes dominated by thermal (free-free) radiation. in doing so, surveyscarried out at $\gtrsim$10 ghz provide a robust, dust-unbiased measurement ofthe massive star formation rate by being highly sensitive to the number ofionizing photons that are produced. to access this powerful star formation ratediagnostic requires that band~5 be available for ska1-mid. we additionallypresent a detailed science case for frequency coverage extending up to 30 ghzduring full ska2 operations, as this allows for highly diverse science whileadditionally providing contiguous frequency coverage between the ska and alma,which will likely be the two most powerful interferometers for the comingdecades. to enable this synergy, it is crucial that the dish design of the skabe flexible enough to include the possibility of being fit with receiversoperating up to 30 ghz.

1501.00385	structure, dynamical impact and origin of magnetic fields in nearby  galaxies in the ska era	magnetic fields are an important ingredient of the interstellar medium (ism).besides their importance for star formation, they govern the transport ofcosmic rays, relevant to the launch and regulation of galactic outflows andwinds, which in turn are pivotal in shaping the structure of halo magneticfields. mapping the small-scale structure of interstellar magnetic fields inmany nearby galaxies is crucial to understand the interaction between gas andmagnetic fields, in particular how gas flows are affected. elucidation of themagnetic role in, e.g., triggering star formation, forming and stabilisingspiral arms, driving outflows, gas heating by reconnection and magnetising theintergalactic medium has the potential to revolutionise our physical picture ofthe ism and galaxy evolution in general. radio polarisation observations in thevery nearest galaxies at high frequencies (&gt;= 3 ghz) and with high spatialresolution (&lt;= 5") hold the key here. the galaxy survey with ska1 that wepropose will also be a major step to understand the galactic dynamo, which isimportant for models of galaxy evolution and for astrophysicalmagnetohydrodynamics in general. field amplification by turbulent gas motions,which is crucial for efficient dynamo action, has been investigated so far onlyin simulations, while compelling evidence of turbulent fields from observationsis still lacking.

1502.05854	(sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of cosmos/aztec  submillimetre galaxies - i. multiwavelength identifications and redshift  distribution	we used the pdbi to map a sample of 15 smgs in the cosmos field at thewavelength of 1.3 mm. the target smgs were originally discovered in thejcmt/aztec 1.1 mm continuum survey at s/n=4-4.5. this paper presents, for thefirst time, interferometric millimetre-wavelength observations of thesesources. the angular resolution of our observations, 1.8", allowed us toaccurately determine the positions of the target smgs. using a detectionthreshold of s/n&gt;4.5 regardless of multiwavelength counterpart association, and4&lt;s/n&lt;=4.5 if a multiwavelength counterpart within 1.5" is also present, thetotal number of detections in our survey is 22. three of our detected smgs(aztec21, 27, and 28; which corresponds to 20%) are marginally resolved at ourangular resolution, and these sources are found to have elongated or clumpymorphologies and/or multiple components. using optical to nir photometricredshifts, available spectroscopic redshifts, and redshifts estimated from theradio-to-submm spectral index we infer a median redshift of$\tilde{z}=3.20\pm0.25$ for our sample. to study the overall multiplicity andredshift distribution of flux-limited samples of smgs we combined these sourceswith the 15 brightest aztec smgs detected at 1.1 mm, aztec1-15, and studiedpreviously. this constitutes a complete, flux- and s/n-limited 1.1-mm selectedsample. we find that the median redshift for the 15 brightest aztec smgs($\tilde{z}=3.05\pm0.44$) is consistent with that for aztec16-30. this conformsto recent observational findings that smgs do not exhibit any significant trendbetween the redshift and (sub)mm flux density. for the combined aztec1-30sample we derive a median redshift of $\tilde{z}=3.17\pm0.27$, consistent withprevious results based on mm-selected samples. we further infer that within thecombined aztec1-30 sample $\sim25\pm9\%$ of sources separate into multiplecomponents.

1504.04528	short gmc lifetimes: an observational estimate with the pdbi arcsecond  whirlpool survey (paws)	we describe and execute a novel approach to observationally estimate thelifetimes of giant molecular clouds (gmcs). we focus on the cloud populationbetween the two main spiral arms in m51 (the inter-arm region) where clouddestruction via shear and star formation feedback dominates over formationprocesses. by monitoring the change in gmc number densities and properties fromone side of the inter-arm to the other, we estimate the lifetime as a fractionof the inter-arm travel time. we find that gmc lifetimes in m51's inter-arm arefinite and short, 20 to 30 myr. such short lifetimes suggest that cloudevolution is influenced by environment, in which processes can disrupt gmcsafter a few free-fall times. over most of the region under investigation shearappears to regulate the lifetime. as the shear timescale increases withgalactocentric radius, we expect cloud destruction to switch primarily to starformation feedback at larger radii. we identify a transition from shear- tofeedback-dominated disruption through a change in the behavior of the gmcnumber density. the signature suggests that shear is more efficient atcompletely dispersing clouds, whereas feedback transforms the population, e.g.by fragmenting high mass clouds into lower mass pieces. compared to thecharacteristic timescale for molecular hydrogen in m51, our short lifetimessuggest that gas can remain molecular while clouds disperse and reassemble. wepropose that galaxy dynamics regulates the cycling of molecular material fromdiffuse to bound (and ultimately star-forming) objects, contributing to longobserved molecular depletion times in normal disk galaxies. we also speculatethat, in more extreme environments such as elliptical galaxies and concentratedgalaxy centers, star formation can be suppressed when the shear timescalebecomes so short that some clouds can not survive to collapse and form stars.

1505.03534	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g): stellar  masses, sizes and radial profiles for 2352 nearby galaxies	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) is a volume,magnitude, and size-limited survey of 2352 nearby galaxies with deep imaging at3.6 and 4.5um. in this paper we describe our surface photometry pipeline andshowcase the associated data products that we have released to the community.we also identify the physical mechanisms leading to different levels of centralstellar mass concentration for galaxies with the same total stellar mass.finally, we derive the local stellar mass-size relation at 3.6um for galaxiesof different morphologies. our radial profiles reach stellar mass surfacedensities below 1 msun pc-2. given the negligible impact of dust and the almostconstant mass-to-light ratio at these wavelengths, these profiles constitute anaccurate inventory of the radial distribution of stellar mass in nearbygalaxies. from these profiles we have also derived global properties such asasymptotic magnitudes (and the corresponding stellar masses), isophotal sizesand shapes, and concentration indices. these and other data products from ourvarious pipelines (science-ready mosaics, object masks, 2d imagedecompositions, and stellar mass maps), can be publicly accessed at irsa(http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/spitzer/s4g/).

1506.05153	the odd offset between the galactic disk and its bar in ngc 3906	we use mid-infrared 3.6 and 4.5microns imaging of ngc 3906 from the spitzersurvey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) to understand the nature of anunusual offset between its stellar bar and the photometric center of anotherwise regular, circular outer stellar disk. we measure an offset of ~720 pcbetween the center of the stellar bar and photometric center of the stellardisk; the bar center coincides with the kinematic center of the disk determinedfrom previous hi observations. although the undisturbed shape of the disksuggests that ngc 3906 has not undergone a significant merger event in itsrecent history, the most plausible explanation for the observed offset is aninteraction. given the relatively isolated nature of ngc 3906 this interactioncould be with dark matter sub structure in the galaxy's halo or from a recentinteraction with a fast moving neighbor which remains to be identified.simulations aimed at reproducing the observed offset between the stellar bar /kinematic center of the system and the photometric center of the disk arenecessary to confirm this hypothesis and constrain the interaction history ofthe galaxy.

1507.04439	discovery of massive, mostly star-formation quenched galaxies with  extremely large lyman-alpha equivalent widths at z ~ 3	we report a discovery of 6 massive galaxies with both extremely large lyaequivalent width and evolved stellar population at z ~ 3. these massiveextremely strong lya emitting objects (maestlos) have been discovered in ourlarge-volume systematic survey for strong lya emitters (laes) with twelveoptical intermediate-band data taken with subaru/suprime-cam in the cosmosfield. based on the sed fitting analysis for these laes, it is found that thesemaestlos have (1) large rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0(lya) ~ 100--300 a,(2) m_star ~ 10^10.5--10^11.1 m_sun, and (3) relatively low specific starformation rates of sfr/m_star ~ 0.03--1 gyr^-1. three of the 6 maestlos haveextended ly$\alpha$ emission with a radius of several kpc although they showvery compact morphology in the hst/acs images, which correspond to therest-frame uv continuum. since the maestlos do not show any evidence for agns,the observed extended lya emission is likely to be caused by star formationprocess including the superwind activity. we suggest that this new class oflaes, maestlos, provides a missing link from star-forming to passively evolvinggalaxies at the peak era of the cosmic star-formation history.

1507.05632	understanding the central kinematics of globular clusters with simulated  integrated-light ifu observations	the detection of intermediate mass black holes in the centres of globularclusters is highly controversial, as complementary observational methods oftendeliver significantly different results. in order to understand thesediscrepancies, we develop a procedure to simulate integral field unit (ifu)observations of globular clusters: simulating ifu star cluster observations(sisco). the input of our software are realistic dynamical models of globularclusters that are then converted in a spectral data cube. we apply sisco tomonte carlo cluster simulations from downing et al. (2010), with a realisticnumber of stars and concentrations. using independent realisations of a givensimulation we are able to quantify the stochasticity intrinsic to the problemof observing a partially resolved stellar population with integrated-lightspectroscopy. we show that the luminosity-weighted ifu observations can bestrongly biased by the presence of a few bright stars that introduce a scatterin the velocity dispersion measurements up to $\simeq$40% around the expectedvalue, preventing any sound assessment of the central kinematic and a sensibleinterpretation of the presence/absence of an intermediate mass black hole.moreover, we illustrate that, in our mock ifu observations, the averagekinematic tracer has a mass of $\simeq$0.75 solar masses, only slightly lowerthan the mass of the typical stars examined in studies of resolvedline-of-sight velocities of giant stars. finally, in order to recover unbiasedkinematic measurements we test different masking techniques that allow us toremove the spaxels dominated by bright stars, bringing the scatter down to alevel of only a few percent. the application of sisco will allow to investigatestate-of-the-art simulations as realistic observations.

1509.07147	(sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of cosmos/aztec  submillimetre galaxies - ii. the spatial extent of the radio-emitting regions	radio emission at cm wavelengths from highly star-forming galaxies, such assmgs, is dominated by synchrotron radiation arising from supernova activity.using deep, high-resolution ($1\sigma=2.3$ $\mu$jy beam$^{-1}$; $0.75^{"}$) cmradio-continuum observations taken by the vla-cosmos 3 ghz large project, westudied the radio-emitting sizes of a flux-limited sample of smgs in the cosmosfield. of the 39 smgs studied here, 3 ghz emission was detected towards 18 ofthem ($\sim46\pm11\%$) with s/n ratios in the range of ${\rm s/n=4.2-37.4}$.using 2d elliptical gaussian fits, we derived a median deconvolved major axisfwhm size of $0.54^{"}\pm 0.11^{"}$ for our 18 smgs detected at 3 ghz. for the15 smgs with known redshift we derived a median linear major axis fwhm of$4.2\pm0.9$ kpc. no clear correlation was found between the radio-emitting sizeand the 3 ghz or submm flux density, or the redshift of the smg. however, thereis a hint of larger radio sizes at $z\sim2.5-5$ compared to lower redshifts.the sizes we derived are consistent with previous smg sizes measured at 1.4 ghzand in mid-$j$ co emission, but significantly larger than those seen in the(sub)mm continuum emission. one possible scenario is that smgs have i) anextended gas component with a low dust temperature, and which can be traced bylow- to mid-$j$ co line emission and radio continuum emission, and ii) awarmer, compact starburst region giving rise to the high-$j$ line emission ofco, which could dominate the dust continuum size measurements. because of therapid cooling of cr electrons in dense starburst galaxies ($\sim10^4-10^5$ yr),the more extended synchrotron radio-emitting size being a result of crdiffusion seems unlikely. instead, if smgs are driven by galaxy mergers theradio synchrotron emission might arise from more extended magnetised ism aroundthe starburst region.

0808.2746	relation between stellar mass and star formation activity in galaxies	for a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts fromthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), we examine the evolution of starformation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. we estimate thecosmic star formation rates (sfr) over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, using therest-frame 2800 a flux (corrected for extinction). we find the mean sfr to be astrong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, withmassive systems (log (m/m(sun)) &gt; 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)to the total star formation rate density (sfrd).  combining data from the cosmos and gemini deep deep survey (gdds), we extendthe sfrd-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. for massive galaxies,we find a steep increase in the sfrd-z relation to z~2; for the less massivesystems, the sfrd which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. thisimplies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activityat earlier epochs (z &gt; 2) than the lower mass galaxies.  we study changes in the sfrds as a function of both redshift and stellar massfor galaxies of different spectral types. we find that the slope of the sfrd-zrelation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of theirstellar mass. for low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution tothe cosmic sfrd comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massivesystems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

astro-ph;0611540	a near-infrared study of 2mass bars in local galaxies: an anchor for  high redshift studies	we have measured the fraction of bars in nearby spiral galaxies usingnear-infrared j, h, and k_s images of 151 spiral galaxies from 2mass. thislocal sample provides an anchor for the study of the evolution of the barfraction and bar properties with redshift. we identify bars by analyzing thefull two-dimensional light distribution and requiring a combined ellipticityand position angle signature. the combined bar signature is found in 59% of thegalaxies. the bar fraction increases to 67% when we include "candidate" bars,where only the ellipticity signature is present. we also measure the change inthe bar fraction as a function of bar size; the bar fraction drops to 36% forbars with a semi-major axis larger than 4 kpc. we find that infrared barstypically extend to one-third of the galactic disk, with a deprojected relativesize of &lt;a_{bar}/r_{25}&gt; ~ 0.3 +/- 0.2. early-type spirals host significantlylarger bars, consistent with earlier studies. the &lt;a_{bar}/r_{25}&gt; is two timeslarger in early-types than in late-types. the typical bar axial ratio (b/a) is\~0.5, with a weak trend of higher axial ratios for larger bars.

0809.2337	properties of the molecular gas in a starbursting qso at z=1.83 in the  cosmos field	using the iram 30m telescope, we have detected the co j=2-1, 4-3, 5-4, and6-5 emission lines in the millimeter-bright, blank-field selected agn cosmosj100038+020822 at redshift z=1.8275. the sub-local thermodynamic equilibrium(lte) excitation of the j=4 level implies that the gas is less excited thanthat in typical nearby starburst galaxies such as ngc253, and in thehigh-redshift quasars studied to date, such as j1148+5251 or br1202-0725. largevelocity gradient (lvg) modeling of the co line spectral energy distribution(co sed; flux density vs. rotational quantum number) yields h2 densities in therange 10^{3.5}--10^{4.0} cm-3, and kinetic temperatures between 50 k and 200 k.the h2 mass of (3.6 - 5.4) x 10^{10} m_sun implied by the line intensitiescompares well with our estimate of the dynamical mass within the inner 1.5 kpcof the object. fitting a two-component gray body spectrum, we find a dust massof 1.2 x 10^{9} m_sun, and cold and hot dust temperatures of 42+/-5 k and160+/-25 k, respectively. the broad mgii line allows us to estimate the mass ofthe central black hole as 1.7 x 10^{9} m_sun. although the optical spectrum andmulti-wavelength sed matches those of an average qso, the molecular gas contentand dust properties resemble those of known submillimeter galaxies (smgs). theoptical morphology of this source shows tidal tails that suggest a recentinteraction or merger. since it shares properties of both starburst and agn,this object appears to be in a transition from a strongly starformingsubmillimeter galaxy to a qso.

0811.1988	dynamical evolution of agn host galaxies - gas in/out-flow rates in 7  nuga galaxies	to examine the role of the host galaxy structure in fueling nuclear activity,we estimated gas flow rates from several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc forseven nearby spiral galaxies, selected from the nuga sample (nuclei ofgalaxies). we calculated gravitational torques from near-ir images anddetermined gas in/out-flow rates as a function of radius and location withinthe galactic disks, based on high angular resolution interferometricobservations of molecular (co using pdbi) and atomic (hi using the vla) gas.the results are compared with kinematic evidence for radial gas flows and thedynamical state of the galaxies (via resonances) derived from several differentmethods. we show that gravitational torques are very efficient at transportinggas from the outer disk all the way into the galaxies centers at ~100 pc;previously assumed dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the corotationresonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by gravitational torque inducedgas flows from other non-axisymmmetric structures. the resulting rates of gasmass inflow range from 0.01 to 50 solar masses per year and are larger for thegalaxy center than for the outer disk. our gas flow maps show the action ofnested bars within larger bars for 3 galaxies. non-circular streaming motionsfound in the kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer disk andappear to correlate only loosely with the in/out-flow rates as a function ofradius. we demonstrate that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems thatundergo strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation periods (e.g. 5times 10^8 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to the effectiveness of gravitationaltorques in redistributing the cold galactic gas.

0811.3977	the cosmos agn spectroscopic survey i: xmm counterparts	we present optical spectroscopy for an x-ray and optical flux-limited sampleof 677 xmm-newton selected targets covering the 2 deg^2 cosmos field, with ayield of 485 high-confidence redshifts. the majority of the spectra wereobtained over three seasons (2005-2007) with the imacs instrument on themagellan (baade) telescope. we also include in the sample previously publishedsloan digital sky survey spectra and supplemental observations withmmt/hectospec. we detail the observations and classification analyses. thesurvey is 90% complete to flux limits of f_{0.5-10 kev}&gt;8 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2s^-1 and i_ab+&lt;22, where over 90% of targets have high-confidence redshifts.making simple corrections for incompleteness due to redshift and spectral typeallows for a description of the complete population to $i_ab+&lt;23. the correctedsample includes 57% broad emission line (type 1, unobscured) agn at0.13&lt;z&lt;4.26, 25% narrow emission line (type 2, obscured) agn at 0.07&lt;z&lt;1.29,and 18% absorption line (host-dominated, obscured) agn at 0&lt;z&lt;1.22 (excludingthe stars that made up 4% of the x-ray targets). we show that the survey'slimits in x-ray and optical flux include nearly all x-ray agn (defined byl_{0.5-10 kev}&gt;3 x 10^42 erg s^-1) to z&lt;1, of both optically obscured andunobscured types. we find statistically significant evidence that the obscuredto unobscured agn ratio at z&lt;1 increases with redshift and decreases withluminosity.
