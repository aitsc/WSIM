0704.0009	the spitzer c2d survey of large, nearby, insterstellar clouds. ix. the  serpens yso population as observed with irac and mips	we discuss the results from the combined irac and mips c2d spitzer legacyobservations of the serpens star-forming region. in particular we present a setof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, yso's, from theextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. we then discussthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of yso's. we find 235 suchobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both irac and mips. anadditional set of 51 lower confidence yso's outside this area is identifiedfrom the mips data combined with 2mass photometry. we describe two sets ofresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties withthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modelingof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. these objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks. we find that the luminosity function of yso's in serpens extendsdown to at least a few x .001 lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.the lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish yso's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of yso's at very low luminosities.a spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved yso's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies. we also present a table of matchesbetween several previous infrared and x-ray studies of the serpens ysopopulation and our spitzer data set.

0906.2005	filamentary structure of star-forming complexes	the nearest young stellar groups are associated with "hubs" of column densityexceeding 10^22 cm^-2, according to recent observations. these hubs radiatemultiple "filaments" of parsec length, having lower column density and fewerstars. systems with many filaments tend to have parallel filaments with similarspacing. such "hub-filament structure" is associated with all of the nine youngstellar groups within 300 pc, forming low-mass stars. similar properties areseen in infrared dark clouds forming more massive stars. in a new model, aninitial clump in a uniform medium is compressed into a self-gravitating,modulated layer. the outer layer resembles the modulated equilibrium ofschmid-burgk (1967) with nearly parallel filaments. the filaments converge ontothe compressed clump, which collapses to form stars with high efficiency. theinitial medium and condensations have densities similar to those in nearbystar-forming clouds and clumps. the predicted structures resemble observedhub-filament systems in their size, shape, and column density, and in theappearance of their filaments. these results suggest that hub-filamentstructure associated with young stellar groups may arise from compression ofclumpy gas in molecular clouds.

0909.3386	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. ii. the  mass evolution of envelopes, disks, and stars from the class 0 through i  stages	the key question about early protostellar evolution is how matter is accretedfrom the large-scale molecular cloud, through the circumstellar disk onto thecentral star. a sample of 20 class 0 and i protostars has been observed incontinuum at (sub)millimeter wavelengths at high angular resolution with thesubmillimeter array. using detailed dust radiative transfer models, we havedeveloped a framework for disentangling the continuum emission from theenvelopes and disks, and from that estimated their masses. for the class isources in the sample, hco+ 3-2 line emission has furthermore been observedwith the submillimeter array. four of these sources show signs of keplerianrotation, constraining the masses of the central stars. both class 0 and iprotostars are surrounded by disks with typical masses of about 0.05 m_sun. noevidence is found for a correlation between the disk mass and evolutionarystage of the young stellar objects. this contrasts the envelope mass, whichdecreases sharply from 1 m_sun in the class 0 stage to &lt;0.1 m_sun in the classi stage. typically, the disks have masses that are 1-10% of the correspondingenvelope masses in the class 0 stage and 20-60% in the class i stage. for theclass i sources for which keplerian rotation is seen, the central stars contain70-98% of the total mass in the star-disk-envelope system, confirming thatthese objects are late in their evolution through the embedded protostellarstages. theoretical models tend to overestimate the disk masses relative to thestellar masses in the late class i stage. the results argue in favor of apicture in which circumstellar disks are formed early during the protostellarevolution and rapidly process material accreted from the larger scale envelopeonto the central star.

1002.2946	direct observation of a sharp transition to coherence in dense cores	we present nh3 observations of the b5 region in perseus obtained with thegreen bank telescope (gbt). the map covers a region large enough (~11'x14')that it contains the entire dense core observed in previous dust continuumsurveys. the dense gas traced by nh3(1,1) covers a much larger area than thedust continuum features found in bolometer observations. the velocitydispersion in the central region of the core is small, presenting subsonicnon-thermal motions which are independent of scale. however, it is thanks tothe coverage and high sensitivity of the observations that we present thedetection, for the first time, of the transition between the coherent core andthe dense but more turbulent gas surrounding it. this transition is sharp,increasing the velocity dispersion by a factor of 2 in less than 0.04 pc (the31" beam size at the distance of perseus, ~250 pc). the change in velocitydispersion at the transition is ~3 km/s/pc. the existence of the transitionprovides a natural definition of dense core: the region with nearly-constantsubsonic non-thermal velocity dispersion. from the analysis presented here wecan not confirm nor rule out a corresponding sharp density transition.

1003.4900	star-forming gas in young clusters	initial conditions for star formation in clusters are estimated forprotostars whose masses follow the initial mass function (imf) from 0.05 to 10solar masses. star-forming infall is assumed equally likely to stop at anymoment, due to gas dispersal dominated by stellar feedback. for sphericalinfall, the typical initial condensation must have a steep density gradient, asin low-mass cores, surrounded by a shallower gradient, as in the clumps aroundcores. these properties match observed column densities in cluster-formingregions when the mean infall stopping time is 0.05 myr and the accretionefficiency is 0.5. the infall duration increases with final protostar mass,from 0.01 to 0.3 myr, and the mass accretion rate increases from 3 to 300 x10^(-6) solar masses/yr. the typical spherical accretion luminosity is ~5 solarluminosities, reducing the luminosity problem to a factor ~3. the initialcondensation density gradient changes from steep to shallow at radius 0.04 pc,enclosing 0.9 solar masses, with mean column density 2 x 10^(22) cm^(-2), andwith effective central temperature 16 k. these initial conditions are denserand warmer than those for isolated star formation.

1004.1170	the mass-size relation from clouds to cores. ii. solar neighborhood  clouds	we measure the mass and size of cloud fragments in several molecular cloudscontinuously over a wide range of spatial scales (0.05 &lt; r / pc &lt; 3). based onthe recently developed "dendrogram-technique", this characterizes dense coresas well as the enveloping clouds. "larson's 3rd law" of constant columndensity, m(r) = c*r^2, is not well suited to describe the derived mass-sizedata. solar neighborhood clouds not forming massive stars (&lt; 10 m_sun; pipenebula, taurus, perseus, and ophiuchus) obey m(r) &lt; 870 m_sun (r / pc)^1.33 .in contrast to this, clouds forming massive stars (orion a, g10.15$-$0.34,g11.11$-$0.12) do exceed the aforementioned relation. thus, this limitingmass-size relation may approximate a threshold for the formation of massivestars. across all clouds, cluster-forming cloud fragments are found to be---atgiven radius---more massive than fragments devoid of clusters. thecluster-bearing fragments are found to roughly obey a mass-size law m =c*r^1.27 (where the exponent is highly uncertain in any given cloud, but iscertainly smaller than 1.5).

1008.1049	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores. ix. discovery of a very  low luminosity object driving a molecular outflow in the dense core l673-7	we present new infrared, submillimeter, and millimeter observations of thedense core l673-7 and report the discovery of a low-luminosity, embedded class0 protostar driving a molecular outflow. l673-7 is seen in absorption againstthe mid-infrared background in 5.8, 8, and 24 micron spitzer images, allowingfor a derivation of the column density profile and total enclosed mass ofl673-7, independent of dust temperature assumptions. estimates of the core massfrom these absorption profiles range from 0.2-4.5 solar masses. millimetercontinuum emission indicates a mass of about 2 solar masses, both from a directcalculation assuming isothermal dust and from dust radiative transfer modelsconstrained by the millimeter observations. we use dust radiative transfermodels to constrain the internal luminosity of l673-7, defined to be theluminosity of the central source and excluding the luminosity from externalheating, to be 0.01-0.045 solar luminosities, with 0.04 solar luminosities themost likely value. l673-7 is thus classified as a very low luminosity object(vello), and is among the lowest luminosity vellos yet studied. we calculatethe kinematic and dynamic properties of the molecular outflow in the standardmanner, and we show that the expected accretion luminosity based on theseoutflow properties is greater than or equal to 0.36 solar luminosities. thediscrepancy between this expected accretion luminosity and the internalluminosity derived from dust radiative transfer models indicates that thecurrent accretion rate is much lower than the average rate over the lifetime ofthe outflow. although the protostar embedded within l673-7 is consistent withcurrently being substellar, it is unlikely to remain as such given thesubstantial mass reservoir remaining in the core.

1009.4460	the spitzer c2d survey of weak-line t tauri stars. iii. the transition  from primordial disks to debris disks	we present 3.6 to 70 {\mu}m spitzer photometry of 154 weak-line t tauri stars(wtts) in the chamaeleon, lupus, ophiuchus and taurus star formation regions,all of which are within 200 pc of the sun. for a comparative study, we alsoinclude 33 classical t tauri stars (ctts) which are located in the same starforming regions. spitzer sensitivities allow us to robustly detect thephotosphere in the irac bands (3.6 to 8 {\mu}m) and the 24 {\mu}m mips band. inthe 70 {\mu}m mips band, we are able to detect dust emission brighter thanroughly 40 times the photosphere. these observations represent the mostsensitive wtts survey in the mid to far infrared to date, and reveal thefrequency of outer disks (r = 3-50 au) around wtts. the 70 {\mu}m photometryfor half the c2d wtts sample (the on-cloud objects), which were not included inthe earlier papers in this series, padgett et al. (2006) and cieza et al.(2007), are presented here for the first time. we find a disk frequency of 19%for on-cloud wtts, but just 5% for off- cloud wtts, similar to the valuereported in the earlier works. wtts exhibit spectral energy distributions(seds) that are quite diverse, spanning the range from optically thick tooptically thin disks. most disks become more tenuous than ldisk/l* = 2 x 10^-3in 2 myr, and more tenuous than ldisk/l* = 5 x 10^-4 in 4 myr.

1104.2950	internal motions in starless dense cores	this paper discusses the statistics of internal motions in starless densecores and the relation of these motions to core density and evolution. fourspectral lines from three molecular species are analyzed from single-pointingand mapped observations of several tens of starless cores. blue asymmetricprofiles are dominant, indicating that inward motions are prevalent insufficiently dense starless cores. these blue profiles are found to be moreabundant, and their asymmetry is bluer, at core positions with stronger $\rmn_2h^+$ line emission or higher column density. thirty three starless cores areclassified into four types according to the blue and red shifts of the lines intheir molecular line maps. among these cores, contracting motions dominate: 19are classified as contracting, 3 as oscillating, 3 as expanding, and 8 asstatic. contracting cores have inward motions all over the core withpredominance of those motions near the region of peak density. cores with thebluest asymmetry tend to have greater column density than other cores and allfive cores with peak column density $&gt; \rm 6\times 10^{21} cm^{-2}$ are foundto be contracting. this suggests that starless cores are likely to havecontracting motions if they are sufficiently condensed. our classification ofthe starless cores may indicate a sequence of core evolution in the sense thatcolumn density increases from static to contracting cores: the static cores inthe earliest stage, the expanding and/or the oscillating cores in the next, andthe contracting cores in the latest stage.

1104.4538	mass distributions of stars and cores in young groups and clusters	we investigate the relation of the stellar initial mass function (imf) andthe dense core mass function (cmf), using stellar masses and positions in 14well-studied young groups. initial column density maps are computed byreplacing each star with a model initial core having the same star formationefficiency (sfe). for each group the sfe, core model, and observationalresolution are varied to produce a realistic range of initial maps. aclumpfinding algorithm parses each initial map into derived cores, derived coremasses, and a derived cmf. the main result is that projected blending ofinitial cores causes derived cores to be too few and too massive. the number ofderived cores is fewer than the number of initial cores by a mean factor 1.4 insparse groups and 5 in crowded groups. the mass at the peak of the derived cmfexceeds the mass at the peak of the initial cmf by a mean factor 1.0 in sparsegroups and 12.1 in crowded groups. these results imply that in crowded younggroups and clusters, the mass distribution of observed cores may not reliablypredict the mass distribution of protostars which will form in those cores.

1105.0688	filamentary condensations in a young cluster	new models are presented for star-forming condensations in clusters. in eachmodel, the condensation mass increases linearly with radius on small scales,and more rapidly on large scales, as in "thermal-nonthermal" models. sphericalcondensations with this structure form protostars which match the imf if theirinfall is subject to equally likely stopping. however such spherical models donot match the filamentary nature of cluster gas, and they are too extended toform protostars having high mass and short spacing. two hybrid models arepresented, which are spherical on small scales and filamentary on large scales.in and around clusters, cores embedded in linear filaments match the elongationof cluster gas, and the central concentration of low-mass stars. in clustercenters, condensations require a low volume filling factor to produce massivestars with short spacing. these may have stellate shape, where cores are nodesof filamentary networks, as seen in some simulations of colliding flows and ofcollapsing turbulent clumps. a dense configuration of such stellatecondensations may be indistinguishable from a clump forming multiple protostarsvia filamentary flow paths.

1109.4137	star formation in dense clusters	a model of core-clump accretion with equally likely stopping describes starformation in the dense parts of clusters, where models of isolated collapsingcores may not apply. each core accretes at a constant rate onto its protostar,while the surrounding clump gas accretes as a power of protostar mass. shortaccretion flows resemble shu accretion, and make low-mass stars. long flowsresemble reduced bondi accretion and make massive stars. accretion stops due toenvironmental processes of dynamical ejection, gravitational competition, andgas dispersal by stellar feedback, independent of initial core structure. themodel matches the field star imf from 0.01 to more than 10 solar masses. thecore accretion rate and the mean accretion duration set the peak of the imf,independent of the local jeans mass. massive protostars require the longestaccretion durations, up to 0.5 myr. the maximum protostar luminosity in acluster indicates the mass and age of its oldest protostar. the distribution ofprotostar luminosities matches those in active star-forming regions ifprotostars have a constant birthrate but not if their births are coeval. forconstant birthrate, the ratio of ysos to protostars indicates the star-formingage of a cluster, typically ~1 myr. the protostar accretion luminosity istypically less than its steady spherical value by a factor of ~2, consistentwith models of episodic disk accretion.

1110.4032	variations in the mass functions of clustered and isolated young stellar  objects	we analyze high quality, complete stellar catalogs for four young (roughly 1myr) and nearby (within ~300 pc) star-forming regions: taurus, lupus3, chai,and ic348, which have been previously shown to have stellar groups whoseproperties are similar to those of larger clusters such as the onc. we findthat stars at higher stellar surface densities within a region or belonging togroups tend to have a relative excess of more massive stars, over a wide rangeof masses. we find statistically significant evidence for this result in taurusand ic348 as well as the onc. these differences correspond to having typicallya ~10 - 20% higher mean mass in the more clustered environment. stars in chaishow no evidence for a trend with either surface density or grouped status, andthere are too few stars in lupus3 to make any definitive interpretation. modelsof clustered star formation do not typically extend to sufficiently low massesor small group sizes in order for their predictions to be tested but ourresults suggest that this regime is important to consider.

1204.1032	mass and luminosity evolution of young stellar objects	a model of protostar mass and luminosity evolution in clusters gives newestimates of cluster age, protostar birthrate, accretion rate and meanaccretion time. the model assumes constant protostar birthrate, core-clumpaccretion, and equally likely accretion stopping. its parameters are set toreproduce the initial mass function, and to match protostar luminositydistributions in nearby star-forming regions. it obtains cluster ages andbirthrates from the observed numbers of protostars and pre-main sequence (pms)stars, and from the modal value of the protostar luminosity. in 31 embeddedclusters and complexes the global cluster age is 1-3 myr, matching availableestimates based on optical spectroscopy and evolutionary tracks. this method ofage estimation is simpler than optical spectroscopy, and is more useful foryoung embedded clusters where optical spectrocopy is not possible. in theyoungest clusters, the protostar fraction decreases outward from the densestgas, indicating that the local star-forming age increases outward from a few0.1 myr in small protostar-dominated zones to a few myr in large pms-dominatedzones.

1301.5614	origin of the dense core mass function in contracting filaments	mass functions of starless dense cores (cmfs) may arise from contraction anddispersal of core-forming filaments. in an illustrative model, a filamentcontracts radially by self-gravity, increasing the mass of its cores. duringthis contraction, fuv photoevaporation and ablation by shocks and windsdisperse filament gas and limit core growth. the stopping times of core growthare described by a waiting-time distribution. the initial filament columndensity profile and the resulting cmf each match recent herschel observationsin detail. then low-mass cores have short growth ages and arise from theinnermost filament gas, while massive cores have long growth ages and draw frommore extended filament gas. the model fits the initial density profile and cmfbest for mean core density 2 10^4 cm^-3 and filament dispersal time scale 0.5myr. then the typical core mass, radius, mean column density, and contractionspeed are respectively 0.8 solar masses, 0.06 pc, 6 10^21 cm^-2, and 0.07 kms^-1, also in accord with observed values.

1301.6792	filamentary accretion flows in the embedded serpens south protocluster	one puzzle in understanding how stars form in clusters is the source of mass-- is all of the mass in place before the first stars are born, or is there anextended period when the cluster accretes material which can continuously fuelthe star formation process? we use a multi-line spectral survey of the southernfilament associated with the serpens south embedded cluster-forming region inorder to determine if mass is accreting from the filament onto the cluster, andwhether the accretion rate is significant. our analysis suggests that materialis flowing along the filament's long axis at a rate of ~30msol/myr (inferredfrom the n2h+ velocity gradient along the filament), and radially contractingonto the filament at ~130msol/myr (inferred from hnc self-absorption). theseaccretion rates are sufficient to supply mass to the central cluster at asimilar rate to the current star formation rate in the cluster. filamentaryaccretion flows may therefore be very important in the ongoing evolution ofthis cluster.

1505.01124	characteristic structure of star-forming clouds	this paper gives a new way to diagnose the star-forming potential of amolecular cloud region from the probability density function of its columndensity (n-pdf). it gives expressions for the column density and mass profilesof a symmetric filament having the same n-pdf as a filamentary region. thecentral concentration of this characteristic filament can distinguish regionsand can quantify their fertility for star formation. profiles are calculatedfor n-pdfs which are pure lognormal, pure power law, or a combination. inrelation to models of singular polytropic cylinders, characteristic filamentscan be unbound, bound, or collapsing depending on their central concentration.such filamentary models of the dynamical state of n-pdf gas are more relevantto star-forming regions than are models of spherical collapse. the starformation fertility of a bound or collapsing filament is quantified by its meanmass accretion rate when in radial free fall. for a given mass per length, thefertility increases with the filament mean column density and with its initialconcentration. in selected regions the fertility of their characteristicfilaments increases with the level of star formation.

1511.01141	mass assembly of stellar systems and their evolution with the sma  (masses). multiplicity and the physical environment in l1448n	we present continuum and molecular line observations at 230 ghz and 345 ghzfrom the sub-millimeter array (sma) toward three protostars in the perseusl1448n region. the data are from the large project "mass assembly of stellarsystems and their evolution with the sma" (masses). three dust continuumsources, source b, source nw, and source a, are detected at both frequencies.these sources have corresponding emission peaks in c18o (j=2-1), 13co (j=2-1),and hco+ (j=4-3), and have offsets with n2d+ (j=3-2) peaks. high angularresolution data from a complimentary continuum survey with the karl g. janskyvery large array show that source b is associated with three 8 mm continuumobjects, source nw with two, and source a remains single. these results suggestthat multiplicity in l1448n exists at different spatial scales from a fewthousand au to &lt; 100 au. velocity gradients in each source obtained fromtwo-dimensional fits to the sma c18o emission are found to be perpendicular towithin 20 degrees of the outflow directions as revealed by 12co (j=2-1). wehave observed that sources b and nw with multiplicity have higher densitiesthan source a without multiplicity. this suggests that thermal jeansfragmentation can be relevant in the fragmentation process. however, we havenot observed a difference in the ratio between rotational and gravitationalenergy between sources with and without multiplicity. we also have not observeda trend between non-thermal velocity dispersions and the level offragmentation. our study has provided the first direct and comprehensivecomparison between multiplicity and core properties in low-mass protostars,although based on small number statistics.

0806.1754	identifying the low luminosity population of embedded protostars in the  c2d observations of clouds and cores	we present a search for all embedded protostars with internal luminosities &lt;1 solar luminosity in the sample of nearby, low-mass star-forming regionssurveyed by the spitzer space telescope c2d legacy project. the internalluminosity (lint) of a source is the luminosity of the central source andexcludes luminosity arising from external heating. on average, the c2d data aresensitive to embedded protostars with lint &gt; 4e-3 (d/140 pc)^2 solarluminosities, a factor of 25 better than the sensitivity of iras to suchobjects. we present selection criteria used to identify candidates from thespitzer data and examine complementary data to decide whether each candidate istruly an embedded protostar. we find a tight correlation between the 70 micronflux and internal luminosity of a protostar, an empirical result based onobservations and two-dimensional radiative transfer models of protostars. weidentify 50 embedded protostars with lint &lt; 1 solar luminosities; 15 have lint&lt; 0.1 solar luminosities. the intrinsic distribution of source luminositiesincreases to lower luminosities. while we find sources down to the abovesensitivity limit, indicating that the distribution may extend to luminositieslower than probed by these observations, we are able to rule out a continuedrise in the distribution below 0.1 solar luminosities. between 75-85% of coresclassified as starless prior to being observed by spitzer remain starless toour luminosity sensitivity; the remaining 15-25% harbor low-luminosity,embedded protostars. we compile complete spectral energy distributions for all50 objects and calculate standard evolutionary signatures, and argue that theseobjects are inconsistent with the simplest picture of star formation whereinmass accretes from the core onto the protostar at a constant rate.

0807.1270	protostar mass due to infall and dispersal	the mass of a protostar is calculated from the infall and dispersal of anisothermal sphere in a uniform background. for high contrast between peak andbackground densities and for short dispersal time t_d, the accretion is"self-limiting": gas beyond the core is dispersed before it accretes, and theprotostar mass approaches a time-independent value of low mass. for lowerdensity contrast and longer dispersal time, the accretion "runs away": gasaccretes from beyond the core, and the protostar mass approaches massive starvalues. the final protostar mass is approximately the initial gas mass whosefree-fall time equals t_d. this mass matches the peak of the imf for gastemperature 10 k, peak and background densities 10^6 and 10^3 cm^-3, and fort_d comparable to the core free-fall time t_core. the accretion luminosityexceeds 1 l-sun for 0.1 myr, as in the "class 0" phase. for t_d/t_core=0.4-0.8and temperature 7-50 k, self-limiting protostar masses are 0.08-5 m-sun. theseprotostar and core masses have ratio 0.4 +- 0.2, as expected if the core massdistribution and the imf have the same shape.

astro-ph;0102039	modes of multiple star formation	this paper argues that star forming environments should be classified intofiner divisions than the traditional isolated and clustered modes. using theobserved set of galactic open clusters and theoretical considerations regardingcluster formation, we estimate the fraction of star formation that takes placewithin clusters. we find that less than 10% of the stellar populationoriginates from star forming regions destined to become open clusters,confirming earlier estimates. the smallest clusters included in theobservational surveys (having at least n=100 members) roughly coincide with thesmallest stellar systems that are expected to evolve as clusters in a dynamicalsense. we show that stellar systems with too few members n &lt; n_\star havedynamical relaxation times that are shorter than their formation times (1-2myr), where the critical number of stars n_\star \approx 100. our resultssuggest that star formation can be characterized by (at least) three principalmodes: i. isolated singles and binaries, ii. groups (n&lt;n_\star), and iii.clusters (n&gt;n_\star). many -- if not most -- stars form through theintermediate mode in stellar groups with 10&lt;n&lt;100. such groups evolve anddisperse much more rapidly than open clusters; groups also have a lowprobability of containing massive stars and are unaffected by supernovae andintense ultraviolet radiation fields. because of their short lifetimes andsmall stellar membership, groups have relatively little effect on the starformation process (on average) compared to larger open clusters.

astro-ph;0102469	new oh zeeman measurements of magnetic field strengths in molecular  clouds	we present the results of a new survey of 23 molecular clouds for the zeemaneffect in oh undertaken with the atnf parkes 64-m radio telescope and the nraogreen bank 43-m radio telescope. the zeeman effect was clearly detected in thecloud associated with the hii region rcw 38, with a field strength of 38+/-3micro-gauss, and possibly detected in a cloud associated with the hii regionrcw 57, with a field strength of -203+/-24 micro-gauss. the remaining 21measurements give formal upper limits to the magnetic field strength, withtypical 1-sigma sensitivities &lt;20 micro-gauss. for 22 of the molecular cloudswe are also able to determine thecolumn density of the gas in which we havemade a sensitive search for the zeeman effect. we combine these results withprevious zeeman studies of 29 molecular clouds, most of which were compiled bycrutcher (1999), for a comparsion of theoretical models with the data. thiscomparison implies that if the clouds can be modeled as initially sphericalwith uniform magnetic fields and densities that evolve to their finalequilibrium state assuming flux-freezing then the typical cloud is magneticallysupercritical, as was found by crutcher (1999). if the clouds can be modeled ashighly flattened sheets threaded by uniform perpendicular fields, then thetypical cloud is approximately magnetically critical, in agreement with shu etal. (1999), but only if the true values of the field for the non-detections areclose to the 3-sigma upper limits. if instead these values are significantlylower (for example, similar to the 1-sigma limits), then the typical cloud isgenerally magnetically supercritical.

astro-ph;0105515	a survey for infall motions toward starless cores. ii. $cs (2-1)$ and  $n_2h^+ (1-0)$ mapping observations	we present the results of an extensive mapping survey of 53 `starless' coresin the optically thick line of cs 2-1 and the optically thin lines of n2h+ 1-0and c18o 1-0. the purpose of this survey was to search for signatures ofextended inward motions.  this study finds 10 `strong' and 9 `probable' infall candidates, based on$\delta v_{cs}$ analysis and on the spectral shapes of cs lines.  from our analysis of the blue-skewed cs spectra and the $\delta v_{cs}$parameter, we find typical infall radii of 0.06-0.14 pc. also, using a simpletwo layer radiative transfer model to fit the profiles, we deriveone-dimensional infall speeds, half of whose values lie in the range of0.05-0.09 km s$^{-1}$. these values are similar to those found in l1544 bytafalla et al., and this result confirms that infall speeds in starless coresare generally faster than expected from ambipolar diffusion in a stronglysub-critical core. in addition, the observed infall regions are too extended tobe consistent with the `inside-out' collapse model applied to a very low-massstar. in the largest cores, the spatial extent of the cs spectra with infallasymmetry is larger than the extent of the $\rm n_2h^+$ core by a factor of2-3. all these results suggest that extended inward motions are a commonfeature in starless cores, and that they could represent a necessary stage inthe condensation of a star-forming dense core.

astro-ph;0108470	structure of protostellar collapse candidate b335 derived from  near-infrared extinction maps	we present a near-infrared extinction study of the dark globule b335, aprotostellar collapse candidate, using data from hst/nicmos and the w.m. keckobservatory. these data allow a new quantitative test of the "inside-out"collapse model previously proposed to explain molecular line profiles observedtoward this region. we find that the shape of the density profile is wellmatched by the collapse model, but that the amount of extinction corresponds tolarger column densities than predicted. an unstable bonnor-ebert sphere withdimensionless outer radius xi_max=12.5+/-2.6 provides an equally gooddescription of the density profile, and is indistinguishable from the collapsemodel over the range in radius sampled by the data. the bipolar outflow drivenby the embedded yso has an important effect on the extinction through the core,and modeling the outflow as a hollowed-out bipolar cone of constant openingangle provides a good match to theobservations. the complete exinction map iswell reproduced by a model that includes both infall and outflow, and an extra20% dispersion that likely results from residual turbulent motions. this fittedmodel has an infall radius of r_inf=26"+/-3"(0.031pc for 250pc distance), andan outflow cone semi-opening angle of alpha=41+/-2 degrees. the fitted infallradius is consistent with those derived from molecular line observations andsupports the inside-out collapse interpretation of the density structure. thefitted opening angle of the outflow is slightly larger than observed in coemission, perhaps because the full extent of the outflow cone in co becomesconfused with ambient core emission at low velocities.

astro-ph;0202173	dense cores in dark clouds. xiv. n2h+(1-0) maps of dense cloud cores	we present results of an extensive mapping survey of n2h+(1-0) in about 60low mass cloud cores already mapped in the nh3(1,1) inversion transition line.the survey has been carried out at the fcrao antenna with an angular resolutionabout 1.5 times finer than the previous ammonia observations. cores with starstypically have map sizes about a factor of two smaller for n2h+ than for nh3,indicating the presence of denser and more centrally concentrated gas comparedto starless cores. significant correlations are found between nh3 and n2h+column densities and excitation temperatures in starless cores, but not incores with stars, suggesting a different chemical evolution of the two species.velocity gradients range between 0.5 and 6 km/s/pc, similar to what has beenfound with nh3 data. ``local'' velocity gradients show significant variation inboth magnitude and direction, suggesting the presence of complexmotions notinterpretable as simple solid body rotation. integrated intensity profiles ofstarless cores present a ``central flattening'' and are consistent with aspherically symmetric density law n ~ r^{-1.2} for r &lt; ~0.03 pc and n ~ r^{-2}at larger r. cores with stars are better modelled with single density powerlaws with n ~ r^{-2}. line widths change across the core but we did not find ageneral trend. the deviation in line width correlates with the mean line width,suggesting that the line of sight contains ~ 10 coherence lengths. thecorresponding value of the coherence length, ~ 0.01 pc, is similar to theexpected cutoff wavelength for mhd waves. this similarity may account for theincreased ``coherence'' of line widths on small scales. despite of the finerangular resolution, the majority of n2h+ and nh3 maps show a similar ``simple''structure, with single peaks and no elongation.

astro-ph;0410748	molecular line profile fitting with analytic radiative transfer models	we present a study of analytic models of starless cores whose line profileshave ``infall asymmetry,'' or blue-skewed shapes indicative of contractingmotions. we compare the ability of two types of analytical radiative transfermodels to reproduce the line profiles and infall speeds of centrally condensedstarless cores whose infall speeds are spatially constant and range between 0and 0.2 km s-1. the model line profiles of hco+ (j=1-0) and hco+ (j=3-2) areproduced by a self-consistent monte carlo radiative transfer code. the analyticmodels assume that the excitation temperature in the front of the cloud iseither constant (``two-layer'' model) or increases inward as a linear functionof optical depth (``hill'' model). each analytic model is matched to the lineprofile by rapid least-squares fitting.  the blue-asymmetric line profiles with two peaks, or with a blue shifted peakand a red shifted shoulder, can be well fit by the ``hill5'' model (a fiveparameter version of the hill model), with an rms error of 0.02 km s-1. a peaksignal to noise ratio of at least 30 in the molecular line observations isrequired for performing these analytic radiative transfer fits to the lineprofiles.

astro-ph;0501127	centrally condensed collapse of starless cores	models of self-gravitating gas in the early stages of pressure-free collapseare compared for initial states which are equilibrium layers, cylinders, andbonnor-ebert spheres. for each geometrical case the density profile has aninner region of shallow slope surrounded by an outer region of steep slope, andthe profile shape during early collapse remains similar to the profile shape ofthe initial equilibrium. the two-slope density structure divides the sphericalcollapse history into a starless infall phase and a protostellar accretionphase. the similarity of density profiles implies that bonnor-ebert fits toobserved column density maps may not distinguish spherical cores from oblate orprolate cores, and may not distinguish static cores from collapsing cores. thevelocity profiles discriminate better than the density profiles between initialgeometries and between collapse ages. the infall velocity generally has asubsonic maximum value, which is approximately equal to the initial velocitydispersion times the ratio of collapse age to central free-fall time.  observations of starless core line profiles constrain collapse models.collapse from initial states which are strongly condensed and slightly prolateis consistent with infall asymmetry observed around starless cores, and is moreconsistent than collapse from initial states which are weakly condensed, and/oroblate. spherical models match observed inward speeds 0.05-0.09 km/s over0.1-0.2 pc, if the collapse has a typical age 0.3-0.5 free fall times, and ifit began from a centrally condensed state which was not in stable equilibrium.in a collapsing core, optically thin line profiles should broaden and developtwo-peak structure as seen in l1544.

astro-ph;0510066	observations of global and local infall in ngc 1333	we report ``infall asymmetry'' in the hco$^+$ (1--0) and (3--2) lines towardngc 1333, extended over $\sim 0.39 {\rm pc}^2$, a larger extent than has beenreported be fore, for any star-forming region. the infall asymmetry extendsover a major portion of the star-forming complex, and is not limited to asingle protostar, or to a single dense core, or to a single spectral line. itseems likely that the infall asymmetry represents inward motions, and thatthese motions are physically associated with the complex. both blue-asymmetricand red-asymmetric lines are seen, but in both the (3--2) and (1--0) lines ofhco$^+$ the vast majority of the asymmetric lines are blue, indicating inwardmotions. the (3--2) line, tracing denser gas, has the spectra with thestrongest asymmetry and these spectra are associated with the protostars iras4a and 4b, which most likely indicates a warm central source is affecting theline profiles. the (3--2) and (1--0) lines usually have the same sense ofasymmetry in common positions, but their profiles differ significantly, and the(1--0) line appears to trace motions on much larger spatial scales than doesthe (3--2) line. line profile models fit the spectra well, but do not stronglyconstrain their parameters. the mass accretion rate of the inward motions is oforder 10$^{-4}$ m$_\odot$/yr, similar to the ratio of stellar mass to clusterage.

astro-ph;0512330	early evolution of stellar groups and clusters: environmental effects on  forming planetary systems	this paper studies the dynamical evolution of young stellar clusters with $n$= 100 - 1000 members. we use n-body simulations to explore how evolutiondepends on system size $n$ and the initial conditions. motivated by recentobservations of extremely young systems, this study compares subvirial andvirial starting states. multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100simulations per case) are used to build up a robust statistical description ofthese systems, e.g., distributions of closest approaches, mass profiles, anddistributions of radial locations. these results provide a framework from whichto assess the effects of these clusters on star and planet formation. thedistributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with distributions offuv luminosities (also calculated here) to determine the radiation exposure ofcircumstellar disks. the distributions of closest approaches are used inconjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here from $10^5$scattering experiments) to determine the probability of solar systemdisruption. we also use the nearby cluster ngc 1333 as a test case. our mainconclusion is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect onforming planetary systems: interaction rates are low so that the typical solarsystem experiences a single encounter within 1000 au. radiation exposure islow, with median fuv flux $g_0$ = 900, so that photoevaporation of disks isonly important beyond 30 au. given the low interaction rates and modestradiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event inthese clusters.

astro-ph;0605475	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores: iii: low mass star  formation in a small group, l1251b	we present a comprehensive study of a low-mass star-forming region,l1251b, atwavelengths from the near-infrared to the millimeter. l1251b, where only oneprotostar, iras 22376+7455, was known previously, is confirmed to be a smallgroup of protostars based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. themost luminous source of l1251b is located 5" north of the iras position. anear-infrared bipolar nebula, which is not associated with the brightest objectand is located at the southeast corner of l1251b, has been detected in the iracbands. ovro and sma interferometric observations indicate that the brightestsource and the bipolar nebula source in the irac bands are deeply embedded disksources.submillimeter continuum observations with single-dish telescopes andthe sma interferometric observations suggest two possible prestellar objectswith very high column densities. outside of the small group, many young stellarobject candidates have been detected over a larger region of 12' x 12'.extended emission to the east of l1251b has been detected at 850 micron; this"east core" may be a site for future star formation since no point source hasbeen detected with irac or mips. this region is therefore a possible example oflow-mass cluster formation, where a small group of pre- and protostellarobjects (l1251b) is currently forming, alongside a large starless core (theeast core).

astro-ph;0610381	current star formation in the perseus molecular cloud: constraints from  unbiased submillimeter and mid-infrared surveys	we present a census of the population of deeply embedded young stellarobjects (ysos) in the perseus molecular cloud complex based on a combination ofspitzer space telescope mid-ir data from the c2d legacy team and jcmt/scubasubmillimeter maps from the complete team. the mid-ir sources detected at 24micron and having [3.6]-[4.5] &gt; 1 are located close to the center of the scubacores, typically within 15" of their peaks. the narrowness of the spatialdistribution of mid-ir sources around the peaks of the scuba cores suggeststhat no significant dispersal of the newly formed ysos has occurred. thisargues against the suggestion that motions of protostars regulate the timescales over which significant (bondi-hoyle) accretion can occur. the mostdeeply embedded ysos are found in regions with high extinction, av &gt; 5, similarto the extinction threshold observed for the scuba cores. all the scuba coreswith high concentrations have embedded ysos, but not all cores with lowconcentrations are starless. an unbiased sample of 49 deeply embedded ysos isconstructed. embedded ysos are found in 40 of the 72 scuba cores with onlythree cores harboring multiple embedded ysos within 15". the equal number ofscuba cores with and without embedded ysos suggests that the time scale for theevolution through the dense prestellar stages, where the cores are recognizedin the submillimeter maps and have central densities of 5e4-1e5 cm^{-3}, issimilar to the time scale for the embedded protostellar stages. the currentstar formation efficiency of cores is estimated to be approximately 10-15%. incontrast, the star formation efficiency averaged over the cloud life time andcompared to the total cloud mass is only a few percent, reflecting also theefficiency in assembling cloud material into the dense cores forming stars.

astro-ph;0610577	a large scale survey of ngc1333	we observed the clustered star forming complex ngc1333 with the bima andfcrao telescopes in the transitions hco+(1-0) and n2h+(1-0) over an 11'x11'area with resolution ~10" (0.015pc). the n2h+ emission follows very closely thesubmillimeter dust continuum emission, while hco+ emission appears morespatially extended and also traces outflows. we have identified 93 n2h+ coresusing the clumpfind algorithm, and we derive n2h+ core masses between 0.05 and2.5m_sun, with uncertainties of a factor of a few, dominated by the adoptedn2h+ abundance. from a comparison with virial masses, we argue that most ofthese n2h+ cores are likely to be bound, even at the lowest masses, suggestingthat the cores do not trace transient structures, and implies the entire massdistribution consists of objects that can potentially form stars. we find thatthe mass distribution of n2h+ cores resembles the field star imf, whichsuggests that the imf is locked in at the pre-stellar stage of evolution. wefind that the n2h+ cores associated with stars identified from spitzer infraredimages have a flat mass distribution. this might be because lower mass coreslose a larger fraction of their mass when forming a star. even in thisclustered environment, we find no evidence for ballistic motions of the coresrelative to their lower density surroundings traced by isotopic co emission,though this conclusion must remain tentative until the surroundings areobserved at the same high resolution as the n2h+.

astro-ph;0701115	prosac: a submillimeter array survey of low-mass protostars. i. overview  of program: envelopes, disks, outflows and hot cores	this paper presents a large spectral line and continuum survey of 8 deeplyembedded, low-mass protostellar cores using the submillimeter array. eachsource was observed in high excitation lines of some of the most commonmolecular species, co, hco+, cs, so, h2co, ch3oh and sio. line emission from 11species originating from warm and dense gas have been imaged at high angularresolution (1-3"; typically 200-600 au) together with continuum emission at 230ghz (1.3 mm) and 345 ghz (0.8 mm). compact continuum emission is observed forall sources which likely originates in marginally optically thick circumstellardisks, with typical lower limits to their masses of 0.1 m_sun (1-10% of themasses of their envelopes) and having a dust opacity law with betaapproximately 1. prominent outflows are present in co 2-1 observations in allsources: the most diffuse outflows are found in the sources with the lowestratios of disk-to-envelope mass, and it is suggested that these sources are ina phase where accretion of matter from the envelope has almost finished and theremainder of the envelope material is being dispersed by the outflows. othercharacteristic dynamical signatures are found with inverse p cygni profilesindicative of infalling motions seen in the 13co 2-1 lines towardngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. outflow-induced shocks are present on all scales inthe protostellar environments and are most clearly traced by the emission ofch3oh in ngc1333-iras4a and -iras4b. these observations suggest that theemission of ch3oh and h2co from these proposed "hot corinos" are related to theshocks caused by the protostellar outflows. only one source, ngc1333-iras2a,has evidence for hot, compact ch3oh emission coincident with the embeddedprotostar.

astro-ph;9706163	on the efficiency of grain alignment in dark clouds	a quantitative analysis of grain alignment in the filamentary dark cloudl1755 in ophiuchus is presented. we show, that the observed decrease of thepolarization to extinction ratio for the inner parts of this quiescent darkcloud can be explained as a result of the decrease of the efficiency of grainalignment.we make quantitative estimates of grain alignment efficiency for sixmechanisms, involving grains with either thermal or suprathermal rotation,interacting with either magnetic field or gaseous flow. we also makesemiquantitative estimates of grain alignment by radiative torques.we show thatin conditions typical of dark cloud interiors, all known major mechanisms ofgrain alignment fail. all the studied mechanisms predict polarization at leastan order of magnitude below the currently detectable levels of order of 1%. onthe contrary, in the dark cloud environments where a_v&lt;1 the grain alignmentcan be much more efficient. there the alignment of suprathermally rotatinggrains with superparamagentic inclusions, and possibly also radiative torquesaccount for observed polarization. these results apply to l1755, which we modelin detail and probably also to b216 and other similar dark clouds. our studysuggests an explanation for the difference in results obtained throughpolarimetry of background starlight and polarized thermal emission from thedust itself. we conjecture that the emission polarimetry selectively revealsaligned grains in the environment far from thermodynamic equilibrium as opposedto starlight polarization studie that probe the alignment of grains all the wayalong the line of sight, including the interiors of dark quiescent clouds,where no alignment is possible.

astro-ph;9809246	the ionization fraction in dense molecular gas ii: massive cores	we present an observational and theoretical study of the ionization fractionin several massive cores located in regions that are currently forming stellarclusters. maps of the emission from the j = 1-&gt; o transitions of c18o, dco+,n2h+, and h13co+, as well as the j = 2 -&gt; 1 and j = 3 -&gt; 2 transitions of cs,were obtained for each core. core densities are determined via a large velocitygradient analysis with values typically 10^5 cm^-3. with the use ofobservations to constrain variables in the chemical calculations we deriveelectron fractions for our overall sample of 5 cores directly associated withstar formation and 2 apparently starless cores. the electron abundances arefound to lie within a small range, -6.9 &lt; log10(x_e) &lt; -7.3, and are consistentwith previous work. we find no difference in the amount of ionization fractionbetween cores with and without associated star formation activity, nor is anydifference found in electron abundances between the edge and center of theemission region. thus our models are in agreement with the standard picture ofcosmic rays as the primary source of ionization for molecular ions. with theaddition of previously determined electron abundances for low mass cores, andeven more massive cores associated with o and b clusters, we systematicallyexamine the ionization fraction as a function of star formation activity. thisanalysis demonstrates that the most massive sources stand out as having thelowest electron abundances (x_e &lt; 10^-8).

astro-ph;9901175	a catalogue of optically selected cores	we present a new catalogue of 406 dense cores optically selected by using thestsci digitized sky survey (dss). in this catalogue 306 cores have neither anembedded yso (eyso) nor a pre-main-sequence (pms) star, 94 cores have eysos (1core has both an eyso and a pms star), and 6 cores have pms star only. oursample of dense cores in the catalogue is fairly complete within a category ofnorthern lynds class 5, 6 clouds, and southern hartley et al. (1986)'s class aclouds, providing a database useful for the systematic study of dense cores.most of the cores listed in the catalogue have diameters between $0.05 - 0.36$pc with a mean of $\sim 0.24$ pc. the sizes ($\sim 0.33$ pc in the mean) ofcores with eysos are found to be usually larger than the sizes ($\sim 0.22 $ pcin the mean) of starless cores. the typical mean gas density of the cores is$\sim7\times 10^3 cm^{-3}$. most of the cores are more likely elongated thanspherical (mean aspect ratio: $\sim 2.4$). the ratio of the number of coreswith eysos to the number of starless cores for our sample is about 0.3,suggesting that the typical lifetime of starless cores is $0.3-1.6$ myr, about3 times longer than the duration of the class 0 and class i phases. thislifetime is shorter than expected from models of ambipolar diffusion, byfactors of 2-44.

0811.1059	the spitzer c2d legacy results: star formation rates and efficiencies;  evolution and lifetimes	(abridged) the c2d spitzer legacy project obtained images and photometry withboth irac and mips instruments for five large, nearby molecular clouds. thispaper combines information drawn from studies of individual clouds into acombined and updated statistical analysis of star formation rates andefficiencies, numbers and lifetimes for sed classes, and clustering properties.current star formation efficiencies range from 3% to 6%. taken together, thefive clouds are producing about 260 solar masses of stars per myr. the starformation surface density is more than an order of magnitude larger than wouldbe predicted from the kennicutt relation used in extragalactic studies.measured against the dense gas probed by the maps of dust continuum emission,the efficiencies are much higher, and the current stock of dense cores would beexhausted in 1.8 myr on average. the derived lifetime for the class i phase is0.44 to 0.54 myr, considerably longer than some estimates. similarly, thelifetime for the class 0 sed class, 0.10 to 0.16 myr, is longer than earlyestimates. the great majority (90%) of young stars lie within loose clusterswith at least 35 members and a stellar density of 1 solar mass per cubic pc.accretion at the sound speed from an isothermal sphere over the lifetimederived for the class i phase could build a star of about 0.25 solar masses,given an efficiency of 0.3. our data confirm and aggravate the "luminosityproblem" for protostars. our results strongly suggest that accretion is timevariable, with prolonged periods of very low accretion. based on a very simplemodel and this sample of sources, half the mass of a star would be accretedduring only 7% of the class i lifetime, as represented by the eight mostluminous objects.

0812.2012	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores. v. discovery of a vello in  the "starless" dense core l328	this paper reports the discovery of a very low luminosity object (vello) inthe "starless" dense core l328, using the spitzer space telescope and groundbased observations from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. the spitzer 8micron image indicates that l328 consists of three subcores of which thesmallest one may harbor a source, l328-irs while two other subcores remainstarless. l328-irs is a class 0 protostar according to its bolometrictemperature (44 k) and the high fraction ~72 % of its luminosity emitted atsub-millimeter wavelengths. its inferred "internal luminosity" (0.04 - 0.06lsun) using a radiative transfer model under the most plausible assumption ofits distance as 200 pc is much fainter than for a typical protostar, and evenfainter than other vellos studied previously. note, however, that its inferredluminosity may be uncertain by a factor of 2-3 if we consider two extremevalues of the distance of l328-irs (125 or 310 pc). low angular resolutionobservations of co do not show any clear evidence of a molecular outflowactivity. but broad line widths toward l328, and spitzer and near-infraredimages showing nebulosity possibly tracing an outflow cavity, strongly suggestthe existence of outflow activity. provided that an envelope of at most ~0.1msunis the only mass accretion reservoir for l328-irs, and the star formationefficiency is close to the canonical value ~30%, l328-irs has not yet accretedmore than 0.05 msun. at the assumed distance of 200 pc, l328-irs is destined tobe a brown dwarf.
