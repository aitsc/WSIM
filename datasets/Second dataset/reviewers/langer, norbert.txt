1006.1354	thermohaline mixing in evolved low-mass stars	thermohaline mixing has recently been proposed to occur in low-mass redgiants, with large consequence for the chemical yields of low-mass stars. weinvestigate the role of thermohaline mixing during the evolution of starsbetween 1msun and 3msun, in comparison to other mixing processes acting inthese stars. we use a stellar evolution code which includes rotational mixing,internal magnetic fields and thermohaline mixing. we confirm that during thered giant stage, thermohaline mixing has the potential to decrease theabundance of ^3he which is produced earlier on the main sequence. in our modelswe find that this process is working on the rgb only in stars with initial massm \simle 1.5msun. moreover we report that thermohaline mixing is present alsoduring core helium burning and beyond, and has the potential to change thesurface abundances of agb stars. while we find rotational and magnetic mixingto be negligible compared to the thermohaline mixing in the relevant layers,the interaction of thermohaline motions with the differential rotation may beessential to establish the time scale of thermohaline mixing in red giants. toexplain the surface abundances observed at the bump in the luminosity function,the speed of the mixing process needs to be more than two orders of magnitudehigher than in our models. however it is not clear if thermohaline mixing isthe only physical process responsible for these surface abundance anomalies.therefore, at this stage, it is not possible to calibrate the efficiency ofthermohaline mixing against the observations.

1009.4462	3d mhd simulations of subsurface convection in ob stars	during their main sequence evolution, massive stars can develop convectiveregions very close to their surface. these regions are caused by an opacitypeak associated with iron ionization. cantiello et al. (2009) found a possibleconnection between the presence of sub-photospheric convective motions andsmall scale stochastic velocities in the photosphere of early-type stars. thissupports a physical mechanism where microturbulence is caused by waves that aretriggered by subsurface convection zones. they further suggest that clumping inthe inner parts of the winds of ob stars could be related to subsurfaceconvection, and that the convective layers may also be responsible forstochastic excitation of non-radial pulsations. furthermore, magnetic fieldsproduced in the iron convection zone could appear at the surface of suchmassive stars. therefore subsurface convection could be responsible for theoccurrence of observable phenomena such as line profile variability anddiscrete absorption components. these phenomena have been observed for decades,but still evade a clear theoretical explanation. here we present preliminaryresults from 3d mhd simulations of such subsurface convection.

1102.0766	rotating massive main-sequence stars ii: simulating a population of lmc  early b-type stars as a test of rotational mixing	rotational mixing in massive stars is a widely applied concept, with farreaching consequences for stellar evolution. nitrogen surface abundances for alarge and homogeneous sample of massive b-type stars in the lmc were obtainedby the vlt-flames survey of massive stars. this sample is the first covering abroad range of projected stellar rotational velocities, with a large enoughsample of high quality data to allow for a statistically significant analysis.we use the sample to provide the first rigorous test of the theory ofrotational mixing in massive stars. we calculated a grid of stellar evolutionmodels, using the flames sample to calibrate some of the uncertain mixingprocesses. we developed a new population-synthesis code, which uses this gridto simulate a large population of stars with masses, ages and rotationalvelocity distributions consistent with those from the flames sample. thesynthesized population is then filtered by the selection effects in theobserved sample, to enable a direct comparison between the empirical resultsand theoretical predictions. our simulations reproduce the fraction of starswithout significant nitrogen enrichment. the predicted number of rapid rotatorswith enhanced nitrogen is about twice as large as found observationally.furthermore, a group of stars consisting of slowly rotating, nitrogen-enrichedobjects and another consisting of rapidly rotating un-enriched objects can notbe reproduced by our single-star population synthesis. additional physicalprocesses appear to be required to understand the population of massivemain-sequence stars from the flames sample.we discuss the possible role ofbinary stars and magnetic fields in the interpretation of our results. we findthat the population of slowly rotating nitrogen-enriched stars is unlikelyproduced via mass transfer and subsequent tidal spin-down in close binarysystems

1103.1877	runaway stars as progenitors of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts	when a core collapse supernova occurs in a binary system, the surviving staras well as the compact remnant emerging from the sn, may reach a substantialspace velocity. with binary population synthesis modelling at solar and onefifth of solar metallicity, we predict the velocities of such runaway stars orbinaries. we compile predictions for runaway ob stars, red supergiants andwolf-rayet stars. for those stars or binaries which undergo a second stellarexplosion we compute their further evolution and the distance travelled until atype ii or type ibc sn or a long or short gamma-ray burst occurs. we find ourpredicted population of ob runaway stars broadly matches the observedpopulation of stars but, to match the fastest observed wr runaway stars, werequire that black holes receive an asymmetric kick upon formation. we findthat at solar metallicity type ic sn progenitors travel shorter distances thanthe progenitors of other sn types because they are typically more massive andthus have shorter lifetimes. those of type iip sn can fly farthest about 48 pcon average at solar metallicity. in considering the consequences of assumingthat the progenitors of long grbs are spun-up secondary stars that experiencequasi-homogeneous evolution, we find that such evolution has a dramatic effecton the population of runaway wr stars and that some 30 per cent of grbs couldoccur a hundred parsecs or more from their initial positions. we also considermergers of double compact object binaries consisting of neutron stars and/orblack holes. we find the most common type of visible mergers are neutronstar--black hole mergers that are roughly ten times more common than neutronstar--neutron star mergers. we also find that there may be a population oflow-velocity neutron stars that are ejected from a binary rather than by theirown natal kick.

1103.4996	formation of millisecond pulsars with co white dwarf companions - i. psr  j1614-2230: evidence for a neutron star born massive	the recent discovery of a 2 m_sun binary millisecond pulsar (demorest et al.2010) has not only important consequences for the equation-of-state of nuclearmatter at high densities but also raises the interesting question if theneutron star psr j1614-2230 was born massive. the answer is vital forunderstanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. furthermore,this system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binaryand how it evolved during its mass exchanging x-ray phase. in this paper wediscuss the progenitor evolution of psr j1614-2230. we have performed detailedstellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass x-ray binaries undergoing casea roche-lobe overflow (rlo) and applied an analytic parameterization forcalculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highlysuper-eddington isotropic re-emission mode. we find two viable possibilitiesfor the formation of the psr j1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6m_sun giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-inphase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0m_sun main sequence donor star via case a rlo. we conclude that the neutronstar must have been born with a mass of ~1.95 m_sun or 1.7+-0.15 m_sun,respectively - which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses inpreviously discovered radio pulsar systems. based on the expected neutron starbirth masses from considerations of stellar evolution and explosion models, wefind that the progenitor star of psr j1614-2230 is likely to have been moremassive than 20 m_sun.

1110.3142	on the circumstellar medium of massive stars and how it may appear in  grb observations	massive stars lose a large fraction of their original mass over the course oftheir evolution. these stellar winds shape the surrounding medium according toparameters that are the result of the characteristics of the stars, varyingover time as the stars evolve, leading to both permanent and temporary featuresthat can be used to constrain the evolution of the progenitor star.  because long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are thought to originate from massivestars, the characteristics of the circumstellar medium (csm) should beobservable in the signal of grbs. this can occur directly, as thecharacteristics of the grb-jet are changed by the medium it collides with, andindirectly because the grb can only be observed through the extendedcircumstellar bubble that surrounds each massive star.  we use computer simulations to describe the circumstellar features that canbe found in the vicinity of massive stars and discuss if, and how, they mayappear in grb observations. specifically, we make hydrodynamical models of thecircumstellar environment of a rapidly rotating, chemically near-homogeneousstar, which is represents a grb progenitor candidate model.  the simulations show that the star creates a large scale bubble of shockedwind material, which sweeps up the interstellar medium in an expanding shell.within this bubble, temporary circumstellar shells, clumps and voids arecreated as a result of changes in the stellar wind. most of these temporaryfeatures have disappeared by the time the star reaches the end of its life,leaving a highly turbulent circumstellar bubble behind. placing the same starin a high density environment simplifies the evolution of the csm as the moreconfined bubble prohibits the formation of some of the temporary structures.

1204.3925	double bow shocks around young, runaway red supergiants: application to  betelgeuse	a significant fraction of massive stars are moving supersonically through theinterstellar medium (ism), either due to disruption of a binary system orejection from their parent star cluster. the interaction of their wind with theism produces a bow shock. in late evolutionary stages these stars may undergorapid transitions from red to blue and vice versa on the hertzsprung-russelldiagram, with accompanying rapid changes to their stellar winds and bow shocks.recent 3d simulations of the bow shock produced by the nearby runaway redsupergiant (rsg) betelgeuse, under the assumption of a constant wind, indicatethat the bow shock is very young (&lt;30000 years old), hence betelgeuse may haveonly recently become a rsg. to test this possibility, we have calculatedstellar evolution models for single stars which match the observed propertiesof betelgeuse in the rsg phase. the resulting evolving stellar wind isincorporated into 2d hydrodynamic simulations in which we model a runaway bluesupergiant (bsg) as it undergoes the transition to a rsg near the end of itslife. we find that the collapsing bsg wind bubble induces a bow shock-shapedinner shell around the rsg wind that resembles betelgeuse's bow shock, and hasa similar mass. surrounding this is the larger-scale retreating bow shockgenerated by the now defunct bsg wind's interaction with the ism. we suggestthat this outer shell could explain the bar feature located (at least inprojection) just in front of betelgeuse's bow shock.

1206.1862	formation of millisecond pulsars with co white dwarf companions - ii.  accretion, spin-up, true ages and comparison to msps with he white dwarf  companions	millisecond pulsars (msps) are mainly characterised by their spin periods,b-fields and masses - quantities which are largely affected by previousinteractions with a companion star in a binary system. in this paper, weinvestigate the formation mechanism of msps by considering the pulsar recyclingprocess in both intermediate-mass x-ray binaries (imxbs) and low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs). the imxbs mainly lead to the formation of binary msps with amassive carbon-oxygen (co) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (onemg wd)companion, whereas the lmxbs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf(he wd) companion. we discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up linein the ppdot-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquelydefined. we derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass neededfor any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explainthe observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars withdifferent types of companions. from numerical calculations we present furtherevidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting x-ray msps inlmxbs during the roche-lobe decoupling phase (tauris 2012) and demonstrate thatthe same effect is negligible in imxbs. we examine the recycling of pulsarswith co wd companions via case bb roche-lobe overflow (rlo) of naked heliumstars in post common envelope binaries. we find that such pulsars typicallyaccrete of the order 0.002-0.007 m_sun which is just about sufficient toexplain their observed spin periods. we introduce isochrones of radio msps inthe ppdot-diagram to follow their spin evolution and discuss their true agesfrom comparison with observations. finally, we apply our results of the spin-upprocess to the massive pulsar j1614-2230 (paper i) and put new constraints onthe birth masses of a number of recycled pulsars.

1308.4887	evolution towards and beyond accretion-induced collapse of massive white  dwarfs and formation of millisecond pulsars	millisecond pulsars (msps) are generally believed to be old neutron stars(nss), formed via type ib/c core-collapse supernovae (sne), which have beenspun up to high rotation rates via accretion from a companion star in alow-mass x-ray binary (lmxb). in an alternative formation channel, nss areproduced via the accretion-induced collapse (aic) of a massive white dwarf (wd)in a close binary. here we investigate binary evolution leading to aic andexamine if nss formed in this way can subsequently be recycled to form mspsand, if so, how they can observationally be distinguished from pulsars formedvia the standard core-collapse sn channel in terms of their masses, spins,orbital periods and space velocities. numerical calculations with a detailedstellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-and post-aic evolution of close binaries. we investigated the mass transferonto a massive wd in 240 systems with three different types of non-degeneratedonor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. when the wd isable to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and theduration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a ns and westudied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit.subsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donorstar refills its roche lobe and calculated the continued lmxb evolution untilthe end. we demonstrate that the final properties of these msps are, ingeneral, remarkably similar to those of msps formed via the standardcore-collapse sn channel. however, the resultant msps created via the aicchannel preferentially form in certain orbital period intervals. finally, wediscuss the link between aic and young nss in globular clusters. ourcalculations are also applicable to progenitor binaries of sne ia under certainconditions.

1407.4563	electron-capture supernovae exploding within their progenitor wind	the most massive stars on the asymptotic giant branch (agb), so calledsuper-agb stars, are thought to produce supernovae (sne) triggered by electroncaptures in their degenerate o+ne+mg cores. super-agb stars are expected tohave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. theexplosions of super-agb stars are therefore presumed to occur in this densewind. we provide the first synthetic light curves (lcs) for such events byexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecsn) progenitors within theirsuper-agb winds. we find that the early lc, i.e. before the recombination wavereaches the bottom of the h-rich envelope of sn ejecta (the plateau phase), isnot affected by the dense wind. however, after the plateau phase, theluminosity remains higher when the super-agb wind is taken into account. wecompare our results to the historical lc of sn 1054, the progenitor of the crabnebula, and show that the explosion of an ecsn within an ordinary super-agbwind can explain the lc features. we conclude that sn 1054 could have been atype iin sn without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggestedto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. we also show that ourlcs match type iin sne with an early plateau phase (`type iin-p') and suggestthat they are ecsne within super-agb winds. although some ecsne can be brightin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their x-rayluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as othertype iin sne whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.thus, we suggest that optically-bright x-ray-faint type iin sne can emerge fromecsne. optically-faint type iin sne, such as sn 2008s, can also originate fromecsne if their h-rich envelope masses are small. some of them can be observedas `type iin-b' sne due to the small h-rich envelope mass.

1408.2522	interacting supernovae from photoionization-confined shells around red  supergiant stars	betelgeuse, a nearby red supergiant, is a runaway star with a powerfulstellar wind that drives a bow shock into its surroundings. this picture hasbeen challenged by the discovery of a dense and almost static shell that isthree times closer to the star than the bow shock and has been decelerated bysome external force. the two physically distinct structures cannot both beformed by the hydrodynamic interaction of the wind with the interstellarmedium. here we report that a model in which betelgeuse's wind is photoionizedby radiation from external sources can explain the static shell withoutrequiring a new understanding of the bow shock. pressure from the photoionizedwind generates a standing shock in the neutral part of the wind and forms analmost static, photoionization-confined shell. other red supergiants shouldhave significantly more massive shells than betelgeuse, because thephotoionization-confined shell traps up to 35 per cent of all mass lost duringthe red supergiant phase, confining this gas close to the star until itexplodes. after the supernova explosion, massive shells dramatically affect thesupernova lightcurve, providing a natural explanation for the many supernovaethat have signatures of circumstellar interaction.

(2011a) by comparing the stellar agesinferred for the primary and secondary stars of eclipsing milky way binaries.ages are determined from dynamical masses and radii that are known to betterthan 3%. we find that the stellar models reproduce the milky way binaries well.bonnsai is available through a web-interface athttp://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/stars/bonnsai.

1410.0019	wind bubbles within h ii regions around slowly moving stars	interstellar bubbles around o stars are driven by a combination of the star'swind and ionizing radiation output. the wind contribution is uncertain becausethe boundary between the wind and interstellar medium is difficult to observe.mid-infrared observations (e.g., of the h ii region rcw 120) show arcs of dustemission around o stars, contained well within the h ii region bubble. thesearcs could indicate the edge of an asymmetric stellar wind bubble, distorted bydensity gradients and/or stellar motion. we present two-dimensional,radiation-hydrodynamics simulations investigating the evolution of wind bubblesand h ii regions around massive stars moving through a dense (n=3000 cm^{-3}),uniform medium with velocities ranging from 4 to 16 km/s. the h ii regionmorphology is strongly affected by stellar motion, as expected, but the windbubble is also very aspherical from birth, even for the lowest space velocityconsidered. wind bubbles do not fill their h ii regions (we find fillingfactors of 10-20%), at least for a main sequence star with mass m~30 msun.furthermore, even for supersonic velocities the wind bow shock does notsignificantly trap the ionization front. x-ray emission from the wind bubble issoft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the windbubble and the h ii region. the wind bubble radiates &lt;1 per cent of its energyin x-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with coolerphotoionized gas. comparison of the simulations with the h ii region rcw 120shows that its dynamical age is &lt;=0.4 myr and that stellar motion &lt;=4 km/s isallowed, implying that the ionizing source is unlikely to be a runaway star butmore likely formed in situ. the region's youth, and apparent isolation fromother o or b stars, makes it very interesting for studies of massive starformation and of initial mass functions.

1410.4557	pulsations of red supergiant pair-instability supernova progenitors  leading to extreme mass loss	recent stellar evolution models show consistently that very massivemetal-free stars evolve into red supergiants shortly before they explode. weargue that the envelopes of these stars, which will form pair-instabilitysupernovae, become pulsationally unstable and that this will lead to extrememass-loss rates despite the tiny metal content of the envelopes. we investigatethe pulsational properties of such models and derive pulsationally inducedmass-loss rates, which take the damping effects of the mass loss on thepulsations selfconsistently into account. we find that the pulsations mayinduce mass-loss rates of ~ 1e-4 - 1e-2 msun/yr shortly before the explosions,which may create a dense circumstellar medium. our results show that verymassive stars with dense circumstellar media may stem from a wider initial massrange than pulsational-pair instability supernovae. the extreme mass loss willcease when so much of the hydrogen-rich envelope is lost that the star becomesmore compact and stops pulsating. the helium core of these stars thereforeremains unaffected, and their fate as pair-instability supernovae remainsunaltered. the existence of dense circumstellar media around metal-freepair-instability supernovae can make them brighter and bluer, and they may beeasier to detect at high redshifts than previously expected. we argue that themass-loss enhancement in pair-instability supernova progenitors can naturallyexplain some observational properties of superluminous supernovae: theenergetic explosions of stars within hydrogen-rich dense circumstellar mediawith little 56ni production and the lack of a hydrogen-rich envelope inpair-instability supernova candidates with large 56ni production.

1410.5471	the timescale of low-mass proto-helium white dwarf evolution	a large number of low-mass (&lt; 0.20 m_sun) helium white dwarfs (he wds) haverecently been discovered. the majority of these are orbiting another wd or amillisecond pulsar (msp) in a close binary system; a few examples are found toshow pulsations or to have a main-sequence star companion. there appear to bediscrepancies between the current theoretical modelling of such low-mass he wdsand a number of key observed cases, indicating that their formation scenarioremains to be fully understood. here we investigate the formation of detachedproto-he wds in close-orbit low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). our prime focus isto examine the thermal evolution and the contraction phase towards the wdcooling track and investigate how this evolution depends on the wd mass. ourcalculations are then compared to the most recent observational data. numericalcalculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were used to trace themass-transfer phase in a large number of close-orbit lmxbs. subsequently, wefollowed the evolution of the detached low-mass proto-he wds, including stageswith residual shell hydrogen burning and vigorous flashes caused by unstablecno burning. we find that the time between roche-lobe detachment until thelow-mass proto-he wd reaches the wd cooling track is typically delta_t_proto =0.5 - 2 gyr, depending systematically on the wd mass and therefore on itsluminosity. the lowest wd mass for developing shell flashes is ~0.21 m_sun forprogenitor stars of mass m2 &lt;= 1.5 m_sun (and ~0.18 m_sun for m2 = 1.6 m_sun).the long timescale of low-mass proto-he wd evolution can explain a number ofrecent observations, including some msp systems hosting he wd companions withvery low surface gravities and high effective temperatures. we find no evidencefor delta_t_proto to depend on the occurrence of flashes and thus question thesuggested dichotomy in thermal evolution of proto-wds.

1412.3468	the occurrence of classical cepheids in binary systems	classical cepheids, like binary stars, are laboratories for stellar evolutionand cepheids in binary systems are especially powerful ones. about one-third ofgalactic cepheids are known to have companions and cepheids in eclipsing binarysystems have recently been discovered in the large magellanic cloud. however,there are no known galactic binary cepheids with orbital periods less than oneyear. we compute population synthesis models of binary cepheids to compare tothe observed period and eccentricity distributions of galactic cepheids as wellas to the number of observed eclipsing binary cepheids in the lmc. we find thatour population synthesis models are consistent with observed binary propertiesof cepheids. furthermore, we show that binary interaction on the red giantbranch prevents some red giant stars from becoming classical cepheids. suchinteractions suggest that the binary fraction of cepheids should besignificantly less than that of their main-sequence progenitors, and thatalmost all binary cepheids have orbital periods longer than one year. if thegalactic cepheid spectroscopic binary fraction is about 35%, then thespectroscopic binary fraction of their intermediate mass main sequenceprogenitors is about 40-45%.

1502.03218	extended supernova shock breakout signals from inflated stellar  envelopes	stars close to the eddington luminosity can have large low-density inflatedenvelopes. we show that the rise times of shock breakout signals fromsupernovae can be extended significantly if supernova progenitors have aninflated stellar envelope. if the shock breakout occurs in such inflatedenvelopes, the shock breakout signals diffuse in them, and their rise time canbe significantly extended. then, the rise times of the shock breakout signalsare dominated by the diffusion time in the inflated envelope rather than thelight-crossing time of the progenitors. we show that our inflated wolf-rayetstar models whose radii are of the order of the solar radius can have shockbreakout signals which are longer than ~100 sec. the existence of inflatedenvelopes in wolf-rayet supernova progenitors may be related to the mysteriouslong shock breakout signal observed in type ib sn 2008d. extended shockbreakout signals may provide evidence for the existence of inflated stellarenvelopes and can be used to constrain the physical properties of theseenigmatic structures.

1507.03988	observational consequences of turbulent pressure in the envelopes of  massive stars	the major mass fraction of the envelope of hot luminous stars is radiativelystable. however, the partial ionisation of hydrogen, helium and iron gives riseto extended sub-surface convection zones in all of them. in this work, weinvestigate the effect of the pressure induced by the turbulent motion in thesezones based on the mixing length theory, and search for observableconsequences. we find that the turbulent pressure fraction can amount up to ~5%in ob supergiants, and to ~30% in cooler supergiants. the resulting structuralchanges are, however, not significantly affecting the evolutionary trackscompared to previous calculations. instead, a comparison of macroturbulentvelocities derived from high quality spectra of ob stars with the turbulentpressure fraction obtained in corresponding stellar models reveals a strongcorrelation of these two quantities. we discuss a possible physical connection,and conclude that turbulent pressure fluctuations may drive high-orderoscillations, which - as conjectured earlier - manifest themselves asmacroturbulence in the photospheres of hot luminous stars.

1507.07783	radiative-transfer models for supernovae iib/ib/ic from binary-star  progenitors	we present 1-d non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium time-dependentradiative-transfer simulations for supernovae (sne) of type iib, ib, and icthat result from the terminal explosion of the mass donor in a close-binarysystem. here, we select three ejecta with a total kinetic energy of ~1.2e51erg,but characterised by different ejecta masses (2-5msun), composition, andchemical mixing. the type iib/ib models correspond to the progenitors that haveretained their he-rich shell at the time of explosion. the type ic model arisesfrom a progenitor that has lost its helium shell, but retains 0.32msun ofhelium in a co-rich core of 5.11msun. we discuss their photometric andspectroscopic properties during the first 2-3 months after explosion, andconnect these to their progenitor and ejecta properties including chemicalstratification. for these three models, arnett's rule overestimates the 56nimass by ~50% while the procedure of katz et al., based on an energy argument,yields a more reliable estimate. the presence of strong ci lines around 9000aprior to maximum is an indicator that the pre-sn star was under-abundant inhelium. as noted by others, the 1.08micron feature is a complex blend of ci,mgii, and hei lines, which makes the identification of he uncertain in sne ibcunless other hei lines can be identified. our models show little scatter in(v-r) colour 10d after r-band maximum. we also address a number of radiativetransfer properties of sne ibc, including the notion of a photosphere, theinference of a representative ejecta expansion rate, spectrum formation,blackbody fits and "correction factors".

1510.01621	revealing the binary origin of type ic superluminous supernovae through  nebular hydrogen emission	we propose that nebular h-alpha emission as detected in the type icsuperluminous supernova iptf13ehe stems from matter which is stripped from acompanion star when the supernova ejecta collide with it. the temporalevolution, the line broadening, and the overall blueshift of the emission areconsistent with this interpretation. we scale the nebular h-alpha luminositypredicted for type ia supernovae in single-degenerate systems to derive thestripped mass required to explain the h-alpha luminosity of iptf13ehe. we finda stripped mass of 0.1 - 0.9 solar masses, assuming that the supernovaluminosity is powered by radioactivity or magnetar spin down. because a centralheating source is required to excite the h-alpha emission, aninteraction-powered model is not favored for iptf13ehe if the h-alpha emissionis from stripped matter. we derive a companion mass of more than 20 solarmasses and a binary separation of less than about 20 companion radii based onthe stripping efficiency during the collision, indicating that the supernovaprogenitor and the companion formed a massive close binary system. if type icsuperluminous supernovae generally occur in massive close binary systems, theearly brightening observed previously in several type ic superluminoussupernovae may also be due to the collision with a close companion.observations of nebular hydrogen emission in future type ic superluminoussupernovae will enable us to test this interpretation.

1511.01487	relating turbulent pressure and macroturbulence across the hr diagram  with a possible link to \gamma-dor stars	a significant fraction of the envelope of low- and intermediate-mass stars isunstable to convection, leading to sub-surface turbulent motion. here, weconsider and include the effects of turbulence pressure in our stellarevolution calculations. in search of an observational signature, we compare thefractional contribution of turbulent pressure to the observed macroturbulentvelocities in stars at different evolutionary stages. we find a strongcorrelation between the two quantities, similar to what was previously foundfor massive ob stars. we therefore argue that turbulent pressure fluctuationsof finite amplitude may excite high-order, high-angular degree stellaroscillations, which manifest themselves at the surface an additional broadeningof the spectral lines, i.e., macroturbulence, across most of the hr diagram.when considering the locations in the hr diagram where we expect high-orderoscillations to be excited by stochastic turbulent pressure fluctuations, wefind a close match with the observational $\gamma$ doradus instability strip,which indeed contains high-order, non-radial pulsators. we suggest thatturbulent pressure fluctuations on a percentual level may contribute to the$\gamma$ dor phenomenon, calling for more detailed theoretical modelling inthis direction.

1512.06857	detecting stellar-wind bubbles through infrared arcs in hii regions	mid-infrared arcs of dust emission are often seen near ionizing stars withinhii regions. a possible explanations for these arcs is that they could show theouter edges of asymmetric stellar wind bubbles. we use two-dimensional,radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within hii regions aroundindividual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust withinthe hii region. we assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled andthat dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the hiiregion as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. wepost-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infraredwavebands using the torus code. we find that the outer edge of a wind bubbleemits brightly at 24um through starlight absorbed by dust grains andre-radiated thermally in the infrared. this produces a bright arc of emissionfor slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases wherethere is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.the 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasingdistance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.the size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative butnot qualitative effects on our results. despite the simplifications of ourmodel, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the hii regionrcw120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences.our model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arcaround cd -38 11636 in rcw120, and with comparable brightness. this suggeststhat infrared arcs around o stars in hii regions may be revealing the extent ofstellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations.

astro-ph;0007390	formation of the neutron donor c13 in agb stars by overshoot and  rotation	(abridged) observations clearly show that low-mass agb stars can provide anucleosynthesis site of the s-process. recent stellar evolution models indicatethat radiative burning of c13 between thermal pulses in low-mass agb stars mayindeed provide the needed neutrons. some mixing between the proton-richenvelope and the carbon-rich core may lead to the production of c13. however,the responsible physical mechanism is not yet unambiguously identified. wepresent stellar model calculations with overshoot and rotation. overshoot, witha time-dependent and exponentially decaying efficiency, leads to a partialmixture of protons and c12 during the third dredge-up. according to thedepth-dependent ratio of protons and c12, a small c13-pocket forms underneath an14-rich layer. overshoot does not allow for any mixing during the interpulsephase. rotation introduces mixing driven by large angular velocity gradientswhich form at the envelope-core interface in agb stars, in particular after athermal pulse. this leads to partial mixing after a pulse, as in the case ofovershoot. however, rotation continues to mix the region of the c13-pocket witha diffusion coefficient of log d ~ 2...3 [cm**2 / s]. this does not only spreadthe c13-pocket, but also the more massive n14-rich layer, and finally leads tomixture of both layers. by the time when the temperature there has risen toabout 9*10e7k and neutron production sets in, the n14 abundance exceeds the c13abundance by a factor of 5...10. we analyze the role of n14 as a neutron poisonby considering the recycling of neutrons via n14(n,p)c14 andc12(p,gamma)n13(beta+)c13 qualitatively. we find that as long as x(n14) &lt;&lt;x(c12), the s-process will still be possible to occur under radiativeconditions.

astro-ph;0103471	chemical composition and origin of nebulae around luminous blue  variables	we use the analysis of the heavy element abundances (c, n, o, s) incircumstellar nebulae around luminous blue variables to infer the evolutionaryphase in which the material has been ejected.  (1) we discuss the different effects that may have changed the gascomposition of the nebula since it was ejected  (2) we calculate the expected abundance changes at the stellar surface due toenvelope convection in the red supergiant phase. if the observed lbv nebulaeare ejected during the rsg phase, the abundances of the lbv nebulae require asignificantly smaller amount of mass to be lost than assumed in evolutionarymodels.  (3) we calculate the changes in the surface composition during the mainsequence phase by rotation induced mixing. if the nebulae are ejected at theend of the ms-phase, the abundances in lbv nebulae are compatible with mixingtimes between 5 x 10^6 and 1 x 10^7 years. the existence of on stars supportsthis scenario.  (4) the predicted he/h ratio in the nebulae are significantly smaller thanthe current observed photospheric values of their central stars.  combining various arguments we show that the lbv nebulae are ejected duringthe blue sg phase and that the stars have not gone through a rsg phase. thechemical enhancements are due to rotation induced mixing, and the ejection ispossibly triggered by near-critical rotation. during the ejection, the outflowwas optically thick, which resulted in a large effective radius and a loweffective temperature. this also explains the observed properties of lbv dust.

astro-ph;0202067	the s-process in rotating agb stars	we discuss the occurrence of the s-process during the radiative interpulsephase of rotating agb stars. due to differential rotation, protons are mixedinto c12-rich layers after thermal pulses, in the course of the so called thirddredge up episode. we follow the time evolution of key isotope abundances inthe relevant layers with a post-processing code which includes time dependantmixing and nucleosynthesis. in rotating agb models, the mixing persists duringthe entire interpulse phase due to the steep gradient of angular velocity atthe envelope-core interface. as the layers containing protons and c12, whichare formed this way, become hotter, a c13-pocket is formed in a natural way.however, in this situation also n14 is formed and spread over the entirec13-pocket. we include the neutron consuming n14(n,p) reaction in our networkand determine to what extent it reduces the production of trans-iron elements.we propose that rotation may be responsible for the spread of efficiencies ofthe c13 neutron source as required by observations.

astro-ph;0302272	mixing and the s-process in rotating agb stars	we model the nucleosynthesis during a radiative interpulse phase of arotating 3msun asymptotic giant branch (agb) star. we find an enhancedproduction of the neutron source species c13 compared to non-rotating modelsdue to shear mixing of protons and c12 at the core-envelope interface. weestimate that the resulting total production of heavy elements by slow neutroncapture s-process is too low to account for most observations. this due to thefact that rotationally induced mixing during the interpulse phase causes apollution of the c13 pocket layer with the neutron poison n14. as a result wefind a maximum neutron exposure of tau_max=0.04mbarn^{-1} in the s-processlayer of our solar metallicity model with rotation. this is about a factor of 5to 10 less than required to reproduce the observed stellar s-process abundancepatterns. we compare our results with models that include hydrodynamicovershooting mixing, and with simple parametric models including the combinedeffects of overshooting and mixing in the interpulse. within the parametricmodel a range of mixing efficiencies during the interpulse phase correlateswith a spread in the s-process efficiency. such a spread is observed in agb andpost-agb stars as well as in pre-solar sic grains.

astro-ph;0305491	the s-process in rotating asymptotic giant branch stars	(abridged) we model the nucleosynthesis during the thermal pulse phase of arotating, solar metallicity agb star of 3m_sun. rotationally induced mixingduring the thermal pulses produces a layer (~2e-5m_sun) on top of the co-corewhere large amounts of protons and c12 co-exist. we follow the abundanceevolution in this layer, in particular that of the neutron source c13 and ofthe neutron poison n14. in our agb model mixing persists during the entireinterpulse phase due to the steep angular velocity gradient at thecore-envelope interface. we follow the neutron production during the interpulsephase, and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of tau_max =0.04 mbarn^-1,which is too small to produce any significant s-process. in parametric models,we then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from theconvective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. models with overshoot andweaker interpulse mixing - as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars- yield larger neutron exposures. we conclude that the incorporation ofrotationally induce mixing processes has important consequences for theproduction of heavy elements in agb stars. through a distribution of initialrotation rates it may lead to a natural spread in the neutron exposuresobtained in agb stars of a given mass - as appears to be required byobservations. our results suggest that both processes, diffusive overshoot androtational mixing, may be required to obtain a consistent description of thes-process in agb stars which fulfils all observational constraints. finally, wefind that mixing due to rotation within our current framework does increase theproduction of n15 in the partial mixing zone, however still falling short ofwhat seems required by observations.

astro-ph;0501071	stabilization of helium shell burning by rotation in accreting white  dwarfs	the currently favored scenario for the progenitor evolution of type iasupernovae (sne ia) presumes that white dwarfs in close binary systems grow tothe chandrasekhar limit via mass accretion from their non-degeneratecompanions. however, the accreted hydrogen and/or helium usually participatethermally unstable or even violent nuclear reactions in a geometricallyconfined region, due to the compactness of the white dwarf. since shell flashesinduced by the thermal instability might induce significant loss of mass,efficient mass increase of white dwarfs by hydrogen and/or helium accretion hasbeen seriously questioned. a good understanding of the stability ofthermonuclear shell sources is therefore crucial in order to investigate theevolution of accreting white dwarfs as sne ia progenitors. here, we present aquantitative criterion for the thermal stability of thermonuclear shellsources, and discuss the effects of rotation on the stability of helium shellburning in helium accreting co white dwarfs with mdot \approx 10^{-7} ...10^{-6} msun/yr. in particular, we show that, if the effects of rotation areproperly considered, helium shell sources are significantly stabilized, whichmight increase the likelihood for accreting white dwarfs to grow to thechandrasekhar limit.

astro-ph;0502133	on the evolution of rapidly rotating massive white dwarfs towards  supernovae or collapses	a recent study by yoon &amp; langer (2004a) indicated that the inner cores ofrapidly accreting (mdot &gt; 10^{-7} m_sun/yr) co white dwarfs may rotatedifferentially, with a shear rate near the threshold value for the onset of thedynamical shear instability. such differentially rotating white dwarfs obtaincritical masses for thermonuclear explosion or electron-capture inducedcollapse which significantly exceed the canonical chandrasekhar limit. here, weconstruct two-dimensional differentially rotating white dwarf models withrotation laws resembling those of the one-dimensional models of yoon &amp; langer(2004a). we derive analytic relations between the white dwarf mass, its angularmomentum, and its rotational-, gravitational- and binding energy. we show thatthese relations are applicable for a wide range of angular velocity profiles,including solid body rotation. we demonstrate that pre-explosion andpre-collapse conditions of both, rigidly and differentially rotating whitedwarfs are well established by the present work, which may facilitate futuremulti-dimensional simulations of type ia supernova explosions and studies ofthe formation of millisecond pulsars and gamma-ray bursts from collapsing whitedwarfs.our results lead us to suggest various possible evolutionary scenariosfor progenitors of type ia supernovae, leading to a new paradigm of a variablemass of exploding white dwarfs, at values well above the classicalchandrasekhar mass. based on our 2d-models, we argue for the supernova peakbrightness being proportional to the white dwarf mass, which could explainvarious aspects of the diversity of type ia supernovae, such as their variationin brightness, the dependence of their mean luminosity on the host galaxy type,and the weak correlation between ejecta velocity and peak brightness.

astro-ph;0504175	which massive stars are gamma-ray burst progenitors?	the collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts requires three essentialingredients: a massive core, removal of the hydrogen envelope, and enoughangular momentum in the core. we study current massive star evolution models ofsolar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable ofproducing these ingredients. in particular, we investigate the role ofhydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary massand angular momentum transfer. we follow the evolution of rotating single starsand of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.neglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars canmaintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption thatmean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. in binarysystems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the massreceiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,leading to a spin-up of the core. we find, however, that this merelycompensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,which leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. thereforethe resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. we also presentmodels that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and weconsider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. weinvestigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angularmomentum into the cores of accreting stars. despite our finding that thismechanism works, the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accretingstar ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation than in thenon-magnetic case.

astro-ph;0504242	constraining the mass transfer in massive binaries through progenitor  evolution models of wolf-rayet+o binaries	since close wr+o binaries are the result of a strong interaction of bothstars in massive close binary systems, they can be used to constrain the highlyuncertain mass and angular momentum budget during the major mass transferphase. we explore the progenitor evolution of the three best suited wr+obinaries hd 90657, hd 186943 and hd 211853, which are characterized by a wr/omass ratio of $\sim$0.5 and periods of 6..10 days. we are doing so at threedifferent levels of approximation: predicting the massive binary evolutionthrough simple mass loss and angular momentum loss estimates, through fullbinary evolution models with parametrized mass transfer efficiency, and throughbinary evolution models including rotation of both components and a physicalmodel which allows to compute mass and angular momentum loss from the binarysystem as function of time during the mass transfer process. all three methodsgive consistently the same answers. our results show that, if these systemsformed through stable mass transfer, their initial periods were smaller thantheir current ones, which implies that mass transfer has started during thecore hydrogen burning phase of the initially more massive star. furthermore,the mass transfer in all three cases must have been highly non-conservative,with on average only $\sim$10% of the transferred mass being retained by themass receiving star. this result gives support to our system mass and angularmomentum loss model, which predicts that, in the considered systems, about 90%of the overflowing matter is expelled by the rapid rotation of the massreceiver close to the $\omega$-limit, which is reached through the accretion ofthe remaining 10%.

astro-ph;0507659	constraints on gamma-ray burst and supernova progenitors through  circumstellar absorption lines	long gamma-ray bursts are thought to be caused by a subset of explodingwolf-rayet stars. we argue that the circumstellar absorption lines in earlysupernova and in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra may allow us to determinethe main properties of the wolf-rayet star progenitors which can produce thosetwo events. to demonstrate this, we first simulate the hydrodynamic evolutionof the circumstellar medium around a 40 msun star up to the time of thesupernova explosion. knowledge of density, temperature and radial velocity ofthe circumstellar matter as function of space and time allows us to compute thecolumn density in the line of sight to the centre of the nebula, as a functionof radial velocity, angle, and time. our column density profiles indicate thepossible number, strengths, widths and velocities of absorption line componentsin supernova and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra. our example calculationshows four distinct line features during the wolf-rayet stage, at about 0, 50,150-700 and 2200 km/s, with only those of the lowest and highest velocitypresent at all times. the 150-700 km/s feature decays rapidly as function oftime after the onset of the wolf-rayet stage. it consists of a variable numberof components, and, especially in its evolved stage, is depending strongly onthe particular line of sight. a comparison with absorption lines detected inthe afterglow of grb 021004 suggests that the high velocity absorptioncomponent in grb 021004 may be attributed to the free streaming wolf-rayetwind, which is consistent with the steep density drop indicated by theafterglow light curve. the presence of the intermediate velocity componentsimplies that the duration of the wolf-rayet phase of the progenitor of grb021004 was much smaller than the average wolf-rayet life time.

astro-ph;0508242	evolution of rapidly rotating metal-poor massive stars towards gamma-ray  bursts	recent models of rotating massive stars including magnetic fields prove itdifficult for the cores of single stars to retain enough angular momentum toproduce a collapsar and gamma-ray burst. at low metallicity, even very massivestars may retain a massive hydrogen envelope due to the weakness of the stellarwinds, posing an additional obstacle to the collapsar model. here, we considerthe evolution of massive, magnetic stars where rapid rotation induces almostchemically homogeneous evolution. we find that in this case, the requirementsof the collapsar model are rather easily fulfilled if the metallicitysufficiently small: 1) rapidly rotating helium stars are formed without theneed to remove the hydrogen envelope, avoiding mass-loss induced spin-down. 2)angular momentum transport from the helium core to hydrogen envelope bymagnetic torques is insignificant. we demonstrate this by calculatingevolutionary models of massive stars with various metallicities, and derive anupper metallicity limit for this scenario based on currently proposed mass lossrates. our models also suggest the existence of a lower co-core mass limit ofabout 10 msun -- which relates to an initial mass of only about 20 msun withinour scenario -- for grb production. we argue that the relative importance ofthe considered grb progenitor channel, compared to any channel related tobinary stars, may increase with decreasing metallicity, and that this channelmight be the major path to grbs from first stars.

astro-ph;0601603	multi-dimensional simulations of the accretion-induced collapse of white  dwarfs to neutron stars	we present 2.5d radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of the accretion-inducedcollapse (aic) of white dwarfs, starting from 2d rotational equilibriumconfigurations of a 1.46-msun and a 1.92-msun model. electron capture leads tothe collapse to nuclear densities of these cores within a few tens ofmilliseconds. the shock generated at bounce moves slowly, but steadily,outwards. within 50-100ms, the stalled shock breaks out of the white dwarfalong the poles. the blast is followed by a neutrino-driven wind that developswithin the white dwarf, in a cone of ~40deg opening angle about the poles, witha mass loss rate of 5-8 x 10^{-3} msun/yr. the ejecta have an entropy on theorder of 20-50 k_b/baryon, and an electron fraction distribution that isbimodal. by the end of the simulations, at &gt;600ms after bounce, the explosionenergy has reached 3-4 x 10^{49}erg and the total ejecta mass has reached a fewtimes 0.001msun. we estimate the asymptotic explosion energies to be lower than10^{50}erg, significantly lower than those inferred for standard core collapse.the aic of white dwarfs thus represents one instance where a neutrino mechanismleads undoubtedly to a successful, albeit weak, explosion.  we document in detail the numerous effects of the fast rotation of theprogenitors: the neutron stars are aspherical; the ``nu_mu'' and anti-nu_eneutrino luminosities are reduced compared to the nu_e neutrino luminosity; thedeleptonized region has a butterfly shape; the neutrino flux and electronfraction depend strongly upon latitude (a la von zeipel); and a quasi-keplerian0.1-0.5-msun accretion disk is formed.

astro-ph;0610563	tides in asynchronous binary systems	stellar oscillations are excited in non-synchronously rotating stars inbinary systems due to the tidal forces. tangential components of the tides candrive a shear flow which behaves as a differentially forced rotating structurein a stratified outer medium. in this paper we show that our single-layerapproximation for the calculation of the forced oscillations yields resultsthat are consistent with the predictions for the synchronization timescales incircular orbits. in addition, calibrating our model results to fit zahn'srelationship between synchronization timescales and orbital separation, we areable to constrain the value of the kinematical viscosity parameter. for the4mo+5mo binary modeled in this paper, the kinematical viscosity is in the range0.0015 -- 0.0043 ro^2/d for orbital periods in the range 2.5 -- 25 d.furthermore, the energy dissipation rate due to the shear flow is found todecrease by ~2 orders of magnitude as synchronization is approached, implyingthat binary systems may approach synchronization relatively quickly but that ittakes a much longer timescale to actually attain this condition. our model canbe used to calculate the energy dissipation rates throughout the orbital cyclefor arbitrary values of eccentricity and stellar rotational velocity. wesuggest that the asymmetric distribution of energy dissipation over the stellarsurface may lead to the appearance of localized regions of enhanced surfaceactivity.

astro-ph;0703321	are the models for type ia supernova progenitors consistent with the  properties of supernova remnants?	we explore the relationship between the models for progenitor systems of typeia supernovae and the properties of the supernova remnants that evolve afterthe explosion. most models for type ia progenitors in the single degeneratescenario predict substantial outflows during the presupernova evolution.expanding on previous work, we estimate the imprint of these outflows on thestructure of the circumstellar medium at the time of the supernova explosion,and the effect that this modified circumstellar medium has on the evolution ofthe ensuing supernova remnant. we compare our simulations with theobservational properties of known type ia supernova remnants in the galaxy(kepler, tycho, sn 1006), the large magellanic cloud (0509-67.5, 0519-69.0,n103b), and m31 (sn 1885). we find that optically thick outflows from the whitedwarf surface (sometimes known as accretion winds) with velocities above 200km/s excavate large low-density cavities around the progenitors. such largecavities are incompatible with the dynamics of the forward shock and the x-rayemission from the shocked ejecta in all the type ia remnants that we haveexamined.

astro-ph;9705097	pulsations in red supergiants with high l/m ratio -- implications for  the stellar and circumstellar structure of supernova progenitors	we investigate the pulsational properties of rsg models --- which we evolvefrom zams masses in the range 10 to $20 \msun$ --- by means of linear andnon-linear calculations. we find period and growth rate of the dominantfundamental mode to increase with increasing luminosity-to-mass ratio $l/m$.our models obtain relatively large $l/m$ values due to the inclusion ofrotation in the evolutionary calculations; however, the largest values areobtained at and beyond central he-exhaustion due to major internalrearrangements of the nuclear burning regions. our non-linear calculations aswell as the behavior of the linear period and growth rate of the pulsations forperiods approaching the kelvin-helmholtz time scale of the h-rich stellarenvelope point towards the possibility of large amplitude pulsations. suchproperties are similar to that found in agb stars and suggest the possibilityof a ``superwind'' to occur before the rsgs explode as supernovae. we concludethat changes in global stellar properties during the last few $10^4 \yr$ beforecore collapse may lead to drastic changes in the pulsational and windproperties of pre-supernova stars, with marked consequences for the immediatepre-supernova structure of the star and the circumstellar medium. we compareour results with observations of long-period oh/ir variables and discussobservational evidence for our scenario from observed supernova light curves,spectra and remnants.

astro-ph;9803005	the spin-up of contracting red supergiants	we report on a mechanism which may lead to a spin-up of the surface of arotating single star leaving the hayashi line, which is much stronger than thespin-up expected from the mere contraction of the star. by analyzing rigidlyrotating, convective stellar envelopes, we qualitatively work out the mechanismthrough which these envelopes may be spun up or down by mass loss through theirlower or upper boundary, respectively. we find that the first case describesthe situation in retreating convective envelopes, which tend to retain most ofthe angular momentum while becoming less massive, thereby increasing thespecific angular momentum in the convection zone and thus in the layers closeto the stellar surface. we explore the spin-up mechanism quantitatively in astellar evolution calculation of a rotating 12 m_sun star, which is found to bespun up to critical rotation after leaving the red supergiant branch. wediscuss implications of this spin-up for the circumstellar matter aroundseveral types of stars, i.e., post-agb stars, b[e] stars, pre-main sequencestars, and, in particular, the progenitor of supernova 1987a.

astro-ph;9905025	giant outbursts of luminous blue variables and the formation of the  homunculus nebula around eta carinae	the observed giant outbursts of luminous blue variables (lbvs) may occur whenthese massive stars approach their eddington limits. when this happens, theymust reach a point where the centrifugal force and the radiative accelerationcancel out gravity at the equator. we call this the omega-limit. when stars areclose to the omega-limit, strong non-spherical mass loss should occur. thissuggests a scenario where a slow and very dense wind, strongly confined to theequatorial plane, is followed by a fast and almost spherical wind. we computetwo-dimensional hydrodynamic models of the evolution of the nebula formed fromsuch interacting winds, using parameters consistent with the outburst of etacarinae in the last century. this outburst gave birth to the homunculus, thehourglass-shaped inner part of a highly structured circumstellar nebula.assuming the star was very close to the omega-limit during outburst, our modelsproduce gas distributions that strongly resemble the homunculus on large andsmall scale. this supports the general conjecture that giant outbursts in lbvsoccur when they approach the eddington limit. our models constrains the averagemass loss rate since the outburst to values smaller than the present-day massloss rate and suggest that eta car is approaching another outburst. our modelsimply that the occurrence of giant lbv outbursts depends on the initial stellarrotation rate, and that the initial angular momentum is as important to theevolution of very massive stars as their initial mass or metallicity.
