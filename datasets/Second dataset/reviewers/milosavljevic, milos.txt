0812.3918	aspherical core-collapse supernovae in red supergiants powered by  nonrelativistic jets	we explore the observational characteristics of jet-driven supernovae bysimulating bipolar-jet-driven explosions in a red supergiant progenitor. wepresent results of four models in which we hold the injected kinetic energy ata constant $10^{51}$ ergs across all jet models but vary the specificcharacteristics of the jets to explore the influence of the nature of jets onthe structure of the supernova ejecta. we evolve the explosions pastshock-breakout and into quasi-homologous expansion of the supernova envelopeinto a red supergiant wind. the oppositely-directed, nickel-rich jets give alarge-scale asymmetry that may account for the non-spherical excitation andsubstructure of spectral lines such as h$\alpha$ and he i 10830\aa. jets with alarge fraction of kinetic to thermal energy punch through the progenitorenvelope and give rise to explosions that would be observed to be asymmetricfrom the earliest epochs, inconsistent with spectropolarimetric measurements oftype ii supernovae. jets with higher thermal energy fractions result inexplosions that are roughly spherical at large radii but are significantlyelongated at smaller radii, deep inside the ejecta, in agreement with thepolarimetric observations. we present shock breakout light curves that indicatethat strongly aspherical shock breakouts are incompatible with recent {\itgalex} observations of shock breakout from red supergiant stars. comparisonwith observations indicates that jets must deposit their kinetic energyefficiently throughout the ejecta while in the hydrogen envelope. thermalenergy-dominated jets satisfy this criterion and yield many of theobservational characteristics of type ii supernovae.

0902.1124	the impact of mergers on the survival and abundance of disk-dominated  galaxies	we study the formation of disk-dominated galaxies in a lcdm universe. theirexistence is considered to be a challenge for the lcdm cosmology, becausegalaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentum transportin gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellar spheroids. here,we postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from gasrich disks iscontrolled by two parameters that characterize galaxy mergers, the mass ratioof merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity of the larger merginghalo. we utilize merger histories generated from realizations of thecosmological density field to calculate the fraction of dark matter halos thathave avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived statistics with thespheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby galaxies. we find, forexample, that the survival rate of disk-dominated galaxies in lcdm is just highenough to explain the observed fractional representation of disk-dominatedgalaxies in the universe if the only mergers which lead to central spheroidformation are those with mass ratios m2/m1 &gt; 0.3 and virial velocities vvir,1 &gt;55 km/s. we discuss the physical origin of this criterion, and show that thedependence of the disk-dominated fraction on galaxy mass provides a furthertest of the merger hypothesis.

0706.2881	cluster merger shock constraints on particle acceleration and nonthermal  pressure in the intracluster medium	x-ray observations of galaxy cluster merger shocks can be used to constrainnonthermal processes in the intracluster medium (icm). the presence ofnonthermal pressure components in the icm, as well as the shock acceleration ofparticles and their escape, all affect shock jump conditions in distinct ways.therefore, these processes can be constrained using x-ray surface brightnessand temperature maps of merger shock fronts. here we use these observations toplace constraints on particle acceleration efficiency in intermediate machnumber (m ~ 2-3) shocks and explore the potential to constrain the contributionof nonthermal components (e.g., cosmic rays, magnetic field, and turbulence) toicm pressure in cluster outskirts. we model the hydrodynamic jump conditions inmerger shocks discovered in the galaxy clusters a520 (m ~ 2) and 1e 0657-56 (m~ 3) using a multifluid model comprised of a thermal plasma, a nonthermalplasma, and a magnetic field. based on the published x-ray spectroscopic dataalone, we find that the fractional contribution of cosmic rays accelerated inthese shocks is lower than about 10% of the shock downstream pressure. currentobservations do not constrain the fractional contribution of nonthermalcomponents to the pressure of the undisturbed shock upstream. future x-rayobservations, however, have the potential to either detect particleacceleration in these shocks through its effect on the shock dynamics, or toplace a lower limit on the nonthermal pressure contributions in the undisturbedicm. we briefly discuss implications for models of particle acceleration incollisionless shocks and the estimates of galaxy cluster masses derived fromx-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich effect observations.

0910.4989	collapsar accretion and the gamma-ray burst x-ray light curve	we present axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of the long-term accretionof a rotating grb progenitor star, a "collapsar," onto the central compactobject. the simulations were carried out with the adaptive mesh refinement codeflash in two spatial dimensions and with an explicit shear viscosity. theevolution of the central accretion rate exhibits phases reminiscent of the longgrb gamma-ray and x-ray light curve, which lends support to the proposal thatthe luminosity is modulated by the central accretion rate. after a few tens ofseconds, an accretion shock sweeps outward through the star. the formation andoutward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapidpower-law decline in the central accretion rate mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, whichresembles the l_x ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the x-ray light curves. thecollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-massequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere. aftera few hundred seconds, the inflow of low-angular-momentum material in the axialfunnel reverses into an outflow from the surface of the thick disk. meanwhile,the rapid decline of the accretion rate slows down, or even settles a in steadystate with mdot ~ 5x10^{-5} msun/s, which resembles the "plateau" phase in thex-ray light curve. while the duration of the "prompt" phase depends on theresolution in our simulations, we provide an analytical model taking intoaccount neutrino losses that estimates the duration to be ~20 s. the modelsuggests that the steep decline in grb x-ray light curves is triggered by thecircularization of the infalling stellar envelope at radii where the virialtemperature is below ~10^{10} k, such that neutrino cooling shuts off and anoutward expansion of the accretion shock becomes imminent.

1004.0267	fragmentation in the first galaxies	we study the gravitational fragmentation of cold accretion streams flowinginto a typical first galaxy. we use a one-zone hydrodynamical model to examinethe thermal evolution of the gas entering a 10^8 m_sun dm halo at z=10. thegoal is to find the expected fragmentation mass scale and thus a characteristicmass of the first population of stars to form by shock fragmentation at highredshift. our model accurately describes the chemical and thermal evolution ofthe gas as we are specifically concerned with how the cooling of the gas altersits fragmentation properties. we find there to be a sharp drop in thefragmentation mass at a metallicity of ~10^-4 z_sun when a strong moleculedestroying, lw background is present. however, if molecules can efficientlyform, they dominate the cooling at t &lt; 10^4 k, demonstrating no 'criticalmetallicity'. dust grains are not included in our chemical model, but we arguetheir inclusion would not significantly the results. we also find that thisphysical scenario allows for the formation of a cluster of solar massfragments, or a single 10^4 m_sun fragment, possibly the precursors to primevalclusters and smbhs. lastly, we conclude that the usual assumption ofisobaricity for galactic shocks breaks down in gas of sufficiently highmetallicity, suggesting that metal cooling may lead to thermal instabilities.

1007.0763	supernovae powered by collapsar accretion in gamma-ray burst sources	the association of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) with type icsupernovae presents a challenge to supernova explosion models. in the collapsarmodel for lgrbs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launchingfrom the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of thecollapse of a rotating progenitor star. the jet is collimated along the star'srotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should berelatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize asubstantial mass of 56ni. our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment ofthe possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,which powers the lgrb, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass inthe envelope to produce a luminous supernova. for this, the energy dissipatednear the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it candrive a supernova-like shockwave. here we suggest that the energy istransported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying onglobal mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. themodel suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope andthat ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. the efficiency with which theaccretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by thecompetition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from theblack hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, themagnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum ofthe infalling envelope. substantial masses of 56ni may be synthesized in theconvective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initialcircularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. thesynthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburnedejecta.

1007.3693	aspherical supernova shock breakout and the observations of supernova  2008d	shock breakout is the earliest, readily-observable emission from acore-collapse supernova explosion. observing supernova shock breakout may yieldinformation about the nature of the supernova shock prior to exiting theprogenitor and, in turn, about the core-collapse supernova mechanism itself.x-ray outburst 080109, later associated with sn 2008d, is a very well-observedexample of shock breakout from a core-collapse supernova. despite excellentobservational coverage and detailed modeling, fundamental information about theshock breakout, such as the radius of breakout and driver of the light curvetime scale, is still uncertain. the models constructed for explaining the shockbreakout emission from sn 2008d all assume spherical symmetry. we present astudy of the observational characteristics of {\it aspherical} shock breakoutfrom stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae. we conduct two-dimensional,jet-driven supernova simulations from stripped-envelope progenitors andcalculate the resulting shock breakout x-ray spectra and light curves. thex-ray spectra evolve significantly in time as the shocks expand outward and arenot well-fit by single-temperature and radius black bodies. the time scale ofthe x-ray burst light curve of the shock breakout is related to the shockcrossing time of the progenitor, not the much shorter light crossing time thatsets the light curve time scale in spherical breakouts. this could explain thelong shock breakout light curve time scale observed for xro 080109/sn 2008d.

1008.2986	nuclear star clusters from clustered star formation	photometrically distinct nuclear star clusters (nscs) are common inlate-type-disk and spheroidal galaxies. the formation of nscs is inevitable inthe context of normal star formation in which a majority of stars form inclusters. a young, mass-losing cluster embedded in an isolated star-forminggalaxy remains gravitationally bound over a period determined by its initialmass and the galactic tidal field. the cluster migrates radially toward thecenter of the galaxy and becomes integrated in the nsc if it reaches thecenter. the rate at which the nsc grows by accreting young clusters can beestimated from empirical cluster formation rates and dissolution times. wemodel cluster migration and dissolution and find that the nscs in late-typedisks and in spheroidals could have assembled from migrating clusters. theresulting stellar nucleus contains a small fraction of the stellar mass of thegalaxy; this fraction is sensitive to the high-mass truncation of the initialcluster mass function (icmf). the resulting nsc masses are consistent with theobserved values, but generically, the final nscs are surrounded by a spatiallymore extended excess over the inward-extrapolated exponential (or sersic) lawof the outer galaxy. we suggest that the excess can be related to thepseudobulge phenomenon in disks, though not all of the pseudobulge massassembles this way. comparison with observed nsc masses can be used toconstrain the truncation mass scale of the icmf and the fraction of clusterssuffering prompt dissolution. we infer truncation mass scales of &lt;~ 10^6 m_sun(&gt;~ 10^5 m_sun) without (with 90%) prompt dissolution.

1011.0438	the first galaxies: assembly of disks and prospects for direct detection	the james webb space telescope (jwst) will enable observations of galaxies atredshifts z &gt; 10 and hence allow to test our current understanding of structureformation at very early times. previous work has shown that the very firstgalaxies inside halos with virial temperatures t &lt; 10^4 k and masses m &lt; 10^8m_sun at z &gt; 10 are probably too faint, by at least one order of magnitude, tobe detected even in deep exposures with jwst. the light collected with jwst maytherefore be dominated by radiation from galaxies inside ten times more massivehalos. we use cosmological zoomed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulationsto investigate the assembly of such galaxies and assess their observabilitywith jwst. we compare two simulations that are identical except for theinclusion of non-equilibrium h/d chemistry and radiative cooling by molecularhydrogen. in both simulations a large fraction of the halo gas settles in twonested, extended gas disks which surround a compact massive gas core. thepresence of molecular hydrogen allows the disk gas to reach low temperaturesand to develop marked spiral structure but does not qualitatively change itsstability against fragmentation. we post-process the simulated galaxies bycombining idealized models for star formation with stellar population synthesismodels to estimate the luminosities in nebular recombination lines as well asin the ultraviolet continuum. we demonstrate that jwst will be able toconstrain the nature of the stellar populations in galaxies such as simulatedhere based on the detection of the he1640 recombination line. extrapolation ofour results to halos with masses both lower and higher than those simulatedshows that jwst may find up to a thousand star-bursting galaxies in future deepexposures of the z &gt; 10 universe.

1104.5249	two-stream-like instability in dilute hot relativistic beams and  astrophysical relativistic shocks	relativistic collisionless shocks are believed to be efficient particleaccelerators. nonlinear outcome of the interaction of accelerated particlesthat run ahead of the shock, the so-called "precursor", with the unperturbedplasma of the shock upstream, is thought to facilitate additional accelerationof these particles and to possibly modify the hydrodynamic structure of theshock. we explore here the linear growth of kinetic modes appearing in theprecursor-upstream interaction in relativistic shocks propagating in non andweakly magnetized plasmas: electrostatic two-stream parallel mode andelectrostatic oblique modes. these modes are of particular interest becausethey are the fastest growing modes known in this type of system. using asimplified distribution function for a dilute ultra-relativistic beam that isrelativistically hot in its own rest frame, yet has momenta that are narrowlycollimated in the frame of the cold upstream plasma into which it propagates,we identify the fastest growing mode in the full $k$-space and calculate itsgrowth rate. we consider all types of plasma (pairs and ions-electrons) andbeam (charged and charge-neutral). we find that unstable electrostatic modesare present in any type of plasma and for any shock parameters. we further findthat two modes, one parallel ($k_\perp=0$) and the other one oblique ($k_\perp\sim k_\|$), are competing for dominance and that either one may dominate thegrowth rate in different regions of the phase space. the dominant mode isdetermined mostly by the perpendicular spread of the accelerated particlemomenta in the upstream frame, which reflects the shock lorentz factor. theparallel mode becomes more dominant in shocks with lower lorentz factors (i.e.,with larger momentum spreads). we briefly discuss possible implications of ourresults for external shocks in gamma-ray burst sources.

1108.1415	simulations of accretion powered supernovae in the progenitors of gamma  ray bursts	observational evidence suggests a link between long duration gamma ray bursts(lgrbs) and type ic supernovae. here, we propose a potential mechanism for typeic supernovae in lgrb progenitors powered solely by accretion energy. wepresent spherically-symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the long-termaccretion of a rotating gamma-ray burst progenitor star, a "collapsar," ontothe central compact object, which we take to be a black hole. the simulationswere carried out with the adaptive mesh refinement code flash in one spatialdimension and with rotation, an explicit shear viscosity, and convection in themixing length theory approximation. once the accretion flow becomesrotationally supported outside of the black hole, an accretion shock forms andtraverses the stellar envelope. energy is carried from the centralgeometrically thick accretion disk to the stellar envelope by convection.energy losses through neutrino emission and nuclear photodisintegration arecalculated but do not seem important following the rapid early drop of theaccretion rate following circularization. we find that the shock velocity,energy, and unbound mass are sensitive to convective efficiency, effectiveviscosity, and initial stellar angular momentum. our simulations show thatgiven the appropriate combinations of stellar and physical parameters,explosions with energies ~5x10^50 ergs, velocities 3000 km/s, and unboundmaterial masses &gt;6 solar masses are possible in a rapidly rotating 16 solarmass main sequence progenitor star. further work is needed to constrain thevalues of these parameters, to identify the likely outcomes in more plausibleand massive lrgb progenitors, and to explore nucleosynthetic implications.

1111.6305	the first galaxies: assembly with black hole feedback	we study how the first galaxies were assembled under feedback from theaccretion onto a central black hole (bh) that is left behind by the firstgeneration of metal-free stars through self-consistent, cosmologicalsimulations. x-ray radiation from the accretion of gas onto bh remnants ofpopulation iii (pop iii) stars, or from high-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs), againinvolving pop iii stars, influences the mode of second generation starformation. we track the evolution of the black hole accretion rate and theassociated x-ray feedback starting with the death of the pop iii progenitorstar inside a minihalo and following the subsequent evolution of the black holeas the minihalo grows to become an atomically cooling galaxy. we find thatx-ray photoionization heating from a stellar-mass bh is able to quench furtherstar formation in the host halo at all times before the halo enters the atomiccooling phase. x-ray radiation from a hmxb, assuming a luminosity close to theeddington value, exerts an even stronger, and more diverse, feedback on starformation. it photoheats the gas inside the host halo, but also promotes theformation of molecular hydrogen and cooling of gas in the intergalactic mediumand in nearby minihalos, leading to a net increase in the number of starsformed at early times. our simulations further show that the radiative feedbackfrom the first bhs may strongly suppress early bh growth, thus constrainingmodels for the formation of supermassive bhs.

1112.5207	the source density and observability of pair-instability supernovae from  the first stars	theoretical models predict that some of the first stars ended their lives asextremely energetic pair-instability supernovae (pisne). with energiesapproaching 10^53 ergs, these supernovae are expected to be within thedetection limits of the upcoming james webb space telescope (jwst), allowingobservational constraints to be placed on the properties of the first stars. weestimate the source density of pisne using a semi-analytic halo mass functionbased approach, accounting for the effects of feedback from star formation onthe pisn rates using cosmological simulations. we estimate an upper limit of~0.2 pisne per jwst field of view at any given time. feedback can reduce thisrate significantly, e.g., lowering it to as little as one pisn per 4000 jwstfields of view for the most pessimistic explosion models. we also find that themain obstacle to observing pisne from the first stars is their scarcity, nottheir faintness; exposures longer than a few times 10^4s will do little toincrease the number of pisne found. given this we suggest a mosaic style searchstrategy for detecting pisne from the first stars. even rather high redshiftpisne are unlikely to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number ofpointings will be required to ensure a detection.

1203.2957	confined population iii enrichment and the prospects for prompt  second-generation star formation	it is widely recognized that nucleosynthetic output of the first, populationiii supernovae was a catalyst defining the character of subsequent stellargenerations. most of the work on the earliest enrichment was carried outassuming that the first stars were extremely massive and that the associatedsupernovae were unusually energetic, enough to completely unbind the baryons inthe host cosmic minihalo and disperse the synthesized metals into theintergalactic medium. recent work, however, suggests that the first stars mayin fact have been somewhat less massive, with a characteristic mass scale of afew tens of solar masses. we present a cosmological simulation following thetransport of the metals synthesized in a population iii supernova assuming thatit had an energy of 1e51 ergs, compatible with standard type ii supernovae. ayoung supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic hii region in thefree expansion phase and is followed for 40 myr employing adaptive meshrefinement and lagrangian tracer particle techniques. the supernova remnantremains partially trapped within the minihalo and the thin snowplow shelldevelops pronounced instability and fingering. roughly half of the ejecta turnaround and fall back toward the center of the halo, with 1% of the ejectareaching the center in 30 kyr and 10% in 10 myr. the average metallicity of thecombined returning ejecta and the pristine filaments feeding into the halocenter from the cosmic web is 0.001 - 0.01 z_sun, but the two remain unmixeduntil accreting onto the central hydrostatic core that is unresolved at the endof the simulation. we conclude that if population iii stars had less extrememasses, they promptly enriched the host minihalos with metals and triggeredpopulation ii star formation.

1205.3835	star formation in the first galaxies i: collapse delayed by lyman-werner  radiation	we investigate the process of metal-free star formation in the first galaxieswith a high-resolution cosmological simulation. we consider the cosmologicallymotivated scenario in which a strong molecule-destroying lyman-werner (lw)background inhibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes, delaying starformation until the collapse or more massive haloes. only when molecularhydrogen (h2) can self-shield from lw radiation, which requires a halo capableof cooling by atomic line emission, will star formation be possible. to followthe formation of multiple gravitationally bound objects, at high gas densitieswe introduce sink particles which accrete gas directly from the computationalgrid. we find that in a 1 mpc^3 (comoving) box, runaway collapse first occursin a 3x10^7 m_sun dark matter halo at z~12 assuming a background intensity ofj21=100. due to a runaway increase in the h2 abundance and cooling rate, aself-shielding, supersonically turbulent core develops abruptly with ~10^4m_sun in cold gas available for star formation. we analyze the formation ofthis self-shielding core, the character of turbulence, and the prospects forstar formation. due to a lack of fragmentation on scales we resolve, we arguethat lw-delayed metal-free star formation in atomic cooling haloes is verysimilar to star formation in primordial minihaloes, although in making thisconclusion we ignore internal stellar feedback. finally, we briefly discuss thedetectability of metal-free stellar clusters with the james webb spacetelescope.

0711.3014	on the survival and abundance of disk-dominated galaxies	we study the formation of disk-dominated galaxies in a lambda cdm universe.their existence is considered to be a challenge for the lambda cdm cosmology,because galaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentumtransport in gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellarspheroids. here, we postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids fromgas-rich disks is controlled by two parameters that characterize galaxymergers, the mass ratio of merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocityof the larger merging halo. we utilize merger histories generated fromrealizations of the cosmological density field to calculate the fraction ofdark matter halos that have avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derivedstatistics with the spheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearbygalaxies. we find, for example, that the survival rate of disk-dominatedgalaxies in lambda cdm is just high enough to explain the observed fractionalrepresentation of disk-dominated galaxies in the universe if the only mergerswhich lead to central spheroid formation are those with mass ratios m2/m1 &gt; 0.3and virial velocities vvir,1 &gt; 55 km/s. we discuss the physical origin of thiscriterion.

1307.1982	star formation in the first galaxies - ii: clustered star formation and  the influence of metal line cooling	population iii stars are believed to have been more massive than typicalstars today and to have formed in relative isolation. the thermodynamic impactof metals is expected to induce a transition leading to clustered, low-masspopulation ii star formation. in this work, we present results from threecosmological simulations, only differing in gas metallicity, that focus on theimpact of metal fine-structure line cooling on the formation of stellarclusters in a high-redshift atomic cooling halo. introduction of sink particlesallows us to follow the process of gas hydrodynamics and accretion onto clusterstars for 4 myr corresponding to multiple local free-fall times. atmetallicities at least $10^{-3}\, z_{\odot}$, gas is able to reach the cmbtemperature floor and fragment pervasively resulting in a stellar cluster ofsize $\sim1$ pc and total mass $\sim1000\, m_{\odot}$. the masses of individualsink particles vary, but are typically $\sim100\, m_{\odot}$, consistent withthe jeans mass when gas cools to the cmb temperature, though some solar massfragments are also produced. at the low metallicity of $10^{-4}\, z_{\odot}$,fragmentation is completely suppressed on scales greater than 0.01 pc and totalstellar mass is lower by a factor of 3 than in the higher metallicitysimulations. the sink particle accretion rates, and thus their masses, aredetermined by the mass of the gravitationally unstable gas cloud and theprolonged gas accretion over many myr. the simulations thus exhibit features ofboth monolithic collapse and competitive accretion. even considering possibledust induced fragmentation that would occur at higher densities, the formationof a bona fide stellar cluster seems to require metal line cooling andmetallicities of at least $10^{-3}\, z_{\odot}$.

0803.1803	the cluster-merger shock in 1e 0657-56	the merging galaxy cluster 1e 0657-56, known as the "bullet cluster," is oneof the hottest clusters known. the x-ray emitting plasma exhibitsbow-shock-like temperature and density jumps. the segregation of this plasmafrom the peaks of the mass distribution determined by gravitational lensing hasbeen interpreted as a direct proof of collisionless dark matter. if the highshock speed inferred from the shock jump conditions equals the relative speedof the merging cdm halos, however, this merger is predicted to be such a rareevent in a lcdm universe that observing it presents a possible conflict withthe lcdm model.  we examined this question using high resolution, 2d simulations of gasdynamics in cluster collisions to analyze the relative motion of the clusters,the bow shock, and the contact discontinuity, and relate these to the x-raydata for the bullet cluster. we find that the velocity of the fluid shock neednot equal the relative velocity of the cdm components. an illustrativesimulation finds that the present relative velocity of the cdm halos is 16%lower than that of the shock. while this conclusion is sensitive to thedetailed initial mass and gas density profiles of the colliding clusters, sucha decrease of the inferred halo relative velocity would significantly increasethe likelihood of finding 1e 0657-56 in a lcdm universe.

1407.0034	recovery from population iii supernova explosions and the onset of  second generation star formation	we use cosmological simulations to assess how the explosion of the firststars in supernovae (sne) influences early cosmic history. specifically, weinvestigate the impact by sne on the host systems for population~iii (pop~iii)star formation and explore its dependence on halo environment and pop~iiiprogenitor mass. we then trace the evolution of the enriched gas untilconditions are met to trigger second-generation star formation. to this extent,we quantify the recovery timescale, which measures the time delay between apop~iii sn explosion and the appearance of cold, dense gas, out of whichsecond-generation stars can form. we find that this timescale is highlysensitive to the pop~iii progenitor mass, and less so to the halo environment.for more massive progenitors, including those exploding in pair instabilitysne, second-generation star formation is delayed significantly, for up to ahubble time. the dependence of the recovery time on the mass of the snprogenitor is mainly due to the ionizing impact of the progenitor star.photoionization heating increases the gas pressure and initiates ahydrodynamical response that reduces the central gas density, an effect that isstronger in more massive. the gas around lower mass pop~iii stars remainsdenser and hence the sn remnants cool more rapidly, facilitating the subsequentre-condensation of the gas and formation of a second generation of stars. inmost cases, the second-generation stars are already metal-enriched to ~2-5 x10^{-4}\zsun, thus belonging to population~ii. the recovery timescale is a keyquantity governing the nature of the first galaxies, able to host low-mass,long-lived stellar systems. these in turn are the target of future deep-fieldcampaigns with the james webb space telescope.

1408.0319	metal transport and chemical heterogeneity in early star forming systems	to constrain the properties of the first stars with the chemical abundancepatterns observed in metal-poor stars, one must identify any non-trivialeffects that the hydrodynamics of metal dispersal can imprint on theabundances. we use realistic cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to quantifythe distribution of metals resulting from one population iii supernova and froma small number of such supernovae exploding in close succession. overall,supernova ejecta are highly inhomogeneously dispersed throughout thesimulations. when the supernova bubbles collapse, quasi-virializedmetal-enriched clouds, fed by fallback from the bubbles and by streaming ofmetal-free gas from the cosmic web, grow in the centers of the dark matterhalos. partial turbulent homogenization on scales resolved in the simulation isobserved only in the densest clouds where the vortical time scales are shortenough to ensure true homogenization on subgrid scales. however, the abundancesin the clouds differ from the gross yields of the supernovae. continuing thesimulations until the cloud have gone into gravitational collapse, we predictthat the abundances in second-generation stars will be deficient in theinnermost mass shells of the supernova (if only one has exploded) or in theejecta of the latest supernovae (when multiple have exploded). this indicatesthat hydrodynamics gives rise to biases complicating the identification ofnucleosynthetic sources in the chemical abundance spaces of the survivingstars.

1501.01002	the first galaxies: simulating their feedback-regulated assembly	we investigate the formation of a galaxy reaching a virial mass of $~ 10^8$solar mass at $z=10$ by carrying out a zoomed radiation-hydrodynamicalcosmological simulation. this simulation traces population~iii (pop~iii) starformation, characterized by a modestly top-heavy initial mass function (imf),and considers stellar feedback such as photoionization heating from pop iii andpopulation~ii (pop~ii) stars, mechanical and chemical feedback from supernovae(sne), and x-ray feedback from accreting black holes (bhs) and high-mass x-raybinaries (hmxbs). we self-consistently impose a transition in star formationmode from top-heavy pop iii to low-mass pop~ii, and find that the starformation rate in the computational box is dominated by pop~iii until $z=13$,and by pop~ii thereafter. the simulated galaxy experiences bursty starformation, with a substantially reduced gas content due to photoionizationheating from pop~iii and pop~ii stars, together with sn feedback. all the gaswithin the simulated galaxy is metal-enriched above $10^{-5}$ solar, such thatthere are no remaining pockets of primordial gas. the simulated galaxy has anestimated observed flux of $~10^{-3} njy$, which is too low to be detected bythe james webb space telescope (jwst) without strong lensing amplification. wealso show that our simulated galaxy is similar in terms of stellar mass tosegue 2, the least luminous dwarf known in the local group.

1501.03212	star formation in the first galaxies - iii. formation, evolution, and  characteristics of the first stellar cluster	we simulate the formation of a low metallicity (0.01 zsun) stellar cluster ina dwarf galaxy at redshift z~14. beginning with cosmological initialconditions, the simulation utilizes adaptive mesh refinement and sink particlesto follow the collapse and evolution of gas past the opacity limit forfragmentation, thus resolving the formation of individual protostellar cores. atime- and location-dependent protostellar radiation field, which heats the gasby absorption on dust, is computed by integration of protostellar evolutionarytracks with the mesa code. the simulation also includes a robustnon-equilibrium chemical network that self-consistently treats gasthermodynamics and dust-gas coupling. the system is evolved for 18 kyr afterthe first protostellar source has formed. in this time span, 30 sink particlesrepresenting protostellar cores form with a total mass of 81 msun. their massesrange from ~0.1 msun to 14.4 msun with a median mass ~0.5-1 msun. massiveprotostars grow by competitive accretion while lower-mass protostars arestunted in growth by close encounters and many-body ejections. in the regimeexplored here, the characteristic mass scale is determined by the temperaturefloor set by the cosmic microwave background and by the onset of efficientdust-gas coupling. it seems unlikely that host galaxies of the first bursts ofmetal-enriched star formation will be detectable with the james webb spacetelescope or other next-generation infrared observatories. instead, the mostpromising access route to the dawn of cosmic star formation may lie in thescrutiny of metal-poor, ancient stellar populations in the galacticneighborhood. the observable targets that correspond to the system simulatedhere are ultra-faint dwarf satellite galaxies such as bootes ii, segue i andii, and willman i.

1504.00005	an increasing stellar baryon fraction in bright galaxies at high  redshift	recent observations have shown that the characteristic luminosity of therest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function does not significantly evolveat 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 and is approximately m*_uv ~ -21. we investigate this apparentnon-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, m_uv &lt; -21 galaxies at z=4to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. including deepspitzer/irac imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find thatm*_uv galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(m/msol)=9.6-9.9 andare thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. however, bright galaxiesat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly brightgalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formationrates and levels of dust attenuation. we match the abundances of these brightz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the bolshoi lambda-cdm simulation toestimate the halo masses. we find that the typical halo masses in ~m*_uvgalaxies decrease from log(m_h/msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(m_h/msol)=11.4 at z=7.thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multipleredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. thestellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean omega_b/omega_m rises from5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigmalevel. this rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, isallowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars athigh redshifts.

1505.07126	abundance anomalies in metal-poor stars from population iii supernova  ejecta hydrodynamics	we present a simulation of the long-term evolution of a population iiisupernova remnant in a cosmological minihalo. employing passive lagrangiantracer particles, we investigate how chemical stratification and anisotropy inthe explosion can affect the abundances of the first low-mass, metal-enrichedstars. we find that reverse shock heating can leave the inner mass shells atentropies too high to cool, leading to carbon-enhancement in the re-collapsinggas. this hydrodynamic selection effect could explain the observed incidence ofcarbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars at low metallicity. we further explorehow anisotropic ejecta distributions, recently seen in direct numericalsimulations of core-collapse explosions, may translate to abundances inmetal-poor stars. we find that some of the observed scatter in the populationii abundance ratios can be explained by an incomplete mixing of supernovaejecta, even in the case of only one contributing enrichment event. wedemonstrate that the customary hypothesis of fully-mixed ejecta clearly failsif post-explosion hydrodynamics prefers the recycling of some nucleosyntheticproducts over others. furthermore, to fully exploit the stellar-archaeologicalprogram of constraining the pop iii initial mass function from the observed popii abundances, considering these hydrodynamical transport effects is crucial.we discuss applications to the rich chemical structure of ultra-faint dwarfsatellite galaxies, to be probed in unprecedented detail with upcomingspectroscopic surveys.

1506.05121	radiation pressure driving of a dusty atmosphere	radiation pressure can be dynamically important in star-forming environmentssuch as ultra-luminous infrared and submillimeter galaxies. whether and howradiation drives turbulence and bulk outflows in star formation sites is stillunclear. the uncertainty in part reflects the limitations of direct numericalschemes that are currently used to simulate radiation transfer andradiation-gas coupling. an idealized setup in which radiation is introduced atthe base of a dusty atmosphere in a gravitational field has recently become thestandard test for radiation-hydrodynamics methods in the context of starformation. to a series of treatments featuring the flux-limited-diffusionapproximation as well as a short-characteristics tracing and m1 closure for thevariable eddington tensor approximation, we here add another treatment that isbased on the implicit monte carlo radiation transfer scheme. consistent withall previous treatments, the atmosphere undergoes rayleigh-taylor instabilityand readjusts to a near-eddington-limited state. we detect late-time netacceleration in which the turbulent velocity dispersion matches that reportedpreviously with the short-characteristics-based radiation transport closure,the most accurate of the three preceding treatments. our technical resultdemonstrates the importance of accurate radiation transfer in simulations ofradiative feedback.

0807.4117	shock vorticity generation from accelerated ion streaming in the  precursor of ultrarelativistic gamma-ray burst external shocks	we investigate the interaction of nonthermal ions (protons and nuclei)accelerated in an ultrarelativistic blastwave with the pre-existing magneticfield of the medium into which the blastwave propagates. while particleacceleration processes such as diffusive shock acceleration can accelerate ionsand electrons, the accelerated electrons suffer larger radiative losses. undercertain conditions, the ions can attain higher energies and reach farther aheadof the shock than the electrons, and so the nonthermal particles can bepartially charge-separated. to compensate for the charge separation, theupstream plasma develops a return current, which, as it flows across themagnetic field, drives transverse acceleration of the upstream plasma and agrowth of density contrast in the shock upstream. if the density contrast isstrong by the time the fluid is shocked, vorticity is generated at the shocktransition. the resulting turbulence can amplify the post-shock magnetic fieldto the levels inferred from gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra and light curves.therefore, since the upstream inhomogeneities are induced by the ionsaccelerated in the shock, they are generic even if the blastwave propagatesinto a medium of uniform density. we speculate about the global structure ofthe shock precursor, and delineate several distinct physical regimes that areclassified by an increasing distance from the shock and, correspondingly, adecreasing density of nonthermal particles that reach that distance.

astro-ph;0103350	formation of galactic nuclei	we investigate a model in which galactic nuclei form via the coalescence ofpre-existing stellar systems containing supermassive black holes. mergersimulations are carried out using n-body algorithms that can follow theformation and decay of a black-hole binary and its effect on the surroundingstars down to sub-parsec scales. our initial stellar systems have steep centraldensity cusps similar to those in low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. formationof a black-hole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the centraldensity; continued decay of the binary creates a ~1/r density cusp similar tothose observed in bright elliptical galaxies, with a break radius that extendswell beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes. the decayof the black hole binary is followed over a factor of ~20 in separation afterformation of a hard binary, considerably farther than in previous simulations.we see almost no dependence of the binary's decay rate on number of particlesin the simulation, contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial densityof stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binary's loss cone. wenevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy wouldbe expected to stall at separations of 0.01-1 pc unless some additionalmechanism is able to extract energy from the binary. our results support apicture in which the observed dependence of nuclear cusp slope on galaxyluminosity is a consequence of galaxy interactions. we also discuss theimplications of our results for the survivability of dark-matter cusps.

astro-ph;0212459	long term evolution of massive black hole binaries	the long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries at the centers ofgalaxies is studied in a variety of physical regimes, with the aim of resolvingthe ``final parsec problem,'' i.e., how black hole binaries manage to shrink toseparations at which emission of gravity waves becomes efficient. a binaryejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in thehost galaxy. continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the losscone. we show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived forcollisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantiallyunderestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. we derive expressions fornon-equilibrium loss-cone dynamics and calculate time scales for the decay ofmassive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantlyhigher decay rates than heretofore. even in the absence of two-body relaxation,decay of binaries can persist due to repeated ejection of stars returning tothe nucleus on eccentric orbits. we show that this recycling of stars leads toa gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy ontime. we derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by thebrownian motion of a black hole binary. we also show that numerical n-bodyexperiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times dueto spurious relaxation.

astro-ph;0306074	the need for a second black hole at the galactic center	deep infra-red observations and long-term monitoring programs have provideddynamical evidence for a supermassive black hole of mass 3.e6 solar massesassociated with the radio source sagitarrius a* at the center of our galaxy.the brightest stars orbiting within 0.1 parsecs of the black hole appear to beyoung, massive main sequence stars, n spite of an environment near the blackhole that is hostile to star formation. we discuss mechanisms by which starsborn outside the central parsec can sink towards the black hole and concludethat the drag coming from plausible stellar populations does not operate on theshort timescales required by the stellar ages. we propose that these stars weredragged in by a second black hole of mass of 1.e3-1.e4 solar masses, whichwould be classified as an intermediate-mass black hole. we discuss theimplications for the stellar populations and the kinematics in the galacticcenter. finally we note that continued astrometric monitoring of the centralradio source offers the prospect for a direct detection of such objects.

astro-ph;0310574	on the origin of nuclear star clusters in late type spiral galaxies	a large fraction of bulgeless disk galaxies contain young compact stellarsystems at their centers, in spite of the local gravitational stability ofthese disks. we evaluate two contrasting hypotheses for the origin of thenuclear star clusters in late-type disk galaxies. the clusters could not havemigrated from distant eccentric locations in the disk. instead they must haveformed in situ, requiring radial transport of gas toward the center of thedisk. this transport could be a consequence of the development of themagnetorotational instability in the differentially rotating warm neutralmedium. we evaluate the rate of gas transport into the disk center and findthat it is sufficient to support continuous star formation in that location.enhanced stellar surface brightness in the inner few hundred parsecs and theformation of a compact stellar system in the central few parsecs areunavoidable in dark matter halos with divergent density profiles. we illustrateour conclusions on a model of the nearest late-type disk galaxy m33.

astro-ph;0401221	the link between warm molecular disks in maser nuclei and star formation  near the black hole at the galactic center	the discovery of hundreds of young, bright stars within a parsec from themassive black hole at the center of the galaxy presents a challenge to starformation theories. the requisite roche densities for the gravitationalcollapse of gas clouds are most naturally achieved in accretion disks. thewater maser sources in keplerian rotation in the nuclei of ngc4258, ngc1068,and the circinus galaxy indicate the presence of warm, extended, molecularaccretion disks around black holes similar in mass to the one at the galacticcenter. here we argue that the current conditions in the maser nuclei, andthose near the galactic center, represent two consecutive, recurrent phases inthe life cycle of the nucleus of a typical gas-rich spiral bulge. the warmmolecular disks that give rise to the observed maser emission fragment intostellar-size objects. the stellar masses, their orbital geometry, and the totalnumber of stars thus formed are consistent with the values identified at thegalactic center. the stars tend to form in compact groups resembling the irs 13complex that dominates the stellar light in the neighborhood of the black hole.

astro-ph;0404138	the acs virgo cluster survey. i. introduction to the survey	the virgo cluster is the dominant mass concentration in the localsupercluster and the largest collection of elliptical and lenticular galaxiesin the nearby universe. in this paper, we present an introduction to the acsvirgo cluster survey: a program to image, in the f475w and f850lp bandpasses(sloan g and z), 100 early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster using theadvanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. we describe theselection of the program galaxies and their ensemble properties, the choice offilters, the field placement and orientation, the limiting magnitudes of thesurvey, coordinated parallel observations of 100 "intergalactic" fields withwfpc2, and supporting ground-based spectroscopic observations of the programgalaxies. in terms of depth, spatial resolution, sample size and homogeneity,this represents the most comprehensive imaging survey to date of early-typegalaxies in a cluster environment. we briefly describe the main scientificgoals of the survey which include the measurement of luminosities,metallicities, ages, and structural parameters for the many thousands ofglobular clusters associated with these galaxies, a high-resolution isophotalanalysis of galaxies spanning a factor of ~ 450 in luminosity and sharing acommon environment, the measurement of accurate distances for the full sampleof galaxies using the method of surface brightness fluctuations, and adetermination of the three-dimensional structure of virgo itself.

astro-ph;0404407	stellar dynamics at the galactic center with an extremely large  telescope	we discuss experiments achievable via monitoring of stellar dynamics near themassive black hole at the galactic center with a next generation, extremelylarge telescope (elt). given the likely observational capabilities of an eltand current knowledge of the stellar environment at the galactic center, wesynthesize plausible samples of stellar orbits around the black hole. we usethe markov chain monte carlo method to evaluate the constraints that orbitalmonitoring places on the matter content near the black hole. results areexpressed as functions of the number n of stars with detectable orbital motionsand the astrometric precision dtheta and spectroscopic precision dv at whichstellar proper motions and radial velocities are monitored. for n = 100, dtheta= 0.5 mas, and dv = 10 km/s -- a conservative estimate of the capabilities of a30 meter telescope -- the extended matter distribution enclosed by the orbitswill produce measurable deviations from keplerian motion if &gt;1000 msun isenclosed within 0.01 pc. the black hole mass and distance to the galacticcenter will be measured to better than ~0.1%. lowest-order relativisticeffects, such as the prograde precession, will be detectable if dtheta &lt; 0.5mas. higher-order effects, including frame dragging due to black hole spin,requires dtheta &lt; 0.05 mas, or the favorable discovery of a compact, highlyeccentric orbit. finally, we calculate the rate at which monitored starsundergo detectable nearby encounters with background stars. such encountersprobe the mass function of stellar remnants that accumulate near the blackhole. we find that ~30 encounters will be detected over a 10 yr baseline fordtheta = 0.5 mas.

astro-ph;0405188	the acs virgo cluster survey iii. chandra and hst observations of  low-mass x-ray binaries and globular clusters in m87	the acis instrument on board the chandra x-ray observatory has been used tocarry out the first systematic study of low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in m87.we identify 174 x-ray point-sources, of which ~150 are likely lmxbs. this lmxbcatalog is combined with deep f475w and f850lp images taken with acs on hst toexamine the connection between lmxbs and globular clusters in m87. of the 1688globular clusters in our catalog, f_x = 3.6 +- 0.5% contain a lmxb and we findthat the metal-rich clusters are 3 +- 1 times more likely to harbor a lmxb thantheir metal-poor counterparts. in agreement with previous findings for othergalaxies, we find that brighter, more metal-rich clusters are more likely tocontain a lmxb. for the first time, however, we are able to demonstrate thatthe probability, p_x, that a given cluster will contain a lmxb dependssensitively on the dynamical properties of the host cluster. specifically, weuse the hst images to measure the half-light radius, concentration index andcentral density, \rho_0, for each globular, and define a parameter, \gamma,which is related to the tidal capture and binary-neutron star exchange rate.our preferred form for p_x is then p_x \propto \gamma \rho_0^{-0.42\pm0.11}(z/z_{\odot})^{0.33\pm0.1}. we argue that if the form of p_x is determined bydynamical processes, then the observed metallicity dependence is a consequenceof an increased number of neutron stars per unit mass in metal-rich globularclusters. finally, we find no compelling evidence for a break in the luminositydistribution of resolved x-ray point sources. instead, the lmxb luminosityfunction is well described by a power law with an upper cutoff at l_x ~ 10^39erg/s.

astro-ph;0410343	the afterglow of massive black hole coalescence	the final merger of a pair of massive black holes in a galactic nucleus iscompelled by gravitational radiation. gravitational waves from the mergers ofblack holes of masses (10^5-10^7)(1+z)^{-1} msun at redshifts of 1-20 will bereadily detectable by the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa), but anelectromagnetic afterglow would be helpful in pinpointing the source and itsredshift. long before the merger, the binary "hollows out" any surrounding gasand shrinks slowly compared to the viscous timescale of a circumbinary disk.the inner gas disk is truncated at the radius where gravitational torque fromthe binary balances the viscous torque, and accretion onto the black holes isdiminished. initially, the inner truncation radius is able to follow theshrinking binary inward. but eventually the gravitational radiation timescalebecomes shorter than the viscous timescale in the disk, leading to a mergedblack hole surrounded by a hollow disk of gas. we show that the subsequentviscous evolution of the hollow, radiation-pressure dominated disk will createa ~10^{43.5}(m/10^6msun) ergs s^{-1} x-ray source on a timescale\~7(1+z)(m/10^6msun)^{1.32} yr. this justifies follow-up monitoring ofgravitational wave events with next-generation x-ray observatories. analysis ofthe detailed light curve of these afterglows will yield new insights into thesubtle physics of accretion onto massive black holes.

astro-ph;0410364	massive black hole binary evolution	coalescence of binary supermassive black holes (sbhs) would constitute thestrongest sources of gravitational waves to be observed by lisa. while theformation of binary sbhs during galaxy mergers is almost inevitable,coalescence requires that the separation between binary components first dropby a few orders of magnitude, due presumably to interaction of the binary withstars and gas in a galactic nucleus. this article reviews the observationalevidence for binary sbhs and discusses how they would evolve. no completelyconvincing case of a bound, binary sbh has yet been found, although a handfulof systems (e.g. interacting galaxies; remnants of galaxy mergers) are nowbelieved to contain two sbhs at projected separations of roughly one kpc.n-body studies of binary evolution in gas-free galaxies have reached largeenough particle numbers to reproduce the slow, "diffusive" refilling of thebinary's loss cone that is believed to characterize binary evolution in realgalactic nuclei. while some of the results of these simulations -- e.g. thebinary hardening rate and eccentricity evolution -- are strongly $n$-dependent,others -- e.g. the "damage" inflicted by the binary on the nucleus -- are not.luminous early-type galaxies often exhibit depleted cores with masses of 1-2times the mass of their nuclear sbhs, consistent with the predictions of thebinary model. studies of the interaction of massive binaries with gas are stillin their infancy, although much progress is expected in the near future. binarycoalescence has a large influence on the spins of sbhs, even for mass ratios asextreme as 10:1, and evidence of spin-flips may have been observed.

astro-ph;0501325	the acs virgo cluster survey iv: data reduction procedures for surface  brightness fluctuation measurements with the advanced camera for surveys	the advanced camera for surveys (acs) virgo cluster survey is a large programto image 100 early-type virgo galaxies using the f475w and f850lp bandpasses ofthe wide field channel of the acs instrument on the hubble space telescope(hst). the scientific goals of this survey include an exploration of thethree-dimensional structure of the virgo cluster and a critical examination ofthe usefulness of the globular cluster luminosity function as a distanceindicator. both of these issues require accurate distances for the full sampleof 100 program galaxies. in this paper, we describe our data reductionprocedures and examine the feasibility of accurate distance measurements usingthe method of surface brightness fluctuations (sbf) applied to the acs virgocluster survey f850lp imaging. the acs exhibits significant geometricaldistortions due to its off-axis location in the hst focal plane; correcting forthese distortions by resampling the pixel values onto an undistorted frameresults in pixel correlations that depend on the nature of the interpolationkernel used for the resampling. this poses a major challenge for the sbftechnique, which normally assumes a flat power spectrum for the noise. weinvestigate a number of different interpolation kernels and show through ananalysis of simulated galaxy images having realistic noise properties that itis possible, depending on the kernel, to measure sbf distances usingdistortion-corrected acs images without introducing significant additionalerror from the resampling. we conclude by showing examples of real image powerspectra from our survey.

astro-ph;0503566	the acs virgo cluster survey. vii. resolving the connection between  globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies	we investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compactdwarf galaxies (ucds) by examining the properties of several compact objectsassociated with m87, all of which were previously classified as globularclusters. combining imaging from the hubble space telescope with ground-basedkeck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocitydispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictionsof population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately20pc, and have v-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. these objects,which we consider to be ucds, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticalgalaxies in virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities andcolors. these ucds are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations ofgalaxies more closely than those of galactic globular clusters. there appearsto be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of abouttwo million solar masses. if the ucds are gravitationally bound, then wesuggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental propertydistinguishing globular clusters from ucds. more than half of the ucdcandidates uncovered in the acs virgo cluster survey are associated with asingle galaxy -- m87 -- which suggests that proximity to the virgo center maybe of critical importance for the formation of these objects. these resultsshow that distinguishing bonafide ucds from bright globular clusters requires acareful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,particularly their mass-to-light ratios.

astro-ph;0503596	dissipationless merging and the assembly of central galaxies	we reanalyze the galaxy-mass correlation function measured by the sloandigital sky survey to obtain host dark matter halo masses at galaxy and galaxygroup scales. we extend the data to galaxy clusters in the 2mass catalog andstudy the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass. while thecentral galaxy luminosity scales as ~m^{0.7-0.8} at low masses, the relationflattens to ~m^{&lt;0.3} above ~4x10^{13} m_sun. the total luminosity of galaxiesin the halo, however, continues to grow as a power-law ~m^{0.8-0.9}. startingfrom the hypothesis that the central galaxies grow by merging ("galacticcannibalism"), we develop a simple model for the evolution of theirluminosities as a consequence of the accretion of satellite galaxies. theluminosity-mass relation flattens when the time scale on which dynamicalfriction induces orbital decay in the satellite galaxies exceeds the age of thedark matter halo. then, the growth of the central galaxy is suppressed as itcan cannibalize only the rare, massive satellite galaxies. the model takes thedependence of the total luminosity of galaxies in a halo on its mass and theglobal galaxy luminosity function as input, and reproduces the observed centralgalaxy luminosity-mass relation over three decades in halo mass,(10^{12}-10^{15}) m_sun.  the success of the model suggests that gas cooling and subsequent starformation did not play an important role in the final assembly of centralgalaxies from sub-l_star precursors.

astro-ph;0504580	what is l*?: anatomy of the galaxy luminosity function	using the empirical relations between the central galaxy luminosity and thehalo mass, and between the total galaxy luminosity in a halo and the halo mass,we construct the galaxy luminosity function (lf). to the luminosity of thecentral galaxy in a halo of a given mass we assign log-normal scatter with amean calibrated against the observations. in halos where the total galaxyluminosity exceeds that of the central galaxy, satellite galaxies aredistributed as a power-law in luminosity. combined with the halo mass function,this description reproduces the observed characteristics of the galaxy lf,including a shape consistent with the schechter function. when all galaxies areincluded, regardless of the environment or the hubble type, the schechter l* isthe luminosity scale above which the central galaxy luminosity-halo massrelation flattens; l* corresponds to ~10^{13}msun on the halo mass scale. insurveys where central galaxies in massive clusters are neglected, either bydesign or because of the cosmic variance, l* is simply the mean luminosity ofcentral galaxies in halos at the upper end of the selected mass range. thesmooth, exponential decay of the schechter function toward high luminositiesreflects the intrinsic scatter in the central galaxy luminosity-halo massrelation. in addition to the lf, the model successfully reproduces the observeddependence of galaxy clustering bias on luminosity.

astro-ph;0507553	steady-state electrostatic layers from weibel instability in  relativistic collisionless shocks	it is generally accepted that magnetic fields generated in the nonlineardevelopment of the transverse weibel instability provide effectivecollisionality in unmagnetized collisionless shocks. recently, extensive twoand three dimensional simulations improved our understanding of the growth andsaturation of the instability in colliding plasma shells. however, thesteady-state structure of the shock wave transition layers remains poorlyunderstood. we use basic physical considerations and order-of-magnitudearguments to study the steady state structure in relativistic unmagnetizedcollisionless shocks in pair plasmas. the shock contains an electrostatic layerresulting from the formation of stationary, magnetically-focused currentfilaments. the filaments form where the cold upstream plasma and thecounterstreaming thermal plasma interpenetrate. the filaments are not entirelyneutral and strong electrostatic fields are present. most of the downstreamparticles cannot cross this layer into the upstream because they are trapped bythe electrostatic field. we identify the critical location in the shocktransition layer where the electromagnetic field ceases to be static. at thislocation, the degree of charge separation in the filaments reaches a maximumvalue, the current inside the filaments comes close to the alfv\'en limit, andthe phase space distribution function starts to isotropize. we argue that theradius of the current filaments upstream of the critical location is abouttwice the upstream plasma skin depth. finally, we show that some downstreamparticles cross the electrostatic layer and run ahead of the shock into thepreshock medium without causing instability. these particles may play animportant role in particle acceleration.

astro-ph;0508464	weibel filament decay and thermalization in collisionless shocks and  gamma-ray burst afterglows	models for the synchrotron emission of gamma-ray burst afterglows suggestthat the magnetic field is generated in the shock wave that forms asrelativistic ejecta plow through the circum-burst medium. transverse weibelinstability efficiently generates magnetic fields near equipartition with thepost-shock energy density. the detailed saturated state of the instability, asseen in particle-in-cell simulations, consists of magnetically self-pinchedcurrent filaments. the filaments are parallel to the direction of propagationof the shock and are about a plasma skin depth in radius, forming aquasi--two-dimensional structure. we use a rudimentary analytical model toargue that the weibel filaments are unstable to a kink-like mode, whichdestroys their quasi--two-dimensional structure. for wavelengths longer thanthan the skin depth, the instability grows at the rate equal to the speed oflight divided by the wavelength. we calculate the transport of collisionlesstest particles in the filaments experiencing the instability and show that theparticles diffuse in energy. this diffusion marks the beginning ofthermalization in the shock transition layer, and causes initial magnetic fielddecay as particles escape from the filaments. we discuss the implications ofthese results for the structure of the shock and the polarization of theafterglow.

astro-ph;0509647	cluster merger variance and the luminosity gap statistic	the presence of multiple luminous galaxies in clusters can be explained bythe finite time over which a galaxy sinks to the center of the cluster andmerges with the the central galaxy. the simplest measurable statistic toquantify the dynamical age of a system of galaxies is the luminosity(magnitude) gap, which is the difference in photometric magnitude between thetwo most luminous galaxies. we present a simple analytical estimate of theluminosity gap distribution in groups and clusters as a function of dark matterhalo mass. the luminosity gap is used to define "fossil" groups; we expect thefraction of fossil systems to exhibit a strong and model-independent trend withmass: ~1-3% of massive clusters and ~5-40% of groups should be fossil systems.we also show that, on cluster scales, the observed intrinsic scatter in thecentral galaxy luminosity-halo mass relation can be ascribed to dispersion inthe merger histories of satellites within the cluster. we compare ourpredictions to the luminosity gap distribution in a sample of 730 clusters inthe sloan digital sky survey c4 catalog and find good agreement. this suggeststhat theoretical excursion set merger probabilities and the standard theory ofdynamical segregation are valid on cluster scales.

astro-ph;0509654	the acs virgo cluster survey ix: the color distributions of globular  cluster systems in early-type galaxies	we present the color distributions of globular cluster (gc) systems for 100virgo cluster early-type galaxies observed in the acs virgo cluster survey. thecolor distributions of individual gc systems are consistent with continuoustrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. on average, almostall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor gcs, with the average fractionof metal-rich gcs ranging from 15 to 60%. the colors of both subpopulationscorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red gcs having asteeper slope. to convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary(g-z)-[fe/h] relation calibrated to galactic, m49 and m87 gcs. this relation isnonlinear with a steeper slope for [fe/h] &lt; -0.8. as a result, themetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich gcs vary similarly with respectto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [fe/h]_mp ~ l^0.16 ~m_star^0.17 and [fe/h]_mr ~ l^0.26 ~ m_star^0.22, respectively. although theserelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by windmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to themass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. theoffset between the two gc populations varies slowly (~ m_star^0.05) and isapproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting anearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the twopopulations of gcs. we also find that although the metal-rich gcs show a largerdispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor gcs* that have an equal or largerdispersion in metallicity. like the color-magnitude relation, these relationsderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formationand evolution of early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0511251	the acs virgo cluster survey xi. the nature of diffuse star clusters in  early-type galaxies	we use hst/acs imaging of 100 early-type galaxies in the acs virgo clustersurvey to investigate the nature of diffuse star clusters (dscs). compared toglobular clusters (gcs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities(m_v &gt; -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 &lt; r_h &lt; 30 pc), but they areprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can bemore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical gc (mu_g &gt; 20 mag arcsec^-2).the median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 &lt; g-z &lt; 1.6,which is redder than metal-rich gcs and often as red as the galaxy itself. mostdsc systems thus have mean ages older than 5 gyr or else have super-solarmetallicities. we find that 12 galaxies in our sample contain a significantexcess of diffuse star cluster candidates -- nine are lenticulars (s0s), andfive visibly contain dust. we also find a substantial population of dscs in thehalo of the giant elliptical m49, associated with the companion galaxy vcc1199. most dsc systems appear to be both aligned with the galaxy light andassociated with galactic disks, but at the same time many lenticulars do nothost substantial dsc populations. diffuse star clusters in our sample sharesimilar characteristics to those identified in other nearby lenticular, spiral,and dwarf galaxies, and we suggest that dscs preferentially form, survive, andcoevolve with galactic disks. their properties are broadly consistent withthose of merged star cluster complexes, and we note that despite being 3 - 5magnitudes brighter than dscs, ultra-compact dwarfs have similar surfacebrightnesses. the closest galactic analogs to the dscs are the old openclusters. we suggest that if a diffuse star cluster population did exist in thedisk of the milky way, it would be very difficult to find.

astro-ph;0512548	the cosmic ray precursor of relativistic collisionless shocks: a missing  link in gamma-ray burst afterglows	collisionless shocks are commonly argued to be the sites of cosmic ray (cr)acceleration. we study the influence of crs on weakly magnetized relativisticcollisionless shocks and apply our results to external shocks in gamma-rayburst (grb) afterglows. the common view is that the transverse weibelinstability (twi) generates a small-scale magnetic field that facilitatescollisional coupling and thermalization in the shock transition. the twi fieldis expected to decay rapidly, over a finite number of proton plasma skin depthsfrom the transition. however, the synchrotron emission in grb afterglowssuggests that a strong and persistent magnetic field is present in the plasmathat crosses the shock; the origin of this field is a key open question. herewe suggest that the common picture involving twi demands revision. namely, thecrs drive turbulence in the shock upstream on scales much larger than the skindepth. this turbulence generates a large-scale magnetic field that quenches twiand produces a magnetized shock. the new field efficiently confines crs andenhances the acceleration efficiency. the crs modify the shocks in grbafterglows at least while they remain relativistic. the origin of the magneticfield that gives rise to the synchrotron emission is plausibly in the cr-driventurbulence. we do not expect ultrahigh energy cosmic ray production in externalgrb shocks.

astro-ph;0602289	contribution of stellar tidal disruptions to the x-ray luminosity  function of active galaxies	the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei has been measured down toluminosities ~10^{42} erg/s in the soft and hard x-rays. some fraction of thisactivity is associated with the accretion of the material liberated by thetidal disruption of stars by massive black holes. we estimate the contributionto the x-ray luminosity function from the tidal disruption process. while thecontribution depends on a number poorly known parameters, it appears that itcan account for the majority of x-ray selected agn with soft or hard x-rayluminosities &lt;~10^{43}-10^{44} erg/s. if this is correct, a picture emerges inwhich a significant portion of the x-ray luminosity function of agn iscomprised of sources powered by tidal-disruption at the faint end, while thesources at the bright end are powered by non-stellar accretion. black holeswith masses &lt;~2x10^6 msun could have acquired most of their present mass by anaccretion of tidal debris. in view of the considerable theoretical uncertaintyconcerning the detailed shape of the light curves of tidal disruption events,we focus on power-law luminosity decay (as identified in candidate tidaldisruption events), but we also discuss constant accretion rate models.

astro-ph;0602297	the acs virgo cluster survey. vi. isophotal analysis and the structure  of early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the morphology, isophotalparameters and surface brightness profiles for 100 early-type members of thevirgo cluster, from dwarfs (m_b = -15.1 mag) to giants (m_b = -21.8 mag). eachgalaxy has been imaged in two filters, closely resembling the sloan g and zpassbands, using the advanced camera for surveys on board the hubble spacetelescope.  dust and complex morphological structures are common, with kiloparsec-scalestellar disks, bars, and nuclear stellar disks seen in 60% of galaxies withintermediate luminosity (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -17), and dust seen in 42% of galaxiesbrighter than m_b = -18.9 mag. dust morphologies range from faint wisps andpatches on tens of parsec scales, to regular, highly organized kpc-scale dustdisks, often showing evidence of recent star formation.  surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters are derived typicallywithin 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for thefaintest systems, with a resolution (fwhm) of 7 pc. based on a parametrizationof the surface brightness profiles in terms of a sersic or core-sersic model,we find that 1) there is no evidence of a bimodal behavior of the slope, gamma,of the profile in the innermost regions; 2) although the brightest galaxieshave shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles (lowest gamma values) arefound in faint dwarf systems; 3) the widely adopted separation of early-typegalaxies between "core" and "power-law" types, which had originally beenprompted by the claim of a clear bimodal distribution of gamma values, isuntenable; and 4) there is no evidence of a structural dichothomy between dwarfand regular ellipticals.

astro-ph;0603252	the acs virgo cluster survey. viii. the nuclei of early-type galaxies	(abridged) the acs virgo cluster survey is an hst program to obtainhigh-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the virgocluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. based on this large,homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency ofnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -15 (66 &lt; f_n &lt; 82%), andfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center ofvirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. resolved stellar nuclei are notpresent in galaxies brighter than m_b ~ -20.5, however, there is no clearevidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence ofnucleation, for a change at m_b ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point betweendwarf and giant galaxies. on average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than atypical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. nuclearluminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than m_b ~-17.6, nuclear colors. comparing the nuclei to the "nuclear clusters" found inlate-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosityand overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is ratherinsensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. the meannuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the meansbh-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detectedsupermassive black holes (sbhs). we argue that compact stellar nuclei might bethe low-mass counterparts of the sbhs detected in the bright galaxies, and thatone should think in terms of "central massive objects" -- either sbhs orcompact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-typegalaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.

0809.2404	accretion onto seed black holes in the first galaxies	the validity of the hypothesis that the massive black holes in high redshiftquasars grew from stellar-sized "seeds" is contingent on a seed's ability todouble its mass every few ten million years. this requires that the seedaccrete at approximately the eddington-limited rate. in the specific case ofradiatively efficient quasiradial accretion in a metal-poor protogalacticmedium, for which the bondi accretion rate is often prescribed in cosmologicalsimulations of massive black hole formation, we examine the effects of theradiation emitted near the black hole's event horizon on the structure of thesurrounding gas flow. we find that the radiation pressure from photoionizationsignificantly reduces the steady-state accretion rate and renders thequasiradial accretion flow unsteady and inefficient. the time-averagedaccretion rates are a small fraction of the eddington-limited accretion ratefor thomson scattering. the pressure of ly-alpha photons trapped near the hiiregion surrounding the black hole may further attenuate the inflow. theseresults suggest that an alternative to quasiradial, radiatively efficientbondi-like accretion should be sought to explain the rapid growth ofquasar-progenitor seed black holes.
