0706.2337	the extended structure of the remote cluster b514 in m31. detection of  extra-tidal stars	we present a study of the density profile of the remote m31 globular clusterb514, obtained from hst/acs observations. coupling the analysis of thedistribution of the integrated light with star counts we can reliably followthe profile of the cluster out to r~35", corresponding to ~130pc. the profileis well fitted, out to ~15 core radii, by a king model having c=1.65. with anestimated core radius r_c=0.38", this corresponds to a tidal radius of r_t~17"(~65pc). we find that both the light and the star counts profiles show adeparture from the best fit king model for r&gt;~8" - as a surface brightnessexcess at large radii, and the star counts profile shows a clear break incorrespondence of the estimated tidal radius. both features are interpreted asthe signature of the presence of extratidal stars around the cluster. we alsoshow that b514 has a half-light radius significantly larger than ordinaryglobular clusters of the same luminosity. in the m_v vs. log r_h plane, b514lies in a region inhabited by peculiar clusters, like omega cen, g1, ngc2419and others, as well as by the nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies.

0904.0571	the non-peculiar velocity dispersion profile of the stellar system omega  centauri	we present the results of a survey of radial velocities over a wide regionextending from r~10 arcmin out to r~80 arcmin (~1.5 tidal radii) within themassive star cluster omega centauri. the survey was performed with flames@vlt,to study the velocity dispersion profile in the outer regions of this stellarsystem. we derived accurate radial velocities for a sample of 2557 newlyobserved stars, identifying 318 bona-fide cluster red giants. merging our datawith those provided by pancino et al. (2007), we assembled a final homogeneoussample of 946 cluster members that allowed us to trace the velocity dispersionprofile from the center out to r~32 arcmin. the velocity dispersion appears todecrease monotonically over this range, from a central value of sigma_{v}~17.2km/s down to a minimum value of sigma_{v}~5.2 km/s. the observed surfacebrightness profile, rotation curve, velocity dispersion profile and ellipticityprofile are simultaneously well reproduced by a simple dynamical model in whichmass follows light, within the classical newtonian theory of gravitation. thecomparison with an n-body model of the evolution of a system mimicking omegacen during the last 10 orbits into the galactic potential suggests that (a) therotation of stars lying in the inner ~20 arcmin of the clusters is not due tothe effects of the tidal field of the milky way, as hypothized by otherauthors, and (b) the overall observational scenario is still compatible withthe possibility that the outer regions of the cluster are subject to some tidalstirring.

0910.1299	on the origin of the helium-rich population in omega centauri	to study the possible origin of the huge helium enrichment attributed to thestars on the blue main sequence of omega centauri, we make use of a chemicalevolution model that has proven able to reproduce other major observedproperties of the cluster, namely, its stellar metallicity distributionfunction, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios withmetallicity. in this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the availableobservational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a muchmore massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosionsin a shallow potential well. this galactic wind must carry out preferentiallythe metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereaselements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar windsby both asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars and massive stars must be mostlyretained. assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both agb starsand fast rotating massive stars (frmss), the interstellar medium of omegacentauri's parent galaxy gets naturally enriched in helium in the course of itsevolution.

1002.1972	bolometric correction and spectral energy distribution of cool stars in  galactic clusters	we have investigated the relevant trend of the bolometric correction (bc) atthe cool-temperature regime of red giant stars and its possible dependence onstellar metallicity. our analysis relies on a wide sample of optical-infraredspectroscopic observations, along the 3500a-2.5micron wavelength range, for agrid of 92 red giant stars in five (3 globular + 2 open) galactic clusters,along the -2.2&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.4 metallicity range. bolometric magnitudes have beenfound within an internal accuracy of a few percent. making use of our newdatabase, we provide a set of fitting functions for the v and k bc vs. teff andbroad-band colors, valid over the interval 3300k&lt;teff&lt;5000k, especially suitedfor red giants. no evident drift of both bc(v) and bc(k) with [fe/h] is found.things may be different, however, for the b-band correction, given a clear(b-v) vs. [fe/h] correlation in place for our data, with metal-poor starsdisplaying a "bluer" (b-v) with respect to the metal-rich sample, for fixedteff. our empirical bolometric scale supports the conclusion that (a) bc(k)from the most recent studies are reliable within &lt;0.1 mag over the wholecolor/temperature range considered in this paper, and (b) the same conclusionapply to bc(v) only for stars warmer than ~3800k. at cooler temperatures theagreement is less general, and marcs models are the only ones providing asatisfactory match to observations.

1111.2688	na-o anticorrelation and hb. ix. kinematics of the program clusters. a  link between systemic rotation and hb morphology?	we use accurate radial velocities for 1981 member stars in 20 galacticglobular clusters, collected within our large survey aimed at the analysis ofthe na-o anti-correlation, to study the internal kinematics of the clusters. weperformed the first systematic exploration of the possible connections betweencluster kinematics and the multiple populations phenomenon in gcs. we did notfind any significant correlation between na abundance and either velocitydispersion or systemic rotation. we searched for systemic rotation in the eightclusters of our sample that lack such analysis from previous works in theliterature (ngc2808, ngc5904, ngc6171, ngc6254, ngc6397, ngc6388, ngc6441, andngc6838). these clusters are found to span a large range of rotationalamplitudes, from ~0.0 km/s (ngc6397) to ~13.0 km/s (ngc6441). we found asignificant correlation between the ratio of rotational velocity to centralvelocity dispersion (v_{rot}/sigma_0) and the horizontal branch morphologyparameter (b-r)/(b+r+v). v_{rot}/sigma_0 is found to correlate also withmetallicity, possibly hinting to a significant role of dissipation in theprocess of formation of globular clusters. v_{rot} is found to correlate wellwith (b-r)/(b+r+v), m_v, sigma_0 and [fe/h]. all these correlations stronglysuggest that systemic rotation may be intimately linked with the processes thatled to the formation of globular clusters and the stellar populations theyhost.

1201.3715	blood ties: the real nature of the lmc binary globular clusters ngc 2136  and ngc 2137	we have used a sample of high-resolution spectra obtained with themulti-fiber facility flames at the very large telescope of the europeansouthern observatory, to derive the kinematical and chemical properties of thetwo young large magellanic cloud globular clusters ngc 2136 and ngc 2137. thesetwo clusters represent a typical example of lmc cluster pair suspected to bebound in a binary system: indeed the cluster centers of gravity have an angularseparation of less than 1.4 arcmin in the sky. the spectral analysis of sevengiants in ngc 2136 and four in ngc 2137 reveals that the two clusters sharevery similar systemic radial velocities, namely vrad=271.5\pm0.4 km/s(sigma=1.0 km/s) and vrad=270.6\pm0.5 km/s (sigma=0.9 km/s) for ngc 2136 andngc 2137, respectively, and they have also indistinguishable abundancepatterns. the iron content is [fe/h]=-0.40\pm0.01 dex (sigma=0.03 dex) for ngc2136 and -0.39\pm0.01 dex (sigma=0.01 dex) for ngc 2137, while the [alpha/fe]ratios are roughly solar in both clusters. these findings suggest that the twoclusters are gravitationally bound and that they formed from the fragmentationof the same molecular cloud that was chemically homogeneous. this is the firstfirm confirmation of the binary nature of a lmc cluster pair. the most likelyfate of this system is to merge into a single structure in a time-scalecomparable with its orbital period.

1203.3024	the luminosity function and stellar mass to light ratio of the massive  globular cluster ngc2419	we used archival hubble space telescope wfc3 images to obtain the luminosityfunction of the remote globular cluster ngc2419 from two magnitudes above thehorizontal branch level down to \sim3.0 magnitudes below the turn off point (tom_i\sim6.4), approximately covering the range of initial stellar masses 0.5m_sun&lt;= m &lt;= 0.9 m_sun. the completeness-corrected luminosity function does notdisplay any change of shape over the radial range covered by the wfc3 data, outto ~6 core radii (r_c), or, equivalently, to ~2 half-light radii. theluminosity function in this radial range is also identical to that obtainedfrom ground based data at much larger distances from the cluster centre(12r_c&lt;= r&lt;= 22r_c), in the magnitude range in which the two distributionsoverlap (m_i&lt;= 4.0). these results support the conclusion by dalessandro et al.that there is no significant mass segregation among cluster stars, hence thestellar mass-to-light ratio remains constant with distance from the clustercentre. we fitted the observed luminosity function with theoreticalcounterparts with the proper age and metallicity from different sets of stellarevolution models and we consistently derive a total v band mass-to-light ratio1.2&lt;= m/l_v&lt;= 1.7, by extrapolating to the hydrogen burning limit, with abest-fit value m/l_v=1.5 +/- 0.1. on the other hand, assuming that there are nocluster stars with m&lt;= 0.3 m_sun, we establish a robust lower limit m/l_v&gt; 0.8.these estimates provide useful constraints for dynamical models of the clusterthat were forced to consider the stellar mass-to-light ratio as a (nearly) freeparameter.

1208.0195	news from the galactic suburbia: the chemical composition of the remote  globular cluster ngc 2419	we present the chemical analysis of 49 giant stars of the globular clusterngc 2419, using medium resolution spectra collected with the multi-objectspectrograph deimos@keck. previous analysis of this cluster revealed a largedispersion in the line strength of the infrared ca ii triplet, suggesting anintrinsic star-to-star scatter in its fe or ca content. from our analysis, weassess that all the investigated stars share the same [fe/h], [ca/fe] and[ti/fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in mg and k abundances isdetected. the distribution of [mg/fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observedtargets having subsolar [mg/fe], down to [mg/fe] ~ -1 dex, a level ofmg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. it is found that thelarge dispersion in mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observeddispersion of the ca ii triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneouslyinterpreted in terms of fe or ca abundance scatter) because mg plays a relevantrole in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor. a strong depletionin the mg abundance leads to an increase of the line strength of the ca iitriplet, due to the variation in the electronic pressure, at a constant fe andca abundance. finally, we detect an anti-correlation between mg and kabundances, not easily explainable within the framework of the currentnucleosynthesis models.

1209.2130	the horizontal branch morphology of m31 globular clusters. extreme  second parameter effect in outer halo clusters	we use deep, high quality colour magnitude diagrams obtained with the hubblespace telescope to compute a simplified version of the mironov index [smi;b/(b+r)] to parametrize the horizontal branch (hb) morphology for 23 globularclusters in the m31 galaxy (sample-a), all located in the outer halo atprojected distances between 10 kpc and 100 kpc. this allows us to compare themwith their galactic counterparts, for which we estimated the smi exactly in thesame way, in the smi vs. [fe/h] plane. we find that the majority of theconsidered m31 clusters lie in a significantly different locus, in this plane,with respect to galactic clusters lying at any distance from the center of themilky way. in particular they have redder hb morphologies at a givenmetallicity, or, in other words, clusters with the same smi value are ~0.4 dexmore metal rich in the milky way than in m31. we discuss the possible origin ofthis difference and we conclude that the most likely explanation is that manyglobular clusters in the outer halo of m31 formed ~1-2 gyr later than theircounterparts in the outer halo of the milky way, while differences in thecluster-to-cluster distribution of he abundance of individual stars may alsoplay a role. the analysis of another sample of 25 bright m31 clusters (eighteenof them with m_v&lt;= -9.0, sample-b), whose smi estimates are much more uncertainas they are computed on shallow colour magnitude diagrams, suggests thatextended blue hb tails can be relatively frequent among the most massive m31globular clusters, possibly hinting at the presence of multiple populations.

1305.3181	the double rgb in m 2: c, n, sr and ba abundances	the globular cluster m 2 has a photometrically detected double red giantbranch (rgb) sequence. we investigate here the chemical differences between thetwo rgbs in order to gain insight in the star formation history of thiscluster. the low-resolution spectra, covering the blue spectral range, werecollected with the mods spectrograph on the lbt, and analyzed via spectrumsynthesis technique. the high quality of the spectra allows us to measure c, n,ba, and sr abundances relative to iron for 15 rgb stars distributed along thetwo sequences. we add to the mods sample c and n measurements for 35 additionalstars belonging to the blue rgb sequence, presented in lardo et al. (2012). wefind a clear separation between the two groups of stars in s-process elementsas well as c and n content. both groups display a c-n anti-correlation and thered rgb stars are on average richer in c and n with respect to the blue rgb.our results reinforce the suggestion that m2 belongs to the family of globularclusters with complex star formation history, together with omega cen, ngc1851, and m 22.

1307.4085	ngc 362: another globular cluster with a split red giant branch	we obtained flames giraffe+uves spectra for both first and second-generationred giant branch (rgb) stars in the globular cluster (gc) ngc 362 and used themto derive abundances of 21 atomic species for a sample of 92 stars. thesurveyed elements include proton-capture (o, na, mg, al, si), alpha-capture(ca, ti), fe-peak (sc, v, mn, co, ni, cu), and neutron-capture elements (y, zr,ba, la, ce, nd, eu, dy). the analysis is fully consistent with that presentedfor twenty gcs in previous papers of this series. stars in ngc 362 seem to beclustered into two discrete groups along the na-o anti-correlation, with a gapat [o/na] 0 dex. na-rich, second generation stars show a trend to be morecentrally concentrated, although the level of confidence is not very high. whencompared to the classical second-parameter twin ngc 288, with similarmetallicity, but different horizontal branch type and much lower total mass,the proton-capture processing in stars of ngc 362 seems to be more extreme,confirming previous analysis. we discovered the presence of a secondary rgbsequence, redder than the bulk of the rgb: a preliminary estimate shows thatthis sequence comprises about 6% of rgb stars. our spectroscopic data andliterature photometry indicate that this sequence is populated almostexclusively by giants rich in ba, and probably rich in all s-process elements,as found in other clusters. in this regards, ngc 362 joins previously studiedgcs like ngc 1851, ngc 6656 (m 22), and ngc 7089 (m 2).

1308.5810	deep multi-telescope photometry of ngc 5466. i. blue stragglers and  binary systems	we present a detailed investigation of the radial distribution of bluestraggler star and binary populations in the galactic globular cluster ngc5466, over the entire extension of the system. we used a combination of dataacquired with the acs on board the hubble space telescope, the lbc-blue mountedon the large binocular telescope, and megacam on the canadian-france-hawaiitelescope. blue straggler stars show a bimodal distribution with a mild centralpeak and a quite internal minimum. this feature is interpreted in terms of arelatively young dynamical age in the framework of the "dynamical clock"concept proposed by ferraro et al. (2012). the estimated fraction of binariesis 6-7% in the central region (r&lt;90") and slightly lower (5.5%) in theoutskirts, at r&gt;200". quite interestingly, the comparison with the results ofmilone et al. (2012) suggests that also binary systems may display a bimodalradial distribution, with the position of the minimum consistent with that ofblue straggler stars. if confirmed, this feature would give additional supportto the scenario where the radial distribution of objects more massive than theaverage cluster stars is primarily shaped by the effect of dynamical friction.moreover, this would also be consistent with the idea that the unperturbedevolution of primordial binaries could be the dominant bss formation process inlow-density environments.

(2006) basedon the anomalous chemical composition of a single cluster giant. we obtainaccurate abundances for a large number of elements and we find that: (a) thesix target stars have the same chemical composition within the uncertainties,except for na and al; (b) the average cluster abundance of \alpha\ elements(with the only exception of si) is nearly solar, at odds with typical halostars and globular clusters of similar metallicity; (c) y, ba, la and euabundances are also significantly lower than in galactic field stars and starclusters of similar metallicity. hence we confirm the lee et al. classificationof ngc 5694 as a cluster of extra-galactic origin. we provide the first insighton the na-o and mg-al anti-correlations in this cluster: all the consideredstars have very similar abundance ratios for these elements, except one thathas significantly lower [na/fe] and [al/fe] ratios, suggesting that some degreeof early self-enrichment has occurred also in this cluster.

0802.2613	the blue straggler population in the globular cluster m53 (ngc5024): a  combined hst, lbt, cfht study	we used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution and wide fieldmulti-wavelength observations collected at three different telescopes (hst, lbtand cfht) to probe blue straggler star (bss) populations in the globularcluster m53. almost 200 bss have been identified over the entire clusterextension. the radial distribution of these stars has been found to be bimodal(similarly to that of several other clusters) with a prominent dip at ~60'' (~2r_c) from the cluster center. this value turns out to be a factor of twosmaller than the radius of avoidance (r_avoid, the radius within which all thestars of ~1.2 m_sun have sunk to the core because of dynamical friction effectsin an hubble time). while in most of the clusters with a bimodal bss radialdistribution, r_avoid has been found to be located in the region of theobserved minimum, this is the second case (after ngc6388) where thisdiscrepancy is noted. this evidence suggests that in a few clusters thedynamical friction seems to be somehow less efficient than expected.  we have also used this data base to construct the radial star density profileof the cluster: this is the most extended and accurate radial profile everpublished for this cluster, including detailed star counts in the very innerregion. the star density profile is reproduced by a standard king model with anextended core (~25'') and a modest value of the concentration parameter(c=1.58). a deviation from the model is noted in the most external region ofthe cluster (at r&gt;6.5' from the center). this feature needs to be furtherinvestigated in order to address the possible presence of a tidal tail in thiscluster.

1501.03161	potassium: a new actor on the globular cluster chemical evolution stage.  the case of ngc 2808	we derive [k/fe] abundance ratios for 119 stars in the globular cluster ngc2808, all of them having o, na, mg and al abundances homogeneously measured inprevious works. we detect an intrinsic star-to-star spread in the potassiumabundance. moreover [k/fe] abundance ratios display statistically significantcorrelations with [na/fe] and [al/fe], and anti-correlations with [o/fe] and[mg/fe]. all the four mg deficient stars ([mg/fe]&lt;0.0) discovered so far in ngc2808 are enriched in k by ~0.3 dex with respect to those with normal [mg/fe].ngc 2808 is the second globular cluster, after ngc 2419, where a clear mg-kanti-correlation is detected, albeit of weaker amplitude. the simultaneouscorrelation/anti-correlation of [k/fe] with all the light elements usuallyinvolved in the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars, stronglysupport the idea that these abundance patterns are due to the sameself-enrichment mechanism that produces na-o and mg-al anti-correlations. thisfinding suggests that detectable spreads in k abundances may be typical in themassive globular clusters where the self-enrichment processes are observed toproduce their most extreme manifestations.

1501.06305	hii regions within a compact high velocity cloud. a nearly star-less  dwarf galaxy?	within the secco survey we identified a candidate stellar counterpart to theultra compact high velocity cloud (uchvc) hvc274.68+74.70-123, that wassuggested by adams et al. (2013) as a possible mini-halo within the local groupof galaxies. the spectroscopic follow-up of the brightest sources within thecandidate reveals the presence of two hii regions whose radial velocity iscompatible with physical association with the uvhvc. the available data doesnot allow us to give a definite answer on the nature of the newly identifiedsystem. a few alternative hypotheses are discussed. however, the most likelypossibility is that we have found a new faint dwarf galaxy residing in thevirgo cluster of galaxies, which we name secco-1. independently of its actualdistance, secco-1 displays a ratio of neutral hydrogen mass to v luminosity ofm_{hi}/l_v&gt;= 20, by far the largest among local dwarfs. hence, it appears as anearly star-less galaxy and it may be an example of the missing links betweennormal dwarfs and the dark mini halos that are predicted to exist in largenumbers according to the currently accepted cosmological model.

astro-ph;0003222	new evidence for the complex struscture of the rgb of omega cen	we report on the complex structure of the red giant branch (rgb) of omegacen, based on a new wide field and wide color baseline b and i photometry. ourcolor magnitude diagram (cmd) shows the presence of multiple populations alongthis branch, in particular we discovered an anomalous branch (rgb-a), whichappears to be well separated from the bulk of the rgb stars. on the basis ofour cmd and from the previous literature we conclude that (1) these stars,clearly identified as a separate population in our cmd, represent the extrememetal rich extension ([ca/h]&gt;-0.3) of the stellar content of omega cen, andshow anomalous abundances of s-process elements (as ba and zr) as well; (2)they are physical members of the omega cen system; (3) they comprise ~ 5% ofthe stars of the whole system; (4) this component and the metal-intermediateone (-0.4&gt;[ca/h]&gt;-1) have been found to share the same spatial distribution,both of them differing significantly from the most metal poor one ([ca/h]&lt;-1).this last evidence supports the hypothesis that metal rich components couldbelong to an independent (proto?) stellar system captured in the past by omegacen.

astro-ph;0104114	a step toward the calibration of the rgb tip as a standard candle	the absolute i magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch m_i(trgb) is oneof the most promising standard candles actually used in astrophysics as afundamental pillar for the cosmological distance scale. with the aim ofimproving the observational basis of its calibration, we have obtained anaccurate estimate of the m_i(trgb) for the globular cluster omega centauri,based (a) on the largest photometric database ever assembled for a globular, bypancino et al.(2000), and (b) on a direct distance estimate for omega cen,recently obtained by thompson et al.(2001) from a detached eclipsing binary.the derived value m_i(trgb) =-4.04\pm 0.12 provides, at present, the mostaccurate empirical zero-point for the calibration of the m_i(trgb) - [fe/h]relation, at [fe/h] ~ -1.7. we also derived a new empirical m_i(trgb) - [fe/h]relation, based on the large ir dataset of red giants in galactic globularclusters recently presented by ferraro et al.(2000). this database (extendingup to [fe/h]=-0.2) covers a more appropriate metallicity range, forextragalactic applications, than previous empirical calibrations (limited to[fe/h]&lt;= -0.7). the proposed relation is in excellent agreement with the newlydetermined zero-point.

astro-ph;0109073	age as the second parameter in ngc 288/ngc 362? ii. the horizontal  branch revisited	we revisit the "second parameter" pair of globular clusters ngc 288/ngc 362on the basis of theoretical models for red giant branch (rgb) and horizontalbranch (hb) stars. the results of the most extensive set of rgb/hb simulationscomputed so far for these clusters are presented for two differentmetallicities. using several different analytical mass loss formulae for rgbstars, we derive relative "hb morphology ages." we compare them with therelative main-sequence turnoff ages derived by application of the "bridge test"by bellazzini et al. (2001), who found that ngc 288 is 2+/-1 gyr older than ngc362. we find that adoption of a higher metallicity ([fe/h] ~ -1.2), as favoredby the carretta &amp; gratton metallicity scale, makes age a much more plausiblesecond parameter candidate for this pair than is the case when a lowermetallicity ([fe/h] ~ -1.5), closer to the zinn &amp; west scale, is adopted.however, while the different hb morphology of these two clusters can bereproduced by canonical hb models with [fe/h] ~ -1.2 and an age difference of 2gyr, this explanation is not without difficulty. in particular, we confirmprevious suggestions that canonical models are unable to reproduce the detailedhb morphology of ngc 288 at its red end, for as yet unknown reasons. finally,we show that the mass dispersion on the hb of ngc 362 is substantially largerthan for ngc 288, and suggest that there is a correlation between the massdispersion on the hb phase and the central density of globular clusters. thisis presumably related to the way environmental effects affect rgb mass loss.[abridged]

astro-ph;0202397	high resolution spectroscopy of metal rich giants in omega cen: first  indication of sne ia enrichment	we have obtained high-resolution, high s/n spectra for six red giants inomega cen: three belonging to the recently discovered, metal-rich red giantbranch (rgb-a, pancino et al. 2000) and three to the metal intermediatepopulation (rgb-mint). accurate iron, copper and alpha-elements (ca and si)abundances have been derived and discussed. in particular, we have obtained thefirst direct abundance determination based on high-resolution spectroscopy forthe rgb-a population, &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.60+/-0.15. although this value is lower thanprevious estimates based on calcium triplet measurements, we confirm that thispopulation is the most metal rich in omega cen. in addition, we have found asignificant difference in the alpha-elements enhancement of the twopopulations. the three rgb-mint stars have the expected overabundance, typicalof halo and globular clusters stars: &lt;[alpha/fe]&gt;=+0.29+/-0.01. the three rgb-astars show, instead, a significantly lower alpha-enhancement:&lt;[alpha/fe]&gt;=+0.10+/-0.04. we have also detected an increasing trend of [cu/fe]with metallicity, similar to the one observed for field stars by sneden et al.(1991). the observational facts presented in this letter, if confirmed bylarger samples of giants, are the first indication that supernovae type iaejecta have contaminated the medium from which the metal rich rgb-a stars haveformed. the implications for current scenarios on the formation and evolutionof omega cen are briefly discussed.

(abridged) we demonstrate that the inner region of umi issignificantly structured, at odds with what expected for a system in dynamicalequilibrium. in particular we show that the main density peak of umi isoff-centered with respect to the center of symmetry of the whole galaxy and itshows a much lower ellipticity with respect to the rest of the galaxy.moreover, umi stars are shown to be clustered according to two differentcharacteristic clustering scales, as opposite to draco, which instead has avery symmetric and smooth density profile. the possible consequences of thisstriking structural difference on our ideas about galaxy formation are brieflydiscussed. combining our distance modulus with the more recent estimates of thetotal luminosity of umi, we find that the mass to light (m/l) ratio of thisgalaxy may be as low as m/l ~ 7, a factor 5-10 lower than current estimates.

(1999) and pancino et al.(2000). however, under this assumption the interpretation of the sgb-a does noteasily fit into the context of a self-enrichment scenario within omega cen. infact, its to magnitude, shape and extension are not compatible with a young,metal-rich population, as required by the self-enrichment process. the to levelof the sgb-a suggests indeed an age as old as the main cluster population,further supporting the extra-cluster origin of the most metal rich stars, assuggested by ferraro, bellazzini &amp; pancino (2002). only accurate measurementsof radial velocities and metal abundances for a representative sample of starswill firmly establish whether or not the sgb-a is actually related to the rgb-aand will finally shed light on the origin of the metal rich population of omegacen.

astro-ph;0407391	why the canis major overdensity is not due to the warp: analysis of its  radial profile and velocities	in response to criticism by momany et al. (2004), that therecently-identified canis major (cma) overdensity could be simply explained bythe galactic warp, we present proof of the existence of a stellar population inthe direction of cma that cannot be explained by known galactic components. byanalyzing the radial distribution of counts of m-giant stars in this direction,we show that the momany et al. (2004) warp model overestimates the number ofstars in the northern hemisphere, hence hiding the cma feature in the south.the use of a better model of the warp has little influence on the morphology ofthe overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a distanceof d=7.2\pm 0.3 kpc. to lend further support to the existence of a populationthat does not belong to the galactic disc, we present radial velocities ofm-giant stars in the centre of the cma structure that were obtained with the2df spectrograph at the aat. the extra population shows a radial velocity ofvr=109\pm4 km/s, which is significantly higher than the typical velocity of thedisc at the distance of cma. this population also has a low dispersion (13\pm4km/s). the canis major overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due tothe galactic warp, adding weight to the hypothesis that we are observing adisrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants. this leads to questions on what partof cma was previously identified as the warp and how to possibly disentanglethe two structures.

astro-ph;0503188	massive young clusters in the disc of m31	we have studied the properties of a sample of 67 very blue and likely youngmassive clusters in m31 extracted from the bologna revised catalog of globularclusters, selected according to their color [(b-v) &lt; 0.45] and/or to thestrength of their hbeta spectral index (hbeta &gt; 3.5 a). their existence in m31has been noted by several authors in the past; we show here that these blueluminous compact clusters (blccs) are a significant fraction (&gt;~ 15%) of thewhole globular cluster system of m31. compared to the global properties of them31 globular cluster system, they appear to be intrinsically fainter,morphologically less concentrated, and with a shallower balmer jump andenhanced $h\beta$ absorption in their spectra.  empirical comparison with integrated properties of clusters with known age aswell as with theoretical ssp models consistently indicate that their typicalage is less than ~2 gyr, while they probably are not so metal-poor as deducedif considered to be old. either selecting blccs by their (b-v) colors or by thestrength of their hbeta index the cluster sample turns out to be distributedonto the outskirts of m31 disc, sharing the kinematical properties of the thin,rapidly rotating disc component.  if confirmed to be young and not metal-poor, these clusters indicate theoccurrence of a significant recent star formation in the thin disc of m31,although they do not set constraints on the epoch of its early formation.

astro-ph;0503705	a radial velocity survey of low galactic latitude structures: i.  kinematics of the canis major dwarf galaxy	as part of a radial velocity survey of low galactic latitude structures thatwe undertook with the 2df spectrograph on the aat, we present the radialvelocities of more than 1500 red giant branch and red clump stars towards thecentre of the canis major dwarf galaxy. with a mean velocity of 72\pm7 km/s ata heliocentric distance of 5.5 kpc and 114\pm2 km/s at 8.5 kpc, these starspresent a peculiar distance -- radial velocity relation that is unlike thatexpected from thin or thick disc stars. moreover, they belong to akinematically cold population with an intrinsic dispersion that may be as lowas 11_{-1}^{+3} km/s. the radial velocity distribution is used to select canismajor stars in the ucac2.0 proper motion catalogue and derive proper motions ingalactic coordinates of (\mu_l,\mu_b)= (-3.6\pm0.8 mas/yr, 1.5\pm0.4 mas/yr)for the dwarf galaxy, which after correcting for the reflex solar motion alongthis line-of-sight gives (\mu_l',\mu_b')= (-6.8\pm0.8 mas/yr, 0.8\pm0.4mas/yr)$, corresponding to a prograde orbit with a tangential velocity of\sim235 km/s at the average distance of \sim7.2 kpc. all these kinematicconstraints can be reproduced in simulations of the accretion of a dwarf ontothe galactic disc. such a process could also be responsible for the monocerosring that has recently been shown to encompass the galactic disc. however,without constraints on the kinematics of the tidal arms emerging from the canismajor dwarf, it is not yet possible to definitively prove a link between thetwo structures.

astro-ph;0504494	the core of the canis major galaxy as traced by red clump stars	the recently-discovered stellar system in canis major is analysed usinghe-burning red clump stars as tracers. canis major turns out to be thestrongest and most spatially confined overdensity of the whole galactic disc,both in terms of number density and of statistical significance. when projectedonto the galactic plane, it appears as an elongated and compact overdensityextending from l ~ 200 to l ~ 280 with a roundish core toward l ~ 240. we findthat the main body of the system has an integrated absolute magnitude m_v=-14.4+/- 0.8, a central surface brightness \mu_{v,0} = 24.0 +/- 0.6 mag/arcsec^2 anda line-of-sight profile peaked at d_{sun}=7.2 +/- 1.0 kpc with half width athalf maximum ~ 2.0 kpc, in excellent agreement with the results obtained withwidely different tracers (m giants and main sequence stars) in previousanalyses. the mean distance to the main body of canis major is observed toincrease with increasing galactic longitude, from d_{sun} ~ 6.3 kpc at l ~ 225,to d_{sun} ~ 9.3 kpc at l ~ 265, in good agreement with the predictions of ourmore recent n-body simulation that models cma as a dwarf galaxy being accretedin a planar orbit onto the disc of the milky way. we confirm that the canismajor system has all the characteristics of the relic of a dwarf galaxy seen ontop of a large-scale overdensity that we detect all over the third and fourthgalactic quadrants (180&lt;l&lt;360, with a strong maximum around l=290 and b&gt; -5)that is identified as the stellar component of the southern galactic warp...(abridged)....

astro-ph;0510280	the pure non-collisional blue straggler population in the giant stellar  system omega centauri	we have used high spatial resolution data from the hubble space telescope andwide-field ground-based observations to search for blue straggler stars (bss)over the entire radial extent of the large stellar system omega centauri. wehave detected the largest population of bss ever observed in any stellarsystem. even though the sample is restricted to the brightest portion of thebss sequence, more than 300 candidates have been identified. bss are thought tobe produced by the evolution of binary systems (either formed by stellarcollisions or mass exchange in binary stars). since systems like galacticglobular clusters (ggc) and omega cen evolve dynamically on time-scalessignificantly shorter than their ages, binaries should have settled toward thecenter, showing a more concentrated radial distribution than the ordinary, lessmassive single stars. indeed, in all ggcs which have been surveyed for bss, thebss distribution is peaked at the center. conversely, in omega cen we find thatthe bss share the same radial distribution as the adopted referencepopulations. this is the cleanest evidence ever found that such a stellarsystem is not fully relaxed even in the central region. we further argue thatthe absence of central concentration in the bss distribution rules out acollisional origin. thus, the omega cen bss are the purest and largestpopulation of non-collisional bss ever observed. our results allow the firstempirical quantitative estimate of the production rate of bss via this channel.bss in omega cen may represent the best local template for modeling the bsspopulations in distant galaxies where they cannot be individually observed.

astro-ph;0512109	the age of the main population of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal  galaxy. solving the "m giant conundrum"	we present a statistically decontaminated color magnitude diagram of a 1 degx 1 deg field in the core of the sagittarius dsph galaxy. coupling this cmdwith the most recent metallicity distributions obtained from high resolutionspectroscopy we derive robust constraints on the mean age of the stellarpopulation that dominates the galaxy (pop a). using three different sets oftheoretical isochrones in the metallicity range -0.4&lt;= [m/h]&lt;= -0.7 and takinginto consideration distance moduli in the range 16.90&lt;= (m-m)_0&lt;= 17.20 we findthat the mean age of pop a is larger than 5 gyr, and the best-fit value is age= 8.0 +/- 1.5 gyr. since pop a provides the vast majority of the m giants thattraces the tidal stream of sgr dsph all over the sky, our estimate resolves theso called ``m giant conundrum'' (majewski et al. 2003). the time needed by them giants that currently populates the stream to diffuse within the main body ofsgr and to reach the extremes of the tidal tails once torn apart from theparent galaxy (~ 3-4 gyr) can be easily accommodated into the time lapsed sincetheir birth (~ 5.5-9.5 gyr).

astro-ph;0608513	detection of a population gradient in the sagittarius stream	we present a quantitative comparison between the horizontal branch morphologyin the core of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgr) and in a widefield sampling a portion of its tidal stream (sgr stream), located tens of kpcaway from the center of the parent galaxy. we find that the blue horizontalbranch (bhb) stars in that part of the stream are five times more abundant thanin the sgr core, relative to red clump stars. the difference in the ratio ofbhb to rc stars between the two fields is significant at the 4.8 sigma level.this indicates that the old and metal-poor population of sgr was preferentiallystripped from the galaxy in past peri-galactic passages with respect to theintermediate-age metal rich population that presently dominates the bound coreof sgr, probably due to a strong radial gradient that was settled within thegalaxy before its disruption. the technique adopted in the present study allowsto trace population gradients along the whole extension of the stream.

astro-ph;0701162	the chemical evolution of omega centauri's progenitor system	chemical evolution models are presented for the anomalous globular clusteromega centauri. after demonstrating that the chemical features of omega cen cannot be reproduced in the framework of the closed-box self-enrichment scenario,we discuss a model in which this cluster is the remnant of a dwarf spheroidalgalaxy evolved in isolation and then swallowed by the milky way. both infall ofprimordial matter and metal-enriched gas outflows have to be considered inorder to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution function, theage-metallicity relation and several abundance ratios. yet, as long as anordinary stellar mass function and standard stellar yields are assumed, we failby far to get the enormous helium enhancement required to explain the blue mainsequence (and, perhaps, the extreme horizontal branch) stellar data. rotatingmodels of massive stars producing stellar winds with large helium excesses atlow metallicities have been put forward as promising candidates to solve the`helium enigma' of omega cen (maeder &amp; meynet, 2006, a&amp;a, 448, l37). however,we show that for any reasonable choice of the initial mass function thehelium-to-metal enrichment of the integrated stellar population is unavoidablymuch lower than 70 and conclude that the issue of the helium enhancement inomega cen still waits for a satisfactory explanation. we briefly speculate uponpossible solutions.

astro-ph;9407086	low mass x-ray binaries in globular clusters: a new metallicity effect	galactic globular clusters (gcs) containing bright x sources (l_x &gt; 10^{36}erg/s), commonly associated with low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), are found tobe significantly denser and more metal-rich than normal non-x-ray clusters bothin the galaxy and in m31. within a framework where lmxbs in gcs are generatedvia tidal captures in high-density clusters and (2+1) encounters in low-densityglobulars, the higher incidence of lmxbs with increasing metallicity is shownto be {\it intrinsic} and not just a by-product of other effects. two possiblemechanisms are examined: the first one assumes a dependence of the cluster imfon metallicity as recently published in the literature. the observed lmbxs,more frequently occurring in metal rich clusters, agrees with the predictednumber of ns only if metallicity accounts for a minor contribution to theobserved variation of the imf slope. other alternatives explored, such as thetotal variation of the observed imf slopes is due to (a) just metallicity and(b) the combination of metallicity and position in the galaxy lead to aclear-cut disagreement with the data. the second mechanism assumes that, atfixed cluster density, the rate of tidal captures depends on radius and mass ofthe capturing star. based on standard stellar models, stars with higher metalcontent have wider radii and higher masses, hence the rate of tidal capturesincreases with increasing metallicity. from the order of magnitude computationsmade, this new effect by itself could explain the observed ratio of 4 betweenthe frequencies of x-ray clusters in the metal-rich and metal-poor groups weobservationally determined. however, there is no reason to exclude that bothmechanisms can be at work.
