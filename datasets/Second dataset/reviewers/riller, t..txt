1001.2657	planck pre-launch status: the planck-lfi programme	this paper provides an overview of the low frequency instrument (lfi)programme within the esa planck mission. the lfi instrument has been developedto produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range27-77 ghz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiationspectrum. the scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamentalcosmology to galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. the instrument design anddevelopment are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testingstrategy. the instrument is presented in the context of the planck mission. thelfi approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. we also describethe lfi ground segment. we present the results of a number of testsdemonstrating the capability of the lfi data processing centre (dpc) toproperly reduce and analyse lfi flight data, from telemetry information tocalibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (intemperature and polarization), component emission maps (cmb and diffuseforegrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the early releasecompact source catalogue and the final compact source catalogue). theorganization of the lfi consortium is briefly presented as well as the role ofthe core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. all tests carriedout on the lfi flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of theinstrument and its various subunits. the data analysis pipeline has been testedand its main steps verified. in the first three months after launch, thecommissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will becompleted, after which planck will begin its operational life, in which lfiwill have an integral part.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2024	planck early results viii: the all-sky early sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  sample	we present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly bythe planck satellite through the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect from its sixhighest frequencies. this early sz (esz) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. its highreliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validationprocess based on planck internal quality assessments and by externalcross-identification and follow-up observations. planck provides the firstmeasured sz signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known esz clusters.planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meetthe esz signal-to-noise selection criterion. at the submission date, twelve ofthe 20 esz candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmedusing xmm-newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbedmorphologies and low luminosities. the esz clusters are mostly at moderateredshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to therarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 msol.

1101.2025	planck early results. ix. xmm-newton follow-up for validation of planck  cluster candidates	we present the xmm-newton follow-up for confirmation of planck clustercandidates. twenty-five candidates have been observed to date using snapshot(~10 ksec) exposures, ten as part of a pilot programme to sample a low range ofsignal-to-noise ratios (4&lt;s/n&lt;6), and a further 15 in a programme to observe asample of s/n&gt;5 candidates. the sensitivity and spatial resolution ofxmm-newton allows unambiguous discrimination between clusters and falsecandidates. the 4 false candidates have s/n &lt;= 4.1. a total of 21 candidatesare confirmed as extended x-ray sources. seventeen are single clusters, themajority of which are found to have highly irregular and disturbed morphologies(about ~70%). the remaining four sources are multiple systems, including theunexpected discovery of a supercluster at z=0.45. for 20 sources we are able toderive a redshift estimate from the x-ray fe k line (albeit of variablequality). the new clusters span the redshift range 0.09 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.54, with amedian redshift of z~0.37. a first determination is made of their x-rayproperties including the characteristic size, which is used to improve theestimate of the sz compton parameter, y_sz. the follow-up validation programmehas helped to optimise the planck candidate selection process. it has alsoprovided a preview of the x-ray properties of these newly-discovered clusters,allowing comparison with their sz properties, and to the x-ray and szproperties of known clusters observed in the planck survey. our results suggestthat planck may have started to reveal a non-negligible population of massivedynamically perturbed objects that is under-represented in x-ray surveys.however, despite their particular properties, these new clusters appear tofollow the y_sz-y_x relation established for x-ray selected objects, where y_xis the product of the gas mass and temperature.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2035	planck early results: the galactic cold core population revealed by the  first all-sky survey	we present the statistical properties of the first version of the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po), in terms of their spatial distribution,temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. we also describe the statistics ofthe early cold core catalogue (ecc, delivered with the early release compactsource catalogue, ercsc) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detectionsof the complete catalogue. we have used the cococodet algorithm to extract10783 cold sources. temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} valuesare derived using the fluxes in the iras 100 \mum band and the three highestfrequency planck bands. temperature spans from 7k to 17k, and peaks around 13k.data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the alltemperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(t) and theeffect of multiple t components folded into the measurements. for one third ofthe objects the distances are obtained. most of the detections are within 2 kpcin the solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. thecores are distributed from the deep galactic plane, despite the confusion, tohigh latitudes (&gt;30$^{\circle}$). the associated mass estimates range from 1 to$10^5$ solar masses. using their physical properties these cold sources areshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structuresbetween clouds and cores. these cold clumps are not isolated but mostlyorganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue ofcold objects. it gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties ofthese potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for theirclassification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2043	planck early results. x. statistical analysis of sunyaev-zeldovich  scaling relations for x-ray galaxy clusters	all-sky data from the planck survey and the meta-catalogue of x-ray detectedclusters of galaxies (mcxc) are combined to investigate the relationshipbetween the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal and x-ray luminosity. thesample comprises ~ 1600 x-ray clusters with redshifts up to ~ 1 and spans awide range in x-ray luminosity. the sz signal is extracted for each objectindividually, and the statistical significance of the measurement is maximisedby averaging the sz signal in bins of x-ray luminosity, total mass, orredshift. the sz signal is detected at very high significance over more thantwo decades in x-ray luminosity (10^43 erg/s &lt; l_500 e(z)^-7/3 &lt; 2 x 10^45erg/s). the relation between intrinsic sz signal and x-ray luminosity isinvestigated and the measured sz signal is compared to values predicted fromx-ray data. planck measurements and x-ray based predictions are found to be inexcellent agreement over the whole explored luminosity range. no significantdeviation from standard evolution of the scaling relations is detected. for thefirst time the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between sz signal andx-ray luminosity is measured and found to be consistent with the one in theluminosity -- mass relation from x-ray studies. there is no evidence of anydeficit in sz signal strength in planck data relative to expectations from thex-ray properties of clusters, underlining the robustness and consistency of ouroverall view of intra-cluster medium properties.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5063	planck 2013 results. ii. low frequency instrument data processing	we describe the data processing pipeline of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi) data processing centre (dpc) to create and characterizefull-sky maps based on the first 15.5 months of operations at 30, 44 and 70ghz. in particular, we discuss the various steps involved in reducing the data,starting from telemetry packets through to the production of cleaned,calibrated timelines and calibrated frequency maps. data are continuouslycalibrated using the modulation induced on the mean temperature of the cosmicmicrowave background radiation by the proper motion of the spacecraft. skysignals other than the dipole are removed by an iterative procedure based onsimultaneous fitting of calibration parameters and sky maps. noise propertiesare estimated from time-ordered data after the sky signal has been removed,using a generalized least square map-making algorithm. a destriping code(madam) is employed to combine radiometric data and pointing information intosky maps, minimizing the variance of correlated noise. noise covariancematrices, required to compute statistical uncertainties on lfi and planckproducts, are also produced. main beams are estimated down to the -20 db levelusing jupiter transits, which are also used for the geometrical calibration ofthe focal plane.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5069	planck 2013 results. viii. hfi photometric calibration and mapmaking	this paper describes the processing applied to the hfi cleaned time-ordereddata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. hfi observes the sky over abroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 ghz. to get the best accuracy onthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibrationschemes have to be used. the 545 and 857 \ghz\ data are calibrated using uranusand neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of theiratmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. the lower frequencies (below 353ghz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.one ofthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of thesatellite in the solar system, and is therefore time-variable. photometriccalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses lowfrequency noise removal. the 2013 released hfi data show some evidence forapparent gain variations of the hfi bolometers' detection chain. thesevariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one yearapart in the same configuration. we developed an effective correction to limitits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. we present several methodsused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration. we distinguishrelative (from one detector to another, or from one frequency to another) andabsolute uncertainties. in both cases, we found that these uncertainties rangefrom a few $10^{-3}$ to several per cents from 100 to 857 ghz. we describe thepipeline producing the maps from the hfi timelines, based on the photometriccalibration parameters and we detail the scheme used to a posteriori set thezero level of the maps. we also briefly discuss the cross-calibration betweenhfi and the spire instrument on board herschel. we finally summarize the basiccharacteristics of the set of the hfi maps from the 2013 planck data release.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5078	planck 2013 results. xviii. gravitational lensing-infrared background  correlation	the multi-frequency capability of the planck satellite provides informationboth on the integrated history of star formation (via the cosmic infraredbackground, or cib) and on the distribution of dark matter (via the lensingeffect on the cosmic microwave background, or cmb). the conjunction of thesetwo unique probes allows us to measure directly the connection between dark andluminous matter in the high redshift (1 &lt; z &lt;3) universe. we use a three-pointstatistic optimized to detect the correlation between these two tracers.following a thorough discussion of possible contaminants and a suite ofconsistency tests, using lens reconstructions at 100, 143 and 217 ghz and cibmeasurements at 100-857 ghz, we report the first detection of the correlationbetween the cib and cmb lensing. the well matched redshift distribution ofthese two signals leads to a detection significance with a peak value of 42\sigma at 545 ghz and a correlation as high as 80% across these two tracers.our full set of multi-frequency measurements (both cib auto- and cib-lensingcross-spectra) are consistent with a simple halo-based model, with acharacteristic mass scale for the halos hosting cib sources oflog_{10}(m/m_sun) = 10.5 \pm 0.6. leveraging the frequency dependence of oursignal, we isolate the high redshift contribution to the cib, and constrain thestar formation rate (sfr) density at z&gt;1. we measure directly the sfr densitywith around 2 sigma significance for three redshift bins between z=1 and 7,thus opening a new window into the study of the formation of stars at earlytimes.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1303.5083	planck 2013 results. xxiii. isotropy and statistics of the cmb	the two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that theinitial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and gaussian - are rigorouslytested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy from theplanck satellite. deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated tobe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequencydependence. many of these anomalies were previously observed in the wmap data,and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).however, we find little evidence for non-gaussianity, with the exception of afew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.in particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connectedto a low observed variance of the cmb signal. a power asymmetry is now found topersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in thelow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. however, anyprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. finally, it is plausible that some of thesefeatures may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, whichshows a deficit of power on similar scales. indeed, when the power spectra oftwo hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, oneshows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillationsbetween odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation andphase correlations also detected in the data. although these analyses representa step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactoryexplanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.

1303.5084	planck 2013 results. xxiv. constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	the planck nominal mission cosmic microwave background (cmb) maps yieldunprecedented constraints on primordial non-gaussianity (ng). using threeoptimal bispectrum estimators, separable template-fitting (ksw), binned, andmodal, we obtain consistent values for the primordial local, equilateral, andorthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result fnl^local=2.7+/-5.8, fnl^equil= -42+/-75, and fnl^ortho= -25+\-39 (68% cl statistical).ng is detected in the data; using skew-c_l statistics we find a nonzerobispectrum from residual point sources, and the isw-lensing bispectrum at alevel expected in the lambdacdm scenario. the results are based oncomprehensive cross-validation of these estimators on gaussian and non-gaussiansimulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass anextensive suite of tests, and are confirmed by skew-c_l, wavelet bispectrum andminkowski functional estimators. beyond estimates of individual shapeamplitudes, we present model-independent, 3-dimensional reconstructions of theplanck cmb bispectrum and thus derive constraints on early-universe scenariosthat generate primordial ng, including general single-field models ofinflation, excited initial states (non-bunch-davies vacua), anddirectionally-dependent vector models. we provide an initial survey ofscale-dependent feature and resonance models. these results bound both generalsingle-field and multi-field model parameter ranges, such as the speed ofsound, c_s \geq 0.02 (95% cl), in an effective field theory parametrization,and the curvaton decay fraction r_d \geq 0.15 (95% cl). the planck datasignificantly limit the viable parameter space of the ekpyrotic/cyclicscenarios. the amplitude of the 4-point function in the local model taunl &lt;2800 (95% cl). these constraints represent the highest precision tests to dateof physical mechanisms for the origin of cosmic structure.

1303.5085	planck 2013 results. xxv. searches for cosmic strings and other  topological defects	planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmicstrings and other defects. we describe forecasts of the cmb power spectruminduced by cosmic strings, calculating these from network models andsimulations using line-of-sight boltzmann solvers. we have studied nambu-gotocosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects areimportant, thus spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in stringsmodels. we have added the angular power spectrum from strings to that for asimple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$ atmultipole $\ell=10$. this parameter has been added to the standard sixparameter fit using cosmomc with flat priors. for the nambu-goto string model,we have obtained a constraint on the string tension of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.5 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to$g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ cmbdata. for the abelian-higgs field theory model we find, $g\mu_{ah}/c^2 &lt; 3.2 x10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} &lt; 0.028$. the marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and inthe $f_{10}$--$\omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented. we have also obtainedconstraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global texturesfor which $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. we have made complementarity searches forthe specific non-gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating withall-sky planck resolution cmb maps generated from networks ofpost-recombination strings. we have obtained upper limits on the string tensionat 95% confidence of $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrumestimation and $g\mu/c^2 &lt; 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches withminkowski functionals. these are conservative upper bounds because onlypost-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-gaussiananalysis.

1303.5086	planck 2013 results. xxvi. background geometry and topology of the  universe	planck cmb temperature maps allow detection of large-scale departures fromhomogeneity and isotropy. we search for topology with a fundamental domainnearly intersecting the last scattering surface (comoving distance $\chi_r$).for most topologies studied the likelihood maximized over orientation showssome preference for multi-connected models just larger than $\chi_r$. thiseffect is also present in simulated realizations of isotropic maps and weinterpret it as the alignment of mild anisotropic correlations with chancefeatures in a single realization; such a feature can also exist, in milderform, when the likelihood is marginalized over orientations. thus marginalized,the limits on the radius $r_i$ of the largest sphere inscribed in a topologicaldomain (at log-likelihood-ratio -5) are: in a flat universe, $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$for the cubic torus (cf. $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ at 99% cl for a matched-circlessearch); $r_i&gt;0.7\chi_r$ for the chimney; $r_i&gt;0.5\chi_r$ for the slab; in apositively curved universe, $r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the dodecahedron;$r_i&gt;1.0\chi_r$ for the truncated cube; $r_i&gt;0.9\chi_r$ for the octahedron.similar limits apply to alternate topologies. we perform a bayesian search foran anisotropic bianchi vii$_h$ geometry. in a non-physical setting where thebianchi parameters are decoupled from cosmology, planck data favour a bianchicomponent with a bayes factor of at least 1.5 units of log-evidence: a bianchipattern is efficient at accounting for some large-scale anomalies in planckdata. however, the cosmological parameters are in strong disagreement withthose found from cmb anisotropy data alone. in the physically motivated settingwhere the bianchi parameters are fitted simultaneously with standardcosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a bianchi vii$_h$ cosmologyand constrain the vorticity of such models: $(\omega/h)_0&lt;8\times10^{-10}$ (95%cl).

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1405.0874	planck intermediate results. xxii. frequency dependence of thermal  emission from galactic dust in intensity and polarization	planck has mapped the intensity and polarization of the sky at microwavefrequencies with unprecedented sensitivity. we make use of the planck 353 ghzi, q, and u stokes maps as dust templates, and cross-correlate them with theplanck and wmap data at 12 frequencies from 23 to 353 ghz, over circularpatches with 10 degree radius. the cross-correlation analysis is performed forboth intensity and polarization data in a consistent manner. we use a mask thatfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediategalactic latitudes. we determine the spectral indices of dust emission inintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 ghz, for each sky-patch. themean values, $1.59\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\pm0.01$ for intensity,for a mean dust temperature of 19.6 k, are close, but significantly different($3.6\,\sigma$). we determine the mean spectral energy distribution (sed) ofthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 ghz dust templates, byaveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. we find that themean sed increases for decreasing frequencies at $\nu &lt; 60$ ghz, for bothintensity and polarization. the rise of the polarization sed towards lowfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated withdust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. weuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and tocharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. thepolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\pm6)$ % from353 to 70 ghz. the decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarizationefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicategrains). our observational results provide inputs to quantify and optimize theseparation between galactic and cosmological polarization.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)
