0706.2301	x-ray detection of the substellar twin 2mass j11011926-7732383 ab	2mass j11011926-7732383 ab (hereafter 2m1101ab), located in the cha i starforming region, is a rare wide-separation brown dwarf binary. xmm-newton andchandra observations of 2m1101ab have allowed us to examine the influence ofphysical parameters (mass, bolometric luminosity and effective temperature) onx-ray emission from a coeval pair of substellar objects. the spatial resolutionof xmm-newton is not sufficient to separate contributions from the twocomponents in the binary. the x-ray source detected with xmm-newton has acolumn density compatible with the infrared extinction of component a. on theother hand, the binary is resolved with chandra, and the bulk of the x-rayemission is clearly associated with the photospherically cooler component b.these apparently contradictory results point at strong variability of 2m1101'sx-ray emission. combined with previous sensitive x-ray observations fromlow-mass members of chai, we find a decline of x-ray luminosity with decreasing(sub)stellar mass that is typical for star forming regions. 2m1101b is thecoolest (spectral type m8.25) and least massive brown dwarf of chai detected inx-rays so far. it is also among the youngest (~1 myr) substellar chai members,and therefore relatively luminous. most bona fide brown dwarfs of cha i haveremained below the sensitivity limits of available x-ray observations, becauseof their low luminosity associated with higher age.

0903.4060	the x-ray emission from z cma during an fuor-like outburst and the  detection of its x-ray jet	accretion shocks have been recognized as important x-ray emission mechanismfor pre-main sequence stars. yet the x-ray properties of fuor outbursts, eventsthat are caused by violent accretion, have been given little attention. we haveobserved the fuor object z cma during optical outburst and quiescence withchandra. no significant changes in x-ray brightness and spectral shape arefound, suggesting that the x-ray emission is of coronal nature. due to thebinary nature of z cma the origin of the x-ray source is ambiguous. however,the moderate hydrogen column density derived from our data makes it unlikelythat the embedded primary star is the x-ray source. the secondary star, whichis the fuor object, is thus responsible for both the x-ray emission and thepresently ongoing accretion outburst, which seem however to be unrelatedphenomena. the secondary is also known to drive a large outflow and jet, thatwe detect here for the first time in x-rays. the distance of the x-ray emittingoutflow source to the central star is higher than in jets of low-mass stars.

0905.0864	searching for a link between the magnetic nature and other observed  properties of herbig ae/be stars and stars with debris disks	among the 21 herbig ae/be stars studied, new detections of a magnetic fieldwere achieved in six stars. for three herbig ae/be stars, we confirm previousmagnetic field detections. the largest longitudinal magnetic field, &lt;b_z&gt; =-454+-42g, was detected in the herbig ae/be star hd101412 using hydrogen lines.no field detection at a significance level of 3sigma was achieved in stars withdebris disks. our study does not indicate any correlation of the strength ofthe longitudinal magnetic field with disk orientation, disk geometry, or thepresence of a companion. we also do not see any simple dependence on themass-accretion rate. however, it is likely that the range of observed fieldvalues qualitatively supports the expectations from magnetospheric accretionmodels giving support for dipole-like field geometries. both the magnetic fieldstrength and the x-ray emission show hints for a decline with age in the rangeof ~2-14myrs probed by our sample supporting a dynamo mechanism that decayswith age. however, our study of rotation does not show any obvious trend of thestrength of the longitudinal magnetic field with rotation period. furthermore,the stars seem to obey the universal power-law relation between magnetic fluxand x-ray luminosity established for the sun and main-sequence active dwarfstars.

0906.4700	results from droxo. ii. - [ne ii] and x-ray emission from rho ophiuchi  young stellar objects	the infrared [ne ii] and [ne iii] fine structure lines at 12.81um and 15.55umare predicted to trace the circumstellar disk gas subject to x-ray heating andionization. we investigate the origin of these lines by comparing observationswith models of x-ray irradiated disks and by searching for empiricalcorrelations between the line luminosities and stellar and circumstellarparameters. we measure neon line fluxes and x-ray luminosities for 28 youngstellar objects in the rho ophiuchi star formation region for which goodquality infrared spectra and x-ray data have been obtained, the former with thespitzer irs and the latter with the deep rho ophiuchi xmm-newton observation.  we detect the [ne ii] and the [ne iii] lines in 10 and 1 cases, respectively.line luminosities show no correlation with x-ray emission. the luminosity ofthe [ne ii] line for one star, and that of both the [ne ii] and [ne iii] linesfor a second star, match the predictions of published models of x-rayirradiated disks; for the remaining 8 objects the [ne ii] emission is 1-3 dexhigher than predicted on the basis of their l_x. class i objects showsignificantly stronger [ne ii] lines than class ii and class iii ones. acorrelation is moreover found between the [ne ii] line emission and the diskmass accretion rates. this might point toward a role of accretion-generated uvemission in the generation of the line or to other mechanisms related to massinflows from circumstellar disks and envelopes and/or to the associated massoutflows (winds and jets). we conclude that the x-ray luminosity is not theonly parameter that determines the [ne ii] emission. explaining the strong [neii] emission of class i objects likely requires the inclusion in the models ofadditional physical components such as the envelope, inflows, and outflows.

0907.4252	a chandra and spitzer census of the young star cluster in the reflection  nebula ngc 7129	the reflection nebula ngc 7129 has long been known to be a site of recentstar formation as evidenced, e.g., by the presence of deeply embeddedprotostars and hh objects. however, studies of the stellar population producedin the star formation process have remained rudimentary. at a presumed age of~3 myr, ngc7129 is in the critical range where disks around young starsdisappear. we make use of chandra x-ray and spitzer and 2mass ir imagingobservations to identify the pre-main sequence stars in ngc7129. we define asample of young stellar objects based on color-color diagrams composed from irphotometry between 1.6 and 8 mu, from 2mass and spitzer, and based on x-raydetected sources from a chandra observation. this sample is composed of 26class ii and 25 class iii candidates. the sample is estimated to be completedown to ~ 0.5 solar masses. the most restricted and least biased sub-sample ofpre-main sequence stars is composed of lightly absorbed (a_v &lt; 5 mag) stars inthe cluster core. this sample comprises 7 class ii and 14 class iii sources, ithas a disk fraction of 33^{+24}_{-19} %, and a median x-ray luminosity of log(l_x) [erg/s] = 30.3. despite the various uncertainties related to the sampleselection, absorption, mass distribution, distance and, consequently, thecomputation of disk fraction and x-ray luminosities, the data yield consistentresults. in particular, we confirm the age of ~3 myr for the ngc7129 cluster.the derived disk fraction is similar to that of sigma orionis, smaller thanthat of cha i (~2 myr), and larger than that of upper sco (5 myr). the x-rayluminosity function is similar to that of ngc 2264 (2 myr) but fainter thanthat of the orion nebula cluster (1 myr).

0909.0218	x-ray optical depth diagnostics of t tauri accretion shocks	in classical t tauri stars, x-rays are produced by two plasma components: ahot low-density plasma, with frequent flaring activity, and a high-densitylower temperature plasma. the former is coronal plasma related to the stellarmagnetic activity. the latter component, never observed in non-accreting stars,could be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. howeverits nature is still being debated. our aim is to probe the soft x-ray emissionfrom the high-density plasma component in classical t tauri stars to checkwhether this is plasma heated in the accretion shock or whether it is coronalplasma. high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy allows us to measure individual linefluxes. we analyze x-ray spectra of the classical t tauri stars mp muscae andtw hydrae. our aim is to evaluate line ratios to search for optical deptheffects, which are expected in the accretion-driven scenario. we also derivethe plasma emission measure distributions emd, to investigate whether and howthe emd of accreting and non accreting young stars differ. the results arecompared to those obtained for the non-accreting weak-line t tauri star twa 5.we find evidence of resonance scattering in the strongest lines of mp mus,supporting the idea that soft x-rays are produced by plasma heated in theaccretion shock. we also find that the emd of mp mus has two peaks: a cool peakat temperatures expected for plasma heated in the accretion shock, and a hotpeak typical of coronal plasma. the shape of the emd of mp mus appears to bethe superposition of the emd of a pure coronal source, like twa 5, and an emdalike that of tw hydrae, which is instead dominated by shock-heated plasma.

0912.3889	the nature of the recent extreme outburst of the herbig be/fu ori binary  z cma	z cma is a binary system which consists of two young stars: a herbig aebecomponent "z cma nw" embedded in a dust cocoon and a less massive component "zcma se", which is classified as a fu orionis type star. recently, the systemshowed the largest outburst reported during the almost 90 years of availableobservations. during the recent outburst we detect that the z cma system ispolarized by 2.6% in the continuum and emission line spectrum, with a positionangle still perpendicular to the jet. from the high level of polarization weconclude that the outburst is associated with the dust embedded herbig aebe nwcomponent. the main result of our studies is that the bolometric luminosity ofz cma remained surprisingly constant during the recent "outburst". we concludethat either the geometry of the cavity through which the light escapes from thecocoon has opened a new path, or that the screen of dust, which reflects thelight toward the observer became more efficient causing the observed increaseof the visual brightness by about 2.5 magnitudes.

1003.3146	studying the underlying event in drell-yan and high transverse momentum  jet production at the tevatron	we study the underlying event in proton-antiproton collisions by examiningthe behavior of charged particles (transverse momentum pt &gt; 0.5 gev/c,pseudorapidity |\eta| &lt; 1) produced in association with large transversemomentum jets (~2.2 fb-1) or with drell-yan lepton-pairs (~2.7 fb-1) in thez-boson mass region (70 &lt; m(pair) &lt; 110 gev/c2) as measured by cdf at 1.96 tevcenter-of-mass energy. we use the direction of the lepton-pair (in drell-yanproduction) or the leading jet (in high-pt jet production) in each event todefine three regions of \eta-\phi space; toward, away, and transverse, where\phi is the azimuthal scattering angle. for drell-yan production (excluding theleptons) both the toward and transverse regions are very sensitive to theunderlying event. in high-pt jet production the transverse region is verysensitive to the underlying event and is separated into a max and mintransverse region, which helps separate the hard component (initial andfinal-state radiation) from the beam-beam remnant and multiple partoninteraction components of the scattering. the data are corrected to theparticle level to remove detector effects and are then compared with severalqcd monte-carlo models. the goal of this analysis is to provide data that canbe used to test and improve the qcd monte-carlo models of the underlying eventthat are used to simulate hadron-hadron collisions.

0708.0860	establishing the nature of companion candidates to x-ray emitting late  b-type stars	the most favored interpretation for the detection of x-ray emission from lateb-type stars is that these stars have a yet undiscovered late-type companion(or an unbound nearby late-type star) that produces the x-rays. several faintir objects at (sub)-arcsecond separation from b-type stars have been uncoveredin our earlier adaptive optics imaging observations, and some of them have beenfollowed up with the high spatial resolution of the chandra x-ray observatory,pinpointing the x-ray emitter. however, firm conclusions on their naturerequires a search for spectroscopic signatures of youth. here we report on ourrecent isaac observations carried out in low resolution spectroscopic mode.equivalent widths have been used to obtain information on spectral types of thecompanions. all eight x-ray emitting systems with late b-type primaries studiedcontain dwarf like companions with spectral types later than a7. the onlysystem in the sample where the companion turns out to be of early spectral typeis not an x-ray source. these results are consistent with the assumption thatthe observed x-ray emission from late b-type stars is produced by an activepre-main sequence companion star.

1006.2717	the enigmatic young brown dwarf binary fu tau: accretion and activity	fu tau belongs to a rare class of young, wide brown dwarf binaries. we haveresolved the system in a chandra x-ray observation and detected only theprimary, fu tau a. hard x-ray emission, presumably from a corona, is presentbut, unexpectedly, we detect also a strong and unusually soft component from futau a. its x-ray properties, so far unique among brown dwarfs, are very similarto those of the t tauri star tw hya. the analogy with tw hya suggests that thedominating soft x-ray component can be explained by emission from accretionshocks. however, the typical free-fall velocities of a brown dwarf are too lowfor an interpretation of the observed x-ray temperature as post-shock region.on the other hand, velocities in excess of the free-fall speed are derived fromarchival optical spectroscopy, and independent pieces of evidence for strongaccretion in fu tau a are found in optical photometry. the high x-rayluminosity of fu tau a coincides with a high bolometric luminosity confirmingan unexplained trend among young brown dwarfs. in fact, fu tau a isoverluminous with respect to evolutionary models while fu tau b is on the 1 myrisochrone suggesting non-contemporaneous formation of the two components in thebinary. the extreme youth of fu tau a could be responsible for its peculiarx-ray properties, in terms of atypical magnetic activity or accretion.alternatively, rotation and magnetic field effects may reduce the efficiency ofconvection which in turn affects the effective temperature and radius of fu taua shifting its position in the hr diagram. although there is no direct prove ofthis latter scenario so far we present arguments for its plausibility.

1103.0739	search of x-ray emission from roap stars: the case of gamma equulei	the detection of x-ray emission from ap stars can be an indicator for thepresence of magnetic activity and dynamo action, provided different origins forthe emission, such as wind shocks and close late-type companions, can beexcluded. here we report on results for gamma equu, the only roap star forwhich an x-ray detection is reported in rosat catalogs. we use high resolutionimaging in x-rays with chandra and in the near-infrared with naco/vlt thatallow us to spatially resolve companions down to ~1" and ~0.06" separations,respectively. the bulk of the x-ray emission is associated with a companion ofgamma equu identified in our naco image. assuming coevality with the primaryroap star (~900 myr), the available photometry for the companion points at ak-type star with ~0.6 m_sun. its x-ray properties are in agreement with thepredictions for its age and mass. an excess of photons with respect to theexpected background and contribution from the nearby companion is observed nearthe optical position of gamma equu. we estimate an x-ray luminosity of log l_x[erg/s] = 26.6 and log(l_x/l_bol) = -7.9 for this emission. a small offsetbetween the optical and the x-ray image leaves some doubt on its associationwith the roap star. the faint x-ray emission that we tentatively ascribe to theroap star is difficult to explain as a solar-like stellar corona due to itsvery low l_x/l_bol level and the very long rotation period of gamma equu. itcould be produced in magnetically confined wind shocks implying a mass lossrate of ~10^(-14) m_sun/yr or from an additional unknown late-type companion atseparation ~0.4". if confirmed by future deeper x-ray observations thisemission could point at the origin for the presence of radioactive elements onsome roap stars.

1111.4420	x-ray view of ic348 in the light of an updated cluster census	we study the properties of the coronae of the low-mass stars in the young(~2-3myr), nearby (~310pc) open cluster ic348 combining x-ray andoptical/infrared data. the four existing chandra observations of ic348 aremerged, thus providing a deeper and spatially more complete x-ray view thanprevious x-ray studies of the cluster. we have compiled a comprehensive catalogof ic348 members taking into account recent updates to the cluster census. ourdata collection comprises fundamental stellar parameters, infrared excessindicating the presence of disks, halpha emission as a tracer of chromosphericemission or accretion and mass accretion rates. we have detected 290 x-raysources in four merged chandra exposures, of which 187 are associated withknown cluster members. only four of the x-ray sources are brown dwarfs(spectral type m6 and later). the detection rate is highest for diskless classiii stars and increases with stellar mass. this may be explained with higherx-ray luminosities for higher mass and later evolutionary stage that is evidentin the x-ray luminosity functions. in particular, we find that for the lowestexamined masses (0.1-0.25 msun) there is a difference between the x-rayluminosity functions of accreting and non-accreting stars (classified on thebasis of their halpha emission strength) as well as those of disk-bearing anddiskless stars (classified on the basis of the slope of the spectral energydistribution). these differences disappear for higher masses. this is relatedto our finding that the l_x/l_bol ratio is non-constant across themass/luminosity sequence of ic348 with a decrease towards lower luminositystars. our analysis of an analogous stellar sample in the orion nebula clustersuggests that the decline of l_x/l_ bol for young stars at the low-mass end ofthe stellar sequence is likely universal.

1302.1061	the uv and x-ray activity of the m dwarfs within 10pc of the sun	we systematically study the x-ray and ultraviolet emission of a subsample ofm dwarfs from a recent proper-motion survey, selecting all m dwarfs within 10pcto obtain a nearly volume-limited sample (~90% completeness). archival rosat,xmm-newton and galex data are combined with published spectroscopic studies ofhalpha emission and rotation to obtain a broad picture of stellar activity on mdwarfs. we make use of synthetic model spectra to determine the relativecontributions of photospheric and chromospheric emission to the ultravioletflux. we also analyse the same diagnostics for a comparison sample of young mdwarfs in the twhya association (~10myrs). we find that generally the emissionin the galex bands is dominated by the chromosphere but the photosphericcomponent is not negligible in early-m field dwarfs. the surface fluxes for thehalpha, near-ultraviolet, far-ultraviolet and x-ray emission are connected viaa power law dependence. we present here for the first time such flux-fluxrelations involving broad-band ultraviolet emission for m dwarfs. for givenspectral type the activity indices, defined as flux ratio between the activitydiagnostic and the bolometric flux of the star, display a spread of 2-3 dexwhich is largest for m4 stars. the mean activity index for fast rotators,likely representing the saturation level, decreases from x-rays over the fuv tothe nuv band and halpha, i.e. the fractional radiation output increases withatmospheric height. the comparison to the ultraviolet and x-ray properties oftwhya members shows a drop of nearly three orders of magnitude for theluminosity in these bands between ~10myr and few gyrs age. a few young fielddwarfs (&lt; 1gyr) in the 10pc sample bridge the gap indicating that the drop inmagnetic activity with age is a continuous process. the slope of the age decayis steeper for the x-ray than for the uv luminosity.

1308.5563	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects iii. photospheric and  chromospheric properties of class iii objects	we analyzed x-shooter/vlt spectra of 24 classiii sources from three nearbystar-forming regions (sigmaorionis, lupusiii, and twhya). we determined theeffective temperature, surface gravity, rotational velocity, and radialvelocity by comparing the observed spectra with synthetic bt-settl modelspectra. we investigated in detail the emission lines emerging from the stellarchromospheres and combined these data with archival x-ray data to allow for acomparison between chromospheric and coronal emissions. both x-ray and halphaluminosity as measured in terms of the bolometric luminosity are independent ofthe effective temperature for early-m stars but decline toward the end of thespectral m sequence. for the saturated early-m stars the average emission levelis almost one dex higher for x-rays than for halpha: log(l_x/l_bol) = -2.85 +-0.36 vs. log(l_halpha/l_bol) = -3.72 +- 0.21. when all chromospheric emissionlines (including the balmer series up to h11, caii hk, the caii infraredtriplet, and several hei lines) are summed up the coronal flux still dominatesthat of the chromosphere, typically by a factor 2-5. flux-flux relationsbetween activity diagnostics that probe different atmospheric layers (from thelower chromosphere to the corona) separate our sample of active pre-mainsequence stars from the bulk of field m dwarfs studied in the literature. fluxratios between individual optical emission lines show a smooth dependence onthe effective temperature. the balmer decrements can roughly be reproduced byan nlte radiative transfer model devised for another young star of similar age.future, more complete chromospheric model grids can be tested against this dataset.

1309.5827	the diagnostic potential of fe lines applied to protostellar jets	we investigate the diagnostic capabilities of the iron lines for tracing thephysical conditions of the shock-excited gas in jets driven by pre-mainsequence stars. we have analyzed the 300-2500 nm x-shooter spectra of two jetsdriven by the pre-main sequence stars eso-halpha 574 and par-lup 3-4. bothspectra are very rich in [feii] lines over the whole spectral range; inaddition, lines from [feiii] are detected in the eso-h\alpha 574 spectrum. nltecodes along with codes for the ionization equilibrium are used to derive thegas excitation conditions of electron temperature and density, and fractionalionization. the iron gas-phase abundance is provided by comparing the ironlines emissivity with that of [oi] 630 nm. the [feii] lines indicate eso-halpha574 jet is, on average, colder (t_e = 9000 k), less dense (n_e = 2 10^4 cm^-3)and more ionized (x_e = 0.7) than the par-lup 3-4 jet (t_e = 13000 k, n_e = 610^4 cm^-3, x_e &lt; 0.4), even if the existence of a higher density component(n_e = 2 10^5 cm^-3) is probed by the [feiii] and [feii] ultra-violet lines.theoretical models suggest that the shock at work in eso-halpha 574 is fasterand likely more energetic than the par-lup 3-4 shock. this latter feature isconfirmed by the high percentage of gas-phase iron measured in eso-halpha 574(50-60% of its solar abundance in comparison with less than 30% in par-lup3-4), which testifies that the eso-halpha 574 shock is powerful enough topartially destroy the dust present inside the jet. this work demonstrates thata multiline fe analysis can be effectively used to probe the excitation andionization conditions of the gas in a jet without any assumption on ionicabundances. the main limitation on the diagnostics resides in the largeuncertainties of the atomic data, which, however, can be overcome through astatistical approach involving many lines.

1310.2069	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: iv -- accretion in  low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects in lupus	we present x-shooter/vlt observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-massstellar and sub-stellar objects (ysos) in the lupus star forming region,spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2msun, but mostly with 0.1msun &lt;mstar &lt; 0.5msun. our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship betweenexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, toinvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of thecentral object. the accretion luminosity (lacc), and from it the accretion rate(macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the uv to thenear-ir, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. the flux andluminosity (ll) of a large number of emission lines of h, he, caii, etc.,observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. theluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with lacc. we provide empiricalrelationships between lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which havea lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. ourmeasurements extend the pab and brg relationships to lacc values about twoorders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. we confirmthat different methodologies to measure lacc and macc yield significantlydifferent results: ha line profile modelling may underestimate macc by 0.6 to0.8dex with respect to macc derived from continuum-excess measures. suchdifferences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between maccand other ysos properties reported in the literature. we derive macc in therange 2e-12 -- 4e-8 msun/yr and conclude that macc is proportional tomstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than inprevious studies. a number of properties indicate that the physical conditionsof the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in macc.

1406.5630	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: v - slow winds in t  tauri stars	disks around t tauri stars are known to lose mass, as best shown by theprofiles of forbidden emission lines of low ionization species. at least twoseparate kinematic components have been identified, one characterised byvelocity shifts of tens to hundreds km/s (hvc) and one with much lower velocityof few km/s (lvc). the hvc are convincingly associated to the emission of jets,but the origin of the lvc is still unknown. in this paper we analyze theforbidden line spectrum of a sample of 44 mostly low mass young stars in lupusand $\sigma$-ori observed with the x-shooter eso spectrometer. we detectforbidden line emission of [oi], [oii], [sii], [ni], and [nii], andcharacterize the line profiles as lvc, blue-shifted hvc and red-shifted hvc. wefocus our study on the lvc. we show that there is a good correlation betweenline luminosity and both l$_{star}$ and the accretion luminosity (or themass-accretion rate) over a large interval of values (l$_{star}$ $\sim 10^{-2}- 1$ l$_\odot$; l$_{acc}$ $\sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}$ l$_\odot$; $\dot m_{acc}$$\sim 10^{-11} - 10^{-7}$ m$_\odot$/yr). the lines show the presence of a slowwind ($v_{peak}&lt;20$ km/s), dense ($n_h&gt;10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), warm (t$\sim5000-10000$ k), mostly neutral. we estimate the mass of the emitting gas andprovide a value for the maximum volume it occupies. both quantities increasesteeply with the stellar mass, from $\sim 10^{-12}$ m$_\odot$ and $\sim 0.01$au$^3$ for m$_{star}$$\sim 0.1$ m$_\odot$, to $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}$m$_\odot$ and $\sim 1$ au$^3$ for m$_{star}$$\sim 1$ m$_\odot$, respectively.these results provide quite stringent constraints to wind models in low massyoung stars, that need to be explored further.

(1996)relativistic hartree-fock model. however, none of the theoretical modelspredicts a-coefficient ratios in agreement with all our determinations. we alsoshow that literature data of near-infrared intensity ratios better agree withour determinations than with theoretical expectations.

1509.07730	first x-ray dectection of the young variable v1180 cas	v1180 cas is a young variable that has shown strong photometric fluctuations(delta_i~6mag) in the recent past, which have been attributed to events ofenhanced accretion. the source has entered a new high-brightness state insept.2013, which we have previously analyzed through optical and near-irspectroscopy. to investigate the current active phase of v1180 cas, weperformed observations with the chandra satellite to study the x-ray emissionfrom the object and its connection to accretion episodes. chandra observationswere performed in early aug.2014. complementary jhk photometry and j-bandspectra were taken at our campo imperatore facility to relate the x-ray andnear-ir emission from the target. we observe a peak of x-ray emission at thenominal position of v1180 cas. this signal corresponds to an x-ray luminosityl_x(0.5-7 kev) in the range 0.8-2.2e30 erg/s. based on the relatively shortduration of the dim states in the light curve and on stellar luminosityconsiderations, we explored the possibility that the brightness minima of v1180cas are driven by extinction variations. from the analysis of the spectralenergy distribution of the high state we infer a stellar luminosity of 0.8-0.9lsun and find that the derived l_x is comparable to the average x-rayluminosities of t tauri stars. moreover, the x-ray luminosity is lower than thex-ray emission levels of 5e30 -1e31 erg/s detected at outbursts in similarlow-mass objects. our analysis suggests that at least part of the photometricfluctuations of v1180 cas might be extinction effects rather than the result ofaccretion excess emission. however, as the source displays spectral featuresindicative of active accretion, we speculate that its photometric variationsmight be the result of a combination of accretion-induced and extinction-driveneffects, as suggested for other young variables, such as v1184 tau and v2492cyg.

astro-ph;0602517	testing the companion hypothesis for the origin of the x-ray emission  from intermediate-mass main-sequence stars	there is no straightforward explanation for intrinsic x-ray emission fromintermediate-mass main-sequence stars. therefore the observed emission is ofteninterpreted in terms of (hypothesized) late-type magnetically active companionstars. we use chandra imaging observations to spatially resolve in x-rays asample of main-sequence b-type stars with recently discovered companions atarcsecond separation. we find that all spatially resolved companions are x-rayemitters, but seven out of eleven intermediate-mass stars are also x-raysources. if this emission is interpreted in terms of additional sub-arcsecondor spectroscopic companions, this implies a high multiplicity of b-type stars.firm results on b star multiplicity pending, the alternative, that b starsproduce intrinsic x-rays, can not be discarded. the appropriate scenario inthis vein is might be a magnetically confined wind, as suggested for the x-rayemission of the magnetic ap star iq aur. however, the only ap star in thechandra sample is not detected in x-rays, and therefore does not support thispicture.

astro-ph;0605590	on the origin of the x-ray emission from herbig ae/be stars	we performed a systematic search for chandra archival observations of herbigae/be stars. these stars are fully radiative and not expected to support dynamoaction analogous to their convective lower-mass counterparts, the t tauristars. their x-ray emission has remained unexplained. the superior spatialresolution of chandra with respect to previous x-ray instrumentation hasallowed us to examine the possible role of late-type companions in generatingthe observed x-rays. in the total sample of 17 herbig ae/be stars, 8 areresolved from x-ray emitting faint companions or other unrelated x-ray brightobjects within 10". the detection fraction of herbig ae/be stars is 76 %, butlowers to 35 % if all emission is attributed to further known and unresolvedcompanions. the spectral analysis confirms the high x-ray temperatures (~ 20mk) and large range of fractional x-ray luminosities (log l_x/l_star) of thisclass derived from earlier studies of individual objects. radiative winds areruled out as emission mechanism on basis of the high temperatures. the x-rayproperties of herbig ae/be stars are not vastly different from those of theirlate-type companion stars (if such are known), nor from other young late-typestars used for comparison. therefore, either a similar kind of process takesplace on both classes of objects, or there must be as yet undiscoveredcompanion stars.

astro-ph;0608651	a statistical analysis of x-ray variability in pre-main sequence objects  of the taurus molecular cloud	this work is part of a systematic x-ray survey of the taurus star formingcomplex with xmm-newton. we study the time series of all x-ray sourcesassociated with taurus members, to statistically characterize their x-rayvariability, and compare the results to those for pre-main sequence stars inthe orion nebula cluster and to expectations arising from a model where all thex-ray emission is the result of a large number of stochastically occurringflares. we find that roughly half of the detected x-ray sources showvariability above our sensitivity limit, and in ~ 26 % of the cases thisvariability is recognized as flares. variability is more frequently detected athard than at soft energies. the variability statistics of ctts and wtts areundistinguishable, suggesting a common (coronal) origin for their x-rayemission. we have for the first time applied a rigorous maximum likelihoodmethod in the analysis of the number distribution of flare energies on pre-mainsequence stars. in its differential form this distribution follows a power-lawwith index alpha = 2.4 +- 0.5, in the range typically observed on late-typestars and the sun. the flare energy distribution is probably steep enough toexplain the heating of stellar coronae by nano-flares (alpha &gt; 2), albeitassociated with a rather large uncertainty that leaves some doubt on thisconclusion.
