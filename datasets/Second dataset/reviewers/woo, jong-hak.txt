1002.3619	amuse-virgo ii. down-sizing in black hole accretion	(abridged) we complete the census of nuclear x-ray activity in 100 early typevirgo galaxies observed by the chandra x-ray telescope as part of theamuse-virgo survey, down to a (3sigma) limiting luminosity of 3.7e+38 erg/sover 0.5-7 kev. the stellar mass distribution of the targeted sample, which ismostly composed of formally `inactive' galaxies, peaks below 1e+10 m_sun, aregime where the very existence of nuclear super-massive black holes (smbhs) isdebated. out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear x-ray source, including 6 hybridnuclei which also host a massive nuclear cluster as visible from archival hstimages. after carefully accounting for contamination from nuclear low-massx-ray binaries based on the shape and normalization of their x-ray luminosityfunction, we conclude that between 24-34% of the galaxies in our sample host ax-ray active smbh (at the 95% c.l.). this sets a firm lower limit to the blackhole occupation fraction in nearby bulges within a cluster environment. at facevalue, the active fraction -down to our luminosity limit- is found to increasewith host stellar mass. however, taking into account selection effects, we findthat the average eddington-scaled x-ray luminosity scales with black hole massas m_bh^(-0.62^{+0.13}_{-0.12}), with an intrinsic scatter of0.46^({+0.08}_{-0.06}) dex. this finding can be interpreted as observationalevidence for `down-sizing' of black hole accretion in local early types, thatis, low mass black holes shine relatively closer to their eddington limit thanhigher mass objects. as a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, definedas those above a fixed x-ray eddington ratio, decreases with increasing blackhole mass.

1004.0252	the lick agn monitoring project: the mbh - sigma relation for  reverberation-mapped active galaxies	(abridged) to investigate the black hole mass (mbh) vs. stellar velocitydispersion relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions ofa sample of local seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined mbhusing reverberation mapping. for most objects, velocity dispersions weremeasured from high s/n ratio optical spectra centered on the ca ii tripletregion (~8500 a), obtained at the keck, palomar, and lick observatories. fortwo objects, in which the ca ii triplet region was contaminated by nuclearemission, the measurement was based on high-quality h-band spectra obtainedwith the osiris at the keck-ii telescope. combining our new measurements withdata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies withstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based mbh measurements in therange of black hole mass 10^6&lt;mbh/m_sun&lt;10^9. we use this sample to obtainreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of them-sigma relation of active galaxies. assuming a constant virial coefficient ffor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60and the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log(mbh/m_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those foundfor quiescent galaxies. we derive an updated value of the virial coefficient fby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreementwith the m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent m-sigmarelation determined by gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with anintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. the uncertainty of the virial coefficientremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole massdeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epochspectroscopic estimates of mbh in active galaxies.

1009.0532	the lick agn monitoring project: alternate routes to a broad-line region  radius	it is now possible to estimate black hole masses across cosmic time, usingbroad emission lines in active galaxies. this technique informs our views ofhow galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. unfortunately, there aremany outstanding uncertainties associated with these "virial" mass estimates.one of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for thebroad-line region. incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity activegalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at lick observatory, werecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretionluminosity other than the optical continuum. we find that the radius of thebroad-line region scales as the square root of the x-ray and hbetaluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. on the other hand, thescaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. this isconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line tox-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. the radius of the broad-lineregion correlates most tightly with hbeta luminosity, while the x-ray andnarrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. thesecorrelations provide useful alternative virial bh masses in objects with nodetectable optical/uv continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies withbroad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies withgalaxy-dominated continua.

0710.1839	comparing and calibrating black hole mass estimators for distant active  galactic nuclei	black hole mass is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (agns).in the distant universe, black hole mass is commonly estimated using the mgii,hbeta, or halpha emission line widths and the optical/uv continuum or lineluminosities, as proxies for the characteristic velocity and size of thebroad-line region. although they all have a common calibration in the localuniverse, a number of different recipes are currently used in the literature.it is important to verify the relative accuracy and consistency of the recipes,as systematic changes could mimic evolutionary trends when comparing varioussamples. at z=0.36, all three lines can be observed at optical wavelengths,providing a unique opportunity to compare different empirical recipes. we usespectra from the keck telescope and the sloan digital sky survey to compareblack hole mass estimators for a sample of nineteen agns at this redshift. wecompare popular recipes available from the literature, finding that massestimates can differ up to 0.38+-0.05 dex in the mean (or 0.13+-0.05 dex, ifthe same virial coefficient is adopted). finally, we provide a set of 30internally self consistent recipes for determining black hole mass from avariety of observables. the intrinsic scatter between cross-calibrated recipesis in the range 0.1-0.3 dex. this should be considered as a lower limit to theuncertainty of the black hole mass estimators.

1112.4490	the role of environment in low-level active galactic nucleus activity:  no evidence for cluster enhancement	we use the amuse-virgo and amuse-field surveys for nuclear x-ray emission inearly-type galaxies to conduct a controlled comparison of low-levelsupermassive black hole activity within cluster and field spheroids. while boththe virgo and the field samples feature highly sub-eddington x-ray luminosities(log l_x/l_edd between -8 and -4), we find that after accounting for theinfluence of host galaxy stellar mass, the field early-type galaxies tendtoward marginally greater (0.38+/-0.14 dex) nuclear x-ray luminosities, at agiven black hole mass, than their cluster counterparts. this trend isqualitatively consistent with the field black holes having access to a greaterreservoir of fuel, plausibly in the form of cold gas located near the nucleus.we are able to rule out at high confidence the alternative of enhanced x-rayactivity within clusters. presuming nuclear x-ray emission correlates with thetotal energy and momentum output of these weakly accreting black holes, thisindicates that low-level active galactic nucleus feedback is not generallystronger within typical cluster galaxies than in the field. these resultsconfirm that for most cluster early-type galaxies (i.e., excluding brightestcluster galaxies) direct environmental effects, such as gas stripping, are morerelevant in quenching star formation.

1204.5178	a keck/lris spatially-resolved spectroscopic study of a liner galaxy  sdss j091628.05+420818.7	using spatially-resolved spectra obtained with the low resolution imagingspectrometer at the keck i telescope, we investigate the nature of ionizingsources and kinematic properties of emission-line gas in a liner galaxy sdssj091628.05+420818.7, which is a nearby (z = 0.0241) and bright (m_r = -20.2)early-type galaxy. after subtracting stellar absorption features using acombination of simple stellar population models, we measure the flux,line-of-sight velocity, and velocity dispersion of four emission lines, i.e.,h{\alpha}, h{\beta}, [o iii] {\lambda}5007, and [n ii] {\lambda}6584, to studyradial change of emission-line fluxes and velocities. compared to thepoint-spread-function of the observation, the emission-line region is slightlyextended but comparable to the seeing size. the central concentration ofemission-line gas suggests that ionization is triggered by a nuclear source,excluding old stellar population as ionizing sources. we find thatemission-line gas is counter-rotating with respect to stellar component andthat the [o iii] {\lambda}5007 line is blueshifted compared to other emissionlines, possibly due to an outflow.

1205.3789	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: dynamical modeling of the broad  line region in mrk 50	we present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (blr) in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the lick agnmonitoring project (lamp) 2011. we model the reverberation mapping datadirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the blr, as well asderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizingfactor or virial coefficient. we find that the geometry of the blr in mrk 50 isa nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, awidth of the blr of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of25\pm10 degrees above the plane. we also constrain the inclination angle to be9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. finally, the black hole mass of mrk 50 isinferred to be log10(m(bh)/msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). by comparison to thevirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mappinganalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74based on aligning the m(bh)-{\sigma}* relation for agn and quiescent galaxies.while our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflowin the blr, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.

0711.2073	amuse-virgo i. super-massive black holes in low-mass spheroids	we present the first results from the agn multiwavelength survey ofearly-type galaxies in the virgo cluster (amuse-virgo). this large programtargets 100 early-type galaxies with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer onboard the chandra x-ray observatory and the multi-band imaging photometer onboard the spitzer space telescope, with the aim of providing an unbiased censusof low-level super-massive black hole (smbh) activity in the local universe.here we report on the chandra observations of the first 16 targets, and combinethem with results from archival data of another, typically more massive, 16targets. point-like x-ray emission from a position coincident with the opticalnucleus is detected in 50% of the galaxies (down to our completeness limit of~4e+38 erg/sec). two of the x-ray nuclei are hosted by galaxies (vcc1178=n4464and vcc1297=n4486b) with absolute b magnitudes fainter than -18, where nuclearstar clusters are known to become increasingly common. after carefullyaccounting for possible contamination from low mass x-ray binaries, we arguethat the detected nuclear x-ray sources are most likely powered by low-levelaccretion on to a smbh, with a &lt;11% chance contamination in vcc1178, where astar cluster is barely resolvable in archival hubble space telescope images.based on black hole mass estimates from the global properties of the hostgalaxies, all the detected nuclei are highly sub-eddington, with luminositiesin the range -8.4&lt;log(l_0.3-10kev/l_edd)&lt;-5.9. the incidence of nuclear x-rayactivity increases with the stellar mass m_star of the host galaxy: onlybetween 3-44% of the galaxies with m_star&lt;1e+10 m_sun harbor an x-ray activesmbh. the fraction rises to between 49-87% in galaxies with stellar mass above1e+10 m_sun (at the 95% confidence level).

1209.3773	recalibration of the virial factor and m-sigma relation for local active  galaxies	determining the virial factor of the broad-line region (blr) gas is crucialfor calibrating agn black hole mass estimators, since the measuredline-of-sight velocity needs to be converted into the intrinsic virialvelocity. the average virial factor has been empirically calibrated based onthe m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies, but the claimed values differ by afactor of two in recent studies. we investigate the origin of the difference bymeasuring the m-sigma relation using an updated galaxy sample from theliterature, and explore the dependence of the virial factor on various fittingmethods. we find that the discrepancy is primarily caused by the sampleselection, while the difference stemming from the various regression methods ismarginal. however, we generally prefer the fitexy and bayesian estimators basedon monte carlo simulations for the m-sigma relation. in addition, the choice ofindependent variable in the regression leads to ~0.2 dex variation in thevirial factor inferred from the calibration process. based on the determinedvirial factor, we present the updated m-sigma relation of local activegalaxies.

1302.4742	calibrating stellar velocity dispersions based on spatially-resolved  h-band spectra for improving the m-sigma relation	to calibrate stellar velocity dispersion measurements from optical andnear-ir stellar lines, and to improve the black hole mass (mbh)- stellarvelocity dispersion (sigma) relation, we measure stellar velocity dispersionsbased on high quality h-band spectra for a sample of 31 nearby galaxies, forwhich dynamical mbh is available in the literature. by comparing velocitydispersions measured from stellar lines in the h-band with those measured fromoptical stellar lines, we find no significant difference, suggesting thatoptical and near-ir stellar lines represent the same kinematics and that dusteffect is negligible for early-type galaxies. based on the spatially-resolvedrotation and velocity dispersion measurements along the major axis of eachgalaxy, we find that a rotating stellar disk is present for 80% of galaxies inthe sample. for galaxies with a rotation component, velocity dispersionsmeasured from a single aperture spectrum can vary by up to ~20%, depending onthe size of the adopted extraction aperture. to correct for the rotationalbroadening, we derive luminosity-weighted velocity dispersion within theeffective radius of each galaxy, providing uniformly measured velocitydispersions to improve the mbh-sigma relation.

1303.1742	the low-luminosity end of the radius-luminosity relationship for active  galactic nuclei	we present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between thehbeta broad-line region (blr) radius and the luminosity of the active galacticnucleus (agn). specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surfacebrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new agns imaged with thehubble space telescope wide field camera 3. the surface brightnessdecompositions allow us to create "agn-free" images of the galaxies, from whichwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measuredthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. we also incorporate 20 newreverberation-mapping measurements of the hbeta time lag, which is assumed toyield the average hbeta blr radius. the final sample includes 41 agns coveringfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. the additions and updates incorporatedhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the r-l relationship. the bestfit to the relationship using a bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simplephotoionization arguments. only two agns appear to be outliers from therelationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubtregarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. the scatter around therelationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. a large fraction of theremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distancesto the agn host galaxies. our results help support the possibility that the r-lrelationship could potentially be used to turn the blrs of agns intostandardizable candles. this would allow the cosmological expansion of theuniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a largerrange of redshifts.

1304.4643	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: fe ii reverberation from the outer  broad-line region	the prominent broad fe ii emission blends in the spectra of active galacticnuclei have been shown to vary in response to continuum variations, but pastattempts to measure the reverberation lag time of the optical fe ii lines havemet with only limited success. here we report the detection of fe iireverberation in two seyfert 1 galaxies, ngc 4593 and mrk 1511, based on datafrom a program carried out at lick observatory in spring 2011. light curves foremission lines including h-beta and fe ii were measured by applying a fittingroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-linecomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine thereverberation lags of the emission lines relative to v-band light curves. inboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of fe ii is longer than that of h-beta,although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of fe iitemplate used in the fit. for spectral decompositions done using the fe iitemplate of veron-cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1305.2946	do quiescent and active galaxies have different m_bh-sigma relations?	to investigate the validity of the assumption that quiescent galaxies andactive galaxies follow the same black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersionrelation, as required for the calibration of m_bh estimators for broad lineagns, we determine and compare the m-sigma relations, respectively, forquiescent and active galaxies. for the quiescent galaxy sample, composed of 72dynamical m_bh measurements, we update sigma for 28 galaxies using homogeneoush-band measurements that are corrected for galaxy rotation. for activegalaxies, we collect 25 reverberation-mapped agns and improve sigma measurementfor two objects . combining the two samples, we determine the virial factor$f$, first by scaling the active galaxy sample to the m-sigma relation ofquiescent galaxies, and second by simultaneously fitting the quiescent andactive galaxy samples, as f=5.1_{-1.1}^{+1.5} and f=5.9_{-1.5}^{+2.1},respectively. the m-sigma relation of active galaxies appears to be shallowerthan that of quiescent galaxies. however, the discrepancy is caused by adifference in the accessible m_bh distribution at given sigma, primarily due tothe difficulty of measuring reliable stellar velocity dispersion for the hostgalaxies of luminous agns. accounting for the selection effects, we find thatactive and quiescent galaxies are consistent with following intrinsically thesame m-sigma relation.

(2) anir echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existingdust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to haveejected another 10 msun shell about 1500 yr before the sn.

1403.4246	x-ray constraints on the local supermassive black hole occupation  fraction	distinct seed formation mechanisms are imprinted upon the fraction of dwarfgalaxies currently containing a central supermassive black hole. seeding by popiii remnants is expected to produce a higher occupation fraction than isgenerated with direct gas collapse precursors. chandra observations of nearbyearly-type galaxies can directly detect even low-level supermassive black holeactivity, and the active fraction immediately provides a firm lower limit tothe occupation fraction. here, we use the volume-limited amuse surveys of ~200optically-selected early-type galaxies to characterize simultaneously, for thefirst time, the occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear x-ray luminositywith stellar mass, accounting for intrinsic scatter, measurement uncertainties,and x-ray limits. for early-type galaxies with log(m_star/m_sun)&lt;10, we obtaina lower limit to the occupation fraction of &gt;20% (at 95% confidence), but fulloccupation cannot be excluded. the preferred dependence of log(l_x) uponlog(m_star) has a slope of about 0.7-0.8, consistent with the "downsizing"trend previously identified from the amuse dataset, and a uniform eddingtonefficiency is disfavored at ~2 sigma. we provide guidelines for the futureprecision with which these parameters may be refined with larger or moresensitive samples.

1411.6334	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. v. the relation between  black hole mass and host galaxy luminosity for a sample of 79 active galaxies	we investigate the cosmic evolution of the black hole (bh) mass -- bulgeluminosity relation using a sample of 52 active galaxies at $z \sim 0.36$ and$z \sim 0.57$ in the bh mass range of $10^{7.4-9.1} m_{\odot}$. by consistentlyapplying multi-component spectral and structural decomposition to high-qualitykeck spectra and high-resolution hst images, bh masses ($m_{\rm bh}$) areestimated using the h$\beta$ broad emission line combined with the 5100 \aa\nuclear luminosity, and bulge luminosities ($l_{\rm bul}$) are derived fromsurface photometry. comparing the resulting $m_{\rm bh}-l_{\rm bul}$ relationto local active galaxies and taking into account selection effects, we findevolution of the form $m_{\rm bh} / l_{\rm bul} \propto (1+z)^{\gamma}$ with$\gamma=1.8\pm0.7$, consistent with bh growth preceding that of the hostgalaxies. including an additional sample of 27 active galaxies with $0.5&lt;z&lt;1.9$taken from the literature and measured in a consistent way, we obtain$\gamma=0.9\pm0.7$ for the $m_{\rm bh}-l_{\rm bul}$ relation and$\gamma=0.4\pm0.5$ for the $m_{\rm bh}$--total host galaxy luminosity ($l_{\rmhost}$) relation. the results strengthen the findings from our previous studiesand provide additional evidence for host-galaxy bulge growth being dominated bydisk-to-bulge transformation via minor mergers and/or disk instabilities.

1412.4133	scaling relations between black holes and their host galaxies: comparing  theoretical and observational measurements, and the impact of selection  effects	we use the high-resolution simulation massiveblackii to examine scalingrelations between black hole mass (mbh) and host galaxy properties (sigma, m*,and lv), finding good agreement with observational data, especially at thehigh-mass end. the simulations have less intrinsic scatter than observations,and the mbh-lv correlation has the largest scatter, suggesting it may the theleast fundamental of the three relations. we find gaussian scatter about allthree relations, except among the highest mass galaxies, which host moremassive black holes. below z~2 the slopes for the full population remainroughly z-independent, and only steepen by 50% by z~4. the normalization of thesigma, lv relations evolve by 0.3, 0.43 dex, while the mbh correlation does notevolve to at least z~2. testing for selection biases, we find samples selectedby mbh or m* have steeper slopes than randomly selected samples. if unaccountedfor, such a selection function would find faster evolution than inferred from arandomly selected sample, as objects at the highend of the relation tend toevolve more rapidly. we find a potential bias among high-lbh subsamples(tending to reside in higher mass galaxies), but these bright-agn exhibit nointrinsic bias relative to fainter ones in equivalent-mass hosts, nor is therea significant difference between active- and inactive-samples. finally wecharacterize the evolution of individual black holes along the scaling planes.below the local relation, black holes grow faster than their host (72% of blackholes 0.3 dex below the mean relation have a mbh-m* trajectory steeper than thelocal relation), while those above have shallower trajectories (only 14% aresteeper than local). black holes tend to grow faster than their hosts untilsurpassing the local relation, at which point their growth is suppressed whiletheir hosts continue to grow, returning them to the mean relation.

1412.7225	the black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion relation of  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s) are arguably one of the key agnsubclasses in investigating the origin of the black hole mass - stellarvelocity dispersion (m-sigma) relation because of their high accretion rate andsignificantly low black hole mass. currently, it is under discussion whetherpresent-day nls1s offset from the m-sigma relation. using the directly measuredstellar velocity dispersion of 93 nls1s at z&lt;0.1, and black hole mass estimatesbased on the updated mass estimators, we investigate the m-sigma relation ofnls1s in comparison with broad-line agns. we find no strong evidence that thenls1s deviates from the m-sigma relation, which is defined byreverberation-mapped type 1 agns and quiescent galaxies. however, there is aclear trend of the offset with the host galaxy morphology, i.e., more inclinedgalaxies toward the line-of-sight have higher stellar velocity dispersion,suggesting that the rotational broadening plays a role in measuring stellarvelocity dispersion based on the single-aperture spectra from the sloan digitalsky survey. in addition, we provide the virial factor log f = $0.05 \pm 0.12$(f = 1.12), for black hole mass estimators based on the fwhm of h$\beta$, byjointly fitting the m-sigma relation using quiescent galaxies andreverberation-mapped agns.

(2004). using 11 agns with reliable detection of brackettlines, we derive the brackett-line-based bh mass estimators. we also find thatthe observed brackett line ratios can be explained with the commonly adoptedphysical conditions of the broad line region (blr). moreover, we fit the hotand warm dust components of the dust torus by adding photometric data of sdss,2mass, $\it{wise}$, and $\it{iso}$ to the $\it{akari}$ spectra, finding hot andwarm dust temperatures of $\sim1100\,\rm{k}$ and $\sim220\,\rm{k}$,respectively, rather than the commonly cited hot dust temperature of 1500 k.

1505.05888	far-infrared and accretion luminosities of the present-day active  galactic nuclei	we investigate the relation between star formation (sf) and black holeaccretion luminosities, using a sample of 492 type-2 active galactic nuclei(agns) at z &lt; 0.22, which are detected in the far-infrared (fir) surveys withakari and herschel. we adopt fir luminosities at 90 and 100 um as sfluminosities, assuming the proposed linear proportionality of star formationrate with fir luminosities. by estimating agn luminosities from [oiii]5007 and[oi]6300 emission lines, we find a positive linear trend between fir and agnluminosities over a wide dynamical range. this result appears to beinconsistent with the recent reports that low-luminosity agns show essentiallyno correlation between fir and x-ray luminosities, while the discrepancy islikely due to the malmquist and sample selection biases. by analyzing thespectral energy distribution, we find that pure-agn candidates, of which firradiation is thought to be agn-dominated, show significantly low-sf activities.these agns hosted by low-sf galaxies are rare in our sample (~ 1%). however,the low fraction of low-sf agn is possibly due to observational limitationssince the recent fir surveys are insufficient to examine the population ofhigh-luminosity agns hosted by low-sf galaxies.

1510.03887	accretion rates of red quasars from the hydrogen p$\beta$ line	red quasars are thought to be an intermediate population betweenmerger-driven star-forming galaxies in dust-enshrouded phase and normalquasars. if so, they are expected to have high accretion ratios, but theirintrinsic dust extinction hampers reliable determination of eddington ratios.here, we compare the accretion rates of 16 red quasars at $z \sim 0.7$ to thoseof normal type 1 quasars at the same redshift range. the red quasars areselected by their red colors in optical through near-infrared (nir) and radiodetection. the accretion rates of the red quasars are derived from the p$\beta$line in nir spectra, which is obtained by the spex on the infrared telescopefacility (irtf) in order to avoid the effects of dust extinction. we find thatthe measured eddington ratios ($l_{\rm bol}$/$l_{\rm edd} \simeq 0.69$) of redquasars are significantly higher than those of normal type 1 quasars, which isconsistent with a scenario in which red quasars are the intermediate populationand the black holes of red quasars grow very rapidly during such a stage.

1510.07626	rest-frame uv single-epoch black hole mass estimates of low-luminosity  agn at intermediate redshifts	the ability to accurately derive black hole (bh) masses at progressivelyhigher redshifts and over a wide range of continuum luminosities has becomeindispensable in the era of large-area extragalactic spectroscopic surveys. inthis paper we present an extension of existing comparisons between rest-frameuv and optical virial bh mass estimators to intermediate redshifts andluminosities comparable to the local h$\beta$ reverberation mapped activegalactic nuclei (agn). we focus on the mgii, civ, and ciii] broad emissionlines and compare them to both h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$. we use newly acquirednear-infrared spectra from the fmos instrument on the subaru telescope for 89broad-lined agn at redshifts between 0.3 and 3.5, complemented by data from theages survey. we employ two different prescriptions for measuring the emissionline widths and compare the results. we confirm that mgii shows a tightcorrelation with h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$, with a scatter of ~0.25 dex. the civand ciii] estimators, while showing larger scatter, are viable virial massestimators after accounting for a trend with the uv-to-optical luminosityratio. we find an intrinsic scatter of ~0.37 dex between balmer and carbonvirial estimators by combining our dataset with previous high redshiftmeasurements. this updated comparison spans a total of 3 decades in bh mass. wecalculate a virial factor for civ/ciii] logf(civ/ciii])=0.87 with an estimatedsystematic uncertainty of ~0.4 dex and find excellent agreement between thelocal reverberation mapped agn sample and our high-z sample.

astro-ph;0207249	agn black hole masses and bolometric luminosities	black hole mass, along with mass accretion rate, is a fundamental property ofactive galactic nuclei. black hole mass sets an approximate upper limit to agnenergetics via the eddington limit. we collect and compare all agn black holemass estimates from the literature; these 177 masses are mostly based on thevirial assumption for the broad emission lines, with the broad-line region sizedetermined from either reverberation mapping or optical luminosity. weintroduce 200 additional black hole mass estimates based on properties of thehost galaxy bulges, using either the observed stellar velocity dispersion orusing the fundamental plane relation to infer $\sigma$; these methods assumethat agn hosts are normal galaxies. we compare 36 cases for which black holemass has been generated by different methods and find, for individual objects,a scatter as high as a couple of orders of magnitude. the less direct themethod, the larger the discrepancy with other estimates, probably due to thelarge scatter in the underlying correlations assumed. using published fluxes,we calculate bolometric luminosities for 234 agns and investigate the relationbetween black hole mass and luminosity. in contrast to other studies, we findno significant correlation of black hole mass with luminosity, other than thoseinduced by circular reasoning in the estimation of black hole mass. theeddington limit defines an approximate upper envelope to the distribution ofluminosities, but the lower envelope depends entirely on the sample of agnincluded. for any given black hole mass, there is a range in eddington ratio ofup to three orders of magnitude.

astro-ph;0409006	the fundamental plane evolution of active galactic nucleus host galaxies	we measured the stellar velocity dispersions of 15 active galactic nucleus(agn) host galaxies at redshifts as high as $\sim 0.34$. combining these withpublished velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we study thefundamental plane of agn host galaxies and its evolution. bl lac hosts andradio galaxies seem to lie on the same fundamental plane as normal early-typegalaxies. the evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of agn host galaxies shows asimilar trend to that observed in normal early-type galaxies, consistent withsingle-burst passive evolution models with formation redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$.the lack of a significant difference between normal and agn host galaxies inthe fundamental plane supports the "grand unification" picture wherein agns area transient phase in the evolution of normal galaxies. the black hole masses ofbl lac objects and radio galaxies, derived using the mass -- dispersionrelation, are similar. the black hole mass is independent of bl lac type. thelocal black hole mass -- host galaxy luminosity relation of our sub-sample at$z &lt; 0.1$ is similar to that of local normal and radio galaxies, but is lesswell defined at higher redshift due to the luminosity evolution of the hostgalaxies.

astro-ph;0603648	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. i: the m_bh-sigma  relation at z=0.36	we test the evolution of the correlation between black hole mass and bulgevelocity dispersion (m$_{\rm bh}-\sigma$), using a carefully selected sample of14 seyfert 1 galaxies at $z=0.36\pm0.01$. we measure velocity dispersion fromstellar absorption lines around mgb (5175\aa) and fe (5270\aa) using high s/nkeck spectra, and estimate black hole mass from the h$\beta$ line width and theoptical luminosity at 5100\aa, based on the empirically calibratedphoto-ionization method. we find a significant offset from the local relation,in the sense that velocity dispersions were smaller for given black hole massesat $z=0.36$ than locally. we investigate various sources of systematicuncertainties and find that those cannot account for the observed offset. themeasured offset is $\delta \log m_{\rm bh}=0.62 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.25$, i.e.$\delta \log \sigma=0.15 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.06$, where the error bars include arandom component and an upper limit to the systematics. at face value, thisresult implies a substantial growth of bulges in the last 4 gyr, assuming thatthe local m$_{\rm bh}-\sigma$ relation is the universal evolutionary end-point.along with two samples of active galaxies with consistently determined blackhole mass and stellar velocity dispersion taken from the literature, wequantify the observed evolution with the best fit linear relation, $\delta \logm_{\rm bh} = (1.66\pm0.43)z + (0.04\pm0.09)$ with respect to the localrelationship of tremaine et al. (2002), and $\delta \log m_{\rm bh} =(1.55\pm0.46)z + (0.01\pm0.12)$ with respect to that of ferrarese (2002). thisresult is consistent with the growth of black holes predating the final growthof bulges at these mass scales ($&lt;\sigma&gt;$=170 km s$^{-1}$).

0812.1329	exploring the disk-jet connection from the properties of narrow line  regions in powerful young radio-loud agns	we investigate the optical emission-line flux ratios of narrow-line regions,in order to determine whether the formation of agn jets requires specificaccretion conditions. we find that bright compact radio galaxies, which arepowerful radio galaxies in the early stage of the jet activity, exhibitsystematically larger flux ratios of [o{\sc i}]$\lambda$6300/[o{\sciii}]$\lambda$5007 and smaller flux ratios of [o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007/[o{\sciii}]$\lambda$4363 than radio-quiet (rq) seyfert 2 galaxies. comparing theobserved line ratios with photoionization models, it is found that thedifference in the flux ratio of low- to high-ionization lines (e.g., [o{\sci}]$\lambda$6300/[o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007) can be well understood by thedifference in the spectral energy distribution (sed) of ionizing sources.powerful young radio-loud (yrl) agns favor sed without a strong big blue bump,i.e., a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (riaf), while rq agns areconsistent with the models adopting sed with a strong big blue bump, i.e., ageometrically thin, optically thick disk. these findings imply that theformation of powerful agn jets requires the accretion disk with harder ionizingsed (i.e., a riaf). we discuss the obscuring structure of yrl agns as aplausible origin of the difference in flux ratios of [o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007/[o{\sc iii}]$\lambda$4363.
