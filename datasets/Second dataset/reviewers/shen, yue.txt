0901.2177	modeling porous dust grains with ballistic aggregates. ii. light  scattering properties	we study the light scattering properties of random ballistic aggregatesconstructed in shen et al. (paper i). using the discrete-dipole-approximation,we compute the scattering phase function and linear polarization for randomaggregates with various sizes and porosities, and with two differentcompositions: 100% silicate and 50% silicate-50% graphite. we investigate thedependence of light scattering properties on wavelength, cluster size andporosity using these aggregate models. we find that while the shape of thephase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates, thelinear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of theaggregates, with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases.contrary to previous studies, we argue that monomer size has negligible effectson the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates, as long as theconstituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to2*pi*a_0/lambda\sim 1.6 where a_0 is the monomer radius. previous claims forsuch monomer size effects are in fact the combined effects of size parameterand porosity. finally, we present aggregate models that can reproduce the phasefunction and polarization of scattered light from the au mic debris disk andfrom cometary dust, including the negative polarization observed for comets atscattering angles 160&lt;theta&lt;180 deg. these aggregates have moderate porosities,p\sim 0.6, and are of sub-micron-size for the debris disk case, or micron-sizefor the comet case.

0903.3230	clustering of low-redshift (z &lt;= 2.2) quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we present measurements of the quasar two-point correlation function,\xi_{q}, over the redshift range z=0.3-2.2 based upon data from the sdss. usinga homogeneous sample of 30,239 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts from thedr5 quasar catalogue, our study represents the largest sample used for thistype of investigation to date. with this redshift range and an areal coverageof approx 4,000 deg^2, we sample over 25 h^-3 gpc^3 (comoving) assuming thecurrent lcdm cosmology. over this redshift range, we find that theredshift-space correlation function, xi(s), is adequately fit by a singlepower-law, with s_{0}=5.95+/-0.45 h^-1 mpc and \gamma_{s}=1.16+0.11-0.16 whenfit over s=1-25 h^-1 mpc. using the projected correlation function we calculatethe real-space correlation length, r_{0}=5.45+0.35-0.45 h^-1 mpc and\gamma=1.90+0.04-0.03, over scales of rp=1-130 h^-1 mpc. dividing the sampleinto redshift slices, we find very little, if any, evidence for the evolutionof quasar clustering, with the redshift-space correlation length stayingroughly constant at s_{0} ~ 6-7 h^-1 mpc at z&lt;2.2 (and only increasing atredshifts greater than this). comparing our clustering measurements to thosereported for x-ray selected agn at z=0.5-1, we find reasonable agreement insome cases but significantly lower correlation lengths in others. we find thatthe linear bias evolves from b~1.4 at z=0.5 to b~3 at z=2.2, withb(z=1.27)=2.06+/-0.03 for the full sample. we compare our data to analyticalmodels and infer that quasars inhabit dark matter haloes of constant mass m ~2x 10^12 h^-1 m_sol from redshifts z~2.5 (the peak of quasar activity) to z~0.[abridged]

0903.4492	supermassive black holes in the hierarchical universe: a general  framework and observational tests	(abridged) we present a simple framework for the growth and evolution ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) in the hierarchical structure formationparadigm. in our model, black hole accretion is triggered during major mergers(mass ratio&gt;~0.3) between host dark matter halos. the successive evolution ofquasar luminosities follows a universal light curve form: an initialexponential growth at constant eddington ratio of order unity until it reachesthe peak luminosity, followed by a power-law decay. assuming that the peakluminosity correlates with the post-merger halo mass, we convolve the lightcurve with the triggering rate of quasar activity to predict the quasarluminosity function (lf). our model reproduces the observed lf at 0.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 forthe full luminosity ranges probed by current optical and x-ray surveys. ourmodel reproduces both the observed redshift evolution and luminosity dependenceof the linear bias of quasar/agn clustering. due to the scatter betweeninstantaneous luminosity and halo mass, quasar/agn clustering weakly depends onluminosity at low to intermediate luminosities; but the linear bias risesrapidly with luminosity at the high luminosity end and at high redshift. in ourmodel, the eddington ratio distribution is roughly log-normal, which broadensand shifts to lower mean values from high luminosity quasars (l_bol&gt;~10^46 ergs^-1) to low luminosity agns (l_bol&lt;~ 10^45 erg s^-1), in good agreement withobservations.

0911.5208	the impact of the uncertainty in single-epoch virial black hole mass  estimates on the observed evolution of the black hole - bulge scaling  relations	recent observations of the black hole (bh) - bulge scaling relations usuallyreport positive redshift evolution, with higher redshift galaxies harboringmore massive bhs than expected from the local relations. all of these studiesfocus on broad line quasars with bh mass estimated from virial estimators basedon single-epoch spectra. since the sample selection is largely based on quasarluminosity, the cosmic scatter in the bh-bulge relation introduces astatistical bias leading to on average more massive bhs given galaxy propertiesat high redshift (lauer et al. 2007). we here emphasize a previouslyunder-appreciated statistical bias resulting from the uncertainty ofsingle-epoch virial bh mass estimators and the shape of the underlying (true)bh mass function, which leads to on average overestimation of the true bhmasses at the high-mass end (shen et al. 2008). we demonstrate that the lattervirial mass bias can contribute a substantial amount to the observed excess inbh mass at fixed bulge properties, comparable to the lauer et al. bias. thevirial mass bias is independent of the lauer et al. bias, hence if both biasesare at work, they can largely (or even fully) account for the observed bh massexcess at high redshift.

0912.0541	identifying supermassive black hole binaries with broad emission line  diagnosis	double-peaked broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei (agns) mayindicate the existence of a bound supermassive black hole (smbh) binary wheretwo distinct broad line regions (blrs) contribute together to the line profile.an alternative interpretation is a disk emitter origin for the double-peakedline profile. using simple blr models, we calculate the expected broad lineprofile for a smbh binary at different separations. under reasonableassumptions that both blrs are illuminated by the two active smbhs and that theionizing flux at the blr location is roughly constant, we confirm the emergenceof double-peaked features and radial velocity drifts of the two peaks due tothe binary orbital motion. however, such a clear double-peaked feature onlyarises in a particular stage of the binary evolution when the two bhs are closeenough such that the line-of-sight orbital velocity difference is larger thanthe fwhm of the individual broad components, while the two blrs are stillmostly distinct. prior to this stage, the velocity splitting due to the orbitmotion of the binary is too small to separate the emission from the two blrs,leading to asymmetric broad line profiles in general. when the two bhs are evencloser such that the two blrs can no longer be distinct, the line profilebecomes more complex and the splitting of the peaks does not correspond to theorbital motion of the binary. in this regime there are no coherent radialvelocity drifts in the peaks with time. asymmetric line profiles are probably afar more common signature of binary smbhs than are double-peaked profiles. wediscuss the temporal variations of the broad line profile for binary smbhs andhighlight the different behaviors of reverberation mapping in the binary anddisk emitter cases, which may serve as a feasible tool to disentangle these twoscenarios.

1003.3432	dust-free quasars in the early universe	the most distant quasars known, at redshifts z=6, generally have propertiesindistinguishable from those of lower-redshift quasars in the rest-frameultraviolet/optical and x-ray bands. this puzzling result suggests that thesedistant quasars are evolved objects even though the universe was only seven percent of its current age at these redshifts. recently one z=6 quasar was shownnot to have any detectable emission from hot dust, but it was unclear whetherthat indicated different hot-dust properties at high redshift or if it issimply an outlier. here we report the discovery of a second quasar withouthot-dust emission in a sample of 21 z=6 quasars. such apparently hot-dust-freequasars have no counterparts at low redshift. moreover, we demonstrate that thehot-dust abundance in the 21 quasars builds up in tandem with the growth of thecentral black hole, whereas at low redshift it is almost independent of theblack hole mass. thus z=6 quasars are indeed at an early evolutionary stage,with rapid mass accretion and dust formation. the two hot-dust-free quasars arelikely to be first-generation quasars born in dust-free environments and aretoo young to have formed a detectable amount of hot dust around them.

1004.1173	constraints on black hole duty cycles and the black hole-halo relation  from sdss quasar clustering	we use shen et al.'s (2009) measurements of luminosity-dependent clusteringin the sdss data release 5 quasar catalog, at redshifts 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, toconstrain the relation between quasar luminosity and host halo mass and toinfer the duty cycle f_opt, the fraction of black holes that shine as opticallyluminous quasars at a given time. we assume a monotonic mean relation betweenquasar luminosity and host halo mass, with log-normal scatter \sigma. forspecified f_opt and \sigma, matching the observed quasar space densitydetermines the normalization of the luminosity-halo mass relation, from whichwe predict the clustering bias. the data show no change of bias between thefaint and bright halves of the quasar sample but a modest increase in bias forthe brightest 10%. at the mean redshift z=1.45 of the sample, the data can bewell described either by models with small intrinsic scatter (\sigma=0.1 dex)and a duty cycle f_opt=6*10^(-4) or by models with much larger duty cycles andlarger values of the scatter. "continuity equation" models of the black holemass population imply f_opt &gt; 2*10^(-3) in this range of masses and redshifts,and the combination of this constraint with the clustering measurements impliesscatter \sigma &gt; 0.4 dex. these findings contrast with those inferred from themuch stronger clustering of high-luminosity quasars at z~4, which requireminimal scatter between luminosity and halo mass and duty cycles close to one.

1006.5452	on the populations of radio galaxies with extended morphology at z&lt;0.3	extended extragalactic radio sources have traditionally been classified intofr i and ii types, based on the ratio r of the separation s between thebrightest regions on either sides of the host galaxy and the total size t ofthe radio source. here we examine the distribution of various physicalproperties as a function of r of 1040 luminous radio galaxies (rgs) at z&lt;0.3from the sdss, nvss, and first. about 2/3 of the rgs are lobe-dominated (ld),and 1/3 have prominent jets. if we follow the original definition of the frtypes (a division based solely on r), fr i and fr ii rgs overlap in their hostgalaxy properties. however, the rare, ld sources with r&gt;0.8 and oiii5007 lineluminosity &gt;10^6 lsun are markedly different on average from the rest of thergs, in the sense that they are hosted in lower mass galaxies, live inrelatively sparse environments, and have higher accretion rates onto thecentral smbh. thus these objects and the rest of rgs form a well-defineddichotomy. motivated by the stark differences in the nuclear emission lineproperties of the rg subsamples, we suggest that the accretion rate onto thesmbh may play the primary role in creating the different morphologies. atrelatively high accretion rates, the accretion system may produce powerful jetsthat create the "classical double" morphology (roughly corresponding to the ldsources with r&gt;0.8 and emission lines); at lower accretion rates the jets froma radiatively inefficient accretion flow generate radio lobes without apparent"hot spots" at the edge (corresponding to the majority of ld sources). atslightly lower accretion rates and in galaxies with dense galactic structure,sources with prominent jets result. it is possible that while the highaccretion rate systems could affect sub-mpc scale environments, the jets fromlower accretion rate systems may efficiently suppress activity within the hostgalaxies.

1011.2282	unification of luminous type 1 quasars through civ emission	using a sample of 30,000 quasars from sdss-dr7, we explore the range ofproperties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as civ1549. specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between l_uv andemission line eqw (the baldwin effect) and the "blueshifting" ofhigh-ionization emission lines. the blueshift of the civ emission line isnearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (rq) quasarsand 360 km/s for radio-loud (rl) quasars, and the baldwin effect is present inboth rq and rl samples. composite spectra are constructed as a function of civemission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships betweendifferent line species and the sed. within a two-component disk+wind model ofthe broad emission line region (belr), where the wind filters the continuumseen by the disk component, we find that rl quasars are consistent with beingdominated by the disk component, while balqsos are consistent with beingdominated by the wind component. some rq objects have emission line featuressimilar to rl quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (bh) spinto form radio jets. our results suggest that there could be significantsystematic errors in the determination of l_bol and bh mass that make itdifficult to place these findings in a more physical context. however, it ispossible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of belrparameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the sed, whichultimately must be tied to bh mass and accretion rate.

1011.5246	type 2 active galactic nuclei with double-peaked [oiii] lines. ii.  single agns with complex narrow-line region kinematics are more common than  binary agns	(abridged) approximately 1% of low redshift (z&lt;0.3) optically-selected type 2agns show a double-peaked [oiii] narrow emission line profile in theirspatially-integrated spectra. such features are usually interpreted as dueeither to kinematics, such as biconical outflows and/or disk rotation of thenarrow line region (nlr) around single black holes, or to the relative motionof two distinct nlrs in a merging pair of agns. here we report follow-up nearinfrared (nir) imaging and optical slit spectroscopy of 31 double-peaked [oiii]type 2 agns drawn from the sdss parent sample presented in liu et al (2010).these data reveal a mixture of origins for the double-peaked feature. roughly10% of our objects are best explained by binary agns at (projected) kpc-scaleseparations, where two stellar components with spatially coincident nlrs areseen. ~ 50% of our objects have [oiii] emission offset by a few kpc,corresponding to the two velocity components seen in the sdss spectra, butthere are no corresponding double stellar components seen in the nir imaging.for those objects with sufficiently high quality slit spectra, we see velocityand/or velocity dispersion gradients in [oiii] emission, suggestive of thekinematic signatures of a single nlr. the remaining ~40% of our objects areambiguous, and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguishbetween the two scenarios. our observations therefore favor the kinematicsscenario with a single agn for the majority of these double-peaked [oiii] type2 agns. we emphasize the importance of combining imaging and slit spectroscopyin identifying kpc binary agns, i.e., in no cases does one of these alone allowan unambiguous identification. we estimate that ~ 0.5-2.5% of the z&lt;0.3 type 2agns are kpc-scale binary agns of comparable luminosities, with a relativeorbital velocity &gt;~150 km/s.

1104.0778	on the link between associated mgii absorbers and star formation in  quasar hosts	a few percent of quasars show strong associated mgii absorption, withvelocities (v_off) lying within a few thousand km/s from the quasar systemicredshift. these associated absorption line systems (aals) are usuallyinterpreted as absorbers that are either intrinsic to the quasar and its host,or arising from external galaxies clustering around the quasar. using compositespectra of ~1,800 mgii aal quasars selected from sdss dr7 at 0.4&lt;~ z&lt;~2, weshow that quasars with aals with v_off&lt;1500 km/s have a prominent excess in[oii]3727 emission (detected at &gt;7sigma) at rest to the quasar host, comparedto unabsorbed quasars. we interpret this [oii] excess as due to enhanced starformation in the quasar host. our results suggest that a significant fractionof aals with v_off&lt;1500 km/s are physically associated with the quasar and itshost, and are most likely large-scale flows with typical velocities of a fewhundred km/s. aal quasars also have dust reddening lying between normal quasarsand the so-called dust-reddened quasars. we suggest that the unique propertiesof aal quasars can be explained if they are the transitional population fromheavily dust-reddened quasar to normal quasars in the formation process ofquasars and their hosts. this scenario predicts a larger fraction of youngbulges, disturbed morphologies and interactions of aal quasar hosts compared tonormal quasars. the intrinsic link between associated absorbers and quasarhosts opens a new window to probe massive galaxy formation and galactic-scalefeedback processes, and provides a crucial test of the evolutionary picture ofquasars.

1203.4570	the halo occupation distribution of sdss quasars	we present an estimate of the projected two-point correlation function (2pcf)of quasars in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) over the full range of one-and two-halo scales, 0.02-120 mpc/h. this was achieved by combining data fromsdss dr7 on large scales and hennawi et al. (2006; with appropriate statisticalcorrections) on small scales. our combined clustering sample is the largestspectroscopic quasar clustering sample to date, containing ~48,000 quasars inthe redshift range 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 with median redshift 1.4. we interpret theseprecise 2pcf measurements within the halo occupation distribution (hod)framework and constrain the occupation functions of central and satellitequasars in dark matter halos. in order to explain the small-scale clustering,the hod modeling requires that a small fraction of z~1.4 quasars,fsat=(7.4+/-1.4) 10^(-4), be satellites in dark matter halos. at z~1.4, themedian masses of the host halos of central and satellite quasars areconstrained to be mcen=(4.1+0.3/-0.4) 10^12 msun/h and msat=(3.6+0.8/-1.0)10^14 msun/h, respectively. to investigate the redshift evolution of thequasar-halo relationship, we also perform hod modeling of the projected 2pcfmeasured by shen et al. (2007) for sdss quasars with median redshift 3.2. wefind tentative evidence for an increase in the mass scale of quasar hosthalos---the inferred median mass of halos hosting central quasars at z~3.2 ismcen=(14.1+5.8/-6.9) 10^12 msun/h. the cutoff profiles of the mean occupationfunctions of central quasars reveal that quasar luminosity is more tightlycorrelated with halo mass at higher redshifts. the average quasar duty cyclearound the median host halo mass is inferred to be fq=(7.3+0.6/-1.5) 10^(-4) atz~1.4 and fq=(8.6+20.4/-7.2) 10^(-2) at z~3.2. we discuss the implications ofour results for quasar evolution and quasar-galaxy co-evolution.

1203.5306	the clustering of intermediate redshift quasars as measured by the  baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	we measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range2.2&lt;z&lt;2.8 using data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. we use ahomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopicredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements atthese redshifts to date. the sample covers 3,600 square degrees, correspondingto a comoving volume of 9.7(gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial lambdacdm cosmology,and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. afteraccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlationfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm0.5)mpc/h over the range 3&lt;s&lt;25mpc/h. the projected correlation function, whichintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fitwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)mpc/h over the range4&lt;r&lt;16mpc/h. there is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependenceto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range inour sample. our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previousmeasurements at similar redshifts. our measurement of the quasar clusteringamplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. we compare thedata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matterhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristicmass of &lt;m&gt;~10^{12}msun/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 percent.

1208.0836	broad absorption line disappearance on multi-year timescales in a large  quasar sample	we present 21 examples of c iv broad absorption line (bal) troughdisappearance in 19 quasars selected from systematic multi-epoch observationsof 582 bright bal quasars (1.9 &lt; z &lt; 4.5) by the sloan digital sky survey-i/ii(sdss-i/ii) and sdss-iii. the observations span 1.1-3.9 yr rest-frametimescales, longer than have been sampled in many previous bal variabilitystudies. on these timescales, ~2.3% of c iv bal troughs disappear and ~3.3% ofbal quasars show a disappearing trough. these observed frequencies suggest thatmany c iv bal absorbers spend on average at most a century along our line ofsight to their quasar. ten of the 19 bal quasars showing c iv bal disappearancehave apparently transformed from bal to non-bal quasars; these are the firstreported examples of such transformations. the bal troughs that disappear tendto be those with small-to-moderate equivalent widths, relatively shallowdepths, and high outflow velocities. other non-disappearing c iv bals in thosenine objects having multiple troughs tend to weaken when one of themdisappears, indicating a connection between the disappearing andnon-disappearing troughs, even for velocity separations as large as 10000-15000km/s. we discuss possible origins of this connection including disk-windrotation and changes in shielding gas.

1209.0477	the demographics of broad line quasars in the mass-luminosity plane ii.  black hole mass and eddington ratio functions	we employ a flexible bayesian technique to estimate the black hole mass andeddington ratio functions for type 1 (i.e., broad line) quasars from auniformly-selected data set of ~58,000 quasars from the sdss dr7. we find thatthe sdss becomes significantly incomplete at m_{bh} &lt; 3 x 10^8 m_{sun} or l /l_{edd} &lt; 0.07, and that the number densities of type 1 quasars continue toincrease down to these limits. both the mass and eddington ratio functions showevidence of downsizing, with the most massive and highest eddington ratio blackholes experiencing type 1 quasar phases first, although the eddington rationumber densities are flat at z &lt; 2. we estimate the maximum eddington ratio oftype 1 quasars in the observable universe to be l / l_{edd} ~ 3. consistentwith our results in paper i, we do not find statistical evidence for aso-called "sub-eddington boundary" in the mass-luminosity plane of broad linequasars, and demonstrate that such an apparent boundary in the observeddistribution can be caused by selection effect and errors in virial bh massestimates. based on the typical eddington ratio in a given mass bin, weestimate typical growth times for the black holes in type 1 quasars and findthat they are typically comparable to or longer than the age of the universe,implying an earlier phase of accelerated (i.e., with higher eddington ratios)and possibly obscured growth. the large masses probed by our sample imply thatmost of our black holes reside in what are locally early type galaxies, and weinterpret our results within the context of models of self-regulated black holegrowth.

1210.6389	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: the quasar  luminosity function from data release nine	we present a new measurement of the optical quasar luminosity function (qlf),using data from the sloan digital sky survey-iii: baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (sdss-iii: boss). from the sdss-iii data release nine(dr9), we select a uniform sample of 22,301 i&lt;=21.8 quasars over an area of2236 sq. deg with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts between 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5, fillingin a key part of the luminosity-redshift plane for optical quasar studies. wederive the completeness of the survey through simulated quasar photometry, andcheck this completeness estimate using a sample of quasars selected by theirphotometric variability within the boss footprint. we investigate the level ofsystematics associated with our quasar sample using the simulations, in theprocess generating color-redshift relations and a new quasar k-correction. weprobe the faint end of the qlf to m_i(z=2.2) = -24.5 and see a clear break inthe qlf at all redshifts up to z=3.5. we find that a log-linear relation (inlog[phi*] - m*) for a luminosity and density evolution (lede) model adequatelydescribes our data within the range 2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5; across this interval the breakluminosity increases by a factor of ~2.3 while phi* declines by a factor of ~6.at z&lt;2.2 our data is reasonably well fit by a pure luminosity evolution (ple)model. we see only a weak signature of "agn downsizing", in line with recentstudies of the hard x-ray luminosity function. we compare our measured qlf to anumber of theoretical models and find that models making a variety ofassumptions about quasar triggering and halo occupation can fit our data over awide range of redshifts and luminosities.

1212.4526	cross-correlation of sdss dr7 quasars and dr10 boss galaxies: the weak  luminosity dependence of quasar clustering at z~0.5	we present the measurement of the two-point cross-correlation function (ccf)of 8,198 sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) quasars and349,608 dr10 cmass galaxies from the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey(boss) at redshift &lt;z&gt;~0.5 (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9). the cross-correlation function can bereasonably well fit by a power-law model xi_qg(r)=(r/r_0)^(-gamma) on projectedscales of r_p=2-25 mpc/h with r_0=6.61+-0.25 mpc/h and gamma=1.69+-0.07. weestimate a quasar linear bias of b_q=1.38+-0.10 at &lt;z&gt;=0.53 from the ccfmeasurements. this linear bias corresponds to a characteristic host halo massof ~4x10^12 m_sun/h, compared to ~10^13 m_sun/h characteristic host halo massfor cmass galaxies. we divide the quasar sample in luminosity and constrain theluminosity dependence of quasar bias to be db_q/dlogl=0.20+-0.34 or 0.11+-0.32(depending on different luminosity divisions) for quasar luminosities-23.5&gt;m_i(z=2)&gt;-25.5, implying a weak luminosity dependence of quasarclustering for the bright end of the quasar population at &lt;z&gt;~0.5. we compareour measurements with theoretical predictions, halo occupation distribution(hod) models and mock catalogs. these comparisons suggest quasars reside in abroad range of host halos, and the host halo mass distributions significantlyoverlap with each other for quasars at different luminosities, implying a poorcorrelation between halo mass and instantaneous quasar luminosity. we also findthat the quasar hod parameterization is largely degenerate such that differenthods can reproduce the ccf equally well, but with different outcomes such asthe satellite fraction and host halo mass distribution. these results highlightthe limitations and ambiguities in modeling the distribution of quasars withthe standard hod approach and the need for additional information in populatingquasars in dark matter halos with hod.

1302.2643	the mass of quasars	i review the current status of quasar black hole (bh) mass estimations.spectroscopic methods have been developed to estimate bh mass in broad linequasars to an accuracy of ~0.5 dex. despite their popularity, significantissues and confusion remain regarding these mass estimators. i provide anin-depth discussion on the merits and caveats of the single-epoch (se) virialbh mass estimators, and a detailed derivation of the statistical biases ofthese se mass estimates resulting from their errors. i show that error-inducedsample biases on the order of a factor of several are likely present in the semass estimates for flux-limited, statistical quasar samples, and thedistribution of se masses in finite luminosity bins can be narrower than thenominal uncertainty of these mass estimates. i then discuss the latestapplications of se virial masses in quasar studies, including the early growthof supermassive black holes, quasar demography in the mass-luminosity plane,and the evolution of the bh-host scaling relations, with specific emphases onselection effects and sample biases in the se masses. i conclude that there isa pressing need to understand and deal with the errors in these bh massestimates, and to improve these bh weighing methods with substantially more andbetter reverberation mapping data.

0801.1115	space density of optically-selected type 2 quasars	type 2 quasars are luminous active galactic nuclei (agn) whose centralregions are obscured by large amounts of gas and dust. in this paper, wepresent a catalog of type 2 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),selected based on their optical emission lines. the catalog contains 887objects with redshifts z &lt; 0.83; this is six times larger than the previousversion and is by far the largest sample of type 2 quasars in the literature.we derive the [oiii]5008 luminosity function for 10^8.3 lsun &lt; l[oiii] &lt; 10^10lsun (corresponding to intrinsic luminosities up to m[2400a]-28 mag orbolometric luminosities up to 4x10^47 erg/sec). this luminosity functionprovides strong lower limits to the actual space density of obscured quasars,due to our selection criteria, the details of the spectroscopic targetselection, as well as other effects. we derive the equivalent luminosityfunction for the complete sample of type 1 (unobscured) quasars; then, wedetermine the ratio of type 2/type 1 quasar number densities. our best dataconstrain this ratio to be at least 1.5:1 for 10^8.3 lsun &lt; l[oiii] &lt; 10^9.5lsun at z &lt; 0.3, and at least 1.2:1 for l[oiii]=10^10 lsun at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.83.type 2 quasars are at least as abundant as type 1 quasars in the relativelynearby universe (z &lt; 0.8) for the highest luminosities.

1306.2680	broad absorption line quasars with redshifted troughs: high-velocity  infall or rotationally dominated outflows?	we report the discovery in the sloan digital sky survey and the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of seventeen broad absorption line(bal) quasars with high-ionization troughs that include absorption redshiftedrelative to the quasar rest frame. the redshifted troughs extend to velocitiesup to v=12,000 km/s and the trough widths exceed 3000 km/s in all but one case.approximately 1 in 1000 bal quasars with blueshifted c iv absorption also hasredshifted c iv absorption; objects with c iv absorption present only atredshifted velocities are roughly four times rarer. in more than half of ourobjects, redshifted absorption is seen in c ii or al iii as well as c iv,making low-ionization absorption at least ten times more common among balquasars with redshifted troughs than among standard bal quasars. however, the civ absorption equivalent widths in our objects are on average smaller thanthose of standard bal quasars with low-ionization absorption. we considerseveral possible ways of generating redshifted absorption. the two most likelypossibilities may be at work simultaneously, in the same objects or indifferent ones. rotationally dominated outflows seen against a quasar'sextended continuum source can produce redshifted and blueshifted absorption,but variability consistent with this scenario is seen in only one of the fourobjects with multiple spectra. the infall of relatively dense andlow-ionization gas to radii as small as 400 schwarzschild radii can inprinciple explain the observed range of trough profiles, but current models donot easily explain the origin and survival of such gas. whatever the origin(s)of the absorbing gas in these objects, it must be located at small radii toexplain its large redshifted velocities, and thus offers a novel probe of theinner regions of quasars.

1306.4330	constraining sub-parsec binary supermassive black holes in quasars with  multi-epoch spectroscopy. i. the general quasar population	we perform a systematic search for sub-parsec binary supermassive black holes(bhs) in normal broad line quasars at z&lt;0.8, using multi-epoch sdssspectroscopy of the broad hbeta line. our working model is that: only one ofthe two bhs in the binary is active, and dynamically dominates its own broadline region (blr); the inactive companion bh is orbiting at a distance of a fewr_blr, where r_blr~0.01-0.1 pc is the blr size. we search for the expectedline-of-sight acceleration of the broad line velocity from binary orbitalmotion by cross-correlating sdss spectra from two epochs separated by up toseveral years in the quasar restframe. out of ~700 pairs of spectra for whichwe have good measurements of the velocity shift between two epochs (1-sigmaerror~40 km/s), we detect 28 systems with significant velocity shifts in broadhbeta, among which seven are the best candidates for the hypothesized binaries.we use the distribution of the observed accelerations (mostly non-detections)to place constraints on the abundance of such binary systems among the generalquasar population. excess variance in the velocity shift is inferred forobservations separated by longer than 0.4 yr (quasar restframe). attributingall the excess to binary motion would imply that most of the quasars in thissample must be in binaries; that the inactive bh must be on average moremassive than the active one; and that the binary separation is at most a fewtimes the size of the blr. however, if this excess variance is partly orlargely due to long-term broad line variability, the requirement of a largepopulation of close binaries is much weakened or even disfavored for massivecompanions.

1312.6694	constraining sub-parsec binary supermassive black holes in quasars with  multi-epoch spectroscopy. ii. the population with kinematically offset broad  balmer emission lines	a small fraction of quasars have long been known to show bulk velocityoffsets in the broad balmer lines with respect to the systemic redshift of thehost galaxy. models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line regiongas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (bhs), orbital motion ofmassive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (bbhs), or recoil bhs, but single-epochspectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. the line-of-sight(los) radial velocity (rv) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring canbe used to test the bbh hypothesis. we have selected a sample of 399 quasarswith offset broad h-beta lines from the sdss dr7 quasar catalog, and haveconducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. combined with theexisting sdss spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the los rvshifts of broad h-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years tonearly a decade. using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%confidence) radial accelerations in the broad h-beta lines in 24 of the 50objects. we suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc bbh candidates,which show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a secondbroad line (either h-alpha or mg ii) without significant changes in thebroad-line profiles. combining the results on the general quasar populationstudied in paper i, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocityoffset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between twoepochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the timeseparation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbitalperiod of the motion causing the line displacement. we discuss the implicationsof our results for the identification of sub-pc bbh candidates in offset-linequasars and for the constraints on their frequency and orbital parameters.[abridged]

1402.0548	a hunt for dual radio active galactic nuclei in the vlass	this whitepaper describes how the vlass could be designed in a manner toallow the identification of candidate dual active galactic nuclei (agn) atseparations &lt;7 kpc. dual agn represent a clear marker of two supermassive blackholes within an ongoing merger. a dual agn survey will provide a wealth ofstudies in structure growth and gravitational-wave science. radio wavelengthsare ideal for identifying close pairs, as disturbed stellar and gaseousmaterial can obscure their presence in optical and shorter wavelengths. withsufficiently high resolution and sensitivity, a large-scale radio imagingsurvey like the vlass will uncover many of these systems and provide the meansto broadly study the radio properties of candidate dual systems revealed atother wavelengths. we determine that the ideal survey for our purposes will beat as high a resolution as possible, with significantly more science return ina array at l-band or higher, or b array at c-band or higher. we describe arange of potential survey parameters within this document. based on theanalysis outlined in this whitepaper, our ideal survey would create a catalogueof $\gtrsim$100 dual agn in either: 1) a medium-sensitivity (~1 mjy detectionthreshold), wide-field (few thousand square degree) survey, or 2) ahigh-sensitivity (~10 ujy threshold) survey of several hundred square degrees.

1407.2250	the dependence of c iv broad absorption line properties on accompanying  si iv and al iii absorption: relating quasar-wind ionization levels,  kinematics, and column densities	we consider how the profile and multi-year variability properties of a largesample of c iv broad absorption line (bal) troughs change when bals from si ivand/or al iii are present at corresponding velocities, indicating that theline-of-sight intercepts at least some lower ionization gas. we derive a numberof observational results for c iv bals separated according to the presence orabsence of accompanying lower ionization transitions, including measurements ofcomposite profile shapes, equivalent width (ew), characteristic velocities,composite variation profiles, and ew variability. we also measure thecorrelations between ew and fractional-ew variability for c iv, si iv, and aliii. our measurements reveal the basic correlated changes between ionizationlevel, kinematics, and column density expected in accretion-disk wind models;e.g., lines-of-sight including lower ionization material generally show deeperand broader c iv troughs that have smaller minimum velocities and that are lessvariable. many c iv bals with no accompanying si iv or al iii bals may haveonly mild or no saturation.

1408.5970	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: technical  overview	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project (sdss-rm) is adedicated multi-object rm experiment that has spectroscopically monitored asample of 849 broad-line quasars in a single 7 deg$^2$ field with the sdss-iiiboss spectrograph. the rm quasar sample is flux-limited to i_psf=21.7 mag, andcovers a redshift range of 0.1&lt;z&lt;4.5. optical spectroscopy was performed during2014 jan-jul dark/grey time, with an average cadence of ~4 days, totaling morethan 30 epochs. supporting photometric monitoring in the g and i bands wasconducted at multiple facilities including the cfht and the steward observatorybok telescopes in 2014, with a cadence of ~2 days and covering all lunarphases. the rm field (ra, dec=14:14:49.00, +53:05:00.0) lies within the cfht-lsw3 field, and coincides with the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) medium deep field md07,with three prior years of multi-band ps1 light curves. the sdss-rm 6-monthbaseline program aims to detect time lags between the quasar continuum andbroad line region (blr) variability on timescales of up to several months (inthe observed frame) for ~10% of the sample, and to anchor the time baseline forcontinued monitoring in the future to detect lags on longer timescales and athigher redshift. sdss-rm is the first major program to systematically explorethe potential of rm for broad-line quasars at z&gt;0.3, and will investigate theprospects of rm with all major broad lines covered in optical spectroscopy.sdss-rm will provide guidance on future multi-object rm campaigns on largerscales, and is aiming to deliver more than tens of blr lag detections for ahomogeneous sample of quasars. we describe the motivation, design andimplementation of this program, and outline the science impact expected fromthe resulting data for rm and general quasar science.

1408.6952	single-epoch black hole mass estimators for broad-line active galactic  nuclei: recalibrating hbeta with a new approach	based on an updated hbeta reverberation mapping (rm) sample of 44 nearbyactive galactic nuclei (agn), we propose a novel approach for black hole (bh)mass estimation using two filtered luminosities computed from single-epoch (se)agn spectra around the hbeta region. we found that the two optimal-filterluminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broadline region, blr) from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical bhmass estimator. the major advantages of this new recipe over traditional se bhmass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad line width are: 1) ithas a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against rm masses; 2) itis extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose thespectrum; 3) it produces unambiguous and highly repeatable results even withlow signal-to-noise spectra. the combination of the two luminosities can alsocancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially introducedby uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. in addition, we recalibratedthe traditional se mass estimators using broad hbeta full width at half maximum(fwhm) and monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100a (l_5100). we found thatusing the best-fit slopes on fwhm and l_5100 (derived from fitting the blrradius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line dispersion andse fwhm, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for l_5100 and2 for fwhm) leads to more precise se mass estimates, improving the intrinsicscatter from 0.41 dex to 0.36 dex with respect to the rm masses. we compareddifferent estimators and discussed their applications to the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) quasar sample. due to the limitations of the current rm sample,application of any se recipe calibrated against rm masses to distant quasarsshould be treated with caution.

1409.2887	the diversity of quasars unified by accretion and orientation	quasars are rapidly accreting supermassive black holes at the center ofmassive galaxies. they display a broad range of properties across allwavelengths, reflecting the diversity in the physical conditions of the regionsclose to the central engine. these properties, however, are not random, butform well-defined trends. the dominant trend is known as eigenvector 1, wheremany properties correlate with the strength of optical iron and [oiii]emission. the main physical driver of eigenvector 1 has long been suspected tobe the quasar luminosity normalized by the mass of the hole (the eddingtonratio), an important quantity of the black hole accretion process. but adefinitive proof has been missing. here we report an analysis of archival datathat reveals that eddington ratio indeed drives eigenvector 1. we also findthat orientation plays a significant role in determining the observedkinematics of the gas, implying a flattened, disklike geometry for thefast-moving clouds close to the hole. our results show that most of thediversity of quasar phenomenology can be unified with two simple quantities,eddington ratio and orientation.

1409.4493	molecular-scale hydrophilicity induced by solute: molecular-thick  charged pancakes of aqueous salt solution on hydrophobic carbon-based  surfaces	we directly observed molecular-thick aqueous salt-solution pancakes on ahydrophobic graphite surface under ambient conditions employing atomic forcemicroscopy. this observation indicates the unexpected molecular-scalehydrophilicity of the salt solution on graphite surfaces, which is differentfrom the macroscopic wetting property of a droplet standing on the graphitesurface. interestingly, the pancakes spontaneously displayed strong positivelycharged behavior. theoretical studies showed that the formation of suchpositively charged pancakes is attributed to cation-{\pi} interactions betweenna+ ions in the aqueous solution and aromatic rings on the graphite surface,promoting the adsorption of water molecules together with cations onto thegraphite surface; i.e., na+ ions as a medium adsorbed to the graphite surfacethrough cation-{\pi} interactions on one side while at the same time bonding towater molecules through hydration interaction on the other side at a molecularscale. these findings suggest that actual interactions regarding carbon-basedgraphitic surfaces including those of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and biocharmay be significantly different from existing theory and they provide newinsight into the control of surface wettability, interactions and relatedphysical, chemical and biological processes.

1412.0342	a real-time fast radio burst: polarization detection and multiwavelength  follow-up	fast radio bursts (frbs) are one of the most tantalizing mysteries of theradio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapidmultiwavelength follow-up of an frb has been possible. new instrumentation hasdecreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, andenables polarimetry to be performed on frbs for the first time. we havediscovered an frb (frb 140514) in real-time on 14 may, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 utcat the parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengthswithin hours of the event. frb 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (dm)of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z\lesssim 0.5$. frb 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularlypolarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linearpolarization $&lt;10%$. we conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to thefrb. if there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected fromcoherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by faraday rotation causedby passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. frb140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known frb fields, andlies close to a previous discovery, frb 110220; based on the difference in dmsof these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity tosampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. follow-up conductedby 12 telescopes observing from x-ray to radio wavelengths was unable toidentify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out modelsin which frbs originate from nearby ($z &lt; 0.3$) supernovae and long durationgamma-ray bursts.

1501.00963	the eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey:  final data from sdss-iii	the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original sdss wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. all the datafrom sdss-iii are now made public. in particular, this paper describes datarelease 11 (dr11) including all data acquired through 2013 july, and datarelease 12 (dr12) adding data acquired through 2014 july (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of sdss-iii observing.relative to our previous public release (dr10), dr12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of h-band spectra of stars as part of the apache point observatory (apo)galactic evolution experiment (apogee), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the multi-object apo radial velocityexoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the apogee outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. in total, sdss-iii added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of thesloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 (segue-2) survey;2,497,484 boss spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 apogee spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040marvels spectra of 5,513 stars. since its first light in 1998, sdss has imagedover 1/3 of the celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.

1502.01034	the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project: no evidence  for evolution in the m-sigma relation to z~1	we present host stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 88broad-line quasars at 0.1&lt;z&lt;1 (46 at z&gt;0.6) from the sloan digital sky surveyreverberation mapping (sdss-rm) project. high signal-to-noise ratio coaddedspectra (average s/n~30 per 69 km/s pixel) from sdss-rm allowed decompositionof the host and quasar spectra, and measurement of the host stellar velocitydispersions and black hole (bh) masses using the single-epoch (se) virialmethod. the large sample size and dynamic range in luminosity(l5100=10^(43.2-44.7) erg/s) lead to the first clear detection of a correlationbetween se virial bh mass and host stellar velocity dispersion far beyond thelocal universe. however, the observed correlation is significantly flatter thanthe local relation, suggesting that there are selection biases in high-zluminosity-threshold quasar samples for such studies. our uniform sample andanalysis enable an investigation of the redshift evolution of the m-sigmarelation free of caveats by comparing different samples/analyses at disjointredshifts. we do not observe evolution of the m-sigma relation in our sample,up to z~1, but there is an indication that the relation flattens towards higherredshifts. coupled with the increasing threshold luminosity with redshift inour sample, this again suggests certain selection biases are at work, andsimple simulations demonstrate that a constant m-sigma relation is favored toz~1. our results highlight the scientific potential of deep coaddedspectroscopy from quasar monitoring programs, and offer a new path to probe theco-evolution of bhs and galaxies at earlier times.

1503.02085	x-ray insights into the nature of phl 1811 analogs and weak  emission-line quasars: unification with a geometrically thick accretion disk?	we present an x-ray and multiwavelength study of 33 weak emission-linequasars (wlqs) and 18 quasars that are analogs of the extreme wlq, phl 1811, atz ~ 0.5-2.9. new chandra 1.5-9.5 ks exploratory observations were obtained for32 objects while the others have archival x-ray observations. significantfractions of these luminous type 1 quasars are distinctly x-ray weak comparedto typical quasars, including 16 (48%) of the wlqs and 17 (94%) of the phl 1811analogs with average x-ray weakness factors of 17 and 39, respectively. wemeasure a relatively hard ($\gamma=1.16_{-0.32}^{+0.37}$) effective power-lawphoton index for a stack of the x-ray weak subsample, suggesting x-rayabsorption, and spectral analysis of one phl 1811 analog, j1521+5202, alsoindicates significant intrinsic x-ray absorption. we compare composite sdssspectra for the x-ray weak and x-ray normal populations and find severaloptical-uv tracers of x-ray weakness; e.g., fe ii rest-frame equivalent widthand relative color. we describe how orientation effects under our previouslyproposed "shielding-gas" scenario can likely unify the x-ray weak and x-raynormal populations. we suggest that the shielding gas may naturally beunderstood as a geometrically thick inner accretion disk that shields the broadline region from the ionizing continuum. if wlqs and phl 1811 analogs have veryhigh eddington ratios, the inner disk could be significantly puffed up (e.g., aslim disk). shielding of the broad emission-line region by a geometricallythick disk may have a significant role in setting the broad distributions of civ rest-frame equivalent width and blueshift for quasars more generally.

1503.08364	dissecting the quasar main sequence: insight from host galaxy properties	the diverse properties of broad-line quasars appear to follow a well-definedmain sequence along which the optical feii strength increases. it has beensuggested that this sequence is mainly driven by the eddington ratio (l/l_edd)of the black hole (bh) accretion. shen &amp; ho demonstrated with quasar clusteringanalysis that the average bh mass decreases with increasing feii strength whenquasar luminosity is fixed, consistent with this suggestion. here we perform anindependent test by measuring the stellar velocity dispersion sigma* (hence thebh mass via the m-sigma* relation) from decomposed host spectra in low-redshiftsloan digital sky survey quasars. we found that at fixed quasar luminosity,sigma* systematically decreases with increasing feii strength, confirming thateddington ratio increases with feii strength. we also found that at fixedluminosity and feii strength, there is little dependence of sigma* on the broadhbeta fwhm. these new results reinforce the framework put forward by shen &amp; hothat eddington ratio and orientation govern most of the diversity seen inbroad-line quasar properties.

0806.0032	on the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets from radial velocity  surveys	we investigate the estimation of orbital parameters by least-$\chi^2$keplerian fits to radial velocity (rv) data using synthetic data sets. we findthat while the fitted period is fairly accurate, the best-fit eccentricity and$m_p\sin i$ are systematically biased upward from the true values for lowsignal-to-noise ratio $k/\sigma\lesssim 3$ and moderate number of observations$n_{\rm obs}\lesssim 60$, leading to a suppression of the number of nearlycircular orbits. assuming intrinsic distributions of orbital parameters, wegenerate a large number of mock rv data sets and study the selection effect onthe eccentricity distribution. we find the overall detection efficiency onlymildly decreases with eccentricity. this is because although high eccentricityorbits are more difficult to sample, they also have larger rv amplitudes forfixed planet mass and orbital semi-major axis. thus the primary source ofuncertainties in the eccentricity distribution comes from biases in keplerianfits to detections with low-amplitude and/or small $n_{\rm obs}$, rather thanfrom selection effects. our results suggest that the abundance oflow-eccentricity exoplanets may be underestimated in the current sample and weurge caution in interpreting the eccentricity distributions of low-amplitudedetections in future rv samples.

1511.01520	reverberation mapping with intermediate-band photometry: detection of  broad-line h$\alpha$ time lags for quasars at $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4$	we present a reverberation mapping (rm) experiment that combines broad- andintermediate-band photometry; it is the first such attempt targeting a sampleof 13 quasars at $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.9$. the quasars were selected to have strongh$\alpha$ or h$\beta$ emission lines that are located in one of threeintermediate bands (with fwhm around 200 \aa) centered at 8045, 8505, and 9171\aa. the imaging observations were carried out in the intermediate bands andthe broad $i$ and $z$ bands using the prime-focus imager 90prime on the 2.3mbok telescope. because of the large ($\sim$1 deg$^2$) field-of-view (fov) of90prime, we were able to include the 13 quasars within only five telescopepointings or fields. the five fields were repeatedly observed over 20--30epochs that were unevenly distributed over a duration of 5--6 months. thecombination of the broad- and intermediate-band photometry allows us to deriveaccurate light curves for both optical continuum (from the accretion disk) andline (from the broad-line region, or blr) emission. we detect h$\alpha$ timelags between the continuum and line emission in 6 quasars. these quasars are ata relatively low redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4$. the measured lags are consistentwith the current blr size-luminosity relation for h$\beta$ at $z&lt;0.3$. whilethis experiment appears successful in detecting lags of the bright h$\alpha$line, further investigation is required to see if it can also be applied to thefainter h$\beta$ line for quasars at higher redshifts. finally we demonstratethat by using a small telescope with a large fov, intermediate-band photometricrm can be efficiently executed for a large sample of quasars at $z&gt;0.2$.

1512.00005	rest-frame optical properties of luminous 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5 quasars: the  hbeta-[oiii] region	we study the rest-frame optical properties of 74 luminous (l_bol=10^46.2-48.2erg/s), 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5 broad-line quasars with near-ir (jhk) slit spectroscopy.systemic redshifts based on the peak of the [oiii]5007 line reveal thatredshift estimates from the rest-frame uv broad emission lines (mostly mgii)are intrinsically uncertain by ~ 200 km/s (measurement errors accounted for).the overall full-width-at-half-maximum of the narrow [oiii] line is ~ 1000 km/son average. a significant fraction of the total [oiii] flux (~ 40%) is in ablueshifted wing component with a median velocity offset of ~ 700 km/s,indicative of ionized outflows within a few kpc from the nucleus; we do notfind evidence of significant [oiii] flux beyond ~ 10 kpc in our slitspectroscopy. the [oiii] line is noticeably more asymmetric and weaker thanthat in typical less luminous low-z quasars. however, when matched in quasarcontinuum luminosity, low-z quasars have similar [oiii] profiles and strengthsas these high-z systems. therefore the exceptionally large width andblueshifted wing, and the relatively weak strength of [oiii] in high-z luminousquasars are mostly a luminosity effect rather than redshift evolution. thehbeta-[oiii] region of these high-z quasars displays a similar spectraldiversity and eigenvector 1 correlations with anti-correlated [oiii] andoptical feii strengths, as seen in low-z quasars; but the average broad hbetawidth is larger by 25% than typical low-z quasars, indicating more massiveblack holes in these high-z systems. these results highlight the importance ofunderstanding [oiii] emission in the general context of quasar parameter spacein order to understand quasar feedback in the form of [oiii] outflows. thecalibrated one-dimensional near-ir spectra are made publicly available, alongwith a composite spectrum.

0806.2882	stability of distant satellites of giant planets in the solar system	we conduct a systematic survey of the regions in which distant satellites canorbit stably around the four giant planets in the solar system, using orbitalintegrations of up to $10^9$ yr. in contrast to previous investigations, we usea grid of initial conditions on a surface of section to explore phase spaceuniformly inside and outside the planet's hill sphere (radius $r_{\rm h}$;satellites outside the hill sphere sometimes are also known asquasi-satellites). our confirmations and extensions of old results and newfindings include the following: (i) many prograde and retrograde satellites cansurvive out to radii $\sim 0.5r_{\rm h}$ and $\sim 0.7r_{\rm h}$, respectively,while some coplanar retrograde satellites of jupiter and neptune can surviveout to $\sim r_{\rm h}$; (ii) stable orbits do not exist within the hill sphereat high ecliptic inclinations when the semi-major axis is large enough that thesolar tide is the dominant non-keplerian perturbation; (iii) there is a gapbetween $\sim r_{\rm h}$ and $2r_{\rm h}$ in which no stable orbits exist; (iv)at distances $\gtrsim 2r_{\rm h}$ stable satellite orbits exist around jupiter,uranus and neptune (but not saturn). for uranus and neptune, in particular,stable orbits are found at distances as large as $\sim 10r_{\rm h}$; (v) thedifferences in the stable zones beyond the hill sphere arise mainly fromdifferences in the planet/sun mass ratio and perturbations from other planets;in particular, the absence of stable satellites around saturn is mainly due toperturbations from jupiter. it is therefore likely that satellites at distances$\gtrsim 2r_{\rm h}$ could survive for the lifetime of the solar system arounduranus, neptune, and perhaps jupiter.

astro-ph;0410658	structures in a class of magnetized scale-free discs	we construct analytically stationary global configurations for both alignedand logarithmic spiral coplanar magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) perturbations in anaxisymmetric background mhd disc with a power-law surface mass density$\sigma_0\propto r^{-\alpha}$, a coplanar azimuthal magnetic field $b_0\proptor^{-\gamma}$, a consistent self-gravity and a power-law rotation curve$v_0\propto r^{-\beta}$ where $v_0$ is the linear azimuthal gas rotation speed.the barotropic equation of state $\pi\propto\sigma^{n}$ is adopted for both mhdbackground equilibrium and coplanar mhd perturbations where $\pi$ is thevertically integrated pressure and $n$ is the barotropic index. for ascale-free background mhd equilibrium, a relation exists among $\alpha$,$\beta$, $\gamma$ and $n$ such that only one parameter (e.g., $\beta$) isindependent. for a linear axisymmetric stability analysis, we provide globalcriteria in various parameter regimes. for nonaxisymmetric aligned andlogarithmic spiral cases, two branches of perturbation modes (i.e., fast andslow mhd density waves) can be derived once $\beta$ is specified. to complementthe magnetized singular isothermal disc (msid) analysis of lou, we extend theanalysis to a wider range of $-1/4&lt;\beta&lt;1/2$. as an example of illustration,we discuss specifically the $\beta=1/4$ case when the background magnetic fieldis force-free. angular momentum conservation for coplanar mhd perturbations andother relevant aspects of our approach are discussed.

astro-ph;0510222	forming supermassive black holes by accreting dark and baryon matter	given a large-scale mixture of self-interacting dark matter (sidm) particlesand baryon matter distributed in the early universe, we advance here atwo-phase accretion scenario for forming supermassive black holes (smbhs) withmasses around $\sim 10^9 m_{\odot}$ at high redshifts $z (\gsim 6)$. the firstphase is conceived to involve a rapid quasi-spherical and quasi-steady bondiaccretion of mainly sidm particles embedded with baryon matter onto seed blackholes (bhs) created at redshifts $z\lsim 30$ by the first generation of massivepopulation iii stars; this earlier phase rapidly gives birth to significantlyenlarged seed bh masses of $m_{\hbox{\tiny bh},t_1}\backsimeq 1.4\times 10^6\m_\odot \sigma_0/(1\hbox{cm}^2\hbox{g}^{-1})(c_s/30\hbox{km s}^{-1})^4$ during$z\sim 20-15$, where $\sigma_0$ is the cross section per unit mass of sidmparticles and $c_s$ is the velocity dispersion in the sidm halo referred to asan effective "sound speed". the second phase of bh mass growth is envisaged toproceed primarily via baryon accretion, eventually leading to smbh masses of$m_{\hbox{\tiny bh}}\sim 10^9 m_\odot$; such smbhs may form either by $z\sim 6$for a sustained accretion at the eddington limit or later at lower $z$ forsub-eddington mean accretion rates. we intend to account for the reporteddetections of a few smbhs at early epochs, e.g., sdss 1148+5251 and so forth,without necessarily resorting to either super-eddington baryon accretion orvery frequent bh merging processes. only extremely massive dark sidm halosassociated with rare peaks of density fluctuations in the early universe mayharbour such early smbhs or quasars. observational consequences are discussed.

astro-ph;0609131	three dimensional compressible hydrodynamic simulations of vortices in  disks	we carry out three-dimensional, high resolution (up to $1024^2\times 256$)hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of vortices in verticallyunstratified keplerian disks using the shearing sheet approximation. thetransient amplification of incompressible, linear amplitude leading waves(which has been proposed as a possible route to nonlinear hydrodynamicalturbulence in disks) is used as one test of our algorithms; our methodsaccurately capture the predicted amplification, converges at second-order, andis free from aliasing. waves expected to reach nonlinear amplitude at peakamplification become unstable to kelvin-helmholtz modes when $\mid w_{\rmmax}\mid\gtrsim \omega$ (where $w_{\rm max}$ is the local maximum of vorticityand $\omega$ the angular velocity). we study the evolution of a power-lawdistribution of vorticity consistent with kolmogorov turbulence; intwo-dimensions long-lived vortices emerge and decay slowly, similar to previousstudies. in three-dimensions, however, vortices are unstable to bending modes,leading to rapid decay. only vortices with a length to width ratio smaller thanone survive; in three-dimensions the residual kinetic energy and shear stressis at least one order of magnitude smaller than in two-dimensions. no evidencefor sustained hydrodynamical turbulence and transport is observed inthree-dimensions. instead, at late times the residual transport is determinedby the amplitude of slowly decaying, large-scale vortices (with horizontalextent comparable to the scale height of the disk), with additionalcontributions from nearly incompressible inertial waves possible. evaluatingthe role that large-scale vortices play in astrophysical accretion disks willrequire understanding the mechanisms that generate and destroy them.

astro-ph;0611635	differences in the agn populations of groups and clusters: clues to agn  evolution	we combine optical and x-ray data for eight low redshift ($z\sim 0.06$) poorgroups of galaxies from the {\it xi}({\it xmm/imacs}) groups project to studythe agn population in the group environment. among $\sim 140$ group members, weidentify five agn based on their optical emission lines. none of theseoptically-selected agn are detected by {\it xmm-newton}. one additional agn isdiscovered in the {\it xmm-newton} observations. this x-ray detected agn, whichhas no obvious agn emission line signatures in its optical spectrum, is amember of the only x-ray luminous group in our sample. the lack of asignificant population of x-ray bright, but optically dull agn among lessdynamically evolved groups is in stark contrast to the large fraction of suchobjects in rich clusters of galaxies (martini et al. 2006). we suggest thisresult can be explained by a physical scenario for agn accretion evolution: agnactivity is initially triggered by galaxy merging, leading to a high accretionrate and an optically dominant phase (via thin disk accretion). as theaccretion rate drops in time, the agn gradually enters an x-ray dominantlow-accretion phase (via a radiative inefficient accretion flow). in thispicture, optical- and x-ray-selected agn are the same population ofsupermassive black holes observed at different epochs. within the context ofthis scenario, the majority of agn in poor groups are in the high-accretionoptically dominant phase, while the agn population in rich clusters is mostlyin the low-accretion x-ray dominant phase.

astro-ph;0702214	clustering of high redshift ($z\ge 2.9$) quasars from the sloan digital  sky survey	(abridged) we study the two-point correlation function of a uniformlyselected sample of 4,426 luminous optical quasars with redshift $2.9 \le z\le5.4$ selected over 4041 deg$^2$ from the fifth data release of the sloandigital sky survey. for a real-space correlation function of the form$\xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are$r_0 = 15.2 \pm 2.7 h^{-1}$ mpc and $\gamma = 2.0 \pm 0.3$, over a scale range$4\le r_p\le 150 h^{-1}$ mpc. thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably morestrongly clustered than their $z \approx 1.5$ counterparts, which have acomoving clustering length $r_0 \approx 6.5 h^{-1}$ mpc. dividing our sampleinto two redshift bins: $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $z\ge 3.5$, and assuming apower-law index $\gamma=2.0$, we find a correlation length of $r_0 = 16.9 \pm1.7 h^{-1}$ mpc for the former, and $r_0 = 24.3 \pm 2.4 h^{-1}$ mpc for thelatter. following martini &amp; weinberg, we relate the clustering strength andquasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. using the sheth &amp;tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range$4\sim 50$ myr for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$; and $30\sim 600$ myr forquasars with $z\ge 3.5$. the corresponding duty cycles are $0.004\sim 0.05$ forthe lower redshift bin and $0.03\sim 0.6$ for the higher redshift bin. theminimum mass of halos in which these quasars reside is $2-3\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $4-6\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $z\ge 3.5$.

0810.4144	quasar clustering from sdss dr5: dependences on physical properties	using a homogenous sample of 38,208 quasars with a sky coverage of $4000 {\rmdeg^2}$ drawn from the sdss data release five quasar catalog, we study thedependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole mass, quasarcolor, and radio loudness. at $z&lt;2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly onluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\sim10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. these weak dependences areconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,virial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted anyclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantitythat best correlates with clustering strength. however, the most luminous andmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\sim 2\sigma$ level)than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase ofthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. we do not observe a strongdependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. on theother hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quietquasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial black hole mass),consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 agn.thus radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in thebiased halo clustering picture. using the sheth et al.(2001) formula for thelinear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is $\sim10^{13} h^{-1}m_\odot$, compared to $\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}m_\odot$ forradio-quiet quasar hosts at $z\sim 1.5$.
