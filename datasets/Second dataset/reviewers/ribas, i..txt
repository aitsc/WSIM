0904.0739	fully automated approaches to analyze large-scale astronomy survey data	observational astronomy has changed drastically in the last decade: manuallydriven target-by-target instruments have been replaced by fully automatedrobotic telescopes. data acquisition methods have advanced to the point thatterabytes of data are flowing in and being stored on a daily basis. at the sametime, the vast majority of analysis tools in stellar astrophysics still rely onmanual expert interaction. to bridge this gap, we foresee that the next decadewill witness a fundamental shift in the approaches to data analysis:case-by-case methods will be replaced by fully automated pipelines that willprocess the data from their reduction stage, through analysis, to storage.while major effort has been invested in data reduction automation, automateddata analysis has mostly been neglected despite the urgent need. scientificdata mining will face serious challenges to identify, understand and eliminatethe sources of systematic errors that will arise from this automation. as aspecial case, we present an artificial intelligence (ai) driven pipeline thatis prototyped in the domain of stellar astrophysics (eclipsing binaries inparticular), current results and the challenges still ahead.

0911.3391	the distance to the andromeda galaxy from eclipsing binaries	the cosmic distance scale largely depends on distance determinations to localgroup galaxies. in this sense, the andromeda galaxy (m31) is a key rung tobetter constrain the cosmic distance ladder. a project was started in 1999 tofirmly establish a direct and accurate distance to m31 using eclipsing binaries(ebs). after the determination of the first direct distance to m31 from ebs,the second direct distance to an eb system is presented:m31v_j00443610+4129194. light and radial velocity curves were obtained andfitted to derive the masses and radii of the components. the acquired spectrawere combined and disentangled to determine the temperature of the components.the analysis of the studied eb resulted in a distance determination to m31 of(m-m)o = 24.30 +/- 0.11 mag. this result, when combined with the previousdistance determination to m31, results in a distance modulus of (m-m)o = 24.36+/- 0.08 mag (744 +/- 33 kpc), fully compatible with other distancedeterminations to m31. with an error of only 4%, the obtained value firmlyestablishes the distance to this important galaxy and represents thefulfillment of the main goal of our project.

1002.1875	a scenario of planet erosion by coronal radiation	context: according to theory, high-energy emission from the coronae of coolstars can severely erode the atmospheres of orbiting planets. no observationaltests of the long term effects of erosion have yet been made. aims: to analyzethe current distribution of planetary mass with x-ray irradiation of theatmospheres in order to make an observational assessment of the effects oferosion by coronal radiation. methods: we study a large sample ofplanet-hosting stars with xmm-newton, chandra and rosat; make a carefulidentification of x-ray counterparts; and fit their spectra to make accuratelymeasurements of the stellar x-ray flux. results: the distribution of theplanetary masses with x-ray flux suggests that erosion has taken place: mostsurviving massive planets, (m_p sin i &gt;1.5 m_j), have been exposed to loweraccumulated irradiation. heavy erosion during the initial stages of stellarevolution is followed by a phase of much weaker erosion. a line dividing thesetwo phases could be present, showing a strong dependence on planet mass.although a larger sample will be required to establish a well-defined erosionline, the distribution found is very suggestive. conclusions: the distributionof planetary mass with x-ray flux is consistent with a scenario in which planetatmospheres have suffered the effects of erosion by coronal x-ray and euvemission. the erosion line is an observational constraint to models ofatmospheric erosion.

1005.5720	the effect of magnetic activity on low-mass stars in eclipsing binaries	in recent years, analyses of eclipsing binary systems have unveileddifferences between the observed fundamental properties of low-mass stars andthose predicted by stellar structure models. particularly, radius and effectivetemperatures computed from models are ~ 5-10% lower and ~ 3-5% higher thanobserved, respectively. these discrepancies have been attributed to differentfactors, notably to the high levels of magnetic activity present on thesestars. in this paper, we test the effect of magnetic activity both on modelsand on the observational analysis of eclipsing binaries using a sample of suchsystems with accurate fundamental properties. regarding stellar models, we havefound that unrealistically high spot coverages need to be assumed to reproducethe observations. tests considering metallicity effects and missing opacitieson models indicate that these are not able to explain the radius discrepanciesobserved. with respect to the observations, we have tested the effect ofseveral spot distributions on the light curve analysis. our results show thatspots cause systematic deviations on the stellar radii derived from light curveanalysis when distributed mainly over the stellar poles. assuming the existenceof polar spots, overall agreement between models and observations is reachedwhen ~ 35% spot coverage is considered on stellar models. such spot coverageinduces a systematic deviation in the radius determination from the light curveanalysis of ~ 3% and is also compatible with the modulations observed on thelight curves of these systems. finally, we have found that the effect ofactivity or rotation on convective transport in partially radiative stars mayalso contribute to explain the differences seen in some of the systems withshorter orbital periods.

1105.0287	time evolution of high-energy emissions of low-mass stars:i. age  determination using stellar chronology with white dwarfs in wide binaries	stellar ages are extremely difficult to determine and often subject to largeuncertainties, especially for field low-mass stars. we plan to carry out acalibration of the decrease in high-energy emissions of low-mass gkm stars withtime, and therefore precise age determination is a key ingredient. the overallgoal of our research is to study the time evolution of these high-energyemissions as an essential input to studing exoplanetary atmospheres.  we propose to determine stellar ages with a methodology based on widebinaries. we are interested in systems composed of a low-mass star and a whitedwarf (wd), where the latter serves as a stellar chronometer for the system. weaim at obtaining reliable ages for a sample of late-type stars older than 1gyr.  we selected a sample of wide binaries composed by a da type wd and a gkmcompanion. high signal-to-noise, low-resolution spectroscopic observations wereobtained for most of the wd members of the sample. atmospheric parameters weredetermined by fitting the spectroscopic data to appropiate wd models. the totalages of the systems were derived by using cooling sequences, an initial-finalmass relationship and evolutionary tracks, to account for the progenitor life.  the spectroscopic observations have allowed us to determine ages for thebinary systems using wds as cosmochronometers. we obtained reliable ages for 27stars between 1 and 5 gyr, which is a range where age determination becomesdifficult for field objects.

1105.0550	estimation of the xuv radiation onto close planets and their evaporation	context: the current distribution of planet mass vs. incident stellar x-rayflux supports the idea that photoevaporation of the atmosphere may take placein close-in planets. integrated effects have to be accounted for. a propercalculation of the mass loss rate due to photoevaporation requires to estimatethe total irradiation from the whole xuv range. aims: the purpose of this paperis to extend the analysis of the photoevaporation in planetary atmospheres fromthe accessible x-rays to the mostly unobserved euv range by using the coronalmodels of stars to calculate the euv contribution to the stellar spectra. themass evolution of planets can be traced assuming that thermal losses dominatethe mass loss of their atmospheres. methods: we determine coronal models for 82stars with exoplanets that have x-ray observations available. then a syntheticspectrum is produced for the whole xuv range (~1-912 {\aa}). the determinationof the euv stellar flux, calibrated with real euv data, allows us to calculatethe accumulated effects of the xuv irradiation on the planet atmosphere withtime, as well as the mass evolution for planets with known density. results: wecalibrate for the first time a relation of the euv luminosity with stellar agevalid for late-type stars. in a sample of 109 exoplanets, few planets withmasses larger than ~1.5 mj receive high xuv flux, suggesting that intensephotoevaporation takes place in a short period of time, as previously found inx-rays. the scenario is also consistent with the observed distribution ofplanet masses with density. the accumulated effects of photoevaporation overtime indicate that hd 209458b may have lost 0.2 mj since an age of 20 myr.conclusions: coronal radiation produces rapid photoevaporation of theatmospheres of planets close to young late-type stars. more complex models areneeded to explain fully the observations.

0711.3523	the effect of activity on stellar temperatures and radii	recent analyses of low-mass eclipsing binary stars have unveiled asignificant disagreement between the observations and the predictions ofstellar structure models. results show that theoretical models underestimatethe radii and overestimate the effective temperatures of low-mass stars butyield luminosities that accord with observations. a hypothesis based upon theeffects of stellar activity was put forward to explain the discrepancies. inthis paper we study the existence of the same trend in single active stars andprovide a consistent scenario to explain systematic differences between activeand inactive stars in the h-r diagram reported earlier. the analysis is doneusing single field stars of spectral types late-k and m and computing theirbolometric magnitudes and temperatures through infrared colours and spectralindices. the properties of the stars in samples of active and inactive starsare compared statistically to reveal systematic differences. after accountingfor a number of possible bias effects, active stars are shown to be cooler thaninactive stars of similar luminosity therefore implying a larger radius aswell, in proportions that are in excellent agreement with those found fromeclipsing binaries. the present results generalise the existence of strongradius and temperature dependences on stellar activity to the entire populationof low-mass stars, regardless of their membership in close binary systems.

0711.4451	fundamental properties of low-mass stars	numerous investigations on the fundamental properties of low-mass stars usingeclipsing binaries indicate a strong discrepancy between theory andobservations that is still awaiting explanation. current models seem to predictradii for stars less massive than the sun that are some 10% smaller thanobserved, while their effective temperatures are some 5% larger. here wediscuss recent new observational data that are relevant to this issue andreview the progress made in understanding the origin of the importantdifferences with theoretical calculations. notably, we provide evidence thatstellar activity may be responsible for the mismatch between observations andtheory through two different channels: inhibition of convection or effects of asignificant starspot coverage. the activity hypothesis is put to a test withobservational diagnostics and some of the consequences of the large starspotcoverage are evaluated. we conclude that stellar activity likely plays a keyrole in defining the properties of active low-mass stars and that this shouldbe properly taken into account when investigating young, active stars inclusters or star-forming regions.

1311.3614	pulsation analysis and its impact on primary transit modeling in wasp-33	to date, wasp-33 is the only delta scuti star known to be orbited by a hotjupiter. the pronounced stellar pulsations, showing periods comparable to theprimary transit duration, interfere with the transit modeling. therefore ourmain goal is to study the pulsation spectrum of the host star to redeterminethe orbital parameters of the system by means of pulsation-cleaned primarytransit light curves. between august 2010 and october 2012 we obtained 457hours of photometry of wasp-33 using small and middle-class telescopes locatedmostly in spain and in germany. our observations comprise the wavelength rangebetween the blue and the red, and provide full phase coverage of the planetaryorbit. after a careful detrend, we focus our pulsation studies in the highfrequency regime, where the pulsations that mostly deform the primary transitexist. the data allow us to identify, for the first time in the system, eightsignificant pulsation frequencies. the pulsations are likely associated withlow-order p-modes. furthermore, we find that pulsation phases evolve in time.we use our knowledge of the pulsations to clean the primary transit lightcurves and carry out an improved transit modeling. surprisingly, taking intoaccount the pulsations in the modeling has little influence on the derivedorbital parameters. however, the uncertainties in the best-fit parametersdecrease. additionally, we find indications for a possible dependence betweenwavelength and transit depth, but only with marginal significance. a clearpulsation solution, in combination with an accurate orbital period, allows usto extend our studies and search for star-planet interactions (spi). althoughwe find no conclusive evidence of spi, we believe that the pulsation nature ofthe host star and the proximity between members make wasp-33 a promising systemfor further spi studies.

astro-ph;0211086	the 0.4-mo eclipsing binary cu cancri: absolute dimensions, comparison  with evolutionary models and possible evidence for a circumstellar dust disk	photometric observations in the r and i bands of the detached m-typedouble-lined eclipsing binary cu cnc have been acquired and analysed. thephotometric elements obtained from the analysis of the light curves have beencombined with an existing spectroscopic solution to yield high-precision(errors&lt;2%) absolute dimensions: m_a=0.4333+/-0.0017 mo, m_b=0.3980+/-0.0014mo, r_a=0.4317+/-0.0052 ro, and r_b=0.3908+/-0.0094 ro. the mean effectivetemperature of the system has been estimated to be teff=3140+/-150 k bycomparing multi-band photometry with synthetic colors computed from modelatmospheres. additionally, we have been able to obtain an estimate for the age(~320 myr) and chemical composition ([fe/h]~0.0) of the binary system throughits membership of the castor moving group. with all these observationalconstraints, we have carried out a critical test of recent stellar models forlow-mass stars. the comparison reveals that most evolutionary modelsunderestimate the radius of the stars by as much as 10%, thus confirming thetrend observed by torres &amp; ribas (2002) for yy gem and v818 tau. in themass-absolute magnitude diagram, cu cnc is observed to be dimmer than otherstars of the same mass. after ruling out a number of different scenarios, theapparent faintness of cu cnc can be explained if its components are some 10%cooler than similar-mass stars or if there is some source of circumstellar dustabsorption. the latter could be a tantalizing indirect evidence for a coplanar(vega-like) dusty disk around this relatively young m-type binary.

astro-ph;0301296	fundamental properties and distances of lmc eclipsing binaries: iv. hv  5936	we have determined the fundamental properties and distance of a fourtheclipsing binary system (eb) in the large magellanic cloud, hv5936 (b0.5 v + b2iii). as in our previous studies, we combine "classical" eb light curve andradial velocity curve analyses with modeling of the uv-through-optical spectralenergy distribution of hv5936 to produce a detailed characterization of thesystem. in this paper, we also include an analysis of the high-resolutionoptical absorption line spectra of the binary components. we find hv5936 to bean algol-class system, in which the masses of the primary and secondary starshave evolved via mass transfer to their current values of 11.6 mo and 4.7 mo,respectively. the properties of the primary star are indistinguishable fromthose of a "normal" star of the same current mass. the secondary is found to beoverluminous for its current mass and exhibits a factor-of-2 enhancement in itssurface he abundance. these results are compatible with "case a" mass exchangeoccurring during the core hydrogen burning phase of the current secondary. thedistance derived to the system, 43.2 +/- 1.8 kpc, implies a distance of ~44.3kpc to the optical center of the lmc. this is several kpc closer than found inour analyses of other systems and we suggest that hv5936 lies "above" the lmcdisk. this is supported by the very low interstellar h i column density and lowe(b-v) found for the system - both of which are consistent with expected milkyway foreground material - and may be associated with hv5936's location near thelmc supergiant shell lmc4.

astro-ph;0310456	effective temperatures and radii of planet-hosting stars from ir  photometry	in this paper we present and analyse determinations of effective temperaturesof planet-hosting stars using infrared (ir) photometry. one of our goals is thecomparison with spectroscopic temperatures to evaluate the presence ofsystematic effects that could alter the determination of metal abundances. toestimate the stellar temperatures we have followed a new approach based onfitting the observed 2mass ir photometry with accurately calibrated syntheticphotometry. special care has been put in evaluating all sources of possibleerrors and incorporating them in the analysis. a comparison of our temperaturedeterminations with spectroscopic temperatures published by different groupsreveals the presence of no systematic trends and a scatter compatible with thequoted uncertainties of 0.5-1.3%. this mutual agreement strengthens the resultsof both the spectroscopic and ir photometry analyses. comparisons with otherphotometric temperature calibrations, generally with poorer performances, arealso presented. in addition, the method employed of fitting ir photometrynaturally yields determinations of the stellar semi-angular diameters, which,when combined with the distances, results in estimations of the stellar radiiwith remarkable accuracies of ~2-4%. a comparison with the only star in thesample with an empirically determined radius (hd 209458 -- from transitphotometry) indicates excellent agreement.

astro-ph;0412253	evolution of the solar activity over time and effects on planetary  atmospheres: i. high-energy irradiances (1-1700 a)	we report on the results of the sun in time multi-wavelength program (x-raysto the uv) of solar analogs with ages covering ~0.1-7 gyr. the chief sciencegoals are to study the solar magnetic dynamo and to determine the radiative andmagnetic properties of the sun during its evolution across the main sequence.the present paper focuses on the latter goal, which has the ultimate purpose ofproviding the spectral irradiance evolution of solar-type stars to be used inthe study and modeling of planetary atmospheres. the results from the sun intime program suggest that the coronal x-ray-euv emissions of the youngmain-sequence sun were ~100-1000 times stronger than those of the present sun.similarly, the transition region and chromospheric fuv-uv emissions of theyoung sun are expected to be 20-60 and 10-20 times stronger, respectively, thanat present. when considering the integrated high-energy emission from 1 to 1200a, the resulting relationship indicates that the solar high-energy flux wasabout 2.5 times the present value 2.5 gyr ago and about 6 times the presentvalue about 3.5 gyr ago (when life supposedly arose on earth). the strongradiation emissions inferred should have had major influences on the thermalstructure, photochemistry, and photoionization of planetary atmospheres andalso played an important role in the development of primitive life in the solarsystem. some examples of the application of the sun in time results onexoplanets and on early solar system planets are discussed.

astro-ph;0505001	gu boo: a new 0.6 msun detached eclipsing binary	we have found a new low-mass, double-lined, detached eclipsing binary, guboo, among a sample of new variables from the rotse-i database. the binary hasan orbital period of 0.488728 +/- 0.000002 days, and estimated apparentmagnitudes vrotse = 13.7 and i = 11.8. our analysis of the light and radialvelocity curves of the system yields individual masses and radii of m1= 0.610+/- 0.007 msun, m2 = 0.599 +/- 0.006 msun, r1= 0.623 +/- 0.016 rsun, r2= 0.620+/- 0.020 rsun. the stars in gu boo are therefore very similar to thecomponents of the eclipsing binary yy gem. for this study we have adopted amean effective temperature for the binary of teff = 3870 +/- 130 k. based onits space velocities we suggest that gu boo is a main sequence binary, possiblywith an age of several gyr. the metallicity of the binary is not wellconstrained at this point but we speculate that it should not be very differentfrom solar. we have compared the physical parameters of gu boo with currentlow-mass stellar models, where we accounted for uncertainties in age andmetallicity by considering a wide range of values for those parameters. ourcomparisons reveal that all the models underestimate the radii of thecomponents of gu boo by at least 10-15%. this result is in agreement with therecent studies of yy gem and cu cnc.

astro-ph;0506074	hd 172189: an eclipsing and spectroscopic binary with a delta sct-ttype  pulsating component in an open cluster	we present a study based on more than 2500 uvby-measurements collected on hd172189, a new eclipsing binary system with a delta sct-type pulsating componentthat belongs to the open cluster ic 4756. the great interest of this objectlies in that three important characteristics coexist: cluster membership,binarity and pulsation. its binarity and the delta sct-type pulsations of onecomponent were detected in the course of several stromgren photometriccampaigns. the frequency analysis of all the uvby out-of-eclipse data reveals aclear frequency of 19.5974 c/d as well as the existence of other high values inthe range 18-20 c/d. we have also carried out a first evaluation of the binaryparameters and determined a value of 5.702 d for the orbital period. anadditional potential interest of hd 172189 resides in its location in the fieldof view of the corot mission and, therefore, this star is an excellentcandidate for becoming a target for asteroseismology.

astro-ph;0507549	a possible black hole in the gamma-ray microquasar ls 5039	the population of high energy and very high energy gamma-ray sources,detected with egret and the new generation of ground-based cherenkovtelescopes, conforms a reduced but physically important sample. most of thesesources are extragalactic (e.g., blazars), while among the galactic ones thereare pulsars and sn remnants. the microquasar ls 5039, previously proposed to beassociated with an egret source by paredes et al. (2000), has recently beendetected at tev energies, confirming that microquasars should be regarded as aclass of high energy gamma-ray sources. to model and understand how theenergetic photons are produced and escape from ls 5039 it is crucial to unveilthe nature of the compact object, which remains unknown. here we present newintermediate-dispersion spectroscopy of this source which, combined with valuesreported in the literature, provides an orbital period of 3.90603+/-0.00017 d,a mass function f(m)=0.0053+/-0.0009 m_sun, and an eccentricity e=0.35+/-0.04.atmosphere model fitting to the spectrum of the optical companion, togetherwith our new distance estimate of d=2.5+/-0.1 kpc, yields r_opt=9.3+0.7-0.6r_sun, log (l_opt/l_sun)=5.26+/-0.06, and m_opt=22.9+3.4-2.9 m_sun. these,combined with our dynamical solution and the assumption ofpseudo-synchronization, yield an inclination i=24.9+/-2.8 degree and a compactobject mass m_x=3.7+1.3-1.0 m_sun. this is above neutron star masses for mostof the standard equations of state and, therefore, we propose that the compactobject in ls 5039 is a black hole. we finally discuss about the implications ofour orbital solution and new parameters of the binary system on the cnoproducts, the accretion/ejection energetic balance, the sn explosion scenario,and the behaviour of the tev emission with the new orbital period.

astro-ph;0601049	effective temperature scale and bolometric corrections from 2mass  photometry	this paper presents a method to determine effective temperatures, angularsemi-diameters and bolometric corrections for population i and ii fgk typestars based on v and 2mass ir photometry. accurate calibration is accomplishedby using a sample of solar analogues, whose average temperature is assumed tobe equal to the solar effective temperature of 5777 k. by taking into accountall possible sources of error we estimate associated uncertainties better than1% in effective temperature and in the range 1.0-2.5% in angular semi-diameterfor unreddened stars. comparison of our new temperatures with otherdeterminations extracted from the literature indicates, in general, remarkablygood agreement. these results suggest that the effective temperaure scale offgk stars is currently established with an accuracy better than 0.5%-1%. theapplication of the method to a sample of 10999 dwarfs in the hipparcoscatalogue allows us to define temperature and bolometric correction (k band)calibrations as a function of (v-k), [m/h] and log g. bolometric corrections inthe v and k bands as a function of effective temperature, [m/h] and log g arealso given. we provide effective temperatures, angular semi-diameters, radiiand bolometric corrections in the v and k bands for the 10999 fgk stars in oursample with the corresponding uncertainties.

astro-ph;0607236	eclipsing binaries suitable for distance determination in the andromeda  galaxy	the local group galaxies constitute a fundamental step in the definition ofcosmic distance scale. therefore, obtaining accurate distance determinations tothe galaxies in the local group, and notably to the andromeda galaxy (m31), isessential to determining the age and evolution of the universe. with thisultimate goal in mind, we started a project to use eclipsing binaries asdistance indicators to m31. eclipsing binaries have been proved to yield directand precise distances that are essentially assumption free. to do so,high-quality photometric and spectroscopic data are needed. as a first step inthe project, broad band photometry (in johnson b and v) has been obtained in aregion (34'x34') at the north-eastern quadrant of the galaxy over 5 years. thedata, containing more than 250 observations per filter, have been reduced bymeans of the so-called difference image analysis technique and the daophotprogram. a catalog with 236238 objects with photometry in both b and vpassbands has been obtained. the catalog is the deepest (v&lt;25.5 mag) obtainedso far in the studied region and contains 3964 identified variable stars, with437 eclipsing binaries and 416 cepheids. the most suitable eclipsing binarycandidates for distance determination have been selected according to theirbrightness and from the modelling of the obtained light curves. the resultingsample includes 24 targets with photometric errors around 0.01 mag. detailedanalysis (including spectroscopy) of some 5-10 of these eclipsing systemsshould result in a distance determination to m31 with a relative uncertainty of2-3% and essentially free from systematic errors, thus representing the mostaccurate and reliable determination to date.

0810.1541	absolute properties of the low-mass eclipsing binary cm draconis	spectroscopic and eclipsing binary systems offer the best means fordetermining accurate physical properties of stars, including their masses andradii. the data available for low-mass stars have yielded firm evidence thatstellar structure models predict smaller radii and higher effectivetemperatures than observed, but the number of systems with detailed analyses isstill small. in this paper we present a complete reanalysis of one of sucheclipsing systems, cm dra, composed of two dm4.5 stars. new and existing lightcurves as well as a radial velocity curve are modeled to measure the physicalproperties of both components. the masses and radii determined for thecomponents of cm dra are m1=0.2310+/-0.0009 msun, m2=0.2141+/-0.0010 msun,r1=0.2534+/-0.0019 rsun, and r2=0.2396+/-0.0015 rsun. with relativeuncertainties well below the 1% level, these values constitute the mostaccurate properties to date for fully convective stars. this makes cm dra avaluable benchmark for testing theoretical models. in comparing ourmeasurements with theory, we confirm the discrepancies reported previously forother low-mass eclipsing binaries. these discrepancies seem likely to be due tothe effects of magnetic activity. we find that the orbit of this system isslightly eccentric, and we have made use of eclipse timings spanning threedecades to infer the apsidal motion and other related properties.
