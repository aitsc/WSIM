0901.1207	modeling the effects of dust evolution on the seds of galaxies of  different morphological type	we present photometric evolution models of galaxies, in which, in addition tothe stellar component, the effects of an evolving dusty interstellar mediumhave been included with particular care. starting from the work of calura,pipino &amp; matteucci (2008), in which chemical evolution models have been used tostudy the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellarmedium in the solar neighbourhood, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it hasbeen possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar codethat includes dust reprocessing (grasil) (silva et al. 1998) to analyse theevolution of the spectral energy distributions (sed) of these galaxies. we testour models against observed seds both in the local universe and at highredshift and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlightevolves for each type of galaxy. the importance of following the dust evolutionis investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simpleassumptions to treat this component.

0902.1202	the energetic environment and the dense interstellar medium in ulirgs	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of a sampleof 30 luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with models that includeboth starburst and agn components. the aim of the work was to determineimportant physical parameters for this kind of objects such as the opticaldepth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, the starformation efficiency and the agn fraction. we found that although about half ofour sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30 % havean agn which accounts for more than 10 % of the infrared luminosity whereas allhave an energetically dominant starburst. our models also determine the mass ofdense molecular gas. assuming that this mass is that traced by the hcnmolecule, we reproduce the observed linear relation between hcn luminosity andinfrared luminosity found by gao and solomon (2004). however, our derivedconversion factor between hcn luminosity and the mass of dense molecular gas isa factor of 2 smaller than that assumed by these authors. finally, we find thatthe star formation efficiency falls as the starburst ages.

0903.2390	two-phase galaxy formation	we propose and test a scenario for the assembly and evolution of luminousmatter in galaxies which substantially differs from that adopted by othersemianalytic models. as for the dark matter (dm), we follow the detailedevolution of halos within the canonical lcdm cosmology using standardmontecarlo methods. however, when overlaying prescriptions for baryonevolution, we take into account an effect pointed out in the past few years bya number of studies mostly based on intensive n-body simulations, namely thattypical halo growth occurs in two phases: an early, fast collapse phasefeaturing several major merger events, followed by a late, quiescent accretiononto the halo outskirts. we propose that the two modes of halo growth drive twodistinct modes for the evolution of baryonic matter, favoring the developmentof the spheroidal and disc components of galaxies, respectively. we test thisidea using the semianalytic technique. our galaxy formation model envisages anearly coevolution of spheroids and the central supermassive black holes,already tested in our previous works, followed by a relatively quiescent growthof discs around the preformed spheroids. in this exploratory study, we coupleour model to the spectrophotometric code grasil, and compare our results onseveral properties of the local galaxy population with observations, finding anencouraging agreement.

0906.3522	modelling the dusty universe i: introducing the artificial neural  network and first applications to luminosity and colour distributions	we introduce a new technique based on artificial neural networks which allowsus to make accurate predictions for the spectral energy distributions (seds) oflarge samples of galaxies, at wavelengths ranging from the far-ultra-violet tothe sub-millimetre and radio. the neural net is trained to reproduce the sedspredicted by a hybrid code comprised of the galform semi-analytical model ofgalaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy mergerhistories, and the grasil spectro-photometric code, which carries out aself-consistent calculation of the sed, including absorption and emission ofradiation by dust. using a small number of galaxy properties predicted bygalform, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority ofcases to within 10% of those computed directly using grasil. the methodperforms best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared and thefar-ultra-violet. the luminosity error introduced by the method has negligibleimpact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions orcolour distributions of galaxies. we use the neural net to predict the overlapbetween galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv and in the observer-frame sub-mmat z=2. we find that around half of the galaxies with a 850um flux above 5 mjyshould have optical magnitudes brighter than r_ab &lt; 25 mag. however, only 1% ofthe galaxies selected in the rest-frame uv down to r_ab &lt; 25 mag should have850um fluxes brighter than 5 mjy. our technique will allow the generation ofwide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame uv or mid- andfar-infrared wavelengths.

0906.4115	two phase galaxy formation: the gas content of normal galaxies	we investigate the atomic (hi) and molecular (h_2) hydrogen content of normalgalaxies by combining observational studies linking galaxy stellar and gasbudgets to their host dark matter (dm) properties, with a physically groundedgalaxy formation model. this enables us to analyse empirical relationshipsbetween the virial, stellar, and gaseous masses of galaxies and explore theirphysical origins. utilising a semi-analytic model (sam) to study the evolutionof baryonic material within evolving dm halos, we study the effects of baryonicinfall and various star formation and feedback mechanisms on the properties offormed galaxies using the most up-to-date physical recipes. we find that inorder to significantly improve agreement with observations of low-mass galaxieswe must suppress the infall of baryonic material and exploit a two-phaseinterstellar medium (ism), where the ratio of hi to h_2 is determined by thegalactic disk structure. modifying the standard schmidt-kennicutt starformation law, which acts upon the total cold gas in galaxy discs and includesa critical density threshold, and employing a star formation law whichcorrelates with the h_2 gas mass results in a lower overall star formationrate. this in turn, allows us to simultaneously reproduce stellar, hi and h_2mass functions of normal galaxies.

0909.1567	predictions for herschel from lambdacdm: unveiling the cosmic star  formation history	we use a model for the evolution of galaxies in the far-ir based on thelambdacdm cosmology to make detailed predictions for upcoming cosmologicalsurveys with the herschel space observatory. we use the combined galformsemi-analytical galaxy formation model and grasil spectrophotometric code tocompute galaxy seds including the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model,which is the same as that in baugh et al. (2005), assumes two different imfs: anormal solar neighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and avery top-heavy imf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shownpreviously that the top-heavy imf appears necessary to explain the numbercounts and redshifts of faint sub-mm galaxies. in this paper, we presentpredictions for galaxy luminosity functions, number counts and redshiftdistributions in the herschel imaging bands. we find that source confusion willbe a serious problem in the deepest planned surveys. we also show predictionsfor physical properties such as star formation rates and stellar, gas and halomasses, together with fluxes at other wavelengths (from the far-uv to theradio) relevant for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. we investigatewhat fraction of the total ir emission from dust and of the high-mass starformation over the history of the universe should be resolved by plannedsurveys with herschel, and find a fraction ~30-50%, depending on confusion.finally, we show that galaxies in herschel surveys should be significantlyclustered.

0704.1562	galaxy evolution in the infra-red: comparison of a hierarchical galaxy  formation model with spitzer data	we present predictions for the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function,number counts and redshift distributions in the ir based on the lambda-cdmcosmological model. we use the combined galform semi-analytical galaxyformation model and grasil spectrophotometric code to compute galaxy sedsincluding the reprocessing of radiation by dust. the model, which is the sameas that in baugh et al (2005), assumes two different imfs: a normal solarneighbourhood imf for quiescent star formation in disks, and a very top-heavyimf in starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. we have shown previously thatthe top-heavy imf seems to be necessary to explain the number counts of faintsub-mm galaxies. we compare the model with observational data from the spitzerspace telescope, with the model parameters fixed at values chosen beforespitzer data became available. we find that the model matches the observedevolution in the ir remarkably well over the whole range of wavelengths probedby spitzer. in particular, the spitzer data show that there is strong evolutionin the mid-ir galaxy luminosity function over the redshift range z ~ 0-2, andthis is reproduced by our model without requiring any adjustment of parameters.on the other hand, a model with a normal imf in starbursts predicts far toolittle evolution in the mid-ir luminosity function, and is therefore excluded.

0708.0149	modeling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs i: the radio spectra	as a constraint for new starburst/agn models of iras bright galaxies wedetermine the radio spectra of 31 luminous and ultraluminous iras galaxies(lirgs/ulirgs). we construct the radio spectra using both new and archivaldata. from our sample of radio spectra we find that very few have a straightpower-law slope. although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectralslope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radiospectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 ghz. this is unexpected because in sources with highrates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make asignificant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. despitethis trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 ghz are flatter forsources with higher values of the fir-radio flux density ratio q, when this iscalculated at 8.4 ghz. therefore, sources that are deficient in radio emissionrelative to fir emission (presumably younger sources) have a larger thermalcomponent to their radio emission. however, we find no correlation between theradio spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz and q at 8.4 ghz. because the lowfrequency spectral index is affected by free-free absorption, and this is afunction of source size for a given mass of ionized gas, this is evidence thatthe ionized gas in ulirgs shows a range of densities. the youngest lirgs andulirgs are characterized by a larger contribution to their high-frequency radiospectra from free-free emission. however, the youngest sources are not thosethat have the greatest free-free absorption at low radio frequencies. thesources in which the effects of free-free absorption are strongest are insteadthe most compact sources. although these have the warmest fir colours, they arenot necessarily the youngest sources.

0708.0845	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) -- v. submillimetre  properties of near-infrared--selected galaxies in the subaru/xmm--newton deep  field	we have studied the submillimetre (submm) properties of the following classesof near-infrared (nir)-selected massive galaxies at high redshifts:bzk-selected star-forming galaxies (bzks); distant red galaxies (drgs); andextremely red objects (eros). we used the scuba half degree extragalacticsurvey (shades), the largest uniform submm survey to date. partial overlap ofsirius/nir images and shades in sxdf has allowed us to identify 4 submm-brightnir-selected galaxies, which are detected in the mid-infrared, 24 micron, andthe radio, 1.4 ghz. we find that all of our submm-bright nir-selected galaxiessatisfy the bzk selection criteria, except for one galaxy whose b-z and z-kcolours are however close to the bzk colour boundary. two of the submm-brightnir-selected galaxies satisfy all of the selection criteria we considered, i.e.they belong to the bzk-drg-ero overlapping population, or `extremely red' bzks.although these extremely red bzks are rare (0.25 arcmin^{-2}), up to 20 % ofthis population could be submm galaxies. this fraction is significantly higherthan that found for other galaxy populations studied here. via a stackinganalysis, we have detected the 850 micron flux of submm-faint bzks and eros inour scuba maps. while the contribution of z~2 bzks to the submm background isabout 10--15 % and similar to that from eros typically at z~1, bzks have ahigher fraction (~30 %) of submm flux in resolved sources compared with erosand submm sources as a whole. from the sed fitting analysis for bothsubmm-bright and submm-faint bzks, we found no clear signature thatsubmm-bright bzks are experiencing a specifically luminous evolutionary phase,compared with submm-faint bzks. an alternative explanation might be thatsubmm-bright bzks are more massive than submm-faint ones.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1006.4637	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies: introducing the  artificial neural network	the spectral energy distribution of galaxies is a complex function of thestar formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas ingalaxies. the computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiationthrough the dust distribution is time-consuming. this aspect becomesunacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then comparedwith multi-wavelength surveys. mainly for this aim, we have implemented anartificial neural network algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiativetransfer code grasil in order to compute the spectral energy distribution ofgalaxies in a short computing time. this allows to avoid the adoption ofempirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies outputby models. the ann has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum(the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-formingmolecular clouds and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties anddependencies). we have defined the input neurons effectively determining theiremission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and isnot linked to a particular galaxy formation model. we have trained the net forthe disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce thesed of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model forspheroidal galaxies. we have checked that for this model both the seds and thegalaxy counts in the herschel bands obtained with the ann approximation arealmost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full grasil. weconclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present theapplication to a more complex sam in another paper.

1008.0009	unusual pah emission in nearby early-type galaxies: a signature of an  intermediate age stellar population?	we present the analysis of spitzer-irs spectra of four early-type galaxies,ngc 1297, ngc 5044, ngc 6868, and ngc 7079, all classified as liners in theoptical bands. their irs spectra present the full series of h2 rotationalemission lines in the range 5--38 microns, atomic lines, and prominent pahfeatures. we investigate the nature and origin of the pah emission,characterized by unusually low 6 -- 9/11.3 microns inter-band ratios. after thesubtraction of a passive early type galaxy template, we find that the 7 -- 9microns spectral region requires dust features not normally present in starforming galaxies. each spectrum is then analyzed with the aim of identifyingtheir components and origin. in contrast to normal star forming galaxies, wherecationic pah emission prevails, our 6--14 microns spectra seem to be dominatedby large and neutral pah emission, responsible for the low 6 -- 9/11.3 micronsratios, plus two broad dust emission features peaking at 8.2 microns and 12microns. theses broad components, observed until now mainly in evolved carbonstars and usually attributed to pristine material, contribute approximately30-50% of the total pah flux in the 6--14 microns region. we propose that thepah molecules in our etgs arise from fresh carbonaceous material which iscontinuously released by a population of carbon stars, formed in a rejuvenationepisode which occurred within the last few gyr. the analysis of the mir spectraallows us to infer that, in order to maintain the peculiar size and chargedistributions biased to large and neutral pahs, this material must be shocked,and excited by the weak uv interstellar radiation field of our etg.

0712.1202	modelling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs ii: the energetic  environment and the dense interstellar medium	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of 30luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with pure starburst models ormodels that include both starburst and agn components to determine importantphysical parameters for this population of objects. in particular we constrainthe optical depth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, thestar formation efficiency and the agn fraction. we find that although abouthalf of our sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30%have an agn which accounts for more than 10% of the infrared luminosity,whereas all have an energetically dominant starburst. our derived agn fractionsare generally in good agreement other measurements based in the mid-infraredline ratios measured by spitzer irs, but lower than those derived from pahequivalent widths or the mid-infrared spectral slope. our models determine themass of dense molecular gas via the extinction required to reproduce the sed.assuming that this mass is that traced by hcn, we reproduce the observed linearrelation between hcn and infrared luminosities found by gao &amp; solomon. we alsofind that the star formation efficiency, defined as the current star formationrate per unit of dense molecular gas mass, is enhanced in the ulirgs phase. ifthe evolution of ulirgs includes a phase in which an agn contributes animportant fraction to the infrared luminosity, this phase should last an orderof magnitude less time than the starburst phase. because the mass of densemolecular gas which we derive is consistent with observations of the hcnmolecule,it should be possible to estimate the mass of dense, star-formingmolecular gas in such objects when molecular line data are not available.

1310.1396	characterizing diffused stellar light in simulated galaxy clusters	[abridged] in this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of the performanceof two different methods to identify the diffuse stellar light in cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. one method is based on adynamical analysis of the stellar component. the second method is closer totechniques commonly employed in observational studies. both the dynamicalmethod and the method based on the surface brightness limit criterion areapplied to the same set of hydrodynamical simulations for a large sample about80 galaxy clusters.  we find significant differences between the icl and dsc fractions computedwith the two corresponding methods, which amounts to about a factor of two forthe agn simulations, and a factor of four for the csf set. we also find thatthe inclusion of agn feedback boosts the dsc and icl fractions by a factor of1.5-2, respectively, while leaving the bcg+icl and bcg+dsc mass fraction almostunchanged. the sum of the bcg and dsc mass stellar mass fraction is found todecrease from ~80 per cent in galaxy groups to ~60 per cent in rich clusters,thus in excess of what found from observational analysis.  we identify the average surface brightness limits that yields the iclfraction from the sbl method close to the dsc fraction from the dynamicalmethod. these surface brightness limits turn out to be brighter in the csf thanin the agn simulations. this is consistent with the finding that agn feedbackmakes bcgs to be less massive and with shallower density profiles than in thecsf simulations. the bcg stellar component, as identified by both methods, areslightly older and more metal-rich than the stars in the diffuse component.

1311.0818	on the role of agn feedback on the thermal and chemodynamical properties  of the hot intra-cluster medium	we present an analysis of the properties of the icm in an extended set ofcosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups performedwith the treepm+sph gadget-3 code. besides a set of non-radiative simulations,we carried out two sets of simulations including radiative cooling, starformation, metal enrichment and feedback from supernovae, one of which alsoaccounts for the effect of feedback from agn resulting from gas accretion ontosuper-massive black holes. these simulations are analysed with the aim ofstudying the relative role played by sn and agn feedback on the generalproperties of the diffuse hot baryons in galaxy clusters and groups: scalingrelations, temperature, entropy and pressure radial profiles, and icm chemicalenrichment. we find that simulations including agn feedback produce scalingrelations that are in good agreement with x-ray observations at all massscales. however, our simulations are not able to account for the observeddiversity between cc and ncc clusters: unlike for observations, we find thattemperature and entropy profiles of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are quitesimilar and resemble more the observed behaviour of ncc clusters. as for thepattern of metal enrichment, we find that an enhanced level of iron abundanceis produced by agn feedback with respect to the case of purely sn feedback. asa result, while simulations including agn produce values of iron abundance ingroups in agreement with observations, they over-enrich the icm in massiveclusters. the efficiency of agn feedback in displacing enriched gas from halosinto the inter-galactic medium at high redshift also creates a widespreadenrichment in the outskirts of clusters and produces profiles of iron abundancewhose slope is in better agreement with observations.

0802.0787	long gamma-ray bursts and their host galaxies at high redshift	motivated by the recent observational and theoretical evidence that longgamma-ray bursts (grbs) are likely associated with low metallicity, rapidlyrotating massive stars, we examine the cosmological star formation rate (sfr)below a critical metallicity z_crit z_sun/10 - z_sun/5, to estimate the eventrate of high-redshift long grb progenitors. to this purpose, we exploit agalaxy formation scenario already successfully tested on a wealth ofobservational data on (proto)spheroids, lyman break galaxies, lyman alphaemitters, submm galaxies, quasars, and local early-type galaxies. we find thatthe predicted rate of long grbs amounts to about 300 events/yr/sr, of whichabout 30 per cent occur at z&gt;~6. correspondingly, the grb number counts wellagree with the bright swift data, without the need for an intrinsic luminosityevolution. moreover, the above framework enables us to predict properties ofthe grb host galaxies. most grbs are associated with low mass galaxy halosm_h&lt;~10^11 m_sun, and effectively trace the formation of small galaxies in suchhalos. the hosts are young, with age smaller than 5*10^7 yr, gas rich, butpoorly extincted (a_v&lt;~0.1) because of their chemical immaturity; this alsoimplies high specific sfr and quite extreme alpha-enhancement. only theminority of hosts residing in large halos with m_h&gt;~10^12 m_sun have largerextinction (a_v~0.7-1), sfrs exceeding 100 m_sun/yr and can be detected atsubmm wavelengths. most of the hosts have uv magnitudes in the range -20&lt;~m_1350&lt;~ -16, and lyman alpha luminosity in the range 2*10^40&lt;~l_lya&lt;~2*10^42 erg/s. grb hosts are thus tracing the faint end of theluminosity function of lyman break galaxies and lyman alpha emitters.

1502.03686	are z&gt;2 herschel galaxies proto-spheroids?	we present a backward approach for the interpretation of the evolution of thenear-infrared and the far-infrared luminosity functions across the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;3. in our method, late-type galaxies are treated by means of aparametric phenomenological method based on pep/hermes data up to z~4, whereasspheroids are described by means of a physically motivated backward model. thespectral evolution of spheroids is modelled by means of a single-mass model,associated to a present-day elliptical with k-band luminosity comparable to thebreak of the local early-type luminosity function. the formation ofproto-spheroids is assumed to occurr across the redshift range 1&lt; z &lt; 5. thekey parameter is represented by the redshift z_0.5 at which halfproto-spheroids are already formed. a statistical study indicates for thisparameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3. we assume as fiducial valuez_0.5~2, and show that this assumption allows us to describe accourately theredshift distributions and the source counts. by assuming z_0.5 ~ 2 at thefar-ir flux limit of the pep-cosmos survey, the pep-selected sources observedat z&gt;2 can be explained as progenitors of local spheroids caught during theirformation. we also test the effects of mass downsizing by dividing thespheroids into three populations of different present-day stellar masses. theresults obtained in this case confirm the validity of our approach, i.e. thatthe bulk of proto-spheroids can be modelled by means of a single model whichdescribes the evolution of galaxies at the break of the present-day early typek-band lf.

1509.04247	cool core clusters from cosmological simulations	we present results obtained from a set of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of galaxy clusters, aimed at comparing predictions withobservational data on the diversity between cool-core (cc) and non-cool-core(ncc) clusters. our simulations include the effects of stellar and agn feedbackand are based on an improved version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamicscode gadget-3, which ameliorates gas mixing and better captures gas-dynamicalinstabilities by including a suitable artificial thermal diffusion. in thisletter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary diagnosticwe used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters, and on the ironprofiles. in keeping with observations, our simulated clusters display avariety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range from steadily decreasingprofiles at small radii, characteristic of cool-core systems, to nearly flatcore isentropic profiles, characteristic of non-cool-core systems. usingobservational criteria to distinguish between the two classes of objects, wefind that they occur in similar proportions in both simulations and inobservations. furthermore, we also find that simulated cool-core clusters haveprofiles of iron abundance that are steeper than those of ncc clusters, whichis also in agreement with observational results. we show that the capability ofour simulations to generate a realistic cool-core structure in the clusterpopulation is due to agn feedback and artificial thermal diffusion: theircombined action allows us to naturally distribute the energy extracted fromsuper-massive black holes and to compensate for the radiative losses oflow-entropy gas with short cooling time residing in the cluster core.

0806.2410	amaze. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3	we present initial results of an eso-vlt large programme (amaze) aimed atdetermining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z&gt;3 by means ofdeep near-ir spectroscopy. gas metallicities are measured, for an initialsample of nine star forming galaxies at z~3.5, by means of optical nebularlines redshifted into the near-ir. stellar masses are accurately determined byusing spitzer-irac data, which sample the rest-frame near-ir stellar light inthese distant galaxies. when compared with previous surveys, themass-metallicity relation inferred at z~3.5 shows an evolution much strongerthan observed at lower redshifts. the evolution is prominent even in massivegalaxies, indicating that z~3 is an epoch of major action in terms of starformation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. there are alsoindications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is strongerrelative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemicalversion of the galaxy downsizing. the mass-metallicity relation observed atz~3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchicalevolutionary models. such discrepancies suggest that at z&gt;3 galaxies areassembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies withlow star formation efficiency. the bulk of the star formation and metallicityevolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into biggersystems.

0807.3335	extremely massive young clusters in ngc1365	in a previous work, three bright mir/radio sources were discovered in thenuclear region of ngc1365. we here confirm that these sources are young andmassive ``embedded'' clusters, and derive their parameters, such as extinction,age and mass. using isaac and visir at the vlt we obtained nir and mir maps andlr spectra. the dataset is first interpreted by comparing the observations withimages and spectra of the close-by young cluster r136 in the lmc and then byusing model predictions for both the nebular emission lines and the spectralenergy distribution of the sources. we produce maps of the region containingthe three sources in the r, j, ks, l' bands and at 12.8micro. we also providespectra in k, l and n. the spectral energy distribution of the three sourcesrises with wavelength. emission lines from ionised hydrogen and molecularhydrogen are detected, as well as pah emission. conspicuous [neii]12.8 line isalso present, while neither the [ariii] 8.9 nor the [siv] 10.4 lines aredetected. this provides a stringent constraint on the age of the sources: theyare relatively evolved young clusters (6-8 myr). owing to their ionising photonrates and ages, they must be extremely massive clusters (around 10^7 solarmasses). their mir spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of twocomponents: (1) an optically thin component, with a continuum comparable tothat of r136, and (2) an optically thick component which might be related tosubsequent or on-going episodes of star formation. these sources are goodcandidates for evolving according to a bi-modal hydrodynamical regime, in whichmatter is trapped at the centre of a compact and massive cluster.

astro-ph;0001308	the infrared side of galaxy formation. i. the local universe in the  semi-analytical framework	we present a new evolutionary model for the far-uv to sub-mm properties ofthe galaxy population. this combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation modelbased on hierarchical clustering (galform) with a spectro-photometric codewhich includes dust reprocessing (grasil). the former provides the starformation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass andvarious geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formedin different density environments. these quantities allow us to model the sedsof galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction andre-emission. two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes,where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. themodel includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starburststriggered by galaxy mergers. we test our models against the observedspectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local universe. the modelsreproduce fairly well the seds of normal spirals and starbursts, and theirinternal extinction properties. the starbursts follow the observed relationshipbetween the fir to uv luminosity ratio and the slope of the uv continuum. theyalso reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (calzetti et al 99). thisresult is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the milkyway extinction law. it suggests that the observed attenuation law is related tothe geometry of the stars and dust. we compute galaxy luminosity functions overour wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement withobservational data. the uv continuum turns out to be a poor star formationindicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.

astro-ph;0008216	modelling the extinction properties of galaxies	recently (granato, lacey, silva et al. 2000, astro-ph/0001308) we havecombined our spectrophotometric galaxy evolution code which includes dustreprocessing (grasil, silva et al. 1998) with semi-analytical galaxy formationmodels (galform, cole et al. 1999). one of the most characteristic features ofthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloudcomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellarmedium. as a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have differentgeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential inunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular thoseundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. indeed, our mergedgrasil+galform model reproduces fairly well the seds of normal spirals andstarbursts from the far-uv to the sub-mm and their internal extinctionproperties. in particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law(calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,and has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.

astro-ph;0010131	spiral and irregular galaxies in the hubble deep field north -  comparison with early types and implications for the global sfr density	we analyze a morphologically-selected complete sample of 52 late-type (spiraland irregular) galaxies in the hubble deep field north with total k-magnitudesbrighter than k=20.47. this sample exploits in particular the ultimate imagingquality achieved by hst in this field, allowing us to clearly disentangle thegalaxy morphologies, based on accurate profiles of the surface brightnessdistributions. our purpose was to investigate systematic differences betweenthe two classes, as for colours, redshift distributions and ages of thedominant stellar populations. this sample appears to miss significantlygalaxies above z=1.4 (in a similar way as an early-type galaxy samplepreviously studied by us), a fact which may be explained as a global decline ofthe underlying mass function for galaxies at these high redshifts. differencesbetween early and late-types are apparent -particularly in the colourdistributions and the evolutionary star-formation (sf) rates per unit volume-,although the complication in spectro-photometric modelling introduced bydust-extinction in the gas-rich systems prevents us to reach conclusive resultson the single sources. however, we find that an integrated quantity like thecomoving star-formation rate density (sfr(t)) as a function of redshift is muchless affected by these uncertainties: by combining this with the previouslystudied early-type galaxy sample, we find a shallower dependence of sfr(t) on zbetween z=0.2 and z=1.5 than found by lilly et al.

astro-ph;0102464	theoretical predictions on the clustering of scuba galaxies and  implications for small-scale fluctuations at sub-mm wavelengths	this paper investigates the clustering properties of scuba-selected galaxiesin the framework of a unifying scheme relating the formation of qsos andspheroids (granato et al. 2000). the theoretical angular correlation functionis derived for different bias functions, corresponding to different values ofthe ratio $m_{\rm halo}/m_{\rm sph}$ between the mass of the dark halo and thefinal mass in stars. scuba sources are predicted to be strongly clustered, witha clustering strength increasing with mass. we show that the model accounts forthe clustering of lyman-break galaxies, seen as the optical counterpart of low-to intermediate-mass primeval spheroidal galaxies and is also consistent withthe observed angular correlation function of extremely red objects. bestagreement is obtained for $m_{\rm halo}/m_{\rm sph}=100$. we also consider theimplications for small scale fluctuations observed at sub-mm wavelengths bycurrent or forthcoming experiments aimed at mapping the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). the predicted amplitude of the clustering signal in the 350ghz channel of the planck mission strongly depends on the halo-to-bulge massratio and may be of comparable amplitude to primary cmb anisotropies formultipole numbers $l\simgt 50$.

astro-ph;0201510	observations of the hubble deep field south with the infrared space  observatory - ii. associations and star formation rates	we present results from a deep mid-ir survey of the hubble deep field south(hdf-s) region performed at 7 and 15um with the cam instrument on board iso. wefound reliable optical/near-ir associations for 32 of the 35 sources detectedin this field by oliver et al. (2002, paper i): eight of them were identifiedas stars, one is definitely an agn, a second seems likely to be an agn, too,while the remaining 22 appear to be normal spiral or starburst galaxies. usingmodel spectral energy distributions (seds) of similar galaxies, we comparemethods for estimating the star formation rates (sfrs) in these objects,finding that an estimator based on integrated (3-1000um) ir luminosityreproduces the model sfrs best. applying this estimator to model fits to theseds of our 22 spiral and starburst galaxies, we find that they are formingstars at rates of ~1-100 m_sol/yr, with a median value of ~40m_sol/yr, assumingan einstein - de sitter universe with a hubble constant of 50 km/s/mpc, andstar formation taking place according to a salpeter (1955) imf across the massrange 0.1-100m_sol. we split the redshift range 0.0&lt;z&lt;0.6 into two equal-volumebins to compute raw estimates of the star formation rate density contributed bythese sources, assuming the same cosmology and imf as above and computingerrors based on estimated uncertainties in the sfrs of individual galaxies. wecompare these results with other estimates of the sfr density made with thesame assumptions, showing them to be consistent with the results of flores etal. (1999) from their iso survey of the cfrs 1415+52 field. however, therelatively small volume of our survey means that our sfr density estimatessuffer from a large sampling variance, implying that our results, bythemselves, do not place tight constraints on the global mean sfr density.

0808.2899	the mid-infrared colour-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies in the  coma cluster as measured by spitzer-irs	we use 16 micron, spitzer-irs, blue peakup photometry of 50 early-typegalaxies in the coma cluster to define the mid-infrared colour-magnituderelation. we compare with recent simple stellar population models that includethe mid-infrared emission from the extended, dusty envelopes of evolved stars.the ks-[16] colour in these models is very sensitive to the relative populationof dusty asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. we find that the passivelyevolving early-type galaxies define a sequence of approximately constant age(~10 gyr) with varying metallicity. several galaxies that lie on theoptical/near-infrared colour-magnitude relation do not lie on the mid-infraredrelation. this illustrates the sensitivity of the ks-[16] colour to age. thefact that a colour-magnitude relation is seen in the mid-infrared underlinesthe extremely passive nature of the majority (68%) of early-type galaxies inthe coma cluster. the corollary of this is that 32% of the early-type galaxiesin our sample are not `passive', insofar as they are either significantlyyounger than 10 gyr or they have had some rejuvenation episode within the lastfew gyr.

astro-ph;0304293	revisiting the location and environment of the central engine in ngc1068	we revisit in this paper the location of the various components observed inthe agn of ngc1068. discrepancies between previously published studies areexplained, and a new measurement for the absolute location of the k-bandemission peak is provided. it is found to be consistent with the position ofthe central engine as derived by gallimore (1997), capetti (1997) and kishimoto(1999). a series of map overlays is then presented and discussed. modelpredictions of dusty tori show that the nuclear unresolved nir-mir emission iscompatible with a broad range of models: the nuclear sed alone does notstrongly constrain the torus geometry, while placing reasonable constraints onits size and thickness. the extended mir emission observed within the ionizingcone is shown to be well explained by the presence of optically thick dustclouds exposed to the central engine radiation and having a small coveringfactor. conversely, a distribution of diffuse dust particles within theionizing cone is discarded. a simple model for the h2 and co emission observedperpendicularly to the axis of the ionizing cone is proposed. we show that aslight tilt between the molecular disc and the compton thick central absorbernaturally reproduces the observed distribution of h2 of co emission.

astro-ph;0307096	dust and nebular emission. i. models for normal galaxies	we present a model for nebular emission in star forming galaxies, which takesinto account the effects of dust reprocessing. the nebular emissions have beencomputed with cloudy and then included into grasil, our spectrophotometric codespecifically developed for dusty galaxies. the interface between nebularemission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed hii regionemission models covering a wide range of physical quantities. concerning theextinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpretthe observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at halpha andin the uv band as a consequence of age selective extinction. we also find that,for these galaxies with modest sfr, the ratio fir/uv provides the bestconstraints on the uv attenuation. our model also allows to deal with differentsfr estimators in a consistent way, from the uv to radio wavelengths, and todiscuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditionsencountered in star forming galaxies. we provide our best estimates ofsfr/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation.it results that sfr derived through halpha, even when corrected for extinctionusing the balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to ageselective extinction. another remarkable result is that sfr from uv luminositycorrected by means of the ratio fir/uv has a small uncertainty. finally, ourmodel provides a calibration of sfr from radio luminosity; we are also able toreproduce the observed fir/radio ratio.

astro-ph;0401199	confusion noise at far-ir to millimeter wavelengths	we present detailed predictions for the confusion noise due to extragalacticsources in the far-ir/(sub)-millimeter channels of esa/iso, nasa/spitzer,esa/herschel and esa/planck satellites, including the contribution fromclustering of unresolved scuba galaxies. clustering is found to increase theconfusion noise, compared to the case of purely poisson fluctuations, by 10-15%for the lowest frequency (i.e. lowest angular resolution) spitzer and herschelchannels, by 25-35% for the 175 micron isophot channel, and to dominate in thecase of planck/hfi channels at nu&gt;143ghz. although our calculations make use ofa specific evolutionary model (granato et al. 2004), the results are stronglyconstrained by the observed counts and by data on the redshift distribution ofscuba sources, and therefore are not expected to be heavily model dependent.the main uncertainty arises from the poor observational definition of thesource clustering properties. two models have been used for the latter: apower-law with constant slope and a redshift-independent comoving correlationlength,r_0, and the standard theoretical model for clustering evolution in alambdacdm universe, with a redshift-dependent bias factor. in both cases, theclustering amplitude has been normalized to yield a unit angular correlationfunction at theta_0=1-2 arcsec for 850 micron sources fainter than 2 mjy,consistent with the results by peacock et al. (2000). this normalizationyields, for the first model, r_0=8.3$ mpc/h, and, for the second model, aneffective mass of dark matter haloes in which these sources reside ofm_halo=1.8*10^{13} m_sun/h. these results are consistent with independentestimates for scuba galaxies and for other, likely related, sources.

astro-ph;0403581	modelling the spectral energy distribution of compact luminous infrared  galaxies: constraints from high frequency radio data	we have performed 23 ghz vla observations of 7 compact, luminous infraredgalaxies, selected to have evidence of starburst activity. new and publishedmulti-frequency data are combined to obtain the spectral energy distributionsof all 7 galaxies from the near-infrared to the radio (at 1.4 ghz). these sedsare compared with new models, for dust enshrouded galaxies, which account forboth starburst and agn components. in all 7 galaxies the starburst provides thedominant contribution to the infrared luminosity; in 4 sources no contributionfrom an agn is required. although agn may contribute up to 50 percent of thetotal far--infrared emission, the starbursts always dominate in the radio. theseds of most of our sources are best fit with a very high optical depth of(&gt;=50) at 1 micron. the scatter in the far-infrared/radio correlation, foundamong luminous iras sources, is due mainly to the different evolutionary statusof their starburst components. the short time-scale of the star formationprocess amplifies the delay between the far-infrared and radio emission. thisbecomes more evident at low radio frequencies (below about 1 ghz) wheresynchrotron radiation is the dominant process. in the far-infrared (atwavelengths shorter than 100 micron) an additional source of scatter isprovided by agn, where present. agn may be detected in the near-infrared by theabsence of the knee, typical of stellar photospheres. however, near-infrareddata alone cannot constrain the level at which agn contribute because theinterpretation of their observed properties, in this wave-band, dependsstrongly on model parameters.

astro-ph;0611409	a highly obscured and strongly clustered galaxy population discovered  with the spitzer space telescope	the ~800 optically unseen (r&gt;25.5) 24mum-selected sources in the completespitzer first look survey sample (fadda et al. 2006) with f[24mum]&gt;0.35 mjy arefound to be very strongly clustered. if, as indicated by several lines ofcircumstantial evidence, they are ultraluminous far-ir galaxies at z ~[1.6-2.7], the amplitude of their spatial correlation function is very high.the associated comoving clustering length is estimated to ber_0=14.0_{-2.4}^{+2.1} mpc, value which puts these sources amongst the moststrongly clustered populations of our known universe. their 8mum-24mum colourssuggest that the agn contribution dominates above f[24mum] ~ 0.8 mjy,consistent with earlier analyses. the properties of these objects (numbercounts, redshift distribution, clustering amplitude) are fully consistent withthose of proto-spheroidal galaxies in the process of forming most of theirstars and of growing their active nucleus, as described by the granato et al.(2004) model. in particular, the inferred space density of such galaxies at z ~2 is much higher than what expected from most semi-analytic models. matches ofthe observed projected correlation function w(\theta) with models derivedwithin the so-called halo occupation scenario show that these sources have tobe hosted by haloes more massive than ~10^{13.4} m_\odot. this value issignificantly higher than that for the typical galactic haloes hosting massiveelliptical galaxies, suggesting a duration of the starburst phase of massivehigh-redshift dusty galaxies of t_b ~ 0.5 gyr.

astro-ph;0611799	the role of the dust in primeval galaxies: a simple physical model for  lyman break galaxies and lyman alpha emitters	we explore the onset of star formation in the early universe, exploiting theobservations of high-redshift lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) and lyman alphaemitters (laes), in the framework of the galaxy formation scenario elaboratedby granato et al. (2004) already successfully tested against the wealth of dataon later evolutionary stages. complementing the model with a simple, physicallyplausible, recipe for the evolution of dust attenuation in metal poor galaxieswe reproduce the luminosity functions (lfs) of lbgs and of laes at differentredshifts. this recipe yields a much faster increase with galactic age ofattenuation in more massive galaxies, endowed with higher star formation rates.these objects have therefore shorter lifetimes in the lae and lbg phases, andare more easily detected in the dusty submillimeter bright phase. the short uvbright lifetimes of massive objects strongly mitigate the effect of the fastincrease of the massive halo density with decreasing redshift, thus accountingfor the weaker evolution of the lbg lf, compared to that of the halo massfunction, and the even weaker evolution between z~6 and z~3 of the lae lf. laesare on the average expected to be younger, with lower stellar masses, andassociated to less massive halos than lbgs. finally, we show that theintergalactic medium can be completely reionized at redshift z~6-7 by massivestars shining in protogalactic spheroids with halo masses from a few 10^10 to afew 10^11 m_sun, showing up as faint lbgs with magnitude in the range-17&lt;m_1350&lt;-20, without resorting to any special stellar initial mass function.

astro-ph;0612087	uv dust attenuation in spiral galaxies: the role of age-dependent  extinction and of the imf	we analyse the attenuation properties of a sample of uv selected galaxies,with the use of the spectrophotometric model grasil. in particular, we focus onthe relation between dust attenuation and the reddening in the uv spectralregion. we show that a realistic modelling of geometrical distribution of dustand of the different population of stars can explain the uv reddening of normalspiral galaxies also with a standard milky way dust. our results clearlyunderline that it is fundamental to take into account that younger stars suffera higher attenuation than older stars (the age-dependent extinction) becausestars are born in more-than-average dusty environments. in this work we alsofind that the concentration of young stars on the galactic plane of spirals hasa relevant impact on the expected uv colours, impact that has not been exploredbefore this paper. finally, we discuss the role of imf in shaping the relationbetween uv reddening and dust attenuation, and we show that a kroupa imf ismore consistent with observed data than the classical salpeter imf.

astro-ph;0703210	astrophysical and cosmological information from large-scale sub-mm  surveys of extragalactic sources	we present a quantitative analysis of the astrophysical and cosmologicalinformation that can be extracted from the many important wide-area, shallowsurveys that will be carried out in the next few years. our calculationscombine the predictions of the physical model by granato et al. (2004) for theformation and evolution of spheroidal galaxies with up-to-date phenomenologicalmodels for the evolution of starburst and normal late-type galaxies and ofradio sources. we compute the expected number counts and the redshiftdistributions of these source populations separately and then focus onproto-spheroidal galaxies. for the latter objects we predict the counts andredshift distributions of strongly lensed sources at 250, 350, 500, and 850micron, the angular correlation function of sources detected in the surveysconsidered, the angular power spectra due to clustering of sources below thedetection limit in herschel and planck surveys. an optimal survey for selectingstrongly lensed proto-spheroidal galaxies is described, and it is shown howthey can be easily distinguished from the other source populations. we alsodiscuss the detectability of the imprints of the 1-halo and 2-halo regimes onangular correlation functions and clustering power spectra, as well as theconstraints on cosmological parameters that can be obtained from thedeterminations of these quantities. the novel data relevant to derive the firstsub-millimeter estimates of the local luminosity functions of starburst andlate-type galaxies, and the constraints on the properties of rare sourcepopulations, such as blazars, are also briefly described.

astro-ph;9705207	far-ir and mm properties of quasars	we use photometric data, from the optical to the mm for a large sample ofoptically selected radio-quiet quasars, at low and high redshifts, to testemission models from circum-nuclear dusty torii around them. model parameters,such as dust mass, temperature distributions and torus sizes are inferred,under the assumption that the dust is heated only by the central nuclearsource. dependences of best-fit parameters on luminosity and redshift arestudied and the contribution of dust in the host galaxy to the observed fluxesis briefly mentioned. only tentative conclusions can be drawn from this yetlarge dataset and detailed modelling, because crucial spectral information ismissing at wavelengths where the qso dust emission is more prominent, i.e. at$\lambda \simeq 50$ to 600 $\mu m$. poor information in this wavelength rangeaffects our understanding not only of the high-redshift objects, but also ofthe low-redshift sample. we then expect fundamental contributions by the firstmission in this field, which is obviously related to the more general one ofgalaxy formation.

astro-ph;9707080	source counts and background radiation	our present understanding of the extragalactic source counts and backgroundradiation at infrared and sub-mm wavelengths is reviewed. available count dataare used to constrain evolutionary models of galaxies and active nuclei. thecirb, on the other hand, provides crucial information on the integrated past iremissivity, including sources so faint to be never accessible. the near-ir andsub-mm are suited to search for the cirb. these cosmological windows are idealto detect redshifted photons from the two most prominent broad emissionfeatures in galaxy spectra: the stellar photospheric 1 micron peak and the oneat 100 micron due to dust re-radiation. the recently claimed detection of anisotropic diffuse component at 100-200 microns would support the evidence forstrong cosmic evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 2$ of faint gas-rich late-typegalaxies, as inferred from direct long-$\lambda$ counts. furthermore, anequally intense cirb flux measured in the wavelength range 200 to 500 $\mu m$may be in support of models envisaging a dust-enshrouded phase during formationof spheroidal galaxies (e.g. franceschini et al., 1994): the backgroundspectrum at such long wavelengths would indicate an high redshift ($z&gt;2-3$) forthis active phase of star formation, implying a relevant constraint onstructure formation scenarios. we argue that, given the difficulties for skysurveys in this spectral domain, only sporadic tests of these ideas will beachieved in the next several years. only a mission like first, in combinationwith large mm arrays and optical telescopes, will allow to thoroughlyinvestigate, via photometric and spectroscopic surveys, these ir-bright earlyphases in the evolution of galaxies and agns.

astro-ph;9709084	modelling intermediate age and old stellar populations in the infrared	we have investigated the spectro-photometric properties of the asymptoticgiant branch (agb) stars and their contribution to the integrated infraredemission in simple stellar populations (ssp). adopting analytical relationsdescribing the evolution of these stars in the hr diagram and empiricalrelations for the mass-loss rate and the wind terminal velocity, we were ableto model the effects of the dusty envelope around these stars, with a minimalnumber of parameters. we computed isochrones at different age and initial metalcontent. we compare our models with existing infrared colors of m giants andmira stars and with iras psc data. contrary to previous models, in the newisochrones the mass-loss rate, which establishes the duration of the agb phase,also determines the spectral properties of the stars. the contribution of thesestars to the integrated light of the population is thus obtained in aconsistent way. we find that the emission in the mid infrared is about oneorder of magnitude larger when dust is taken into account in an intermediateage population, irrespective of the particular mixture adopted. the dependenceof the integrated colors on the metallicity and age is discussed, withparticular emphasis on the problem of age-metallicity degeneracy. we show that,contrary to the case of optical or near infrared colors, the adoption of asuitable pass-band in the mid infrared allows a fair separation of the twoeffects. we suggest intermediate redshift elliptical galaxies as possibletargets of this method of solving the age-metallicity dilemma. the new sspmodels constitute a first step in a more extended study aimed at modelling thespectral properties of the galaxies from the ultraviolet to the far infrared.

astro-ph;9804004	extragalactic point sources and the planck surveyor mission	we review estimates of small scale fluctuations due to extragalactic pointsources in the planck surveyor frequency bands. while our undestanding of thespectral and evolutionary properties of these sources is far from complete,conservative estimates allow us to confidently conclude that, in the frequencyrange 100--200 ghz, their contaminating effect is well below the expectedanisotropy level of the cosmic microwave background (cmb), down to angularscales of at least $\simeq 10'$. hence, an accurate subtraction of foregroundfluctuations is not critical for the determination of the cmb power spectrum upto multipoles $\ell \simeq 1000$. in any case, planck's wide frequency coveragewill allow to carefully control foreground contributions.on the other hand, theall sky surveys at 9 frequencies, spanning the range 30--900 ghz, will beunique in providing complete samples comprising from several hundreds to manythousands of extragalactic sources, selected in an essentially unexploredfrequency region. new classes of sources may be revealed in these data. thefamiliar ``flat''-spectrum radio sources should show spectral features carryingessential information on their physical properties. crucial information will beprovided to understand the nature of radio sources with strongly invertedspectra. scenarios for the cosmological evolution of galaxies will beextensively tested.

astro-ph;9806077	early-type galaxies in the hubble deep field: the star formation history	we have investigated the properties of a complete k-band selected sample of35 elliptical and s0 galaxies brighter than k=20.15 in the hubble deep field,as representative of the field galaxy population. this sample has been derivedfrom deep k-band image by the kpno-irim camera, by applying a rigorousmorphological classification scheme based on quantitative analyses of thesurface brightness profiles. the broad-band spectra of the sample galaxiesallow us to date their dominant stellar populations. the majority of brightearly-types in this field are found at redshifts z&lt;1.3 to display colorsindicative of a fairly wide range of ages (typically 1.5 to 3 gyrs). we findthat the major episodes of star-formation building up typical m_star galaxieshave taken place during a wide redshift interval 1&lt;z&lt;4 for q_0=0.5, whichbecomes 1&lt;z&lt;3 for q_0=0.15. our estimated galactic masses, for a salpeter imf,are found in the range from a few billion to a few 10^{11} solar masses alreadyat z=1. so the bright end of the e/s0 population is mostly in place by thatcosmic epoch, with space densities, masses and luminosities consistent withthose of the local field e/s0 population. what distinguishes the present sampleis a remarkable absence of objects at z&gt;1.3, which should be detectable duringthe luminous star-formation phase expected to happen at these redshifts.obvious solutions are a) that the merging events imply perturbed morphologieswhich prevent selecting them by our morphological classification filter, or b)that a dust-polluted ism obscures the (either continuous or episodic) events ofstar-formation. we conclude that the likely solution is a combination thereof,i.e. a set of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts occurring during thefirst few gyrs of the galaxy's lifetime.

astro-ph;9903349	new photometric models of galactic evolution applied to the hdf	we summarize our modelling of galaxy photometric evolution (grasil code). byincluding the effects of dust grains and pahs molecules in a two phases clumpymedium, where clumps are associated to star forming regions, we reproduce theobserved uv to radio seds of galaxies with star formation rates from zero toseveral hundreds $m_\odot/yr$. grasil is a powerful tool to investigate thestar formation, the initial mass function and the supernovae rate in nearbystarbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the evolution ofluminosity functions of different types of galaxies at wavelengths covering sixdecades. it may be interfaced with any device providing the star formation andmetallicity histories of a galaxy. as an application, we have investigated theproperties of early-type galaxies in the hdf, tracking the contribution of thispopulation to the cosmic star-formation history, which has a broad peak betweenz=1.5 and 4. to explain the absence of objects at z $\gsim$ 1.3, we suggest asequence of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts in the first few gyrs ofgalaxies lifetime. we are at present working on a complementary sample of latetype objects selected in a similar way.

astro-ph;9911304	joint formation of qsos and spheroids: qsos as clocks of star formation  in spheroids	direct and indirect observational evidence leads to the conclusion that highredshift qsos did shine in the core of early type proto-galaxies during theirmain episode of star formation. exploting this fact, we derive the rate offormation of this kind of stellar systems at high redshift by using the qsoluminosity function. the elemental proportions in elliptical galaxies, thedescendents of the qso hosts, suggest that the star formation was more rapid inmore massive objects. we show that this is expected to occur in dark matterhaloes, when the processes of cooling and heating is considered. this is alsoconfirmed by comparing the observed sub-mm counts to those derived by couplingthe formation rate and the star formation rate of the spheroidal galaxies witha detailed model for their sed evolution. in this scenario scuba galaxies andlyman break galaxies are early type proto-galaxies forming the bulk of theirstars before the onset of qso activity.

astro-ph;9912127	bepposax uncovers a type-2 qso in the hyperluminous infrared galaxy iras  09104+4109	we studied with bepposax the infrared luminous galaxy iras 09104+4109 over avery wide x-ray band from 0.1 to 80 kev. our observations indicate thedominance of a thermal component at energies below 8 kev, which we attribute tothe free-free emission from the intracluster (ic) plasma surrounding thesource. above 10 kev we find evidence for the existence of flux in excess withrespect to the free-free ic plasma emission. this, together with the marginaldetection of a neutral iron line at $\sim 6.4$ kev, gives a strong indicationfor the presence of an agn deeply buried within the source. this component isbest modelled by a strongly absorbed (n_h &gt; 5 10^{24} cm^{-2}) power-law plusunabsorbed reflection spectrum (0.15&lt;r&lt;0.3), which is also responsible for thecold iron line. the unabsorbed broad-band (2-100 kev) x-ray emission of thisagn is 2.5 10$^{46} erg/s, well within the range of quasar luminosities. ourresults indicate that iras 09104+4109 is indeed the prototype of a rare classof sources, the luminous type-2 qsos. the association of this source with ahuge cooling-flow of $\sim 1000 m_\odot$ in the cluster, as indicated by thex-ray data, might suggest that such condition of extremely fast massaccumulation could favour the survival of a thick obscuring envelope, whichwould otherwise be quickly destroyed by the very luminous central source.
