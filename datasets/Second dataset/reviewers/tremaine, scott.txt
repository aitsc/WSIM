0903.4897	the m-sigma and m-l relations in galactic bulges and determinations of  their intrinsic scatter	we derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black holemass (m_bh) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity(l) (the m-sigma and m-l relations), based on 49 m_bh measurements and 19 upperlimits. particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter(epsilon_0) in both relations. we find log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta *log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. the results forellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatterrecovered for spirals is significantly larger. the scatter inferred reinforcesthe need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass functionbased on the m-sigma relation, and further implies that there may besubstantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the m-sigma relation.we estimate the m-l relationship as log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta * log(l_v/ 10^11 l_sun,v) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. these results appear to beinsensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and thedistribution of intrinsic scatter. we show that culling the sample according tothe resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations tolarger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

1007.4298	generalized schwarzschild's method	we describe a new finite element method (fem) to construct continuousequilibrium distribution functions of stellar systems. the method is ageneralization of schwarzschild's orbit superposition method from the space ofdiscrete functions to continuous ones. in contrast to schwarzschild's method,fem produces a continuous distribution function (df) and satisfies the intraelement continuity and jeans equations. the method employs two finite-elementmeshes, one in configuration space and one in action space. the df isrepresented by its values at the nodes of the action-space mesh and byinterpolating functions inside the elements. the galerkin projection of allequations that involve the df leads to a linear system of equations, which canbe solved for the nodal values of the df using linear or quadratic programming,or other optimization methods. we illustrate the superior performance of fem byconstructing ergodic and anisotropic equilibrium dfs for spherical stellarsystems (hernquist models). we also show that explicitly constraining the df bythe jeans equations leads to smoother and/or more accurate solutions with bothschwarzschild's method and fem.

0709.0585	the black hole mass and extreme orbital structure in ngc1399	the largest galaxies, and in particular central galaxies in clusters, offerunique insight into understanding the mechanism for the growth of nuclear blackholes. we present hubble space telescope kinematics for ngc1399, the centralgalaxy in fornax. we find the best-fit model contains a black hole of 5.1 +-0.7x 10^8 msun (at a distance of 21.1 mpc), a factor of over 2 below thecorrelation of black hole mass and velocity dispersion. we also find a dramaticsignature for central tangential anisotropy. the velocity profiles on adjacentsides 0.5" away from the nucleus show strong bimodality, and the centralspectrum shows a large drop in the dispersion. both of these observations pointto an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. the best-fit orbitalmodel suggests a ratio of the tangential to radial internal velocitydispersions of three. this ratio is the largest seen in any galaxy to date andwill provide an important measure for the mode by which the central black holehas grown.

1101.1954	the black-hole mass in m87 from gemini/nifs adaptive optics observations	we present the stellar kinematics in the central 2" of the luminouselliptical galaxy m87 (ngc 4486), using laser adaptive optics to feed thegemini telescope integral-field spectrograph, nifs. the velocity dispersionrises to 480 km/s at 0.2". we combine these data with extensive stellarkinematics out to large radii to derive a black-hole mass equal to(6.6+-0.4)x10^9 msun, using orbit-based axisymmetric models and including onlythe nifs data in the central region. including previously-reported ground-baseddata in the central region drops the uncertainty to 0.25x10^9 msun with nochange in the best-fit mass; however, we rely on the values derived from thenifs-only data in the central region in order to limit systematic differences.the best-fit model shows a significant increase in the tangential velocityanisotropy of stars orbiting in the central region with decreasing radius;similar to that seen in the centers of other core galaxies. the black-hole massis insensitive to the inclusion of a dark halo in the models --- the highangular-resolution provided by the adaptive optics breaks the degeneracybetween black-hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. the present black-holemass is in excellent agreement with the gebhardt &amp; thomas value, implying thatthe dark halo must be included when the kinematic influence of the black holeis poorly resolved. this degeneracy implies that the black-hole masses ofluminous core galaxies, where this effect is important, may need to bere-evaluated. the present value exceeds the prediction of the blackhole-dispersion and black hole-luminosity relations, both of which predictabout 1x10^9 msun for m87, by close to twice the intrinsic scatter in therelations. the high-end of the black hole correlations may be poorly determinedat present.

1106.1079	observational selection effects and the m-sigma relation	we examine the possibility that the observed relation between black-hole massand host-galaxy stellar velocity dispersion (the m-sigma relation) is biased byan observational selection effect, the difficulty of detecting a black holewhose sphere of influence is smaller than the telescope resolution. inparticular, we critically investigate recent claims that the m-sigma relationonly represents the upper limit to a broad distribution of black-hole masses ingalaxies of a given velocity dispersion. we find that this hypothesis can berejected at a high confidence level, at least for the early-type galaxies withrelatively high velocity dispersions (median 268 km/s) that comprise most ofour sample. we also describe a general procedure for incorporatingobservational selection effects in estimates of the properties of the m-sigmarelation. applying this procedure we find results that are consistent withearlier estimates that did not account for selection effects, although withlarger error bars. in particular, (i) the width of the m-sigma relation is notsignificantly increased; (ii) the slope and normalization of the m-sigmarelation are not significantly changed; (iii) most or all luminous early-typegalaxies contain central black holes at zero redshift. our results may notapply to late-type or small galaxies, which are not well-represented in oursample.

1106.5403	the statistics of multi-planet systems	we describe statistical methods for measuring the exoplanet multiplicityfunction - the fraction of host stars containing a given number of planets -from transit and radial-velocity surveys. the analysis is based on theapproximation of separability - that the distribution of planetary parametersin an n-planet system is the product of identical 1-planet distributions. wereview the evidence that separability is a valid approximation for exoplanets.we show how to relate the observable multiplicity function in surveys withsimilar host-star populations but different sensitivities. we also show how tocorrect for geometrical selection effects to derive the multiplicity functionfrom transit surveys if the distribution of relative inclinations is known.applying these tools to the kepler transit survey and radial-velocity surveys,we find that (i) the kepler data alone do not constrain the mean inclination ofmulti-planet systems; even spherical distributions are allowed by the data butonly if a small fraction of host stars contain large planet populations (&gt; 30);(ii) comparing the kepler and radial-velocity surveys shows that the meaninclination of multi-planet systems lies in the range 0-5 degrees; (iii) themultiplicity function of the kepler planets is not well-determined by thepresent data.

1110.4551	density waves in debris discs and galactic nuclei	we study the linear perturbations of collisionless near-keplerian discs. suchsystems are models for debris discs around stars and the stellar discssurrounding supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. using afinite-element method, we solve the linearized collisionless boltzmann equationand poisson's equation for a wide range of disc masses and rms orbitaleccentricities to obtain the eigenfrequencies and shapes of normal modes. wefind that these discs can support large-scale `slow' modes, in which thefrequency is proportional to the disc mass. slow modes are present forarbitrarily small disc mass so long as the self-gravity of the disc is thedominant source of apsidal precession. we find that slow modes are of twogeneral types: parent modes and hybrid child modes, the latter arising fromresonant interactions between parent modes and singular van kampen modes. themost prominent slow modes have azimuthal wavenumbers $m=1$ and $m=2$. weillustrate how slow modes in debris discs are excited during a fly-by of aneighbouring star. many of the non-axisymmetric features seen in debris discs(clumps, eccentricity, spiral waves) that are commonly attributed to planetscould instead arise from slow modes; the two hypotheses can be distinguished bylong-term measurements of the pattern speed of the features.

1205.4033	on the local dark matter density	an analysis of the kinematics of 412 stars at 1-4 kpc from the galacticmid-plane by moni bidin et al. (2012) has claimed to derive a local density ofdark matter that is an order of magnitude below standard expectations. we showthat this result is incorrect and that it arises from the assumption that themean azimuthal velocity of the stellar tracers is independent of galactocentricradius at all heights. we substitute the assumption, supported by data, thatthe circular speed is independent of radius in the mid-plane. we demonstratethat the assumption of constant mean azimuthal velocity is implausible byshowing that it requires the circular velocity to drop more steeply thanallowed by any plausible mass model, with or without dark matter, at largeheights above the mid-plane. using the approximation that the circular velocitycurve is flat in the mid-plane, we find that the data imply a local dark-matterdensity of 0.008 +/- 0.003 msun/pc^3 = 0.3 +/- 0.1 gev/cm3, fully consistentwith standard estimates of this quantity. this is the most robust directmeasurement of the local dark-matter density to date.

1206.0299	gravitational collapse in one dimension	we simulate the evolution of one-dimensional gravitating collisionlesssystems from non- equilibrium initial conditions, similar to the conditionsthat lead to the formation of dark- matter halos in three dimensions. as in thecase of 3d halo formation we find that initially cold, nearly homogeneousparticle distributions collapse to approach a final equilibrium state with auniversal density profile. at small radii, this attractor exhibits a power-lawbehavior in density, {\rho}(x) \propto |x|^(-{\gamma}_crit), {\gamma}_crit\simeq 0.47, slightly but significantly shallower than the value {\gamma} = 1/2suggested previously. this state develops from the initial conditions through aprocess of phase mixing and violent relaxation. this process preserves theenergy ranks of particles. by warming the initial conditions, we illustrate across-over from this power-law final state to a final state containing ahomogeneous core. we further show that inhomogeneous but cold power-law initialconditions, with initial exponent {\gamma}_i &gt; {\gamma}_crit, do not evolvetoward the attractor but reach a final state that retains their originalpower-law behavior in the interior of the profile, indicating a bifurcation inthe final state as a function of the initial exponent. our results rely on ahigh-fidelity event-driven simulation technique.

1211.5603	planets near mean-motion resonances	the multiple-planet systems discovered by the kepler mission exhibit thefollowing feature: planet pairs near first-order mean-motion resonances preferorbits just outside the nominal resonance, while avoiding those just inside theresonance. we explore an extremely simple dynamical model for planet formation,in which planets grow in mass at a prescribed rate without orbital migration ordissipation. we develop an analytic version of this model for two-planetsystems in two limiting cases: the planet mass grows quickly or slowly relativeto the characteristic resonant libration time. in both cases the distributionof systems in period ratio develops a characteristic asymmetric peak-troughstructure around the resonance, qualitatively similar to that observed in thekepler sample. we verify this result with numerical integrations of therestricted three-body problem. we show that for the 3:2 resonance, where theobserved peak-trough structure is strongest, our simple model is consistentwith the observations for a range of mean planet masses 20-100m_{\oplus}. thismass range is higher than expected, by at least a factor of three, from the fewkepler planets with measured masses, but part of this discrepancy could be dueto oversimplifications in the dynamical model or uncertainties in the planetarymass-radius relation.

1306.4330	constraining sub-parsec binary supermassive black holes in quasars with  multi-epoch spectroscopy. i. the general quasar population	we perform a systematic search for sub-parsec binary supermassive black holes(bhs) in normal broad line quasars at z&lt;0.8, using multi-epoch sdssspectroscopy of the broad hbeta line. our working model is that: only one ofthe two bhs in the binary is active, and dynamically dominates its own broadline region (blr); the inactive companion bh is orbiting at a distance of a fewr_blr, where r_blr~0.01-0.1 pc is the blr size. we search for the expectedline-of-sight acceleration of the broad line velocity from binary orbitalmotion by cross-correlating sdss spectra from two epochs separated by up toseveral years in the quasar restframe. out of ~700 pairs of spectra for whichwe have good measurements of the velocity shift between two epochs (1-sigmaerror~40 km/s), we detect 28 systems with significant velocity shifts in broadhbeta, among which seven are the best candidates for the hypothesized binaries.we use the distribution of the observed accelerations (mostly non-detections)to place constraints on the abundance of such binary systems among the generalquasar population. excess variance in the velocity shift is inferred forobservations separated by longer than 0.4 yr (quasar restframe). attributingall the excess to binary motion would imply that most of the quasars in thissample must be in binaries; that the inactive bh must be on average moremassive than the active one; and that the binary separation is at most a fewtimes the size of the blr. however, if this excess variance is partly orlargely due to long-term broad line variability, the requirement of a largepopulation of close binaries is much weakened or even disfavored for massivecompanions.

1308.0021	co-evolution of galactic nuclei and globular cluster systems	we revisit the hypothesis that dense galactic nuclei are formed frominspiraling globular clusters. recent advances in understanding of thecontinuous formation of globular clusters over cosmic time and the concurrentevolution of the galaxy stellar distribution allow us to construct a simplemodel that matches the observed spatial and mass distributions of clusters inthe galaxy and the giant elliptical galaxy m87. in order to compare withobservations, we model the effects of dynamical friction and dynamicalevolution, including stellar mass loss, tidal stripping of stars, and tidaldisruption of clusters by the growing galactic nucleus. we find thatinspiraling globular clusters form a dense central structure, with mass andradius comparable to the typical values in observed nuclear star clusters(nscs) in late-type and low-mass early-type galaxies. the density contrastassociated with the nsc is less pronounced in giant elliptical galaxies. ourresults indicate that the nsc mass as a fraction of mass of the galaxy stellarspheroid scales as m_nsc/m_* = 0.0025 m_{*,11}^{-0.5}. thus disrupted globularclusters could contribute most of the mass of nscs in galaxies with stellarmass below 10^{11} msun. the inner part of the accumulated cluster may seed thegrowth of a central black hole via stellar dynamical core collapse, therebyrelieving the problem of how to form luminous quasars at high redshift. theseed black hole may reach about 10^5 msun within 1 gyr of the beginning ofglobular cluster formation.

1308.1964	dynamics of warped accretion discs	accretion discs are present around both stellar-mass black holes in x-raybinaries and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. a wide varietyof circumstantial evidence implies that many of these discs are warped. thestandard bardeen--petterson model attributes the shape of the warp to thecompetition between lense--thirring torque from the central black hole andviscous angular-momentum transport within the disc. we show that thisdescription is incomplete, and that torques from the companion star (for x-raybinaries) or the self-gravity of the disc (for active galactic nuclei) can playa major role in determining the properties of the warped disc. including theseeffects leads to a rich set of new phenomena. for example, (i) when a companionstar is present and the warp arises from a misalignment between the companion'sorbital axis and the black hole's spin axis, there is no steady-state solutionof the pringle--ogilvie equations for a thin warped disc when the viscosityfalls below a critical value; (ii) in agn accretion discs, the warp can exciteshort-wavelength bending waves that propagate inward with growing amplitudeuntil they are damped by the disc viscosity. we show that both phenomena canoccur for plausible values of the black hole and disc parameters, and brieflydiscuss their observational implications.

1309.5244	why do earth satellites stay up?	satellites in low earth orbits must accurately conserve their orbitaleccentricity, since a decrease in perigee of only 5-10% would cause them tocrash. however, these satellites are subject to gravitational perturbationsfrom the earth's multipole moments, the moon, and the sun that are notspherically symmetric and hence do not conserve angular momentum, especiallyover the tens of thousands of orbits made by a typical satellite. why then dosatellites not crash? we describe a vector-based analysis of the long-termbehavior of satellite orbits and apply this to several toy systems containing asingle non-keplerian perturbing potential. if only the quadrupole potentialfrom the earth's equatorial bulge is present, all near-circular orbits arestable. if only the octupole potential is present, all such orbits areunstable. if only the lunar or solar potential is present, all near-circularorbits with inclinations to the ecliptic exceeding 39 degrees are unstable. wedescribe the behavior of satellites in the simultaneous presence of all ofthese perturbations and show that almost all low earth orbits are stablebecause of an accidental property of the dominant quadrupole potential. we alsorelate these results to the phenomenon of lidov-kozai oscillations.

1312.6694	constraining sub-parsec binary supermassive black holes in quasars with  multi-epoch spectroscopy. ii. the population with kinematically offset broad  balmer emission lines	a small fraction of quasars have long been known to show bulk velocityoffsets in the broad balmer lines with respect to the systemic redshift of thehost galaxy. models to explain these offsets usually invoke broad-line regiongas kinematics/asymmetry around single black holes (bhs), orbital motion ofmassive (~sub-pc) binary black holes (bbhs), or recoil bhs, but single-epochspectra are unable to distinguish between these scenarios. the line-of-sight(los) radial velocity (rv) shifts from long-term spectroscopic monitoring canbe used to test the bbh hypothesis. we have selected a sample of 399 quasarswith offset broad h-beta lines from the sdss dr7 quasar catalog, and haveconducted second-epoch optical spectroscopy for 50 of them. combined with theexisting sdss spectra, the new observations enable us to constrain the los rvshifts of broad h-beta lines with a rest-frame baseline of a few years tonearly a decade. using cross-correlation analysis, we detect significant (99%confidence) radial accelerations in the broad h-beta lines in 24 of the 50objects. we suggest that 9 of the 24 detections are sub-pc bbh candidates,which show consistent velocity shifts independently measured from a secondbroad line (either h-alpha or mg ii) without significant changes in thebroad-line profiles. combining the results on the general quasar populationstudied in paper i, we find a tentative anti-correlation between the velocityoffset in the first-epoch spectrum and the average acceleration between twoepochs, which could be explained by orbital phase modulation when the timeseparation between two epochs is a non-negligible fraction of the orbitalperiod of the motion causing the line displacement. we discuss the implicationsof our results for the identification of sub-pc bbh candidates in offset-linequasars and for the constraints on their frequency and orbital parameters.[abridged]

1406.1178	a numerical study of vector resonant relaxation	stars bound to a supermassive black hole interact gravitationally. persistenttorques acting between stellar orbits lead to the rapid resonant relaxation ofthe orbital orientation vectors ("vector" resonant relaxation) and slowerrelaxation of the eccentricities ("scalar" resonant relaxation), both at ratesmuch faster than two-body or non-resonant relaxation. we describe a newparallel symplectic integrator, n-ring, which follows the dynamical evolutionof a cluster of n stars through vector resonant relaxation, by averaging thepairwise interactions over the orbital period and periapsis-precessiontimescale. we use n-ring to follow the evolution of clusters containing over10^4 stars for tens of relaxation times. among other results, we find that theevolution is dominated by torques among stars with radially overlapping orbits,and that resonant relaxation can be modelled as a random walk of the orbitnormals on the sphere, with angular step size ranging from 0.5-1 radian. therelaxation rate in a cluster with a fixed number of stars is proportional tothe rms mass of the stars. the rms torque generated by the cluster stars isreduced below the torque between kepler orbits due to apsidal precession anddeclines weakly with the eccentricity of the perturbed orbit. however since theangular momentum of an orbit also decreases with eccentricity, the relaxationrate is approximately eccentricity-independent for e&lt;0.7 and grows rapidly witheccentricity for e&gt;0.8. we quantify the relaxation using the autocorrelationfunction of the spherical multipole moments; this decays exponentially and thee-folding time may be identified with the vector resonant relaxation timescale.

1504.01160	the statistical mechanics of planet orbits	the final "giant-impact" phase of terrestrial planet formation is believed tobegin with a large number of planetary "embryos" on nearly circular, coplanarorbits. mutual gravitational interactions gradually excite their eccentricitiesuntil their orbits cross and they collide and merge; through this process thenumber of surviving bodies declines until the system contains a small number ofplanets on well-separated, stable orbits. in this paper we explore a simplestatistical model for the orbit distribution of planets formed by this process,based on the sheared-sheet approximation and the ansatz that the planetsexplore uniformly all of the stable region of phase space. the model providesanalytic predictions for the distribution of eccentricities and semimajor axisdifferences, correlations between orbital elements of nearby planets, and thecomplete n-planet distribution function, in terms of a single parameter, the"dynamical temperature", that is determined by the planetary masses. thepredicted properties are generally consistent with n-body simulations of thegiant-impact phase and with the distribution of semimajor axis differences inthe kepler catalog of extrasolar planets. a similar model may apply to theorbits of giant planets if these orbits are determined mainly by dynamicalevolution after the planets have formed and the gas disk has disappeared.

0806.2133	dynamics of wimps in the solar system and implications for direct and  indirect detection	semi-analytic treatments of the evolution of orbits of weakly interactingmassive particles (wimps) in the solar system suggest that the wimps bound tothe solar system may enhance the direct detection rate relative to that of theunbound population by up to a factor of order unity, and boost the flux ofneutrinos from wimp annihilation in the earth by up to two orders of magnitude.to test these important but uncertain results, we perform a suite of numericalorbit integrations to explore the properties of the bound wimp population as afunction of the wimp mass and the scattering cross section with baryonicmatter. for regions of wimp parameter space presently allowed by experiments,we find that (i) the bound wimp population enhances the direct detection rateby at most ~1% relative to the rate from unbound halo wimps; (ii) it isunlikely that planned km^3-scale neutrino telescopes will detect neutrinos fromwimp annihilation in the earth; (iii) the event rate from neutrinos produced bywimp annihilation in the sun may be much smaller than implied by the usualcalculations, which assume that wimps scattered onto bound orbits are rapidlythermalized in the sun.

astro-ph;0009255	resonant capture by inward migrating planets	we investigate resonant capture of small bodies by planets that migrateinwards, using analytic arguments and three-body integrations. if the orbits ofthe planet and the small body are initially circular and coplanar, the smallbody is captured when it crosses the 2:1 resonance with the planet. as theorbit shrinks it becomes more eccentric, until by the time its semimajor axishas shrunk by a factor of four, its eccentricity reaches nearly unity(1-e&lt;&lt;10^{-4}). in typical planetary systems, bodies in this high-eccentricityphase are likely to be consumed by the central star. if they can avoid thisfate, as migration continues the inclination flips from 0 to i=180 degrees;thereafter the eccentricity declines until the semimajor axis is a factor ofnine smaller than at capture, at which point the small body is released fromthe 2:1 resonance on a nearly circular retrograde orbit. small bodies capturedinto resonance from initially inclined or eccentric orbits can also be ejectedfrom the system, or released from the resonance on highly eccentric polarorbits (i\simeq 90 degrees) that are stabilized by a secular resonance. weconclude that migration can drive much of the inner planetesimal disk into thestar, and that post-migration multi-planet systems may not be coplanar.

astro-ph;0011571	slow modes in keplerian disks	low-mass disks orbiting a massive body can support "slow" normal modes, inwhich the eigenfrequency is much less than the orbital frequency. slow modesare lopsided, i.e., the azimuthal wavenumber m=1. we investigate the propertiesof slow modes, using softened self-gravity as a simple model for collectiveeffects in the disk. we employ both the wkb approximation and numericalsolutions of the linear eigenvalue equation. we find that all slow modes arestable. discrete slow modes can be divided into two types, which we labelg-modes and p-modes. the g-modes involve long leading and long trailing waves,have properties determined by the self-gravity of the disk, and are onlypresent in narrow rings or in disks where the precession rate is dominated byan external potential. in contrast, the properties of p-modes are determined bythe interplay of self-gravity and other collective effects. p-modes involveboth long and short waves, and in the wkb approximation appear in degenerateleading/trailing pairs. disks support a finite number---sometimes zero---ofdiscrete slow modes, and a continuum of singular modes.

astro-ph;0203468	the slope of the black-hole mass versus velocity dispersion correlation	observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the massof the central dark object m and the velocity dispersion sigma of the hostgalaxy, of the form log(m/m_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma_0); however, publishedestimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). merritt &amp; ferraresehave argued that low slopes (&lt;4) arise because of neglect of random measurementerrors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of themilky way galaxy. we show that these explanations account for at most a smallpart of the slope range. instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because ofsystematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups forthe same galaxies. the origin of these differences remains unclear, but wesuggest that one significant component of the difference results from ferrarese&amp; merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is theeffective radius) using an empirical formula. another component may arise fromdispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. a new determinationof the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, forsigma_0=200 km/s. the m-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in log mthat is no larger than 0.3 dex. in an appendix, we present a simple model forthe velocity-dispersion profile of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0209483	axisymmetric dynamical models of the central regions of galaxies	we present axisymmetric, orbit superposition models for 12 galaxies usingdata taken with the hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-basedobservatories. in each galaxy, we detect a central black hole (bh) and measureits mass to accuracies ranging from 10% to 70%. we demonstrate that in mostcases the bh detection requires both the hst and ground-based data. using theground-based data alone does provide an unbiased measure of the bh mass(provided they are fit with fully general models), but at a greatly reducedsignificance. the most significant correlation with host galaxy properties isthe relation between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the hostgalaxy; we find no other equally strong correlation, and no second parameterthat improves the quality of the mass-dispersion relation. we are also able tomeasure the stellar orbital properties from these general models. the mostmassive galaxies are strongly biased to tangential orbits near the bh,consistent with binary bh models, while lower-mass galaxies have a range ofanisotropies, consistent with an adiabatic growth of the bh.

astro-ph;0403257	black hole mass determinations from orbit superposition models are  reliable	we show that orbit-superposition dynamical models (schwarzschild's method)provide reliable estimates of nuclear black hole masses and errors whenconstructed from adequate orbit libraries and kinematic data. we thus rebut tworecent papers that argue that bh masses obtained from this method areunreliable. these papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable bhmasses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result ofan inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamicalmodels. this is an elementary error that is easily avoided. we describe amethod to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. weprovide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sensethat the range of allowable bh masses is not artificially narrowed by use oftoo few orbits. a second point raised by critics is that kinematic data aregenerally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliablemass. we make the distinction between unreliable determinations and impreciseones. we show that there are several different properties of a kinematicdataset that can lead to imprecise bh determinations, but none of theattributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. in short,the degree to which the bh radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopicobservations is already reflected in the bh-mass error envelope, and is not ahidden source of error. the bh masses published by our group and the leidengroup are reliable.

astro-ph;0404396	excitation and propagation of eccentricity disturbances in planetary  systems	the high eccentricities of the known extrasolar planets remain largelyunexplained. we explore the possibility that eccentricities are excited in theouter parts of an extended planetary disk by encounters with stars passing at afew hundreds of au. after the encounter, eccentricity disturbances propagateinward due to secular interactions in the disks, eventually exciting theinnermost planets. we study how the inward propagation of eccentricity inplanetary disks depends on the number and masses of the planets and spacingbetween them and on the overall surface-density distribution in the disk. themain governing factors are the large-scale surface-density distribution and thetotal size of the system. if the smeared-out surface density is approximated bya power-law \sigma(r)\propto r^{-q}, then eccentricity disturbances propagateinward efficiently for flat density distributions with q &lt; 1. if this conditionis satisfied and the size of the planetary system is 50 au or larger, thetypical eccentricities excited by this mechanism by field star encounters inthe solar neighborhood over 5 gyr are in the range 0.01-0.1. highereccentricities (&gt; 0.1) may be excited in planetary systems around stars thatare formed in relatively dense, long-lived open clusters. therefore, thismechanism may provide a natural way to excite the eccentricities of extrasolarplanets.

0808.4001	a stellar dynamical measurement of the black hole mass in the maser  galaxy ngc 4258	we determine the mass of the black hole at the center of the spiral galaxyngc 4258 by constructing axisymmetric dynamical models of the galaxy. thesemodels are constrained by high spatial resolution imaging and long-slitspectroscopy of the nuclear region obtained with the {\em hubble spacetelescope}, complemented by ground-based observations extending to largerradii. our best mass estimate is $\mbh = (3.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^7 \msun $ fora distance of 7.28 mpc (statistical errors only). this is within 15% of $(3.82\pm 0.01) \times 10^7 \msun$, the mass determined from the kinematics ofwater masers (rescaled to the same distance) assuming they are in keplerianrotation in a warped disk. the construction of accurate dynamical models of ngc4258 is somewhat compromised by an unresolved active nucleus and colorgradients, the latter caused by variations in the stellar population and/orobscuring dust. these problems are not present in the $\sim 30$ other blackhole mass determinations from stellar dynamics that have been published by usand other groups; thus, the relatively close agreement between the stellardynamical mass and the maser mass in ngc 4258 enhances our confidence in theblack hole masses determined in other galaxies from stellar dynamics usingsimilar methods and data of comparable quality.

0809.0237	satellite dynamics on the laplace surface	the orbital dynamics of most planetary satellites is governed by thequadrupole moment from the equatorial bulge of the host planet and the tidalfield from the sun. on the laplace surface, the long-term orbital evolutiondriven by the combined effects of these forces is zero, so that orbits have afixed orientation and shape. the "classical" laplace surface is defined forcircular orbits, and coincides with the planet's equator at smallplanetocentric distances and with its orbital plane at large distances. adissipative circumplanetary disk should settle to this surface, and hencesatellites formed from such a disk are likely to orbit in or near the classicallaplace surface. this paper studies the properties of laplace surfaces. ourprincipal results are: (i) if the planetary obliquity exceeds 68.875 deg thereis a range of semimajor axes in which the classical laplace surface isunstable; (ii) at some obliquities and planetocentric distances there is adistinct laplace surface consisting of nested eccentric orbits, whichbifurcates from the classical laplace surface at the point where instabilitysets in; (iii) there is also a "polar" laplace surface perpendicular to theline of nodes of the planetary equator on the planetary orbit; (iv) forcircular orbits, the polar laplace surface is stable at small planetocentricdistances and unstable at large distances; (v) at the onset of instability thispolar laplace surface bifurcates into two polar laplace surfaces composed ofnested eccentric orbits.

astro-ph;0506548	constraints on the acceleration of the solar system from high-precision  timing	many astronomers have speculated that the solar system contains undiscoveredmassive planets or a distant stellar companion. the acceleration of the solarsystem barycenter can constrain the mass and position of the putativecompanion. in this paper we use the most recent timing data on accurateastronomical clocks (millisecond pulsars, pulsars in binary systems andpulsating white dwarfs) to constrain this acceleration. no evidence fornon-zero acceleration has been found; the typical sensitivity achieved by ourmethod is a/c=a few times 10^{-19} s^{-1}, comparable to the acceleration dueto a jupiter-mass planet at 200 au. the acceleration method is limited by theuncertainties in the distances and by the timing precision for pulsars inbinary systems, and by the intrinsic distribution of the period derivatives formillisecond pulsars. timing data provide stronger constraints than residuals inthe motions of comets or planets if the distance to the companion exceeds a fewhundred au. the acceleration method is also more sensitive to the presence of adistant companion (&gt; 300-400 au) than existing optical and infrared surveys. weoutline the differences between the effects of the peculiar acceleration of thesolar system and the background of gravitational waves on high-precisiontiming.

0705.4103	selection bias in observing the cosmological evolution of the mbh-sigma  and mbh-l relationships	programs to observe evolution in the mbh-sigma or mbh-l relations typicallycompare black-hole masses, mbh, in high-redshift galaxies selected by nuclearactivity to mbh in local galaxies selected by luminosity l, or stellar velocitydispersion sigma. because agn luminosity is likely to depend on mbh, selectioneffects are different for high-redshift and local samples, potentiallyproducing a false signal of evolution. this bias arises because cosmic scatterin the mbh-sigma and mbh-l relations means that the mean log(l) or log(sigma)among galaxies that host a black hole of given mbh, may be substantiallydifferent than the log(l) or log(sigma) obtained from inverting the mbh-l ormbh-sigma relations for the same nominal mbh. the bias is particularly strongat high mbh, where the luminosity and dispersion functions of galaxies arefalling rapidly. the most massive black holes occur more often as rare outliersin galaxies of modest mass than in the even rarer high-mass galaxies, whichwould otherwise be the sole location of such black holes in the absence ofcosmic scatter. because of this bias, mbh will typically appear to be too largein the distant sample for a given l or sigma. for the largest black holes andthe largest plausible cosmic scatter, the bias can reach a factor of 3 in mbhfor the mbh-sigma relation and a factor of 9 for the mbh-l relation.unfortunately, the actual cosmic scatter is not known well enough to correctfor the bias. measuring evolution of the mbh and galaxy property relationsrequires object selection to be precisely defined and exactly the same at allredshifts.

astro-ph;0606739	the masses of nuclear black holes in luminous elliptical galaxies and  implications for the space density of the most massive black holes	black hole masses predicted from the mbh-sigma relationship conflict withthose predicted from the mbh-l relationship for the most luminous galaxies,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). this is because stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with l for bcgs and other giantellipticals. the mbh-l relationship predicts that the most luminous bcgs mayhave mbh approaching 10^{10}m_sol, while the m-sigma relationship alwayspredicts mbh&lt;3x10^9m_sol. we argue that the mbh-l relationship is a plausibleor even preferred description for bcgs and other galaxies of similarluminosity. if cores in central stellar density are formed by binary bhs, thenthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of mbh.using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxiesobserved by hst, we argue that l is superior to sigma as an indicator ofr_gamma in luminous galaxies. the observed r_gamma-mbh relationship for 11 coregalaxies with measured mbh appears to be consistent with the mbh-l relationshipfor bcgs. bcgs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities thatmay be difficult to generate with the modest bh masses inferred from thembh-sigma relationship. mbh~l may be expected to hold for bcgs, if they wereformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of bh to stellarmass. this picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigmawith l and the more rapid increase in effective radii with l seen in bcgs. ifbcgs have large bhs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local bhmass function for mbh&gt;3x10^9m_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richerthan that inferred from the mbh-sigma relationship. the volume density of qsosat earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the mbh-l relationship.

0705.4285	shrinking binary and planetary orbits by kozai cycles with tidal  friction	at least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binarystars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation:(i) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to themain sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a fewstellar radii away, and (ii) in current theories of planet formation, theregion within ~0.1 au of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a jupiter-massplanet to form, yet many "hot jupiters" are observed at such distances. weinvestigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbationsfrom a distant companion star (kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. weintegrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution oforbital elements produced by this process. binary stars with orbital periods of0.1 to 10 days, with a median of ~2 d, are produced from binaries with muchlonger periods (10 d to 10^5 d), consistent with observations indicating thatmost or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). we alsomake two new testable predictions: (1) for periods between 3 and 10 d, thedistribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and thetertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40 deg and 140 deg. (2) extrasolarplanets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo thisprocess, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot jupiter will typically bemisaligned with the equator of its host star.

astro-ph;9603018	resonant relaxation in stellar systems	we demonstrate the existence of an enhanced rate of angular momentumrelaxation in nearly keplerian star clusters, such as those found in thecenters of galactic nuclei containing massive black holes. the enhancedrelaxation arises because the radial and azimuthal orbital frequencies in akeplerian potential are equal, and hence may be termed {\em resonantrelaxation}. we explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using bothnumerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. we findthat the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than thenon-resonant relaxation time by of order $m_\star/m$, where $m_\star$ is themass in stars and $m$ is the mass of the central object. resonance does notenhance the energy relaxation rate. we examine the effect of resonantrelaxation on the rate of tidal disruption of stars by the central mass; wefind that the flux of stars into the loss cone is enhanced when the loss coneis empty, but that the disruption rate averaged over the entire cluster is notstrongly affected. we show that relativistic precession can disable resonantrelaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable tothose in galactic nuclei. resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decayof the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether thedistribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential. theaccelerated relaxation implies that there are regions in nuclear star clustersthat are relaxed in angular momentum but not in energy; unfortunately, theseregions are not well-resolved in nearby galaxies by the hubble space telescope.

astro-ph;9604092	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst iii: non-parametric recovery  of stellar luminosity distributions	we have non-parametrically determined the luminosity density profiles andtheir logarithmic slopes for 42 early-type galaxies observed with hst. assumingthat the isodensity contours are spheroidal, then the luminosity density isuniquely determined from the surface brightness data through the abel equation.for nearly all the galaxies in our sample, the logarithmic slope of theluminosity density measured at 0.1" (the innermost reliable measurement withthe uncorrected hst) is significantly different from zero; i.e. most ellipticalgalaxies have cusps. there are only two galaxies for which an analytic corecannot be excluded. the distribution of logarithmic slopes at 0.1" appears tobe bimodal, confirming the conclusion of lauer et al. (1995) that early-typegalaxies can be divided into two types based on their surface-brightnessprofiles; i.e., those with cuspy cores and those whose steep power-law profilescontinue essentially unchanged in to the resolution limit. the peaks in theslope distribution occur at -0.8 and -1.9. more than half of the galaxies haveslopes steeper than -1.0. taken together with the recent theoretical work ofmerritt &amp; fridman, these results suggest that many (and maybe most) ellipticalgalaxies are either nearly axisymmetric or spherical near the center, or slowlyevolve due to the influence of stochastic orbits.

astro-ph;9610055	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst. iv. central parameter  relations	we analyze hubble space telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hot galaxies). luminous hot galaxieshave cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r ~ r_b toshallow inner profiles with logslope less than 0.3. faint hot galaxies showsteep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores. thecenters of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass andluminosity than the cores of large galaxies at a limiting radius of 10 pc. atintermediate magnitudes (-22.0 &lt; m_v &lt; -20.5), core and power-law galaxiescoexist, and there is a range in r_b at a given luminosity of at least twoorders of magnitude. central properties correlate with global rotation andshape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-lawgalaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. the dense power-law centers ofdisky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-richmergers. the parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products ofgas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. for example, core galaxies accretesmall, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-densitycores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. an alternative modelfor core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (bhs): thebh may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any existsand scouring out a core. an average bh mass per spheroid of 0.002 times thestellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii ofobserved cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of agns andkinematic detections of bhs in nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;9707161	linear response, dynamical friction and the fluctuation-dissipation  theorem in stellar dynamics	we apply linear response theory to a general, inhomogeneous, stationarystellar system, with particular emphasis on dissipative processes analogous tolandau damping. assuming only that the response is causal, we show that theirreversible work done by an external perturber is described by theanti-hermitian part of a linear response operator, and damping of collectivemodes is described by the anti-hermitian part of a related polarizationoperator. we derive an exact formal expression for the response operator, whichis the classical analog of a well-known result in quantum statistical physics.when the self-gravity of the response can be ignored, and the ensemble-averagedgravitational potential is integrable, the expressions for the mode energy,damping rate, and polarization operator reduce to well-known formulae derivedfrom perturbation theory in action-angle variables. in this approximation,dissipation occurs only via resonant interaction with stellar orbits orcollective modes. for stellar systems in thermal equilibrium, theanti-hermitian part of the response operator is directly related to thecorrelation function of the fluctuations. thus dissipative properties of thesystem are completely determined by the spectrum of density fluctuations---thefluctuation-dissipation theorem. in particular, we express the coefficient ofdynamical friction for an orbiting test particle in terms of the fluctuationspectrum; this reduces to the known chandrasekhar formula in the restrictivecase of an infinite homogeneous system with a maxwellian velocity distribution.

astro-ph;9708072	the demography of massive dark objects in galaxy centres	we construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with hubblespace telescope photometry and ground-based kinematics. the models assume thateach galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function,arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratioupsilon, and a central massive dark object (mdo) of arbitrary mass m_bh. theyprovide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of m_bh andupsilon; the four galaxies that cannot be fit have kinematically decoupledcores. the mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fit galaxies areconsistent with the fundamental plane correlation upsilon \propto l^0.2, wherel is galaxy luminosity. in all but six galaxies the models require at the 95%confidence level an mdo of mass m_bh ~ 0.006 m_bulge = 0.006 upsilon l. five ofthe six galaxies consistent with m_bh=0 are also consistent with thiscorrelation. the other (ngc 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on m_bh. weconsider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describingthe correlation of the masses of these mdos with other galaxy properties. oneof the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~0.97 of galaxies havemdos, whose masses are well described by a gaussian distribution in log(m_bh/m_bulge) of mean -2.27 and width ~0.07.

astro-ph;9709130	linear response of galactic halos to adiabatic gravitational  perturbations	we determine the response of a self-similar isothermal stellar system tosmall adiabatic gravitational perturbations. for odd spherical harmonics, theresponse is identical to the response of the analogous isothermal fluid system.for even spherical harmonics, the response can be regarded as an infiniteseries of wavetrains in $\log r$, implying alternating compression andrarefaction in equal logarithmic radius intervals. partly because of theoscillatory nature of the solutions, tidal fields from external sources are notstrongly amplified by an intervening isothermal stellar system, except at radii$\lta 10^{-3.5}$ times the satellite radius; at some radii the stellar systemcan even screen the external tidal field in a manner analogous to debyescreening. as weinberg has pointed out, individual resonances in a stellarsystem can strongly amplify external tidal fields over a limited radial range,but we cannot address this possibility because we examine only adiabaticperturbations. we also discuss the application of our method to the haloresponse caused by the slow growth of an embedded thin disk.

astro-ph;9710116	fitting random stable solar systems to titius-bode laws	simple ``solar systems'' are generated with planetary orbital radii rdistributed uniformly random in log(r) between 0.2 and 50 au. a conservativestability criterion is imposed by requiring that adjacent planets are separatedby a minimum distance of k hill radii, for values of k ranging from 1 to 8.least-squares fits of these systems to generalized bode laws are performed, andcompared to the fit of our own solar system. we find that this stabilitycriterion, and other ``radius-exclusion'' laws, generally produce approximatelygeometrically spaced planets that fit a titius-bode law about as well as ourown solar system. we then allow the random systems the same exceptions thathave historically been applied to our own solar system. namely, one gap may beinserted, similar to the gap between mars and jupiter, and up to 3 planets maybe ``ignored'', similar to how some forms of bode's law ignore mercury,neptune, and pluto. with these particular exceptions, we find that our solarsystem fits significantly better than the random ones. however, we believe thatthis choice of exceptions, designed specifically to give our own solar system abetter fit, gives it an unfair advantage that would be lost if other exceptionrules were used. we conclude that the significance of bode's law is simply thatstable planetary systems tend to be regularly spaced; this conclusion could bestrengthened by the use of more stringent methods of rejecting unstable solarsystems, such as long-term orbit integrations.

astro-ph;9805145	resonant thickening of disks by small satellite galaxies	we study the vertical heating and thickening of galaxy disks due to accretionof small satellites. our simulations are restricted to axial symmetry, whichlargely eliminates numerical evolution of the target galaxy but requires thetrajectory of the satellite to be along the symmetry axis of the target. wefind that direct heating of disk stars by the satellite is not importantbecause the satellite's gravitational perturbation has little power atfrequencies resonant with the vertical stellar orbits. the satellite doeslittle damage to the disk until its decaying orbit resonantly exciteslarge-scale disk bending waves. bending waves can damp through dynamicalfriction from the halo or internal wave-particle resonances; we find thatwave-particle resonances dominate the damping. the principal vertical heatingmechanism is therefore dissipation of bending waves at resonances with stellarorbits in the disk. energy can thus be deposited some distance from the pointof impact of the satellite. the net heating from a tightly bound satellite canbe substantial, but satellites that are tidally disrupted before they are ableto excite bending waves do not thicken the disk.

astro-ph;9902032	rates of tidal disruption of stars by massive central black holes	there is strong evidence for some kind of massive dark object in the centresof many galaxy bulges. the detection of flares from tidally disrupted starscould confirm that these objects are black holes (bhs). here we presentcalculations of the stellar disruption rates in detailed dynamical models ofreal galaxies, taking into account the refilling of the loss cone of stars ondisruptable orbits by two-body relaxation and tidal forces in non-sphericalgalaxies. the highest disruption rates (one star per 10^4 yr) occur in faint(l&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies, which have steep central density cusps. more luminousgalaxies are less dense and have much longer relaxation times and more massivebhs. dwarf stars in such galaxies are swallowed whole by the bh and hence donot emit flares; giant stars could produce flares as often as every 10^5 yr,although the rate depends sensitively on the shape of the stellar distributionfunction. we discuss the possibility of detecting disruption flares in currentsupernova searches. the total mass of stars consumed over the lifetime of thegalaxy is of order 10^6 m_sun, independent of galaxy luminosity; thus disruptedstars may contribute significantly to the present bh mass in galaxies fainterthan about 10^9 l_sun.

astro-ph;9912026	axisymmetric, 3-integral models of galaxies: a massive black hole in  ngc3379	we fit axisymmetric 3-integral dynamical models to ngc3379 using theline-of-sight velocity distribution obtained from hst/fos spectra of the galaxycenter and ground-based long-slit spectroscopy along four position angles, withthe light distribution constrained by wfpc2 and ground-based images. we havefitted models with inclinations from 29 (intrinsic galaxy type e5) to 90degrees (intrinsic e1) and black hole masses from 0 to 1e9 m_solar. thebest-fit black hole masses range from 6e7 to 2e8 m_solar, depending oninclination. the velocity ellipsoid of the best model is not consistent witheither isotropy or a two-integral distribution function. along the major axis,the velocity ellipsoid becomes tangential at the innermost bin, radial in themid-range radii, and tangential again at the outermost bins. for the acceptablemodels, the radial to tangential dispersion in the mid-range radii ranges from1.1 &lt; sigma_r / sigma_t &lt; 1.7. compared with these 3-integral models,2-integral isotropic models overestimate the black hole mass since they cannotprovide adequate radial motion. however, the models presented in this paperstill contain restrictive assumptions-namely assumptions of constant m/l andspheroidal symmetry-requiring yet more models to study black hole properties incomplete generality.
