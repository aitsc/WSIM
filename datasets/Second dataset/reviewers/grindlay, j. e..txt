0908.2817	a relativistic type ibc supernova without a detected gamma-ray burst	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) mark the explosive death of somemassive stars and are a rare sub-class of type ibc supernovae (sne ibc). theyare distinguished by the production of an energetic and collimated relativisticoutflow powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole or neutron star).observationally, this outflow is manifested in the pulse of gamma-rays and along-lived radio afterglow. to date, central engine-driven sne have beendiscovered exclusively through their gamma-ray emission, yet it is expectedthat a larger population goes undetected due to limited satellite sensitivityor beaming of the collimated emission away from our line-of-sight. in thisframework, the recovery of undetected grbs may be possible through radiosearches for sne ibc with relativistic outflows. here we report the discoveryof luminous radio emission from the seemingly ordinary type ibc sn 2009bb,which requires a substantial relativistic outflow powered by a central engine.the lack of a coincident grb makes sn 2009bb the first engine-driven sndiscovered without a detected gamma-ray signal. a comparison with our extensiveradio survey of sne ibc reveals that the fraction harboring central engines islow, ~1 percent, measured independently from, but consistent with, the inferredrate of nearby grbs. our study demonstrates that upcoming optical and radiosurveys will soon rival gamma-ray satellites in pinpointing the nearestengine-driven sne. a similar result for a different supernova is reportedindependently.

0908.2818	the high-metallicity explosion environment of the relativistic supernova  2009bb	we investigate the environment of the nearby (d ~ 40mpc) broad-lined type icsupernova sn 2009bb. this event was observed to produce a relativistic outflowlikely powered by a central accreting compact object. while such a phenomenonwas previously observed only in long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), no lgrbwas detected in association with sn 2009bb. using an optical spectrum of the sn2009bb explosion site, we determine a variety of ism properties for the hostenvironment, including metallicity, young stellar population age, and starformation rate. we compare the sn explosion site properties to observations oflgrb and broad-lined sn ic host environments on optical emission line ratiodiagnostic diagrams. based on these analyses, we find that the sn 2009bbexplosion site has a very high metallicity of ~2x solar, in agreement withother broad-lined sn ic host environments and at odds with the low-redshiftlgrb host environments and recently proposed maximum metallicity limits forrelativistic explosions. we consider the implications of these findings and theimpact that sn 2009bb's unusual explosive properties and environment have onour understanding of the key physical ingredient that enables some sne toproduce a relativistic outflow.

1002.3889	imaging and burst location with the exist high-energy telescope	the primary instrument of the proposed exist mission is a coded mask highenergy telescope (the het), that must have a wide field of view and extremelygood sensitivity. it will be crucial to minimize systematic errors so that evenfor very long total integration times the imaging performance is close to thestatistical photon limit. there is also a requirement to be able to reconstructimages on-board in near real time in order to detect and localize gamma-raybursts. this must be done while the spacecraft is scanning the sky. thescanning provides all-sky coverage and is key to reducing systematic errors.the on-board computational problem is made even more challenging for exist bythe very large number of detector pixels. numerous alternative designs for thehet have been evaluated. the baseline concept adopted depends on a unique codedmask with two spatial scales. monte carlo simulations and analytic analysistechniques have been used to demonstrate the capabilities of the design and ofthe proposed two-step burst localization procedure.

1003.2965	interstellar extinction and the distribution of stellar populations in  the direction of the ultra-deep chandra galactic field	we studied the stellar population in the central 6.6x6.6arcmin,region of theultra-deep (1msec) chandra galactic field - the "chandra bulge field" (cbf)approximately 1.5 degrees away from the galactic center - using the hubblespace telescope acs/wfc blue (f435w) and red (f625w) images. we mainly focus onthe behavior of red clump giants - a distinct stellar population, which isknown to have an essentially constant intrinsic luminosity and color. bystudying the variation in the position of the red clump giants on a spatiallyresolved color-magnitude diagram, we confirm the anomalous total-to-selectiveextinction ratio, as reported in previous work for other galactic bulge fields.we show that the interstellar extinction in this area is &lt;a_(f625w)&gt;= 4 onaverage, but varies significantly between ~3-5 on angular scales as small as 1arcminute. using the distribution of red clump giants in anextinction-corrected color-magnitude diagram, we constrain the shape of astellar-mass distribution model in the direction of this ultra-deep chandrafield, which will be used in a future analysis of the population of x-raysources. we also show that the adopted model for the stellar densitydistribution predicts an infrared surface brightness in the direction of the"chandra bulge field" in good agreement (i.e. within ~15%) with the actualmeasurements derived from the spitzer/irac observations.

1011.3295	identification of a population of x-ray emitting massive stars in the  galactic plane	we present x-ray, infrared, optical and radio observations of four previouslyunidentified galactic plane x-ray sources, ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, axj144701-5919 and ax j144547-5931. detection of each source with the chandrax-ray observatory has provided sub-arcsecond localizations, which we use toidentify bright infrared counterparts to all four objects. infrared and opticalspectroscopy of these counterparts demonstrate that all four x-ray sources areextremely massive stars, with spectral classifications ofpe/wn9 (axj163252-4746), wn7 (ax j184738-0156 = wr121a), wn7-8h (ax j144701-5919) andoif+ (ax j144547-5931). ax j163252-4746 and ax j184738-0156 are both luminous,hard, x-ray emitters with strong fe xxv emission lines in their x-ray spectraat ~6.7 kev. the multi-wavelength properties of ax j163252-4746 and axj184738-0156 are not consistent with isolated massive stars or accretion onto acompact companion; we conclude that their x-ray emission is most likelygenerated in a colliding-wind binary system. for both ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931, the x-ray emission is an order of magnitude less luminous andwith a softer spectrum. these properties are consistent with a colliding-windbinary interpretation for these two sources also, but other mechanisms for thegeneration of x-rays cannot be excluded. there are many other as yetunidentified x-ray sources in the galactic plane, with x-ray properties similarto those seen for ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931. this may indicate a substantial population of x-ray-emittingmassive stars and colliding-wind binaries in the milky way.

1102.1722	spectral curvature behavior during x-ray flares in grb afterglow  emission	one of the most impressive recent discovery of swift is the evidence thatx-ray flares occurring during the grb afterglows are quite common, beingobserved in roughly 50% of the afterglows. these x-ray flares range fluencescomparable with the grb prompt emission and could be also repetitive. severalpictures have been proposed on their origin and among them the most acceptedregards the internal shock scenario, interpreting the x-ray flares as late timeactivity of the grb central engine. we propose to describe the spectral shapeof the x-ray flares adopting the same physical model recently used to interpretthe grb prompt emission: the log-parabolic function. in particular, we showthat their spectral energy distribution (sed) is remarkably curved, while nosignificant curvature appears in the underlying x-ray afterglow emission. inaddition, the log-parabolic function is statistically favored with respect toother proposed spectral models. by using a time resolved spectral analysis, weshow the evolution of the peak energy and the curvature parameters of the sedduring the x-ray flares in two of the brightest grbs afterglows observed byswift. we found that in the x-ray flares there is an anti-correlation betweenthe peak energy and the curvature, as expected in a stochastic accelerationscenario.

1103.3716	transient extremely soft x-ray emission from the unusually bright cv in  the globular cluster m3: a new cv x-ray luminosity record?	we observed the accreting white dwarf 1e1339.8+2837 (1e1339) in the globularcluster m3 in nov. 2003, may 2004 and jan. 2005, using the chandra acis-sdetector. the source was observed in 1992 to possess traits of a supersoftx-ray source (sss), with a 0.1-2.4 kev luminosity as large as 2x10^{35} erg/s,after which time the source's luminosity fell by roughly two orders ofmagnitude, adopting a hard x-ray spectrum more typical of cvs. our observationsconfirm 1e1339's hard cv-like spectrum, with photon index gamma=1.3+-0.2. wefound 1e1339 to be highly variable, with a 0.5-10 kev luminosity ranging from1.4+-0.3x10^{34} erg/s to 8.5+4.9-4.6x10^{32} erg/s, with 1e1339's maximumluminosity being perhaps the highest yet recorded for hard x-ray emission ontoa white dwarf. in jan. 2005, 1e1339 displayed substantial low-energy emissionbelow 0.3 kev. although current chandra responses cannot properly model thisemission, its bolometric luminosity appears comparable to or greater than thatof the hard spectral component. this raises the possibility that the supersoftx-ray emission seen from 1e1339 in 1992 may have shifted to the far-uv.

1203.0568	infrared colors of the gamma-ray detected blazars	blazars constitute the most enigmatic class of extragalactic gamma-raysources, and their observational features have been ascribed to a relativisticjet closely aligned to the line of sight. they are generally divided in twomain classes: the bl lac objects (bl lacs) and the flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). in the case of bl lacs the double bumped spectral energy distribution(sed) is generally described by the synchrotron self compton (ssc) emission,while for the fsrqs it is interpreted as due to external compton (ec) emission.recently, we showed that in the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] micron color- color diagramthe blazar population covers a distinct region (i.e., the wise blazar strip,wbs), clearly separated from the other extragalactic sources that are dominatedby thermal emission. in this paper we investigate the relation between theinfrared and gamma-ray emission for a subset of confirmed blazars from theliterature, associated with fermi sources, for which wise archival observationsare available. this sample is a proper subset of the sample of sources usedpreviously, and the availability of fermi data is critical to constrain themodels on the emission mechanisms for the blazars. we found that the selectedblazars also lie on the wise blazar strip covering a narrower region of theinfrared color-color planes than the overall blazars population. we then foundan evident correlation between the ir and gamma-ray spectral indices expectedin the ssc and ec frameworks. finally, we determined the ratio between theirgamma-ray and infrared fluxes, a surrogate of the ratio of powers between theinverse compton and the synchrotron sed components, and used such parameter totest different emitting scenarios blazars.

1203.1330	the wise gamma-ray strip parametrization: the nature of the gamma-ray  active galactic nuclei of uncertain type	despite the large number of discoveries made recently by fermi, the originsof the so called unidentified gamma-ray sources remain unknown. the largenumber of these sources suggests that among them there could be a populationthat significantly contributes to the isotropic gamma-ray background and istherefore crucial to understand their nature. the first step toward a completecomprehension of the unidentified gamma-ray source population is to identifythose that can be associated with blazars, the most numerous class ofextragalactic sources in the gamma-ray sky. recently, we discovered thatblazars can be recognized and separated from other extragalactic sources usingthe infrared (ir) wise satellite colors. the blazar population delineates aremarkable and distinctive region of the ir color-color space, the wise blazarstrip. in particular, the subregion delineated by the gamma-ray emittingblazars is even narrower and we named it as the wise gamma-ray strip (wgs). inthis paper we parametrize the wgs on the basis of a single parameter s that wethen use to determine if gamma-ray active galactic nuclei of the uncertain type(agus) detected by fermi are consistent with the wgs and so can be consideredblazar candidates. we find that 54 agus out of a set 60 analyzed have ir colorsconsistent with the wgs; only 6 agus are outliers. this result implies that avery high percentage (i.e., in this sample about 90%) of the agus detected byfermi are indeed blazar candidates.

astro-ph;0005496	rxte studies of long-term x-ray spectral variations in 4u 1820-30	we present the results of detailed spectral studies of the ultra-compact lowmass x-ray binary (lmxb) 4u 1820-30 carried out with the rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) during 1996-7. 4u 1820-30 is an ``atoll'' source x-ray burster(xrb) located in the globular cluster ngc 6624. it is known to have an 11minute binary period and a ~176 day modulation in its 2--12 kev flux.observations were made with the pca and hexte instruments on rxte at roughlyone-month intervals to sample this long-term period and study flux-relatedspectral changes. there are clear correlations between our fitted spectralparameters and both the broad-band (2--50 kev) flux and the position in thecolor-color diagram, as described by the parameter s_a introduced by mendez etal. (1999). in addition, we find a strong correlation between the position inthe color-color diagram and the frequencies of the kilohertz quasi-periodicoscillations (khz qpos) reported by zhang et al. (1998). this lends furthersupport to the notion that evidence for the last stable orbit in the accretiondisk of 4u 1820-30 has been observed. for a model consisting of comptonizationof cool photons by hot electrons plus an additional blackbody component, wereport an abrupt change in the spectral parameters at the same accretion rateat which the khz qpos disappear. for a model consisting of a multicolor diskblackbody plus a cut-off power law, we find that the inner disk radius reachesa minimum at the same accretion rate at which the khz qpo frequency saturates,as expected if the disk reaches the last stable orbit. both models facetheoretical and observational problems when interpreted physically for thissystem.

astro-ph;0005497	rxte studies of x-ray spectral variations with accretion rate in 4u  1915-05	we present the results of detailed spectral studies of the ultra-compact lowmass x-ray binary (lmxb) 4u 1915-05 carried out with the rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) during 1996. 4u 1915-05 is an x-ray burster (xrb) known toexhibit a ~199-day modulation in its 2--12 kev flux. observations wereperformed with the pca and hexte instruments on rxte at roughly one-monthintervals to sample this long-term period and study accretion rate-relatedspectral changes. we obtain good fits with a model consisting of a blackbodyand an exponentially cut-off power law. the spectral parameters are stronglycorrelated with both the broad-band (2--50 kev) luminosity and the position inthe color-color diagram, with the source moving from a low hard state to a highsoft state as the accretion rate increases. the blackbody component appears todrive the spectral evolution. our results are consistent with a geometry inwhich the soft component arises from an optically thick boundary layer and thehard component from an extended comptonizing corona. comparing our results withthose of a similar study of the brighter source 4u 1820-30 (bloser et al.2000), we find that the two ultra-compact lmxbs occupy similar spectral stateseven though the transitions occur at very different total luminosities.

astro-ph;0010359	stellar variability in the globular cluster terzan 5	we present the results of a search for variability in and near the core ofthe metal-rich, obscured globular cluster terzan 5, using nicmos on hst. thisextreme cluster has approximately solar metallicity and a central density thatplaces it in the upper few percent of all clusters. it is estimated to have thehighest interaction rate of any galactic globular cluster. the large extinctiontowards terzan 5 and the severe stellar crowding near the cluster centerpresent a substantial observational challenge. using time series analysis wediscovered two variable stars in this cluster. the first is a rrab lyraevariable with a period of ~0.61 days, a longer period than that of field starswith similar high metallicities. this period is, however, shorter than theaverage periods of rr lyraes found in the metal-rich globular clusters ngc6441, ngc 6388 and 47 tuc. the second variable is a blue star with a 7-hourperiod sinusoidal variation and a likely orbital period of 14 hours. this staris probably an eclipsing blue straggler, or (less likely) the infraredcounterpart to the low mass x-ray binary known in terzan 5. due to the extremecrowding and overlapping airy profile of the ir psf, we fall short of ouroriginal goal of detecting cvs via palpha emission and detecting variableinfrared emission from the location of the binary msp in terzan 5.

astro-ph;0010465	timing analysis of the light curve of the dipping-bursting x-ray binary  x1916-053	we present the timing analysis results for our observations of the x-ray dipsource x1916-053 conducted with rxte between february and october of 1996. ourgoal was to finally measure the binary period - as either the x-ray dip periodor ~1% longer optical modulation period, thereby establishing if the binary hasa precessing disk (su uma model) or a third star (triple model). combined withhistorical data (1979-96), the x-ray dip period is measured to be 3000.6508$\pm$ 0.0009 sec with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit $|\dot p| \leq 2.06 \times10^{-11}$. from our quasi-simultaneous optical observations (may 14-23, 1996)and historical data (1987-96), we measure the optical modulation period to be3027.5510 $\pm$ 0.0052 sec with a 2$\sigma$ upper limit $|\dot p| \leq 2.28\times 10^{-10}$. the two periods are therefore each stable (over all recordeddata) and require a $3.9087 \pm 0.0008$d beat period. this beat period, andseveral of its harmonics is also observed as variations in the dip shape. phasemodulation of x-ray dips, observed in a 10 consecutive day observation, ishighly correlated with the $\sim$3.9d dip shape modulation. the 1987-1996optical observations show that the optical phase fluctuations are a factor of 3larger than those in the x-ray. we discuss su uma vs. triple models to describethe x1916-053 light curve behavior and conclude that the x-ray dip period, withsmaller phase jitter, is probably the binary period so that the requiredprecession is most likely similar to that observed in su uma and x-ray novasystems. however the ``precession'' period stability and especially the factthat the times of x-ray bursts may partially cluster to occur just after x-raydips, continue to suggest that this system may be a hierarchical triple.

astro-ph;0110074	balloon flight background measurement with actively-shielded planar and  imaging czt detectors	we present results from the flight of two prototype czt detectors on ascientific balloon payload in september 2000. the first detector, referred toas ``czt1,'' consisted of a 10 mm x 10 mm x 2 mm czt crystal with a single goldplanar electrode readout. this detector was shielded by a combination of apassive collimator surrounded by plastic scintillator and a thick bgo crystalin the rear. the second detector, ``czt2,'' comprised two 10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mmczt crystals, one made of ev products high pressure bridgman material and theother of imarad horizontal bridgman material, each fashioned with a 4 x 4 arrayof gold pixels on a 2.5 mm pitch. the pixellated detectors wereflip-chip-mounted side by side and read out by a 32-channel asic. this detectorwas also shielded by a passive/plastic collimator in the front, but used onlyadditional passive/plastic shielding in the rear. both experiments were flownfrom ft. sumner, nm on september 19, 2000 on a 24 hour balloon flight. czt1recorded a non-vetoed background level at 100 kev of ~1e-3 cts/cm2/s/kev.raising the bgo threshold from 50 kev to ~1 mev produced only an 18% increasein this level. czt2 recorded a background at 100 kev of ~4e-3 cts/cm2/s/kev inthe ev products detector and ~6e-3 cts/cm2/s/kev in the imarad detector. bothczt1 and czt2 spectra were in basic agreement with monte carlo simulations,though both recorded systematically higher count rates at high energy thanpredicted. no lines were observed, indicating that neutron capture reactions,at least those producing decay lines at a few 100 kev, are not significantcomponents of the czt background. comparison of the czt1 and czt2 spectraindicates that passive/plastic shielding may provide adequately low backgroundlevels for many applications.

astro-ph;0310475	cathode depth sensing in czt detectors	measuring the depth of interaction in thick cadmium-zinc-telluride (czt)detectors allows improved imaging and spectroscopy for hard x-ray imaging above100 kev. the energetic x-ray imaging survey telescope (exist) will employrelatively thick (5 - 10 mm) czt detectors, which are required to perform thebroad energy-band sky survey. interaction depth information is needed tocorrect events to the detector "focal plane" for correct imaging and can beused to improve the energy resolution of the detector at high energies byallowing event-based corrections for incomplete charge collection. backgroundrejection is also improved by allowing low energy events from the rear andsides of the detector to be rejected. we present experimental results ofinteraction depth sensing in a 5 mm thick pixellated au-contact imarad cztdetector. the depth sensing was done by making simultaneous measurements ofcathode and anode signals, where the interaction depth at a given energy isproportional to the ratio of cathode/anode signals. we demonstrate how a simpleempirical formula describing the event distributions in the cathode/anodesignal space can dramatically improve the energy resolution. we also estimatethe energy and depth resolution of the detector as a function of the energy andthe interaction depth. we also show a depth-sensing prototype system currentlyunder development for exist in which cathode signals from 8, 16 or 32 crystalscan be read-out by a small multi-channel asic board that is verticallyedge-mounted on the cathode electrode along every second czt crystal boundary.this allows czt crystals to be tiled contiguously with minimum impact onthroughput of incoming photons. the robust packaging is crucial in exist, whichwill employ very large area imaging czt detector arrays.

astro-ph;0402294	discovery of x-ray absorption features from the dipping low-mass x-ray  binary xb 1916-053 with xmm-newton	we report the discovery of narrow fe xxv and fe xxvi k alpha x-ray absorptionlines at 6.65 and 6.95 kev in the persistent emission of the dipping low-massx-ray binary (lmxb) xb 1916-053 during an xmm-newton observation performed inseptember 2002. in addition, there is marginal evidence for absorption featuresat 1.48 kev, 2.67 kev, 7.82 kev and 8.29 kev consistent with mg xii, s xvi, nixxvii k alpha and fe xxvi k beta transitions, respectively. such absorptionlines from highly ionized ions are now observed in a number of high inclination(ie. close to edge-on) lmxbs, such as xb 1916-053, where the inclination isestimated to be between 60-80 degrees. this, together with the lack of anyorbital phase dependence of the features (except during dips), suggests thatthe highly ionized plasma responsible for the absorption lines is located in acylindrical geometry around the compact object. using the ratio of fe xxv andfe xxvi column densities, we estimate the photo-ionization parameter of theabsorbing material to be 10^{3.92} erg cm s^{-1}. only the fe xxv line isobserved during dipping intervals and the upper-limits to the fe xxvi columndensity are consistent with a decrease in the amount of ionization duringdipping intervals. this implies the presence of cooler material in the line ofsight during dipping. we also report the discovery of a 0.98 kev absorptionedge in the persistent emission spectrum. the edge energy decreases to 0.87 kevduring deep dipping intervals. the detected feature may result from edges ofmoderately ionized ne and/or fe with the average ionization level decreasingfrom persistent emission to deep dipping. this is again consistent with thepresence of cooler material in the line of sight during dipping.

astro-ph;0404453	the burst and transient source experiment (batse) earth occultation  catalog of low-energy gamma-ray sources	the burst and transient source experiment (batse), aboard the compton gammaray observatory (cgro), provided a record of the low-energy gamma-ray sky(20-1000 kev) between 1991 april and 2000 may (9.1y). using the earthoccultation technique to extract flux information, a catalog of sources usingdata from the batse large area detectors has been prepared. the first part ofthe catalog consists of results from the monitoring of 58 sources, mostlygalactic. for these sources, we have included tables of flux and spectral data,and outburst times for transients. light curves (or flux histories) have beenplaced on the world wide web. we then performed a deep-sampling of 179 objects(including the aforementioned 58 objects) combining data from the entire 9.1ybatse dataset. source types considered were primarily accreting binaries, but asmall number of representative active galaxies, x-ray-emitting stars, andsupernova remnants were also included. the deep sample results include definitedetections of 83 objects and possible detections of 36 additional objects. thedefinite detections spanned three classes of sources: accreting black hole andneutron star binaries, active galaxies and supernova remnants. flux data forthe deep sample are presented in four energy bands: 20-40, 40-70, 70-160, and160-430 kev. the limiting average flux level (9.1 y) for the sample varies from3.5 to 20 mcrab (5 sigma) between 20 and 430 kev, depending on systematicerror, which in turn is primarily dependent on the sky location. to strengthenthe credibility of detection of weaker sources (5-25 mcrab), we generated earthoccultation images, searched for periodic behavior using fft and epoch foldingmethods, and critically evaluated the energy-dependent emission in the fourflux bands.

astro-ph;0412137	three additional quiescent low-mass x-ray binary candidates in 47  tucanae	we identify through their x-ray spectra one certain (w37) and two probable(w17 and x4) quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries (qlmxbs) containing neutronstars in a long chandra x-ray exposure of the globular cluster 47 tucanae, inaddition to the two previously known qlmxbs. w37's spectrum is dominated by ablackbody-like component consistent with radiation from the hydrogen atmosphereof a 10 km neutron star. w37's lightcurve shows strong x-ray variability whichwe attribute to variations in its absorbing column depth, and eclipses with aprobable 3.087 hour period. for most of our exposures, w37's blackbody-likeemission (assumed to be from the neutron star surface) is almost completelyobscured, yet some soft x-rays (of uncertain origin) remain. two additionalcandidates, w17 and x4, present x-ray spectra dominated by a harder component,fit by a power-law of photon index ~1.6-3. an additional soft component isrequired for both w17 and x4, which can be fit with a 10 km hydrogen-atmosphereneutron star model. x4 shows significant variability, which may arise fromeither its power-law or hydrogen-atmosphere spectral component. both w17 and x4show rather low x-ray luminosities, lx(0.5-10 kev)~5*10^{31} ergs/s. all threecandidate qlmxbs would be difficult to identify in other globular clusters,suggesting an additional reservoir of fainter qlmxbs in globular clusters thatmay be of similar numbers as the group of previously identified objects. thenumber of millisecond pulsars inferred to exist in 47 tuc is less than 10 timeslarger than the number of qlmxbs in 47 tuc, indicating that for typicalinferred lifetimes of 10 and 1 gyr respectively, their birthrates arecomparable.

astro-ph;0512168	a chandra x-ray observation of the globular cluster terzan 1	we present a 19 ks chandra acis-s observation of the globular cluster terzan1. fourteen sources are detected within 1.4 arcmin of the cluster center with 2of these sources predicted to be not associated with the cluster (backgroundagn or foreground objects). the neutron star x-ray transient, x1732-304, haspreviously been observed in outburst within this globular cluster with theoutburst seen to last for at least 12 years. here we find 4 sources that areconsistent with the rosat position for this transient, but none of the sourcesare fully consistent with the position of a radio source detected with the vlathat is likely associated with the transient. the most likely candidate for thequiescent counterpart of the transient has a relatively soft spectrum and anunabsorbed 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 2.6e32 ergs/s, quite typical of otherquiescent neutron stars. assuming standard core cooling, from the quiescentflux of this source we predict long (&gt;400 yr) quiescent episodes to allow theneutron star to cool. alternatively, enhanced core cooling processes are neededto cool down the core. however, if we do not detect the quiescent counterpartof the transient this gives an unabsorbed 0.5-10 kev luminosity upper limit of8e31 ergs/s. we also discuss other x-ray sources within the globular cluster.  from the estimated stellar encouter rate of this cluster we find that thenumber of sources we detect is significantly higher than expected by therelationship of pooley et al.

astro-ph;9802053	rxte observation of the x-ray burster 1e1724-3045. i : timing study of  the persistent x-ray emission with the pca	we report on the rxte/pca observation of the x-ray burster 1e1724-3045located in the globular cluster terzan 2. the persistent x-ray emission shows ahigh level of noise variability, the so-called high frequency noise (hfn) witha fractional root mean squared (rms) of about 25% in the 2e-3 - 40 hz range.the strong hfn together with the hardness of its x-ray spectrum suggest that1e1724-3045 is an ``atoll'' source which was in its ``island'' state during theobservation. the fourier power density spectra (pds) can be modeled in terms ofthe sum of two ``shot noise'' components for which the shots have a single-sideexponential shape. the characteristic shot decay timescales inferred from thebest fitting of the pds are ~680 and 16 msec respectively. the two componentscontribute similarly to the total rms (about 15%). the pds contains also athird component: a broad and asymmetric peaked noise feature centered at 0.8hz. this quasi periodic oscillation-like (qpo) feature contributes at the levelof ~ 10% to the total rms. the integrated rms of all three components shows apositive correlation with energy up to at least 40 kev. we also show that1e1724-3045 has striking timing similarities with the black hole candidate groj0422+32 (nova persei 1992). our observation demonstrates that a low frequencyqpo simultaneously with a high level of rms is not a timing signature unique toblack holes. this extends the growing list of similarities between atollsources and black hole systems.

astro-ph;9804268	galactic black hole binaries: high-energy radiation	observations of galactic bhcs made by the compton gro in the hard x-ray andgamma-ray bands have significantly enhanced our knowledge of the emissionproperties of these objects. understanding these observations presents aformidable challenge to theoretical models of the accretion flow onto thecompact object and of the physical mechanisms that generate high-energyradiation. here we summarize the current state of observations and theoreticalinterpretation of the emission from bhcs above 20 kev.  the all-sky monitoring capability of batse allows nearly continuous studiesof the high-energy emission from more than a dozen bhcs. these long-termdatasets are particularly well-suited to multi-wavelength studies. energyspectral evolution and/or state transitions have been observed from many of thebhcs.  observations above 50 kev from osse demonstrate the existence of two gammaray spectral states that appear to be the extensions of the x-ray low/hard andhigh/soft (or perhaps very high) states. the former state, the "breaking"state, cuts off with e-folding energy ~100 kev and has its peak luminosity nearthis energy. in contrast, the latter state has luminosity peaking in the softx-rays and an unbroken power law spectrum, even up to energies above 500 kev insome cases.  the breaking gamma-ray spectrum can be well modeled by comptonization of softphotons in a hot thermal plasma. the power-law state creates more significanttheoretical challenges. it has been suggested that in this state the high-energy emission arises from bulk-motion comptonization in the convergentaccretion flow from the inner edge of the accretion disk.
