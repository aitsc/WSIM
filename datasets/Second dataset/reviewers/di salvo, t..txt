0902.2128	timing of the 2008 outburst of sax j1808.4-3658 with xmm-newton: a  stable orbital period derivative over ten years	we report on a timing analysis performed on a 62-ks long xmm-newtonobservation of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 during thelatest x-ray outburst that started on september 21, 2008. by connecting thetime of arrivals of the pulses observed during the xmm observation, we derivedthe best-fit orbital solution and a best-fit value of the spin period for the2008 outburst. comparing this new set of orbital parameters and, in particular,the value of the time of ascending-node passage with the orbital parametersderived for the previous four x-ray outbursts of sax j1808.4-3658 observed bythe pca on board rxte, we find an updated value of the orbital periodderivative, which turns out to be $\dot p_{\rm orb} = (3.89 \pm 0.15) \times10^{-12}$ s/s. this new value of the orbital period derivative agrees with thepreviously reported value, demonstrating that the orbital period derivative inthis source has remained stable over the past ten years. although this timespanis not sufficient yet for confirming the secular evolution of the system, weagain propose an explanation of this behavior in terms of a highlynon-conservative mass transfer in this system, where the accreted mass (asderived from the x-ray luminosity during outbursts) accounts for a mere 1% ofthe mass lost by the companion.

0902.4398	searching for pulsed emission from xte j0929-314 at high radio  frequencies	the aim of this work is to search for radio signals in the quiescent phase ofaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, in this way giving an ultimate proof ofthe recycling model, thereby unambiguously establishing that accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars are the progenitors of radio millisecond pulsars.  to overcome the possible free-free absorption caused by matter surroundingaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsars in their quiescence phase, we performed theobservations at high frequencies. making use of particularly precise orbitaland spin parameters obtained from x-ray observations, we carried out a deepsearch for radio-pulsed emission from the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsarxte j0929-314 in three steps, correcting for the effect of the dispersion dueto the interstellar medium, eliminating the orbital motions effects, andfinally folding the time series.  no radio pulsation is present in the analyzed data down to a limit of 68microjy at 6.4 ghz and 26 microjy at 8.5 ghz.  we discuss several mechanisms that could prevent the detection, concludingthat beaming factor and intrinsic low luminosity are the most likelyexplanations.

0906.3716	a ionized reflecting skin above the accretion disk of gx 349+2	the broad emission features in the fe-kalpha region of x-ray binary spectrarepresent an invaluable probe to constrain the geometry and the physics ofthese systems. several low mass x-ray binary systems (lmxbs) containing aneutron star (ns) show broad emission features between 6 and 7 kev and most ofthem are nowi nterpreted as reflection features from the inner part of anaccretion disk in analogy to those observed in the spectra of x-ray binarysystems containing a black hole candidate. the ns lmxb gx 349+2 was observed bythe xmm-newton satellite which allows, thanks to its high effective area andgood spectral resolution between 6 and 7 kev, a detailed spectroscopic study ofthe fe-kalpha region. we study the xmm data in the 0.7-10 kev energy band. thecontinuum emission is modelled by a blackbody component plus a multicoloreddisk blackbody. a very intense emission line at 1 kev, three broad emissionfeatures at 2.63, 3.32, 3.9 kev and a broader emission feature in the fe-kalpharegion are present in the residuals. the broad emission features above 2 kevcan be equivalently well fitted with gaussian profiles or relativistic smearedlines (diskline in xspec). the fe-kalpha feature is better fitted using adiskline component at 6.76 kev or two diskline components at 6.7 and 6.97 kev,respectively. the emission features are interpreted as resonant transitions ofs xvi, ar xviii, ca xix, and highly ionized iron. modelling the line profileswith relativistic smeared lines, we find that the reflecting plasma is locatedat less than 40 km from the ns, a value compatible with the inner radius of theaccretion disk inferred from the multicolored disk blackbody component ($24 \pm7$ km). the inclination angle of gx 349+2 is between 40 and 47 deg.

0708.0498	orbital evolution of an accreting millisecond pulsar: witnessing the  banquet of a hidden black widow?	we have performed a timing analysis of all the four x-ray outbursts from theaccreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 observed so far by the pca onboard rxte. for each of the outbursts we derived the best-fit value of the timeof ascending node passage. we find that these times follow a parabolic trend,which gives an orbital period derivative $\dot p_{\rm orb} = (3.40 \pm 0.18)\times 10^{-12}$ s/s, and a refined estimate of the orbital period, $p_{\rmorb} = 7249.156499 \pm 1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ s (reference epoch $t_0 =50914.8099$ mjd). this derivative is positive, suggesting a degenerate or fullyconvective companion star, but is more than one order of magnitude higher thanwhat is expected from secular evolution driven by angular momentum lossescaused by gravitational radiation under the hypothesis of conservative masstransfer. using simple considerations on the angular momentum of the system, wepropose an explanation of this puzzling result assuming that during x-rayquiescence the source is ejecting matter (and angular momentum) from the innerlagrangian point. we have also verified that this behavior is in agreement witha possible secular evolution of the system under the hypothesis of highlynon-conservative mass transfer. in this case, we find stringent constraints onthe masses of the two components of the binary system and its inclination. theproposed orbital evolution indicates that in this kind of sources the neutronstar is capable to efficiently ablate the companion star, suggesting that thiskind of objects are part of the population of the so-called black widowpulsars, still visible in x-rays during transient mass accretion episodes.

0708.0534	precise determination of orbital parameters in system with slowly  drifting phases: application to the case of xte j1807-294	we describe a timing technique that allows to obtain precise orbitalparameters of an accreting millisecond pulsar in those cases in which intrinsicvariations of the phase delays (caused e.g. by proper variation of the spinfrequency) with characteristic timescale longer than the orbital period do notallow to fit the orbital parameters over a long observation (tens of days). weshow under which conditions this method can be applied and show the resultsobtained applying this method to the 2003 outburst observed by rxte of theaccreting millisecond pulsar xte j1807-294 which shows in its phase delays anon-negligible erratic behavior. we refined the orbital parameters of xtej1807-294 using all the 90 days in which the pulsation is strongly detected andthe method applicable. in this way we obtain the orbital parameters of thesource with a precision more than one order of magnitude better than theprevious available orbital solution, a precision obtained to date, on accretingmillisecond pulsars, only for xte j1807-294 analyzing several outburstsspanning over seven years and with a much better statistics.

1004.1963	a self-consistent approach to the hard and soft states of 4u 1705-44	we analyzed two xmm-newton observations of the bright atoll source 4u1705-44, which can be considered a prototype of the class of the persistent nslmxbs showing both hard and soft states. the first observation was performedwhen the source was in a hard low flux state, the second during a soft,high-flux state. both the spectra show broad iron emission lines. we fit thespectra using a two-component model, together with a reflection modelspecifically suited to the case of a neutron star, where the incident spectrumhas a blackbody shape. in the soft state, the reflection model, convolved witha relativistic smearing component, consistently describes the broad featurespresent in the spectrum, and we find a clear relation between the temperatureof the incident flux and the temperature of the harder x-ray component that weinterpret as the boundary layer emission. in this state we find convergingevidence that the boundary layer outer radius is ~ 2 times the neutron starradius. in the low flux state, we observe a change in the continuum shape ofthe spectrum with respect to the soft state. still, the broad local emissionfeatures can be associated with a disk reflecting matter, but in a lowerionization state, and possibly produced in an accretion disk truncated atgreater distance. our analysis provides strong evidence that the reflectioncomponent in soft states of lmxbs comes from to hard x-ray thermal irradiation,which we identify with the boundary layer emission, also present in thecontinuum model. in the hard state, the broad iron line if also produced byreflection, and the continuum disk emission can be self-consistently accountedif the disk is truncated at a greater distance than the soft state.

1006.4260	search for pulsations at high radio frequencies from accreting  millisecond x-ray pulsars in quiescence	it is commonly believed that millisecond radio pulsars have been spun up bytransfer of matter and angular momentum from a low-mass companion during anx-ray active mass transfer phase. a subclass of low-mass x-ray binaries is thatof the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsars, transient systems that show periodsof x-ray quiescence during which radio emission could switch on. the aim ofthis work is to search for millisecond pulsations from three accretingmillisecond x-ray pulsars, xte j1751-305, xte j1814-338, and sax j1808.4-3658,observed during their quiescent x-ray phases at high radio frequencies (5 - 8ghz) in order to overcome the problem of the free-free absorption due to thematter engulfing the system. a positive result would provide definite proof ofthe recycling model, providing the direct link between the progenitors andtheir evolutionary products. the data analysis methodology has been chosen onthe basis of the precise knowledge of orbital and spin parameters from x-rayobservations. it is subdivided in three steps: we corrected the time series forthe effects of (i) the dispersion due to interstellar medium and (ii) of theorbital motions, and finally (iii) folded modulo the spin period to increasethe signal-to-noise ratio. no radio signal with spin and orbitalcharacteristics matching those of the x-ray sources has been found in oursearch, down to very low flux density upper limits. we analysed severalmechanisms that could have prevented the detection of the signal, concludingthat the low luminosity of the sources and the geometric factor are the mostlikely reasons for this negative result.

0710.4934	spectral analysis of lmc x-2 with xmm/newton: unveiling the emission  process in the extragalactic z-source	we present the results of the analysis of an archival observation of lmc x-2performed with xmm/newton. the spectra taken by high-precision instruments havenever been analyzed before. we find an x-ray position for the source that isinconsistent with the one obtained by rosat, but in agreement with the einsteinposition and that of the optical counterpart. the correlated spectral andtiming behaviour of the source suggests that the source is probably in thenormal branch of its x-ray color-color diagram. the spectrum of the source canbe fitted with a blackbody with a temperature 1.5 kev plus a disk blackbody at0.8 kev. photoelectric absorption from neutral matter has an equivalenthydrogen column of 4 x 10^{20} cm^{-2}. an emission line, which we identify asthe o viii lyman alpha line, is detected, while no feature due to iron isdetected in the spectrum. we argue that the emission of this source can bestraightforwardly interpreted as a sum of the emission from a boundary layerbetween the ns and the disc and a blackbody component coming from the discitself. other canonical models that are used to fit z-sources do not give asatisfactory fit to the data. the detection of the o viii emission line (andthe lack of detection of lines in the iron region) can be due to the fact thatthe source lies in the large magellanic cloud.

1203.4096	the pulse profile and spin evolution of the accreting pulsar in terzan  5, igr j17480-2446, during its 2010 outburst	(abridged) we analyse the spectral and pulse properties of the 11 hztransient accreting pulsar, igr j17480-2446, in the globular cluster terzan 5,considering all the available rxte, swift and integral observations performedbetween october and november, 2010.  by measuring the pulse phase evolution we conclude that the ns spun up at anaverage rate of &lt;nu_dot&gt;=1.48(2)e-12 hz/s, compatible with the accretion of thekeplerian angular momentum of matter at the inner disc boundary. similar toother accreting pulsars, the stability of the pulse phases determined by usingthe second harmonic component is higher than that of the phases based on thefundamental frequency. under the assumption that the second harmonic is a goodtracer of the neutron star spin frequency, we successfully model its evolutionin terms of a luminosity dependent accretion torque. if the ns accretes thespecific keplerian angular momentum of the in-flowing matter, we estimate theinner disc radius to lie between 47 and 93 km when the luminosity attains itspeak value. smaller values are obtained if the interaction between the magneticfield lines and the plasma in the disc is considered.  the phase-averaged spectrum is described by thermal comptonization of photonswith energy of ~1 kev. a hard to soft state transition is observed during theoutburst rise. the comptonized spectrum evolves from a comptonizing cloud at anelectron temperature of ~20 kev towards an optically denser cloud at kt_e~3kev. at the same time, the pulse amplitude decreases from 27% to few per centand becomes strongly energy dependent. we discuss various possibilities toexplain such a behaviour, proposing that at large accretion luminosities asignificant fraction of the in-falling matter is not channelled towards themagnetic poles, but rather accretes more evenly onto the ns surface.

1204.2464	a complete x-ray spectral coverage of the 2010 may-june outbursts of  circinus x-1	circinus x-1 is a neutron-star-accreting x-ray binary in a wide (p$_{\rmorb}$ = 16.6 d), eccentric orbit. after two years of relatively low x-rayluminosity, in may 2010 circinus x-1 went into outburst, reaching 0.4 crabflux. this outburst lasted for about two orbital cycles and was followed byanother shorter and fainter outburst in june. we focus here on the broadbandx-ray spectral evolution of the source as it spans about three order ofmagnitudes in flux. we attempt to relate luminosity, spectral shape, localabsorption, and orbital phase. we use multiple rossi-xte/pca (3.0--25 kev) andswift/xrt (1.0--9.0 kev) observations and a 20 ks long chandra/hetgsobservation (1.0--9.0 kev), to comprehensively track the spectral evolution ofthe source during all the outbursting phases. these observations were takenevery two/three days and cover about four orbital cycles. the pca data mostlycover the major outburst, the xrt data monitor the declining phase of the majoroutburst and all the phases of the minor outburst, and chandra data provide anessential snapshot of the end of this overall outbursting phase. the x-rayspectrum can be satisfactorily described by a thermal comptonization model withvariable neutral local absorption in all phases of the outburst. no otheradditive component is statistically required. the first outburst decayslinearly, with an ankle in the light curve as the flux decreases below$\sim$\,5 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. at the same time, thesource shows a clear spectral state transition from an optically thick to anoptically thin state. while the characteristics of the first, bright, outburstcan be interpreted within the disk-instability scenario, the following, minor,outburst shows peculiarities that cannot be easily reconciled in thisframework.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

astro-ph;0005396	the broad band spectrum of mxb 1728-34 observed by bepposax	we report on the results of a broad band (0.1-100 kev) spectral analysis ofthe bursting atoll source mxb 1728-34 observed by the bepposax satellite. threebursts were present during this observation. the spectrum during the bursts canbe fitted by a blackbody with a temperature of 2 kev. from the bursts we alsoestimate a distance to the source of 5.1 kpc. mxb 1728-34 was in a rather softstate during the bepposax observation. the persistent spectrum is well fittedby a continuum consisting of a soft blackbody emission and a comptonizedspectrum. we interpreted the soft component as the emission from the accretiondisk. taking into account a spectral hardening factor of 1.7, we estimated thatthe inner disk radius is $r_{\rm in} \sqrt{\cos i} \sim 20$ km, where i is theinclination angle. the comptonized component could originate in a sphericalcorona, with temperature of 10 kev and optical depth of 5, surrounding theneutron star. a broad gaussian emission line at 6.7 kev is observed in thespectrum, probably emitted in the ionized corona or in the inner part of thedisk. another emission line is present at 1.66 kev.

astro-ph;0008361	study of the temporal behavior of 4u 1728-34 as a function of its  position in the color-color diagram	we study the timing properties of the bursting atoll source 4u 1728-34 as afunction of its position in the x-ray color-color diagram. in the island partof the color-color diagram (corresponding to the hardest energy spectra) thepower spectrum of 4u 1728-34 shows several features such as a band-limitednoise component present up to a few tens of hz, a low frequency quasi-periodicoscillation (lfqpo) at frequencies between 20 and 40 hz, a peaked noisecomponent around 100 hz, and one or two qpos at khz frequencies. in addition tothese, in the lower banana (corresponding to softer energy spectra) we alsofind a very low frequency noise (vlfn) component below ~1 hz. in the upperbanana (corresponding to the softest energy spectra) the power spectra aredominated by the vlfn, with a peaked noise component around 20 hz. we find thatthe frequencies of the khz qpos are well correlated with the position in thex-ray color-color diagram. for the frequency of the lfqpo and the breakfrequency of the broad-band noise component the relation appears more complex.these frequencies both increase when the frequency of the upper khz qpoincreases from 400 to 900 hz, but at this frequency a jump in the values of theparameters occurs. we interpret this jump in terms of the gradual appearance ofa qpo at the position of the break at high inferred mass accretion rate, whilethe previous lfqpo disappears. simultaneously, another kind of noise appearswith a break frequency of ~7 hz, similar to the nbo of z sources. the 100 hzpeaked noise does not seem to correlate with the position of the source in thecolor-color diagram, but remains relatively constant in frequency. thiscomponent may be similar to several 100 hz qpos observed in black holebinaries.

astro-ph;0102299	detection of a hard tail in the x-ray spectrum of the z source gx 349+2	we present the results of a bepposax observation of the z source gx 349+2covering the energy range 0.1-200 kev. the presence of flares in the lightcurve indicates that the source was in the flaring branch during the bepposaxobservation. we accumulated energy spectra separately for the non-flaringintervals and the flares. in both cases the continuum is well described by asoft blackbody ($k t_{bb} \sim 0.5$ kev) and a comptonized spectrumcorresponding to an electron temperature of $k t_e \sim 2.7$ kev, optical depth$\tau \sim 10$ (for a spherical geometry), and seed photon temperature of $kt_w \sim 1$ kev. all temperatures tend to increase during the flares. in thenon-flaring emission a hard tail dominates the spectrum above 30 kev. this canbe fit by a power law with photon index $\sim 2$, contributing $\sim 2%$ of thetotal source luminosity over the bepposax energy range. a comparison with hardtails detected in some soft states of black hole binaries suggests that asimilar mechanism could originate these components in black hole and neutronstar systems.

astro-ph;0104170	where have all the submillisecond pulsars gone?	the existence of pulsars with spin period below one millisecond is expected,though they have not been detected up to now. their formation depends on thequantity of matter accreted from the companion which, in turn, is limited bythe mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. mass ejection must beefficient, at least in some cases, in order to produce the observed populationof moderately fast spinning millisecond pulsars. first we demonstrate, in theframework of the widely accepted recycling scenario, using a populationsynthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period belowone millisecond is expected. then we propose that significant variations in themass-transfer rate may cause, in systems with orbital periods larger than 1 hr,the switch-on of a radio pulsar whose radiation pressure is capable of ejectingout of the system most of the matter transferred by the companion and preventany further accretion. we show how this mechanism could dramatically alter thebinary evolution since the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the innerlagrangian point is still active while the accretion is inhibited. moreover wedemonstrate that the persistency of this ``radio ejection'' phase depends onthe binary orbital period, demonstrating that close systems (orbital periodslower than 1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultra fast spinning neutronstars. this could explain why submillisecond pulsars have not been detected sofar, as current radio surveys are hampered by computational limitations withrespect to the detection of very short spin period pulsars in short orbitalperiod binaries.

astro-ph;0104171	partially absorbed comptonization spectrum from the nearly edge-on  source x 1822-371	we report the results of a spectral analysis over the range 0.1-200 kevperformed on the dipping source x 1822-371 observed by bepposax. we find thebest fit to the continuum using a partially covered comptonization model, dueto scattering off soft seed photons by electrons at a temperature of ~4.8 kev,without the presence of any soft blackbody emission. the equivalent hydrogencolumn obtained for the absorbed component is ~4.5 10^{22} cm^{-2}, an order ofmagnitude larger than the galactic absorption for this source, and the coveringfraction is ~71%. because the inclination angle of x 1822-371 to the line ofsight is ~85^\circ, this model gives a reasonable scenario for the source: thecomptonized spectrum could come from an extended accretion disk corona (adc),probably the only region that can be directly observed due to the highinclination. the excess of matter producing the partial covering could be closeto the equatorial plane of the system, above the outer disk, occulting theemission from the inner disk and the inner part of the adc. an iron emissionline is also present at ~6.5 kev with an equivalent width of ~150 ev. we arguethat this strong iron line cannot be explained as reflection of the comptonizedspectrum by the accretion disk. it is probably produced in the adc. an emissionline at ~1.9 kev (with an equivalent width of ~54 ev) and an absorption edge at\~8.7 kev (with an optical depth of ~0.1) are also required to fit thisspectrum. these features are probably produced by highly ionized iron (fe xxiv)present in the outer part of the adc, where the plasma density is\~10^{11}-10^{12} cm^{-3} and ionized plasma is present.

astro-ph;0104367	the 0.1-100 kev spectrum of lmc x-4 in the high state: evidence for a  high energy cyclotron absorption line	we report on the spectral analysis of the x-ray pulsar lmc x-4 in its highstate out of eclipse observed by bepposax. during this observation no coherentpulsations are detected. the primary continuum is well described by a power lawwith a high energy cutoff (e_cutoff ~ e_fold ~ 18 kev). the addition of acyclotron absorption line at ~100 kev improves the fit significantly. theinferred magnetic moment is 1.1 10^{31} gauss cm^3, in agreement with the valueestimated assuming that the neutron star is at the spin equilibrium, as it hasbeen proposed for this source. the remaining excess at low energies can befitted by a comptonization of soft photons by moderately hot electrons (kt ~0.9kev), with an optical depth \tau ~ 16. the seed photons for this comptonizationare consistent with black body emission from the accretion disk at themagnetospheric radius. another possibility is to fit the soft excess with blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung. in this case the black body would originatefrom cold plasma at the magnetosphere while the bremsstrahlung component may beproduced by the strong stellar wind from the companion star, ionized by thex-ray emission from the pulsar.

astro-ph;0107202	spectral evolution of circinus x-1 along its orbit	we report on the spectral analysis of circinus x-1 observed by the ascasatellite in march 1998 along one orbital period. the luminosity of the source(in the 0.1-100 kev band) ranges from $2.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at theperiastron (orbital phase 0.01) to $1.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at orbitalphase 0.3. from the spectral analysis and the lightcurve we argue that cir x-1shows three states along the orbital evolution. the first state is at theorbital phase interval 0.97-0.3: the luminosity becames super-eddington and astrong flaring activity is present. in this state a shock could form in theinner region of the system due to the super-eddington accretion rate, producingan outflow of ionized matter whose observational signature could be theprominent absorption edge at $\sim 8.7$ kev observed in the energy spectrum atthese phases. in the second state, corresponding to the orbital phase intervalbetween 0.3 and 0.7, the accretion rate is sub-eddington and we observe aweaker outflow, with smaller hydrogen column: the absorption edge is now at$\sim 8.3$ kev with an optical depth a factor of 2.5 to 6 smaller. the thirdstate corresponds to the orbital phase interval 0.78-0.97. in this state thebest fit model to the spectrum requires the presence of a partial coveringcomponent, indicating that the emission from the compact object is partiallyabsorbed by neutral matter, probably the atmosphere of the companion starand/or the accreting matter from the companion.

astro-ph;0109088	where may ultra-fast rotating neutron stars be hidden?	the existence of ultra-fast rotating neutron stars (spin period p &lt; 1 ms) isexpected on the basis of current models for the secular evolution ofinteracting binaries, though they have not been detected yet. their formationdepends on the quantity of matter accreted by the neutron star which, in turn,is limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. an efficient massejection can avoid the formation of ultra-fast pulsars or their accretioninduced collapse to a black hole. we propose that significant reductions of themass-transfer rate may cause the switch-on of a radio pulsar phase, whoseradiation pressure may be capable of ejecting out of the system most of thematter transferred by the companion. this can prevent, for long orbital periodsand if a sufficiently fast spin has been reached, any further accretion, evenif the original transfer rate is restored, thus limiting the minimum spinperiod attainable by the neutron star. we show that close systems (orbitalperiods p_orb \sim 1 hr are the only possible hosts for ultra-fast spinningneutron stars. this could explain why ultra-fast radio pulsars have not beendetected so far, as the detection of pulsars with very short spin periods inclose systems is hampered, in current radio surveys, by strong dopplermodulation and computational limitations.

astro-ph;0310463	the different fates of a low-mass x-ray binary. i: conservative mass  transfer	we study the evolution of a low mass x-ray binary coupling a binary stellarevolution code with a general relativistic code that describes the behavior ofthe neutron star. we assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (b~10^8 g).in the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that duringthe binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to theneutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. this issufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with theneutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable ofejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. wefind that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up tomoderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almostunavoidable. the collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretionphase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in asupramassive sequence. in this last case the collapse is driven by energylosses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. for extremely supramassive neutronstars these energy losses cause a spin up. as a consequence the pulsar willhave a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. thisbehavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and thereforecould be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. if ther-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, thegravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a ns toroughly 2 ms. in this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even morecommon since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black holeduring accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency.

astro-ph;0412021	xmm-newton x-ray spectroscopy of the high-mass x-ray binary 4u1700-37 at  low flux	we present results of a monitoring campaign of the high-mass x-ray binarysystem 4u 1700-37/hd 153919, carried out with xmm-newton in february 2001. thesystem was observed at four orbital phase intervals, covering 37% of one3.41-day orbit. the lightcurve includes strong flares, commonly observed inthis source. we focus on three epochs in which the data are not affected byphoton pile up: the eclipse, the eclipse egress and a low-flux interval in thelightcurve around orbital phase phi ~0.25. the high-energy part of thecontinuum is modelled as a direct plus a scattered component, each representedby a power law with identical photon index (alpha ~1.4), but with differentabsorption columns. we show that during the low-flux interval the continuum isstrongly reduced, probably due to a reduction of the accretion rate onto thecompact object. a soft excess is detected in all spectra, consistent witheither another continuum component originating in the outskirts of the systemor a blend of emission lines. many fluorescence emission lines fromnear-neutral species and discrete recombination lines from he- and h-likespecies are detected during eclipse and egress. the detection of recombinationlines during eclipse indicates the presence of an extended ionised regionsurrounding the compact object. the observed increase in strength of someemission lines corresponding to higher values of the ionisation parameter xifurther substantiates this conclusion.

(2004)report a timing and spectral analysis of the transient be/x-ray pulsar saxj2103.5+4545 at high energies (5--200 kev). in this work we present for thefirst time a study of the pulse profile at energies above 20 kev using integraldata. the spin-pulse profile shows a prominent (with a duty cycle of 14%) andbroad (with a fwhm of ~ 51 s) peak and a secondary peak which becomes moreevident above 20 kev. the pulsed fraction increases with energy from ~ 45% at5--40 kev to ~ 80% at 40--80 kev. the morphology of the pulse profile alsochanges as a function of energy, consistent with variations in the spectralcomponents that are visible in the pulse phase resolved spectra. a study of thedouble peaked profile shows that the difference in the two peaks can be modeledby a different scattering fraction between the radiation from the two magneticpoles.

astro-ph;0505099	revised orbital parameters of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax  j1808.4-3658	we present temporal analysis of the three outbursts of the x-ray millisecondpulsar sax j1808.4-3658 that occurred in 1998, 2000 and 2002. with a techniquethat uses the chi^2 obtained with an epoch folding search to discriminatebetween different possible orbital solutions, we find an unique solution validover the whole five years period for which high temporal resolution data areavailable. we revise the estimate of the orbital period, p_orb =7249.1569(1) sand reduce the corresponding error by one order of magnitude with respect tothat previously reported. moreover we report the first constraint on theorbital period derivative, -6.6 x 10^-12 &lt; pdot &lt; +0.8 x 10^-12 s/s. thesevalues allow us to produce, via a folding technique, pulse profiles at anygiven time. analysis of these profiles shows that the pulse shape is clearlyasymmetric in 2002, occasionally showing a secondary peak at about 145 degreesfrom the main pulse, which is quite different from the almost sinusoidal shapereported at the beginning of the 1998 outburst.

astro-ph;0511798	radio-ejection and bump-related orbital period gap of millisecond binary  pulsars	the monotonic increase of the radius of low mass stars during their ascent onthe red giant branch halts when they suffer a temporary contraction. thisoccurs when the hydrogen burning shell reaches the discontinuity in hydrogencontent left from the maximum increase in the convective extension, at the timeof the first dredge up, and produces a well known "bump" in the luminosityfunction of the red giants of globular clusters. if the giant is the masslosing component in a binary in which mass transfer occurs on the nuclearevolution time scale, this event produces a temporary stop in the masstransfer, which we will name "bump related" detachment. if the accretingcompanion is a neutron star, in which the previous mass transfer has spun upthe pulsar down to millisecond periods, the subsequent mass transfer phase maybe altered by the presence of the energetic pulsar. in fact, the onset of aradio--ejection phase produces loss of mass and angular momentum from thesytem. we show that this sequence of events may be at the basis of the shortageof systems with periods between ~ 20 and 60 days in the distribution ofbinaries containing millisecond pulsars. we predict that systems which can bediscovered at periods into the gap should have preferentially either magneticmoments smaller than ~ 2 x10^{26}gcm^3, or larger than ~ 4x10^{26}gcm^3. wefurther show that this period gap should not be present in population ii.

astro-ph;0607614	search for radio pulsations in four anomalous x-ray pulsars and  discovery of two new pulsars	we report on observations of four southern anomalous x-ray pulsars, (1rxsj170849.0-400910, 1e 1048.1-5937, 1e 1841-045 and ax j1845-0258), obtained at1.4 ghz using the parkes radio telescope. radio pulsations from these sourceshave been searched (i) by directly folding the time series at a number of trialperiods centered on the value of the spin rate obtained from the x-rayobservations; (ii) by performing a blind search; (iii) using a code sensitiveto single dedispersed pulses, in the aim to detect signals similar to those ofthe recently discovered rotating radio transients. no evidence for radiopulsations with an upper limit of ~0.1 mjy for any of the four targets has beenfound. the blind search led to the serendipitous discovery of two new pulsars,rotating with a spin period of about 0.7 s and of 92 ms respectively, and tothe further detection of 18 known pulsars, two of which were also detected inthe single-pulse search.

astro-ph;0608335	a hard x-ray view on scorpius x-1 with integral: non-thermal emission ?	we present here simultaneous integral/rxte observations of sco x-1, and inparticular a study of the hard x-ray emission of the source and its correlationwith the position in the z-track of the x-ray color-color diagram. we find thatthe hard x-ray (above about 30 kev) emission of sco x-1 is dominated by apower-law component with a photon index of ~3. the flux in the power-lawcomponent slightly decreases when the source moves in the color-color diagramin the sense of increasing inferred mass accretion rate from the horizontalbranch to the normal branch/flaring branch vertex. it becomes not significantlydetectable in the flaring branch, where its flux has decreased by about anorder of magnitude. these results present close analogies to the behavior of gx17+2, one of so-called sco-like z sources. finally, the hard power law in thespectrum of sco x-1 does not show any evidence of a high energy cutoff up to100 - 200 kev, strongly suggesting a non-thermal origin of this component.

astro-ph;0609708	integral serendipitous detection of the gamma-ray microquasar ls 5039	ls 5039 is the only x-ray binary persistently detected at tev energies by thecherenkov hess telescope. it is moreover a gamma-ray emitter in the gev andpossibly mev energy ranges. to understand important aspects of jet physics,like the magnetic field content or particle acceleration, and emissionprocesses, such as synchrotron and inverse compton (ic), a complete modeling ofthe multiwavelength data is necessary. ls 5039 has been detected along almostall the electromagnetic spectrum thanks to several radio, infrared, optical andsoft x-ray detections. however, hard x-ray detections above 20 kev have been sofar elusive and/or doubtful, partly due to source confusion for the poorspatial resolution of hard x-ray instruments. we report here on deep (300 ksec)serendipitous integral hard x-ray observations of ls 5039, coupled withsimultaneous vla radio observations. we obtain a 20-40 kev flux of 1.1 +/- 0.3mcrab (5.9 (+/-1.6) x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), a 40-100 kev upper limit of1.5 mcrab (9.5 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}), and typical radio flux densitiesof about 25 mjy at 5ghz. these hard x-ray fluxes are significantly lower thanprevious estimates obtained with batse in the same energy range but, in thelower interval, agree with extrapolation of previous rxte measurements. theintegral observations also hint to a break in the spectral behavior at hardx-rays. a more sensitive characterization of the hard x-ray spectrum of ls 5039from 20 to 100 kev could therefore constrain key aspects of the jet physics,like the relativistic particle spectrum and the magnetic field strength. futuremultiwavelength observations would allow to establish whether such hard x-raysynchrotron emission is produced by the same population of relativisticelectrons as those presumably producing tev emission through ic.
