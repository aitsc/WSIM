0902.3374	chemical abundances of 451 stars from the harps gto planet search  program: thin disc, thick disc, and planets	we present a uniform study of the chemical abundances of 12 elements (si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, co, ni, na, mg, and al) derived from the spectra of 451stars observed as part of one of the harps gto planet search programs. sixtyeight of these are planet-bearing stars. the main goals of our work are: i) theinvestigation of possible differences between the abundances of stars with andwithout planets; ii) the study of the possible differences in the abundances ofstars in the thin and the thick disc. we confirm that there is a systematicallyhigher metallicity in planet host stars, when compared to non planet-hosts,common to all studied species. we also found that there is no difference in thegalactic chemical evolution trends of the stars with and without planets. starsthat harbour planetary companions simply appear to be in the high metallicitytail of the distribution. we also confirm that neptunian and super-earth classplanets may be easier to find at lower metallicities. a statisticallysignificative abundance difference between stars of the thin and the thick discwas found for [fe/h] $&lt;$ 0. however, the populations from the thick and thethin disc cannot be clearly separated.

0906.0766	radius determination of solar-type stars using asteroseismology: what to  expect from the kepler mission	for distant stars, as observed by the nasa kepler satellite, parallaxinformation is currently of fairly low quality and is not complete. this limitsthe precision with which the absolute sizes of the stars and their potentialtransiting planets can be determined by traditional methods. asteroseismologywill be used to aid the radius determination of stars observed during nasa'skepler mission. we report on the recent asteroflag hare-and-hounds exercise#2,where a group of `hares' simulated data of f-k main-sequence stars that a groupof `hounds' sought to analyze, aimed at determining the stellar radii. based onthe asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-yeartime series data from the kepler mission, we demonstrate that the stellar radiican be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditionalstellar parameters from the kepler input catalogue. the radii found by thevarious methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the truevalues of the artificial stars to within 3%, when the large frequency spacingis used. this is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is notapplied. these results give strong confidence that radius estimation can beperformed to better than 3% for solar-like stars using automatic pipelinereduction. even when the stellar distance and luminosity are unknown we canobtain the same level of agreement.

0909.0285	a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of host stars of transiting planets	the analysis of transiting extra-solar planets provides an enormous amount ofinformation about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. a preciseknowledge of the host stars is necessary to derive the planetary propertiesaccurately. the properties of the host stars, especially their chemicalcomposition, are also of interest in their own right. information about planetformation is inferred by, among others, correlations between differentparameters such as the orbital period and the metallicity of the host stars.the stellar properties studied should be derived as homogeneously as possible.the present work provides new, uniformly derived parameters for 13 host starsof transiting planets. effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulenceparameter, and iron abundance were derived from spectra of both highsignal-to-noise ratio and high resolution by assuming iron excitation andionization equilibria. for some stars, the new parameters differ from previousdeterminations, which is indicative of changes in the planetary radii. asystematic offset in the abundance scale with respect to previous assessmentsis found for the tres and hat objects. our abundance measurements areremarkably robust in terms of the uncertainties in surface gravities. the ironabundances measured in the present work are supplemented by all previousdeterminations using the same analysis technique. the distribution of ironabundance then agrees well with the known metal-rich distribution of planethost stars. to facilitate future studies, the spectroscopic results of thecurrent work are supplemented by the findings for other host stars oftransiting planets, for a total dataset of 50 objects.

1011.2094	the harps search for southern extrasolar planets xxv. results from the  metal-poor sample	searching for extrasolar planets around stars of different metallicity mayprovide strong constraints to the models of planet formation and evolution. inthis paper we present the overall results of a harps (a high-precisionspectrograph mostly dedicated to deriving precise radial velocities) program tosearch for planets orbiting a sample of 104 metal-poor stars (selected [fe/h]below -0.5). radial velocity time series of each star are presented andsearched for signals using several statistical diagnostics. stars with detectedsignals are presented, including 3 attributed to the presence of previouslyannounced giant planets orbiting the stars hd171028, hd181720, and hd190984.several binary stars and at least one case of a coherent signal caused byactivity-related phenomena are presented. one very promising new, possiblegiant planet orbiting the star hd107094 is discussed, and the results areanalyzed in light of the metallicity-giant planet correlation. we conclude thatthe frequency of giant planets orbiting metal-poor stars may be higher thanpreviously thought, probably reflecting the higher precision of the harpssurvey. in the metallicity domain of our sample, we also find evidence that thefrequency of planets is a steeply rising function of the stellar metal content,as found for higher metallicity stars.

1310.0696	the plato 2.0 mission	plato 2.0 has recently been selected for esa's m3 launch opportunity(2022/24). providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density andage) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: how doplanetary systems form and evolve? are there other systems with planets likeours, including potentially habitable planets? the plato 2.0 instrumentconsists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 sec readout cadence and 2with 2.5 sec candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg2) and a largephotometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). it focusses on bright (4-11 mag) starsin wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to earth-size byphotometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-basedradial-velocity follow-up measurements. asteroseismology will be performed forthese bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, includingmasses and ages. the combination of bright targets and asteroseismology resultsin high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2%, 4-10% and 10% for planetradii, masses and ages, respectively. the planned baseline observing strategyincludes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planetsreaching into the habitable zone (hz) of solar-like stars and an additionalstep-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50% of the sky. plato 2.0 willobserve up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of smallplanets, and thousands of planets in the neptune to gas giant regime out to thehz. it will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulkcharacterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages.this catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbitaldistances, where surface temperatures are moderate. coverage of this parameterrange with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to plato2.0.

1311.2417	orbital and physical properties of planets and their hosts: new insights  on planet formation and evolution	we explore the relations between physical and orbital properties of planetsand properties of their host stars to identify the main observable signaturesof the formation and evolution processes of planetary systems. we use a largesample of fgk dwarf planet hosts with stellar parameters derived in ahomogeneous way from the sweet-cat database to study the relation betweenstellar metallicity and position of planets in the period-mass diagram. in thesecond part we use all the rv-detected planets orbiting fgk stars to explorethe role of planet-disk and planet-planet interaction on the evolution oforbital properties of planets with masses above 1mjup. we show that planetsorbiting metal-poor stars have longer periods than those in metal-rich systems.this trend is valid for masses at least from 10mearth to 4mjup. earth-likeplanets orbiting metal-rich stars always show shorter periods (fewer than 20days) than those orbiting metal-poor stars. we also found statisticallysignificant evidence that very high mass giants have on average more eccentricorbits than giant planets with lower mass.finally, we show that theeccentricity of planets with masses higher than 4mjup tends to be lower forplanets with shorter periods. our results suggest that the planets in the p-mpdiagram are evolving differently because of a mechanism that operates over awide range of planetary masses. this mechanism is stronger or weaker dependingon the metallicity of the respective system. one possibility is that planets inmetal-poor disks form farther out from their central star and/or they formlater and do not have time to migrate as far as the planets in metal-richsystems. the trends and dependencies obtained for very high mass planetarysystems suggest that planet-disk interaction is a very important andorbit-shaping mechanism for planets in the high-mass domain. shortened.

0802.0783	on mode conversion and wave reflection in magnetic ap stars	we investigate the effect of a strong large scale magnetic field on thereflection of high frequency acoustic modes in rapidly oscillating ap stars. tothat end we consider a toy model composed of an isothermal atmosphere matchedonto a polytropic interior and determine the numerical solution to the set ofideal magneto-hydrodynamic equations in a local plane-parallel approximationwith constant gravity. using the numerical solution in combination withapproximate analytical solutions that are valid in the limits where themagnetic and acoustic components are decoupled, we calculate the relativefraction of energy flux that is carried away in each oscillation cycle byrunning acoustic waves in the atmosphere and running magnetic waves in theinterior. for oscillation frequencies above the acoustic cutoff we show thatmost energy losses associated with the presence of running waves occur inregions where the magnetic field is close to vertical. moreover, by consideringthe depth dependence of the energy associated with the magnetic component ofthe wave in the atmosphere we show that a fraction of the wave energy is keptin the oscillation every cycle. for frequencies above the acoustic cutofffrequency such energy is concentrated in regions where the magnetic field issignificantly inclined in relation to the local vertical. even though ourcalculations were aimed at studying oscillations with frequencies above theacoustic cutoff frequency, based on our results we discuss what results may beexpected for oscillations of lower frequency.

1404.4514	on the origin of stars with and without planets. tc trends and clues to  galactic evolution	we explore a sample of 148 solar-like stars to search for a possiblecorrelation between the slopes of the abundance trends versus condensationtemperature (known as the tc slope) with stellar parameters and galacticorbital parameters in order to understand the nature of the peculiar chemicalsignatures of these stars and the possible connection with planet formation. wefind that the tc slope significantly correlates (at more than 4sigma) with thestellar age and the stellar surface gravity. we also find tentative evidencethat the tc slope correlates with the mean galactocentric distance of the stars(rmean), suggesting that those stars that originated in the inner galaxy havefewer refractory elements relative to the volatiles. while the average tc slopefor planet-hosting solar analogs is steeper than that of their counterpartswithout planets, this difference probably reflects the difference in their ageand rmean. we conclude that the age and probably the galactic birth place aredeterminant to establish the star's chemical properties. old stars (and starswith inner disk origin) have a lower refractory-to-volatile ratio.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

1407.6765	spectroscopic parameters for solar-type stars with moderate/high  rotation. new parameters for 10 planet-hosts	planetary studies demand precise and accurate stellar parameters as input toinfer the planetary properties. different methods often provide differentresults that could lead to biases in the planetary parameters. in this work, wepresent a refinement of the spectral synthesis technique designed to treatbetter more rapidly rotating fgk stars. this method is used to derive precisestellar parameters, namely effective temperature, surface gravity,metallicitity and rotational velocity. this procedure is tested for samples oflow and moderate/fast rotating fgk stars. the spectroscopic analysis is basedon the spectral synthesis package spectroscopy made easy (sme), assuming kuruczmodel atmospheres in lte. the line list where the synthesis is conducted, iscomprised of iron lines and the atomic data are derived after solarcalibration. the comparison of our stellar parameters shows good agreement withliterature values, both for low and for higher rotating stars. in addition, ourresults are on the same scale with the parameters derived from the ironionization and excitation method presented in our previous works. we presentnew atmospheric parameters for 10 transiting planet-hosts as an update to thesweet-cat catalogue. we also re-analyse their transit light curves to derivenew updated planetary properties.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1410.1310	correcting the spectroscopic surface gravity using transits and  asteroseismology. no significant effect on temperatures or metallicities with  ares+moog in lte	precise stellar parameters are crucial for several reasons, amongst which arethe precise characterization of orbiting exoplanets and the correctdetermination of galactic chemical evolution. the atmospheric parameters areextremely important because all the other stellar parameters depend on them.using our standard equivalent-width method on high-resolution spectroscopy,good precision can be obtained for the derived effective temperature andmetallicity. the surface gravity, however, is usually not well constrained withspectroscopy. we use two different samples of fgk dwarfs to study the effect ofthe stellar surface gravity on the precise spectroscopic determination of theother atmospheric parameters. furthermore, we present a straightforward formulafor correcting the spectroscopic surface gravities derived by our method andwith our linelists. our spectroscopic analysis is based on kurucz models inlte, performed with the moog code to derive the atmospheric parameters. thesurface gravity was either left free or fixed to a predetermined value. thelatter is either obtained through a photometric transit light curve or derivedusing asteroseismology. we find first that, despite some minor trends, theeffective temperatures and metallicities for fgk dwarfs derived with thedescribed method and linelists are, in most cases, only affected within theerrorbars by using different values for the surface gravity, even for verylarge differences in surface gravity, so they can be trusted. the temperaturesderived with a fixed surface gravity continue to be compatible within 1 sigmawith the accurate results of the infrared flux method (irfm), as is the casefor the unconstrained temperatures. secondly, we find that the spectroscopicsurface gravity can easily be corrected to a more accurate value using a linearfunction with the effective temperature.

1501.06227	an ancient extrasolar system with five sub-earth-size planets	the chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii lessthan four earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts,which tend to be metal-rich. this implies that small, including earth-size,planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's historywhen metals were more scarce. we report kepler spacecraft observations ofkepler-444, a metal-poor sun-like star from the old population of the galacticthick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets withsizes between those of mercury and venus. we validate this system as a truefive-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailedcharacterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysisof the transit photometry. kepler-444 is the densest star with detectedsolar-like oscillations. we use asteroseismology to directly measure a preciseage of 11.2+/-1.0 gyr for the host star, indicating that kepler-444 formed whenthe universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldestknown system of terrestrial-size planets. we thus show that earth-size planetshave formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8-billion-year history,leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy.the age of kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among thehosts to the first galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint thebeginning of the era of planet formation.

1504.05962	evidence for a spectroscopic direct detection of reflected light from 51  peg b	the detection of reflected light from an exoplanet is a difficult technicalchallenge at optical wavelengths. even though this signal is expected toreplicate the stellar signal, not only is it several orders of magnitudefainter, but it is also hidden among the stellar noise. we apply a variant ofthe cross-correlation technique to harps observations of 51 peg to detect thereflected signal from planet 51 peg b. our method makes use of thecross-correlation function of a binary mask with high-resolution spectra toamplify the minute planetary signal that is present in the spectra by a factorproportional to the number of spectral lines when performing the crosscorrelation. the resulting cross-correlation functions are then normalized by astellar template to remove the stellar signal. carefully selected sections ofthe resulting normalized ccfs are stacked to increase the planetary signalfurther. the recovered signal allows probing several of the planetaryproperties, including its real mass and albedo. we detect evidence for thereflected signal from planet 51 peg b at a significance of 3\sigma_noise. thedetection of the signal permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46^+0.06_-0.01m_jup (assuming a stellar mass of 1.04\;m_sun) for the planet and an orbitalinclination of 80^+10_-19 degrees. the analysis of the data also allows us toinfer a tentative value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of theplanet. the results suggest that 51peg b may be an inflated hot jupiter with ahigh albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of 1.9 \pm 0.3 r_jup for asignal amplitude of 6.0\pm0.4 x 10^-5). we confirm that the method we perfectedcan be used to retrieve an exoplanet's reflected signal, even with currentobserving facilities. the advent of next generation of observing facilitieswill yield new opportunities for this type of technique to probe deeper intoexoplanets.

1506.02019	the first radial velocity measurements of a microlensing event: no  evidence for the predicted binary	the gravitational microlensing technique allows the discovery of exoplanetsaround stars distributed in the disk of the galaxy towards the bulge. however,the alignment of two stars that led to the discovery is unique over thetimescale of a human life and cannot be re-observed. moreover, the target hostis often very faint and located in a crowded region. these difficulties hamperand often make impossible the follow-up of the target and study of its possiblecompanions. gould et al. (2013) predicted the radial-velocity curve of a binarysystem, ogle-2011-blg-0417, discovered and characterised from a microlensingevent by shin et al. (2012). we used the uves spectrograph mounted at the vlt,eso to derive precise radial-velocity measurements of ogle-2011-blg-0417. togather high-precision on faint targets of microlensing events, we proposed touse the source star as a reference to measure the lens radial velocities. weobtained ten radial velocities on the putative v=18 lens with a dispersion of~100 m/s, spread over one year. our measurements do not confirm themicrolensing prediction for this binary system. the most likely scenario isthat the assumed v=18 mag lens is actually a blend and not the primary lensthat is 2 magnitude fainter. further observations and analyses are needed tounderstand the microlensing observation and infer on the nature andcharacteristics of the lens itself.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.
