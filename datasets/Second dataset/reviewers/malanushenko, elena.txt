0905.4126	a survey of z~6 quasars in the sdss deep stripe. ii. discovery of six  quasars at z_{ab}&gt;21	we present the discovery of six new quasars at z~6 selected from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) southern survey, a deep imaging survey obtained byrepeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. the six quasars areabout two magnitudes fainter than the luminous z~6 quasars found in the sdssmain survey and one magnitude fainter than the quasars reported in paper i(jiang et al. 2008). four of them comprise a complete flux-limited sample at21&lt;z_ab&lt;21.8 over an effective area of 195 deg^2. the other two quasars arefainter than z_ab=22 and are not part of the complete sample. the quasarluminosity function at z~6 is well described as a single power law\phi(l_{1450}) \propto l_{1450}^{\beta} over the luminosity range-28&lt;m_{1450}&lt;-25. the best-fitting slope \beta varies from -2.6 to -3.1,depending on the quasar samples used, with a statistical error of 0.3-0.4.about 40% of the quasars discovered in the sdss southern survey have verynarrow lya emission lines, which may indicate small black hole masses and higheddington luminosity ratios, and therefore short black hole growth time scalesfor these faint quasars at early epochs.

0905.4502	tracing sagittarius structure with sdss and segue imaging and  spectroscopy	we show that the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream can be traced with very redk/m-giant stars selected from sdss photometry. a subset of these stars arespectroscopically confirmed with segue and sdss spectra, and the distance scaleof 2mass and sdss m giants is calibrated to the rr lyrae distance scale. theabsolute g band magnitude of the k/m-giant stars at the tip of the giant branchis m_g=-1.0. the line-of-sight velocities of the m giant and bhb stars that arespatially coincident with the sgr dwarf tidal stream are consistent with thoseof previous authors, reinforcing the need for new models that can explain allof the sgr tidal debris stream observations. we estimate stellar densitiesalong the tidal tails that can be used to help constrain future models. thek/m-giant, bhb, and f-turnoff stars in the lower surface brightness tidalstream that is adjacent to the main leading sgr dwarf tidal tail havevelocities and metallicities that are similar to those of the stars in theleading tidal tail. the ratio of k/m giants to bhbs and bhbs to f-turnoff starsare also similar for both branches of the leading tidal tail. we show thatthere is an additional low-metallicity tidal stream near the sgr trailing tidaltail.

0908.2627	insight into the formation of the milky way through cold halo  substructure. i. the echos of milky way formation	we identify ten -- seven for the first time -- elements of cold halosubstructure (echos) in the volume within 17.5 kpc of the sun in the inner haloof the milky way. our result is based on the observed spatial and radialvelocity distribution of metal-poor main sequence turnoff (mpmsto) stars in 137sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration (segue) lines ofsight. we point out that the observed radial velocity distribution isconsistent with a smooth stellar component of the milky way's inner halooverall, but disagrees significantly at the radial velocities that correspondto our detections. we show that all of our detections are statisticallysignificant and that we expect no false positives. we also use our detectionsand completeness estimates to infer a formal upper limit of 0.34 +/- 0.02 onthe fraction of the mpmsto population in the inner halo that belong to echos.our detections and completeness calculations suggest that there is asignificant population of low fractional overdensity echos in the inner halo,and we predict that 1/3 of the inner halo (by volume) harbors echos with mpmstostar number densities n ~ 15 kpc^-3. echos are likely older than known surfacebrightness substructure, so our detections provide us with a direct measure ofthe accretion history of the milky way in a region and time interval that hasyet to be fully explored. in concert with previous studies, our result suggeststhat the level of merger activity has been roughly constant over the past fewgyr and that there has been no accretion of single stellar systems more massivethan a few percent of a milky way mass in that interval.

1201.1909	new neutrino mass bounds from sloan digital sky survey iii data release  8 photometric luminous galaxies	we present neutrino mass bounds using 900,000 luminous galaxies withphotometric redshifts measured from sloan digital sky survey iii data releaseeight (sdss dr8). the galaxies have photometric redshifts between $z = 0.45$and $z = 0.65$, and cover 10,000 square degrees and thus probe a volume of3$h^{-3}$gpc$^3$, enabling tight constraints to be derived on the amount ofdark matter in the form of massive neutrinos. a new bound on the sum ofneutrino masses $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.26$ ev, at 95% confidence level (cl), isobtained after combining our sample of galaxies, which we call "cmass", withwmap 7 year cosmic microwave background (cmb) data and the most recentmeasurement of the hubble parameter from the hubble space telescope (hst). thisconstraint is obtained with a conservative multipole range choice of $30 &lt; \ell&lt; 200$ in order to minimize non-linearities, and a free bias parameter in eachof the four redshift bins. we study the impact of assuming this linear galaxybias model using mock catalogs, and find that this model causes a small ($\sim1-1.5 \sigma$) bias in $\omega_{\rm dm} h^2$. for this reason, we also quoteneutrino bounds based on a conservative galaxy bias model containingadditional, shot noise-like free parameters. in this conservative case, thebounds are significantly weakened, e.g. $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.36$ ev (95% confidencelevel) for wmap+hst+cmass ($\ell_{\rm max}=200$). we also study the dependenceof the neutrino bound on multipole range ($\ell_{\rm max}=150$ vs $\ell_{\rmmax}=200$) and on which combination of data sets is included as a prior. theaddition of supernova and/or baryon acoustic oscillation data does notsignificantly improve the neutrino mass bound once the hst prior is included.[abridged]

1206.2210	type ia supernova properties as a function of the distance to the host  galaxy in the sdss-ii sn survey	we use type-ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by the sdss-ii sn survey tosearch for dependencies between sn ia properties and the projected distance tothe host galaxy center, using the distance as a proxy for local galaxyproperties (local star-formation rate, local metallicity, etc.). the sampleconsists of almost 200 spectroscopically or photometrically confirmed sne ia atredshifts below 0.25. the sample is split into two groups depending on themorphology of the host galaxy. we fit light-curves using both mlcs2k2 andsalt2, and determine color (av, c) and light-curve shape (delta, x1) parametersfor each sn ia, as well as its residual in the hubble diagram. we thencorrelate these parameters with both the physical and the normalized distancesto the center of the host galaxy and look for trends in the mean values andscatters of these parameters with increasing distance. the most significant (atthe 4-sigma level) finding is that the average fitted av from mlcs2k2 and cfrom salt2 decrease with the projected distance for sne ia in spiral galaxies.we also find indications that sne in elliptical galaxies tend to have narrowerlight-curves if they explode at larger distances, although this may be due toselection effects in our sample. we do not find strong correlations between theresiduals of the distance moduli with respect to the hubble flow and thegalactocentric distances, which indicates a limited correlation between snmagnitudes after standardization and local host metallicity.

1207.6114	stellar masses of sdss-iii boss galaxies at z~0.5 and constraints to  galaxy formation models	we calculate stellar masses for massive luminous galaxies at redshift 0.2-0.7using the first two years of data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energydistributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies areused to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. accurateboss spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. we find that thedistribution of stellar masses in boss is narrow (delta log m~0.5 dex) andpeaks at about logm ~ 11.3 (for a kroupa initial stellar mass function), andthat the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, inagreement with the intended boss target selection. the galaxy masses probed byboss extend over ~10^{12} m, providing unprecedented measurements of thehigh-mass end of the galaxy mass function. we find that the galaxy numberdensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} m agrees with previous determinations. we perform acomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the bosstarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. the abundanceof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the boss data, butthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. moreover, no evolution withredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance ofmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. additionally, bossdata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in thelocal universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. on the otherhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span anarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. we argue that thelack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly dueto metallicity, which is too low in the models.

1209.0759	the milky way's circular velocity curve between 4 and 14 kpc from apogee  data	we measure the milky way's rotation curve over the galactocentric range 4 kpc&lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc from the first year of data from the apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). we model the line-of-sight velocitiesof 3,365 stars in fourteen fields with b = 0 deg between 30 deg &lt; l &lt; 210 degout to distances of 10 kpc using an axisymmetric kinematical model thatincludes a correction for the asymmetric drift of the warm tracer population(\sigma_r ~ 35 km/s). we determine the local value of the circular velocity tobe v_c(r_0) = 218 +/- 6 km/s and find that the rotation curve is approximatelyflat with a local derivative between -3.0 km/s/kpc and 0.4 km/s/kpc. we alsomeasure the sun's position and velocity in the galactocentric rest frame,finding the distance to the galactic center to be 8 kpc &lt; r_0 &lt; 9 kpc, radialvelocity v_{r,sun} = -10 +/- 1 km/s, and rotational velocity v_{\phi,sun} =242^{+10}_{-3} km/s, in good agreement with local measurements of the sun'sradial velocity and with the observed proper motion of sgr a*. we investigatevarious systematic uncertainties and find that these are limited to offsets atthe percent level, ~2 km/s in v_c. marginalizing over all the systematics thatwe consider, we find that v_c(r_0) &lt; 235 km/s at &gt;99% confidence. we find anoffset between the sun's rotational velocity and the local circular velocity of26 +/- 3 km/s, which is larger than the locally-measured solar motion of 12km/s. this larger offset reconciles our value for v_c with recent claims thatv_c &gt;~ 240 km/s. combining our results with other data, we find that the milkyway's dark-halo mass within the virial radius is ~8x10^{11} m_sun.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

1307.3308	very low mass stellar and substellar companions to solar-like stars from  marvels iv: a candidate brown dwarf or low-mass stellar companion to hip  67526	we report the discovery of a candidate brown dwarf or a very low mass stellarcompanion (marvels-5b) to the star hip 67526 from the multi-object apo radialvelocity exoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the radial velocity curve forthis object contains 31 epochs spread over 2.5 years. our keplerian fit using amarkov chain monte carlo approach, reveals that the companion has an orbitalperiod of $90.2695^{+0.0188}_{-0.0187}$ days, an eccentricity of $0.4375 \pm0.0040$ and a semi-amplitude of $2948.14^{+16.65}_{-16.55}$ m s$^{-1}$. usingadditional high-resolution spectroscopy, we find the host star has an effectivetemperature $t_{\rm{eff}}=6004 \pm 34$ k, a surface gravity $\log g$ [cgs]$=4.55 \pm 0.17$ and a metallicity [fe/h] $=+0.04 \pm 0.06$. the stellar massand radius determined through the empirical relationship of torres et al.(2010), yields 1.10$\pm$0.09 $m_{\sun}$ and 0.92$\pm$0.19 $r_{\sun}$. theminimum mass of marvels-5b is $65.0 \pm 2.9 m_{jup}$, indicating that it islikely to be either a brown dwarf or a very low mass star, thus occupying arelatively sparsely-populated region of the mass function of companions tosolar-type stars. the distance to this system is 101$\pm$10 pc from theastrometric measurements of hipparcos. no stellar tertiary is detected in thehigh-contrast images taken by either fastcam lucky imaging or keck adaptiveoptics imaging, ruling out any star with mass greater than 0.2$m_{\sun}$ at aseparation larger than 40 au.

1307.7735	the tenth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first  spectroscopic data from the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic  evolution experiment	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) has been in operation since 2000 april.this paper presents the tenth public data release (dr10) from its currentincarnation, sdss-iii. this data release includes the first spectroscopic datafrom the apache point observatory galaxy evolution experiment (apogee), alongwith spectroscopic data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)taken through 2012 july. the apogee instrument is a near-infrared r~22,500300-fiber spectrograph covering 1.514--1.696 microns. the apogee survey isstudying the chemical abundances and radial velocities of roughly 100,000 redgiant star candidates in the bulge, bar, disk, and halo of the milky way. dr10includes 178,397 spectra of 57,454 stars, each typically observed three or moretimes, from apogee. derived quantities from these spectra (radial velocities,effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities) are alsoincluded.dr10 also roughly doubles the number of boss spectra over thoseincluded in the ninth data release. dr10 includes a total of 1,507,954 bossspectra, comprising 927,844 galaxy spectra; 182,009 quasar spectra; and 159,327stellar spectra, selected over 6373.2 square degrees.

1308.2685	a glance at the host galaxy of high-redshift quasars using strong damped  lyman-alpha systems as coronagraphs	we searched quasar spectra from the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) for the rare occurrences where a strong damped lyman-alphaabsorber (dla) blocks the broad line region emission from the quasar and actsas a natural coronagraph to reveal narrow ly\alpha\ emission from the hostgalaxy. we define a statistical sample of 31 dlas in data release 9 (dr9) withlog n(hi) &gt; 21.3 cm^-2 located at less than 1500 km s^-1 from the quasarredshift. in 25% (8) of these dlas, a strong narrow ly\alpha\ emission line isobserved with flux ~25 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 on average. for dlas withoutthis feature in their troughs, the average 3-\sigma\ upper limit is &lt; 0.8 x10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. our statistical sample is nearly 2.5 times larger thanthe anticipated number of intervening dlas in dr9 within 1500 km s^-1 of thequasar redshift. we also define a sample of 26 dlas from dr9 and dr10 withnarrow ly\alpha\ emission detected and no limit on the hi column density tobetter characterize properties of the host galaxy emission. analyzing thestatistical sample, we do not find substantial differences in the kinematics,metals, or reddening for the two populations with and without emissiondetected. the highly symmetric narrow ly\alpha\ emission line profile centeredin the hi trough indicates that the emitting region is separate from theabsorber. the luminosity of the narrow ly\alpha\ emission peaks is intermediatebetween that of lyman-alpha emitters and radio galaxies, implying that thely\alpha\ emission is predominantly due to ionizing radiation from the agn.galaxies neighboring the quasar host are likely responsible for the majority (&gt;75%) of these dlas, with only a minority (&lt; 25%) arising from hi clouds locatedin the agn host galaxy.

1308.6818	host galaxy spectra and consequences for sn typing from the sdss sn  survey	we present the spectroscopy from 5254 galaxies that hosted supernovae (sne)or other transient events in the sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss-ii).obtained during sdss-i, sdss-ii, and the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss), this sample represents the largest systematic, unbiased,magnitude limited spectroscopic survey of supernova (sn) host galaxies. usingthe host galaxy redshifts, we test the impact of photometric sn classificationbased on sdss imaging data with and without using spectroscopic redshifts ofthe host galaxies. following our suggested scheme, there are a total of 1166photometrically classified sne ia when using a flat redshift prior and 1126 sneia when the host spectroscopic redshift is assumed. for 1024 (87.8%) candidatesclassified as likely sne ia without redshift information, we find that theclassification is unchanged when adding the host galaxy redshift. usingphotometry from sdss imaging data and the host galaxy spectra, we also reporthost galaxy properties for use in future nalysis of sn astrophysics. finally,we investigate the differences in the interpretation of the light curveproperties with and without knowledge of the redshift. when using the salt2light curve fitter, we find a 21% increase in the number of fits that convergewhen using the spectroscopic redshift. without host galaxy redshifts, we findthat salt2 light curve fits are systematically biased towards lower photometricredshift estimates and redder colors in the limit of low signal-to-noise data.the general improvements in performance of the light curve fitter and theincreased diversity of the host galaxy sample highlights the importance of hostgalaxy spectroscopy for current photometric sn surveys such as the dark energysurvey and future surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope.

1309.5535	discovery of a dynamical cold point in the heart of the sagittarius dsph  galaxy with observations from the apogee project	the dynamics of the core of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dsph)galaxy are explored using high-resolution (r~22,500), h-band, near-infraredspectra of over 1,000 giant stars in the central 3 deg^2 of the system, ofwhich 328 are identified as sgr members. these data, among some of the earliestobservations from the sdss-iii/apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment (apogee) and the largest published sample of high resolution sgrdsph spectra to date, reveal a distinct gradient in the velocity dispersion ofsgr from 11-14 km/s for radii &gt;0.8 degrees from center to a dynamical coldpoint of 8 km/s in the sgr center --- a trend differing from that found inprevious kinematical analyses of sgr over larger scales that suggest a more orless flat dispersion profile at these radii. well-fitting mass models witheither cored and cusped dark matter distributions can be found to match thekinematical results, although the cored profile succeeds with significantlymore isotropic stellar orbits than required for a cusped profile. it isunlikely that the cold point reflects an unusual mass distribution. thedispersion gradient may arise from variations in the mixture of populationswith distinct kinematics within the dsph; this explanation is suggested (e.g.,by detection of a metallicity gradient across similar radii), but notconfirmed, by the present data. despite these remaining uncertainties abouttheir interpretation, these early test data (including some from instrumentcommissioning) demonstrate apogee's usefulness for precision dynamical studies,even for fields observed at extreme airmasses.

1309.7660	the large-scale distribution of cool gas around luminous red galaxies	we present a measurement of the correlation function between luminous redgalaxies and cool gas traced by mg ii \lambda \lambda 2796, 2803 absorption, onscales ranging from about 30 kpc to 20 mpc. the measurement is based oncross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z~0.5 andthe flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10^5 background quasarsfrom the sloan digital sky survey. we find that: (i) this galaxy-gascorrelation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 mpc, consistent withthe expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to aregime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. assuming that,on average, the distribution of mg ii gas follows that of dark matter up to agas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accuratedescription of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale.within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous redgalaxies to be about 10^{13.5} m_solar, in agreement with other methods. wealso find the mg ii gas-to-mass ratio around lrgs to be consistent with thecosmic value estimated on mpc scales. combining our galaxy-gas correlation andthe galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we candirectly measure the mg ii gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reachthe same conclusion. (ii) from line-width estimates, we show that the velocitydispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors.on large scales the gas distribution follows the hubble flow, whereas on smallscales we observe the velocity dispersion of the mg ii gas clouds to be lowerthan that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. thisis in line with the fact that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of thevirialized hot gas.

1311.4569	chemical cartography with apogee: large-scale mean metallicity maps of  the milky way	we present galactic mean metallicity maps derived from the first year of thesdss-iii apogee experiment. mean abundances in different zones ofgalactocentric radius (0 &lt; r &lt; 15 kpc) at a range of heights above the plane (0&lt; |z| &lt; 3 kpc), are derived from a sample of nearly 20,000 stars withunprecedented coverage, including stars in the galactic mid-plane at largedistances. we also split the sample into subsamples of stars with low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] abundance ratios. we assess possible biases in deriving themean abundances, and find they are likely to be small except in the innerregions of the galaxy. a negative radial gradient exists over much of thegalaxy; however, the gradient appears to flatten for r &lt; 6 kpc, in particularnear the galactic mid-plane and for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. at r &gt; 6 kpc, thegradient flattens as one moves off of the plane, and is flatter at all heightsfor high-[{\alpha}/m] stars than for low-[{\alpha}/m] stars. alternatively,these gradients can be described as vertical gradients that flatten at largergalactocentric radius; these vertical gradients are similar for both low andhigh-[{\alpha}/m] populations. stars with higher [{\alpha}/m] appear to have aflatter radial gradient than stars with lower [{\alpha}/m]. this could suggestthat the metallicity gradient has grown steeper with time or, alternatively,that gradients are washed out over time by migration of stars.

1405.1431	redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of massive galaxies from  sdss-iii/boss	we study the redshift evolution of the dynamical properties of ~180,000massive galaxies from sdss-iii/boss combined with a local early-type galaxysample from sdss-ii in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt; 0.6. the typical stellar massof this sample is mstar~2x10^{11} msun. we analyze the evolution of the galaxyparameters effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion, and the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift. as the effective radii of boss galaxies atthese redshifts are not well resolved in the sdss imaging we calibrate the sdsssize measurements with hst/cosmos photometry for a sub-sample of galaxies. wefurther apply a correction for progenitor bias to build a sample which consistsof a coeval, passively evolving population. systematic errors due to sizecorrection and the calculation of dynamical mass, are assessed through montecarlo simulations. at fixed stellar or dynamical mass, we find moderateevolution in galaxy size and stellar velocity dispersion, in agreement withprevious studies. we show that this results in a decrease of the dynamical tostellar mass ratio with redshift at &gt;2sigma significance. by combining oursample with high-redshift literature data we find that this evolution of thedynamical to stellar mass ratio continues beyond z~0.7 up to z&gt;2 as mdyn/mstar~(1+z)^{-0.30+/- 0.12} further strengthening the evidence for an increase ofmdyn/mstar with cosmic time. this result is in line with recent predictionsfrom galaxy formation simulations based on minor merger driven mass growth, inwhich the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius increases withcosmic time.

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

0808.0001	galactic globular and open clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  crowded field photometry and cluster fiducial sequences in ugriz	we present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in order to exploit over 100 million stellarobjects with r &lt; 22.5 mag observed by sdss, we need to understand thecharacteristics of stars in the sdss ugriz filters. while star clusters provideimportant calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globularclusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded forthe standard sdss photometric pipeline to process. to complement the sdssimaging survey, we reduce the sdss imaging data for crowded cluster fieldsusing the daophot/allframe suite of programs and present photometry for 17globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a sdss value-added catalog. ourphotometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native sdss 2.5-meterugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied tothe sdss photometry without relying upon any transformations. model photometryfor red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by girardi et al. cannotbe matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by~0.02-0.05 mag. good agreement (&lt; ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with clem etal. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformationequations in tucker et al.
