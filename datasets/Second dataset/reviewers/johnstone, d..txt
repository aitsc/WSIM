0904.3363	dispersal of protoplanetary disks by central wind stripping	we present a model for the dispersal of protoplanetary disks by winds fromeither the central star or the inner disk. these winds obliquely strike theflaring disk surface and strip away disk material by entraining it in anoutward radial-moving flow at the wind-disk interface which lies several diskscale heights above the mid-plane. the disk dispersal time depends on theentrainment velocity at which disk material flows into this turbulent shearlayer interface. if the entrainment efficiency is ~10% of the local soundspeed, a likely upper limit, the dispersal time at 1 au is ~6 myr for a diskwith a surface density of 10^3 g cm^{-2}, a solar mass central star, and a windwith an outflow rate 10^{-8} msun/yr and terminal velocity 200 km/s. whencompared to photoevaporation and viscous evolution, wind stripping can be adominant mechanism only for the combination of low accretion rates (&lt; 10^{-8}msun/yr) and wind outflow rates approaching these accretion rates. this case isunusual since generally outflow rates are &lt; 0.1 of of accretion rates.

0707.0169	the james clerk maxwell telescope legacy survey of nearby star-forming  regions in the gould belt	this paper describes a james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) legacy surveythat has been awarded roughly 500 hrs of observing time to be carried out from2007 to 2009. in this survey we will map with scuba-2 (submillimetre commonuser bolometer array 2) almost all of the well-known low-mass andintermediate-mass star-forming regions within 0.5 kpc that are accessible fromthe jcmt. most of these locations are associated with the gould belt. fromthese observations we will produce a flux-limited snapshot of star formationnear the sun, providing a legacy of images, as well as point-source andextended-source catalogues, over almost 700 square degrees of sky. theresulting images will yield the first catalogue of prestellar and protostellarsources selected by submillimetre continuum emission, and should increase thenumber of known sources by more than an order of magnitude. we will also obtainco maps with the array receiver harp (heterodyne array receiver programme), inthree co isotopologues, of a large typical sample of prestellar andprotostellar sources. we will then map the brightest hundred sources with thescuba-2 polarimeter (pol-2), producing the first statistically significant setof polarization maps in the submillimetre. the images and source catalogueswill be a powerful reference set for astronomers, providing a detailed legacyarchive for future telescopes, including alma, herschel and jwst.

0707.0489	an unbiased survey of 500 nearby stars for debris disks: a jcmt legacy  program	we present the scientific motivation and observing plan for an upcomingdetection survey for debris disks using the james clerk maxwell telescope. thescuba-2 unbiased nearby stars (suns) survey will observe 500 nearby mainsequence and sub-giant stars (100 of each of the a, f, g, k and m spectralclasses) to the 850 micron extragalactic confusion limit to search for evidenceof submillimeter excess, an indication of circumstellar material. the surveydistance boundaries are 8.6, 16.5, 22, 25 and 45 pc for m, k, g, f and a stars,respectively, and all targets lie between the declinations of -40 deg to 80deg. in this survey, no star will be rejected based on its inherent properties:binarity, presence of planetary companions, spectral type or age. this will bethe first unbiased survey for debris disks since iras. we expect to detect ~125debris disks, including ~50 cold disks not detectable in current shorterwavelength surveys. a substantial amount of complementary data will be requiredto constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. high resolutionstudies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. therefore, thesesystems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety ofobservatories to characterize their physical properties. for non-detectedsystems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount ofcircumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the kuiper belt mass, but as low as10 times the kuiper belt mass for the nearest stars in the sample(approximately 2 pc).

0910.1609	the science case for building a band 1 receiver suite for alma	we present a set of compelling science cases for the alma band 1 receiversuite. for these cases, we assume in tandem the updated nominal band 1frequency range of 35-50 ghz with a likely extension up to 52 ghz; togetherthese frequencies optimize the band 1 science return. the scope of the sciencecases ranges from nearby stars to the re-ionization edge of the universe. twocases provide additional leverage on the present alma level one science goalsand are seen as particularly powerful motivations for building the band 1receiver suite: (1) detailing the evolution of grains in protoplanetary disks,as a complement to the gas kinematics, requires continuum observations out to~35 ghz (~9mm); and (2) detecting co 3-2 line emission from galaxies like themilky way during the epoch of re-ionization, i.e., 6 &lt; z &lt; 10, also requiresband 1 receiver coverage. the range of band 1 science is wide, however, andincludes studies of very small dust grains in the ism, pulsar wind nebulae,radio supernovae, x-ray binaries, the galactic center (i.e., sgr a*), densecloud cores, complex carbon-chain molecules, masers, magnetic fields in thedense ism, jets and outflows from young stars, distant galaxies, and galaxyclusters (i.e., the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect). a comparison of alma and thejansky vla (jvla) at the same frequencies of band 1 finds similar sensitivityperformance at 40-50 ghz, with a slight edge for alma at higher frequencies(e.g., within a factor of 2 for continuum observations). with its larger numberof instantaneous baselines, however, alma band 1data will have greater fidelitythan those from the jvla at similar frequencies.

1002.2020	the jcmt legacy survey of the gould belt: a first look at taurus with  harp	as part of a jcmt legacy survey of star formation in the gould belt, wepresent early science results for taurus. co j=3-2 maps have been secured alongthe north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as l 1495, along with deep13co and c18o j=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. with these data we search formolecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, hh objects and shockedh2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across thisextensive region. in total 21 outflows are identified. it is clear that thebowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of t tauristars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. by comparison, theridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostarswhich, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. weestimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in l 1495to be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. if we take previousestimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates aprestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. from the number of outflows we alsocrudely estimate the star formation efficiency in l 1495, finding it to becompatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. we note that molecularoutflow-driving sources have redder near-ir colours than their hh jet-drivingcounterparts. we also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated withthe more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flowincreases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.

1004.2822	chemical study of intermediate-mass (im) class 0 protostars. co  depletion and n2h+ deuteration	we are carrying out a physical and chemical study of the protostellarenvelopes in a representative sample of im class 0 protostars. in our firstpaper (crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. here, westudy the co depletion and n2h+ deuteration. we observed the millimeter linesof c18o, c17o, n2h+ and n2d+ toward the protostars using the iram 30mtelescope. based on these observations, we derived the c18o, n2h+ and n2d+radial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfercode. in addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. allthe c18o 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the c18o abundance decreasesinwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the coevaporation temperature, 20-25k, where the co is released back to the gasphase. the n2h+ deuterium fractionation in class 0 ims is[n2d+]/[n2h+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental[d/h] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than inpre-stellar clumps. chemical models account for the c18o and n2h+ observationsif we assume the co abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in theinner envelope. this could be the consequence of the co being converted intoch3oh on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or thephotodissociation of co by the stellar uv radiation. the deuteriumfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. this discrepancy is very likelycaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry andneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and uvradiation from the star. more important, the deuterium fractionation isdependent on the ortho-to-para h2 ratio, which is not likely to reach thesteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars.

1005.0947	physical structure of the envelopes of intermediate-mass protostars	context: intermediate mass protostars provide a bridge between low- andhigh-mass protostars. furthermore, they are an important component of the uvinterstellar radiation field. despite their relevance, little is known abouttheir formation process. aims: we present a systematic study of the physicalstructure of five intermediate mass, candidate class 0 protostars. our twogoals are to shed light on the first phase of intermediate mass star formationand to compare these protostars with low- and high-mass sources. methods: wederived the dust and gas temperature and density profiles of the sample. weanalysed all existing continuum data on each source and modelled the resultingsed with the 1d radiative transfer code dusty. the gas temperature was thenpredicted by means of a modified version of the code cht96. results: we foundthat the density profiles of five out of six studied intermediate massenvelopes are consistent with the predictions of the "inside-out" collapsetheory.we compared several physical parameters, like the power law index of thedensity profile, the size, the mass, the average density, the density at 1000au and the density at 10 k of the envelopes of low-, intermediate, andhigh-mass protostars. when considering these various physical parameters, thetransition between the three groups appears smooth, suggesting that theformation processes and triggers do not substantially differ.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.2521	detection of interstellar oxidaniumyl: abundant h2o+ towards the  star-forming regions dr21, sgr b2, and ngc6334	we identify a prominent absorption feature at 1115 ghz, detected in firsthifi spectra towards high-mass star-forming regions, and interpret itsastrophysical origin. the characteristic hyperfine pattern of the h2o+ground-state rotational transition, and the lack of other known low-energytransitions in this frequency range, identifies the feature as h2o+ absorptionagainst the dust continuum background and allows us to derive the velocityprofile of the absorbing gas. by comparing this velocity profile with velocityprofiles of other tracers in the dr21 star-forming region, we constrain thefrequency of the transition and the conditions for its formation. in dr21, thevelocity distribution of h2o+ matches that of the [cii] line at 158\mu\m and ofoh cm-wave absorption, both stemming from the hot and dense clump surfacesfacing the hii-region and dynamically affected by the blister outflow. diffuseforeground gas dominates the absorption towards sgr b2. the integratedintensity of the absorption line allows us to derive lower limits to the h2o+column density of 7.2e12 cm^-2 in ngc 6334, 2.3e13 cm^-2 in dr21, and 1.1e15cm^-2 in sgr b2.

1005.4517	water cooling of shocks in protostellar outflows: herschel-pacs map of  l1157	in the framework of the water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish)key program, maps in water lines of several outflows from young stars are beingobtained, to study the water production in shocks and its role in the outflowcooling. this paper reports the first results of this program, presenting apacs map of the o-h2o 179 um transition obtained toward the young outflowl1157. the 179 um map is compared with those of other important shock tracers,and with previous single-pointing iso, swas, and odin water observations of thesame source that allow us to constrain the water abundance and total cooling.strong h2o peaks are localized on both shocked emission knots and the centralsource position. the h2o 179 um emission is spatially correlated with emissionfrom h2 rotational lines, excited in shocks leading to a significantenhancement of the water abundance. water emission peaks along the outflow alsocorrelate with peaks of other shock-produced molecular species, such as sio andnh3. a strong h2o peak is also observed at the location of the proto-star,where none of the other molecules have significant emission. the absolute 179um intensity and its intensity ratio to the h2o 557 ghz line previouslyobserved with odin/swas indicate that the water emission originates in warmcompact clumps, spatially unresolved by pacs, having a h2o abundance of theorder of 10^-4. this testifies that the clumps have been heated for a time longenough to allow the conversion of almost all the available gas-phase oxygeninto water. the total water cooling is ~10^-1 lo, about 40% of the cooling dueto h2 and 23% of the total energy released in shocks along the l1157 outflow.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.5131	reversal of infall in sgrb2(m) revealed by herschel/hifi observations of  hcn lines at thz frequencies	to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in massive starformation, we analyze the shapes of emission lines from hot molecular cores,whose asymmetries trace infall and expansion motions. the high-mass starforming region sgrb2(m) was observed with herschel/hifi (hexos key project) invarious lines of hcn and its isotopologues, complemented by apex data. theobservations are compared to spherically symmetric, centrally heated modelswith density power-law gradient and different velocity fields (infall orinfall+expansion), using the radiative transfer code ratran. the hcn lineprofiles are asymmetric, with the emission peak shifting from blue to red withincreasing j and decreasing line opacity (hcn to h$^{13}$cn). this is mostevident in the hcn 12--11 line at 1062 ghz. these line shapes are reproduced bya model whose velocity field changes from infall in the outer part to expansionin the inner part. the qualitative reproduction of the hcn lines suggests thatinfall dominates in the colder, outer regions, but expansion dominates in thewarmer, inner regions. we are thus witnessing the onset of feedback in massivestar formation, starting to reverse the infall and finally disrupting the wholemolecular cloud. to obtain our result, the thz lines uniquely covered by hifiwere critically important.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.1254	herschel-hifi spectroscopy of the intermediate mass protostar ngc7129  firs 2	herschel-hifi observations of water from the intermediate mass protostarngc7129 firs 2 provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in thisstar formation environment. six spectral settings, covering four h216o and twoh218o lines, were observed and all but one h218o line were detected. the fourh2 16 o lines discussed here share a similar morphology: a narrower, \approx 6km/s, component centered slightly redward of the systemic velocity of ngc7129firs 2 and a much broader, \approx 25 km/s component centered blueward andlikely associated with powerful outflows. the narrower components areconsistent with emission from water arising in the envelope around theintermediate mass protostar, and the abundance of h2o is constrained to \approx10-7 for the outer envelope. additionally, the presence of a narrowself-absorption component for the lowest energy lines is likely due toself-absorption from colder water in the outer envelope. the broader component,where the h2o/co relative abundance is found to be \approx 0.2, appears to betracing the same energetic region that produces strong co emission at high j.

1106.1885	the initial conditions of isolated star formation - x. a suggested  evolutionary diagram for prestellar cores	we propose an evolutionary path for prestellar cores on the radius-massdiagram, which is analogous to stellar evolutionary paths on thehertzsprung-russell diagram. using james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt)observations of l1688 in the ophiuchus star-forming complex, we analyse thehco+ (j=4\rightarrow3) spectral line profiles of prestellar cores. we find thatof the 58 cores observed, 14 show signs of infall in the form of ablue-asymmetric double-peaked line profile. these 14 cores all lie beyond thejeans mass line for the region on a radius-mass plot. furthermore another 10cores showing tentative signs of infall, in their spectral line profile shapes,appear on or just over the jeans mass line. we therefore propose the manner inwhich a prestellar core evolves across this diagram. we hypothesise that a coreis formed in the low-mass, low-radius region of the plot. it then accretesquasistatically, increasing in both mass and radius. when it crosses the limitof gravitational instability it begins to collapse, decreasing in radius,towards the region of the diagram where protostellar cores are seen.

1201.1919	molecular tracers of turbulent shocks in giant molecular clouds	giant molecular clouds contain supersonic turbulence and simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence show that these supersonic motions decay inroughly a crossing time, which is less than the estimated lifetimes ofmolecular clouds. such a situation requires a significant release of energy. werun models of c-type shocks propagating into gas with densities around 10^3cm^(-3) at velocities of a few km / s, appropriate for the ambient conditionsinside of a molecular cloud, to determine which species and transitionsdominate the cooling and radiative energy release associated with shock coolingof turbulent molecular clouds. we find that these shocks dissipate their energyprimarily through co rotational transitions and by compressing pre-existingmagnetic fields. we present model spectra for these shocks and by combiningthese models with estimates for the rate of turbulent energy dissipation, weshow that shock emission should dominate over emission from unshocked gas formid to high rotational transitions (j &gt;5) of co. we also find that theturbulent energy dissipation rate is roughly equivalent to the cosmic-rayheating rate and that the ambipolar diffusion heating rate may be significant,especially in shocked gas.

1204.0009	water in star-forming regions with herschel (wish): ii. evolution of 557  ghz 110-101 emission in low-mass protostars	(abridged) water is a key tracer of dynamics and chemistry in low-massprotostars, but spectrally resolved observations have so far been limited insensitivity and angular resolution. in this first systematic survey ofspectrally resolved water emission in low-mass protostellar objects, h2o wasobserved in the ground-state transition at 557 ghz with hifi on herschel in 29embedded class 0 and i protostars. complementary far-ir and sub-mm continuumdata (including pacs data from our program) are used to constrain the spectralenergy distribution of each source. h2o intensities are compared to inferredenvelope and outflow properties and co 3-2 emission. h2o emission is detectedin all objects except one. the line profiles are complex and consist of severalkinematic components. the profiles are typically dominated by a broad gaussianemission feature, indicating that the bulk of the water emission arises inoutflows, not the quiescent envelope. several sources show multiple shockcomponents in either emission or absorption, thus constraining the internalgeometry of the system. furthermore, the components include inverse p-cygniprofiles in 7 sources (6 class 0, 1 class i) indicative of infalling envelopes,and regular p-cygni profiles in 4 sources (3 class i, 1 class 0) indicative ofexpanding envelopes. "bullets" moving at &gt;50 km/s are seen in 4 class 0sources; 3 of these are new detections. in the outflow, the h2o/co abundanceratio as a function of velocity is nearly the same for all sources, increasingfrom 10^-3 at &lt;5 km/s to &gt;10^-1 at &gt;10 km/s. the h2o abundance in the outerenvelope is low, ~10^-10. the different h2o profile components show a clearevolutionary trend: in the class 0 sources, emission is dominated by outflowcomponents originating inside an infalling envelope. when the infall diminishesduring the class i phase, the outflow weakens and h2o emission disappears.

1407.2426	the origin of organic emission in ngc 2071	context: the physical origin behind organic emission in embedded low-massstar formation has been fiercely debated in the last two decades. a multitudeof scenarios have been proposed, from a hot corino to pdrs on cavity walls toshock excitation.  aims: the aim of this paper is to determine the location and thecorresponding physical conditions of the gas responsible for organics emissionlines. the outflows around the small protocluster ngc 2071 are an ideal testbedto differentiate between various scenarios.  methods: using herschel-hifi and the sma, observations of ch3oh, h2co andch3cn emission lines over a wide range of excitation energies were obtained.comparisons to a grid of radiative transfer models provide constraints on thephysical conditions. comparison to h2o line shape is able to trace gas-phasesynthesis versus a sputtered origin.  results: emission of organics originates in three spots: the continuumsources irs 1 ('b') and irs 3 ('a') as well as a outflow position ('f').densities are above 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures between 100 to 200 k.ch3oh emission observed with hifi originates in all three regions and cannot beassociated with a single region. very little organic emission originatesoutside of these regions.  conclusions: although the three regions are small (&lt;1,500 au), gas-phaseorganics likely originate from sputtering of ices due to outflow activity. thederived high densities (&gt;10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$) are likely a requirement for organicmolecules to survive from being destroyed by shock products. the lack ofspatially extended emission confirms that organic molecules cannot (re)formthrough gas-phase synthesis, as opposed to h2o, which shows strong line wingemission. the lack of ch3cn emission at 'f' is evidence for a different historyof ice processing due to the absence of a protostar at that location and recentice mantle evaporation.

1412.5965	the jcmt gould belt survey: evidence for radiative heating in serpens  mwc 297 and its influence on local star formation	we present scuba-2 450micron and 850micron observations of the serpens mwc297 region, part of the jcmt gould belt survey of nearby star-forming regions.simulations suggest that radiative feedback influences the star-formationprocess and we investigate observational evidence for this by constructingtemperature maps. maps are derived from the ratio of scuba-2 fluxes and a twocomponent model of the jcmt beam for a fixed dust opacity spectral index ofbeta = 1.8. within 40 of the b1.5ve herbig star mwc 297, the submillimetrefluxes are contaminated by free-free emission with a spectral index of1.03+-0.02, consistent with an ultra-compact hii region and polar winds/jets.contamination accounts for 73+-5 per cent and 82+-4 per cent of peak flux at450micron and 850micron respectively. the residual thermal disk of the star isalmost undetectable at these wavelengths. young stellar objects are confirmedwhere scuba-2 850micron clumps identified by the fellwalker algorithm coincidewith spitzer gould belt survey detections. we identify 23 objects and use tbolto classify nine ysos with masses 0.09 to 5.1 msun. we find two class 0, oneclass 0/i, three class i and three class ii sources. the mean temperature is15+-2k for the nine ysos and 32+-4k for the 14 starless clumps. we observe astarless clump with an abnormally high mean temperature of 46+-2k and concludethat it is radiatively heated by the star mwc 297. jeans stability providesevidence that radiative heating by the star mwc 297 may be suppressing clumpcollapse.

1503.00719	mid-j co shock tracing observations of infrared dark clouds i	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are dense, molecular structures in theinterstellar medium that can harbour sites of high-mass star formation. irdcscontain supersonic turbulence, which is expected to generate shocks thatlocally heat pockets of gas within the clouds. we present observations of theco j = 8-7, 9-8, and 10-9 transitions, taken with the herschel spaceobservatory, towards four dense, starless clumps within irdcs (c1 ing028.37+00.07, f1 and f2 in g034.43+0007, and g2 in g034.77-0.55). we detectthe co j = 8-7 and 9-8 transitions towards three of the clumps (c1, f1, and f2)at intensity levels greater than expected from photodissociation region (pdr)models. the average ratio of the 8-7 to 9-8 lines is also found to be between1.6 and 2.6 in the three clumps with detections, significantly smaller thanexpected from pdr models. these low line ratios and large line intensitiesstrongly suggest that the c1, f1, and f2 clumps contain a hot gas component notaccounted for by standard pdr models. such a hot gas component could begenerated by turbulence dissipating in low velocity shocks.

1509.00318	the jcmt plane survey: early results from the l = 30 degree field	we present early results from the jcmt plane survey (jps), which has surveyedthe northern inner galactic plane between longitudes l=7 and l=63 degrees inthe 850-{\mu}m continuum with scuba-2, as part of the james clerk maxwelltelescope legacy survey programme. data from the l=30 degree survey region,which contains the massive star-forming regions w43 and g29.96, are analysedafter approximately 40% of the observations had been completed. thepixel-to-pixel noise is found to be 19 mjy/beam, after a smooth over the beamarea, and the projected equivalent noise levels in the final survey areexpected to be around 10 mjy/beam. an initial extraction of compact sources wasperformed using the fellwalker method resulting in the detection of 1029sources above a 5-{\sigma} surface-brightness threshold. the completenesslimits in these data are estimated to be around 0.2 jy/beam (peak flux density)and 0.8 jy (integrated flux density) and are therefore probably alreadydominated by source confusion in this relatively crowded section of the survey.the flux densities of extracted compact sources are consistent with those ofmatching detections in the shallower atlasgal survey. we analyse the virial andevolutionary state of the detected clumps in the w43 star-forming complex andfind that they appear younger than the galactic-plane average.

1509.06385	the jcmt gould belt survey: a quantitative comparison between scuba-2  data reduction methods	performing ground-based submillimetre observations is a difficult task as themeasurements are subject to absorption and emission from water vapour in theearth's atmosphere and time variation in weather and instrument stability.removing these features and other artifacts from the data is a vital processwhich affects the characteristics of the recovered astronomical structure weseek to study. in this paper, we explore two data reduction methods for datataken with the submillimetre common-user bolometer array-2 (scuba-2) at thejames clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). the jcmt legacy reduction 1 (jcmt lr1)and the gould belt legacy survey legacy release 1 (gbs lr1) reduction both usethe same software, starlink, but differ in their choice of data reductionparameters. we find that the jcmt lr1 reduction is suitable for determiningwhether or not compact emission is present in a given region and the gbs lr1reduction is tuned in a robust way to uncover more extended emission, whichbetter serves more in-depth physical analyses of star-forming regions. usingthe gbs lr1 method, we find that compact sources are recovered well, even at apeak brightness of only 3 times the noise, whereas the reconstruction of largerobjects requires much care when drawing boundaries around the expectedastronomical signal in the data reduction process. incorrect boundaries canlead to false structure identification or it can cause structure to be missed.in the jcmt lr1 reduction, the extent of the true structure of objects largerthan a point source is never fully recovered.

1511.00357	linking low- to high-mass ysos with herschel-hifi observations of water	water probes the dynamics in young stellar objects (ysos) effectively,especially shocks in molecular outflows. it is a key molecule for exploringwhether the physical properties of low-mass protostars can be extrapolated tomassive ysos. as part of the wish key programme, we investigate the dynamicsand the excitation conditions of shocks along the outflow cavity wall asfunction of source luminosity. velocity-resolved herschel-hifi spectra of theh2o 988, 752, 1097 ghz and 12co j=10-9, 16-15 lines were analysed for 52 ysoswith bolometric luminosities (l_bol) ranging from &lt;1 to &gt;10^5 l_sun. theprofiles of the h2o lines are similar, indicating that they probe the same gas.we see two main gaussian emission components in all ysos: a broad componentassociated with non-dissociative shocks in the outflow cavity wall (cavityshocks) and a narrow component associated with quiescent envelope material.more than 60% of the total integrated intensity of the h2o lines (l_h2o) comesfrom the cavity shock component. the h2o line widths are similar for all ysos,whereas those of 12co 10-9 increase slightly with l_bol. the excitationanalysis of the cavity shock component, performed with the non-lte radiativetransfer code radex, shows stronger 752 ghz emission for high-mass ysos, likelydue to pumping by an infrared radiation field. as previously found for co, astrong correlation with slope unity is measured between log(l_h2o) andlog(l_bol), which can be extrapolated to extragalactic sources. we concludethat the broad component of h2o and high-j co lines originate in shocks in theoutflow cavity walls for all ysos, whereas lower-j co transitions mostly traceentrained outflow gas. the higher uv field and turbulent motions in high-massobjects compared to their low-mass counterparts may explain the slightlydifferent kinematical properties of 12co 10-9 and h2o lines from low- tohigh-mass ysos.

1512.00893	the jcmt gould belt survey: a first look at dense cores in orion b	we present a first look at the scuba-2 observations of three sub-regions ofthe orion b molecular cloud: ldn 1622, ngc 2023/2024, and ngc 2068/2071, fromthe jcmt gould belt legacy survey. we identify 29, 564, and 322 dense cores inl1622, ngc 2023/2024, and ngc 2068/2071 respectively, using the scuba-2 850micron map, and present their basic properties, including their peak fluxes,total fluxes, and sizes, and an estimate of the corresponding 450 micron peakfluxes and total fluxes, using the fellwalker source extraction algorithm.assuming a constant temperature of 20 k, the starless dense cores have a massfunction similar to that found in previous dense core analyses, with asalpeter-like slope at the high-mass end. the majority of cores appear stableto gravitational collapse when considering only thermal pressure; indeed, mostof the cores which have masses above the thermal jeans mass are alreadyassociated with at least one protostar. at higher cloud column densities, above1-2 x 10^23 cm^-2, most of the mass is found within dense cores, while at lowercloud column densities, below 1 x 10^23 cm^-2, this fraction drops to 10% orlower. overall, the fraction of dense cores associated with a protostar isquite small (&lt;8%), but becomes larger for the densest and most centrallyconcentrated cores. ngc 2023 / 2024 and ngc 2068/2071 appear to be on the pathto forming a significant number of stars in the future, while l1622 has littleadditional mass in dense cores to form many new stars.

1512.04940	mid-j co shock tracing observations of infrared dark clouds ii low-j co  constraints on excitation, depletion, and kinematics	infrared dark clouds are kinematically complex molecular structures in theinterstellar medium that can host sites of massive star formation. we present 4square arcminute maps of the 12co, 13co, and c18o j = 3 to 2 lines fromselected locations within the c and f (g028.37+00.07 and g034.43+00.24)infrared dark clouds (irdcs), as well as single pointing observations of the13co and c18o j = 2 to 1 lines towards three cores within these clouds. wederive co gas temperatures throughout the maps and find that co issignificantly frozen out within these irdcs. we find that the co depletiontends to be the highest near column density peaks, with maximum depletionfactors between 5 and 9 in irdc f and between 16 and 31 in irdc c. we alsodetect multiple velocity components and complex kinematic structure in bothirdcs. therefore, the kinematics of irdcs seem to point to dynamically evolvingstructures yielding dense cores with considerable depletion factors.

astro-ph;0103376	a submillimeter view of star formation near the hii region kr 140	we present the results of 450 and 850 micron continuum mapping of the hiiregion kr 140 using the scuba instrument on the jcmt. kr 140 is a small (5.7 pcdiameter) hii region at a distance of 2.3+/-0.3 kpc. five of the six iras pointsources near kr 140 were mapped in this study. our analysis shows that two ofthese iras sources are embedded late b type stars lying well outside the hiiregion, two are a part of the dust shell surrounding the hii region, and one isthe combined emission from an ensemble of smaller sources unresolved by iras.we have discovered a number of relatively cold submillimeter sources notvisible in the iras data, ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.7 pc and in mass from0.5 to 130 msun. the distribution of masses for all sources is wellcharacterized by a power law n(&gt;m) ~ m^{-alpha} with alpha = 0.5 +/- 0.04, inagreement with the typical mass function for clumped structures of this scalein molecular clouds. several of the submillimeter sources are found at thehii-molecular gas interface and have probably been formed as the result of theexpansion of the hii region. many of the submillimeter sources we detect aregravitationally bound and most of these follow a mass-size relationshipexpected for objects in virial equilibrium with non-thermal pressure support.upon the loss of non-thermal support they could be sites of star formation.along with the two b stars that we have identified as possible cluster membersalong with ves 735, we argue that five nearby highly-reddened stars are in apre-main-sequence stage of evolution.

astro-ph;0505331	fourier transform spectroscopy of the submillimetre continuum emission  from hot molecular cores	we have used a fourier transform spectrometer on the james clerk maxwelltelescope to study the submillimetre continuum emission from dust in three hotmolecular cores (hmc). the spectral index beta of the dust emission for thesesources has been determined solely within the 30 ghz wide 350 ghz (850 micron)passband to an accuracy comparable to those determined through multi-wavelengthobservations. we find an average beta = 1.6, in agreement with spectral indicesdetermined from previous submillimetre observations of these sources and withthose determined for hmc in general. the largest single source of uncertaintyin these results is the variability of the atmosphere at 350 ghz, and withbetter sky subtraction techniques we show that the dust spectral index canclearly be determined within one passband to high accuracy with a submillimetrefts. using an imaging fts on scuba-2, the next generation wide-fieldsubmillimetre camera currently under development to replace scuba at the jcmtin 2006, we calculate that at 350 ghz it will be possible to determine beta to+/- 0.1 for sources as faint as 400 mjy/beam and to +/- 0.3 for sources asfaint as 140 mjy/beam.

astro-ph;0603474	an observational perspective of low mass dense cores ii: evolution  towards the initial mass function	we review the properties of low mass dense molecular cloud cores, includingstarless, prestellar, and class 0 protostellar cores, as derived fromobservations. in particular we discuss them in the context of the currentdebate surrounding the formation and evolution of cores. there exist severalfamilies of model scenarios to explain this evolution (with many variations ofeach) that can be thought of as a continuum of models lying between two extremeparadigms for the star and core formation process. at one extreme there is thedynamic, turbulent picture, while at the other extreme there is a slow,quasi-static vision of core evolution. in the latter view the magnetic fieldplays a dominant role, and it may also play some role in the former picture.polarization and zeeman measurements indicate that some, if not all, corescontain a significant magnetic field. wide-field surveys constrain thetimescales of the core formation and evolution processes, as well as thestatistical distribution of core masses. the former indicates that prestellarcores typically live for 2--5 free-fall times, while the latter seems todetermine the stellar initial mass function. in addition, multiple surveysallow one to compare core properties in different regions. from this it appearsthat aspects of different models may be relevant to different star-formingregions, depending on the environment. prestellar cores in cluster-formingregions are smaller in radius and have higher column densities, by up to anorder of magnitude, than isolated prestellar cores. this is probably due to thefact that in cluster-forming regions the prestellar cores are formed byfragmentation of larger, more turbulent cluster-forming cores, which in turnform as a result of strong external compression.

0810.2790	shells, jets, and internal working surfaces in the molecular outflow  from iras 04166+2706	context: iras 04166+2706 in taurus is one of the most nearby young stellarobjects whose molecular outflow contains a highly collimated fast component.  methods: we have observed the iras 04166+2706 outflow with the iram plateaude bure interferometer in co(j=2-1) and sio(j=2-1) achieving angularresolutions between 2'' and 4''. to improve the quality of the co(2-1) images,we have added single dish data to the interferometer visibilities.  results: the outflow consists of two distinct components. at velocities &lt;10km/s, the gas forms two opposed, approximately conical shells that have the ysoat their vertex. these shells coincide with the walls of evacuated cavities andseem to result from the acceleration of the ambient gas by a wide-angle wind.at velocities &gt;30 km/s, the gas forms two opposed jets that travel along thecenter of the cavities and whose emission is dominated by a symmetriccollection of at least 7 pairs of peaks. the velocity field of this componentpresents a sawtooth pattern with the gas in the tail of each peak moving fasterthan the gas in the head. this pattern, together with a systematic widening ofthe peaks with distance to the central source, is consistent with the emissionarising from internal working surfaces traveling along the jet and resultingfrom variations in the velocity field of ejection. we interpret this componentas the true protostellar wind, and we find its composition consistent with achemical model of such type of wind.  conclusions: our results support outflow wind models that have simultaneouslywide-angle and narrow components, and suggest that the ehv peaks seen in anumber of outflows consist of internally-shocked wind material.
