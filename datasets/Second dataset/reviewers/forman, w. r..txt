0901.1346	high-energy particle acceleration at the radio-lobe shock of centaurus a	we present new results on the shock around the southwest radio lobe ofcentaurus a using data from the chandra very large programme observations. thex-ray spectrum of the emission around the outer southwestern edge of the lobeis well described by a single power-law model with galactic absorption --thermal models are strongly disfavoured, except in the region closest to thenucleus. we conclude that a significant fraction of the x-ray emission aroundthe southwest part of the lobe is synchrotron, not thermal. we infer that inthe region where the shock is strongest and the ambient gas density lowest, theinflation of the lobe is accelerating particles to x-ray synchrotron emittingenergies, similar to supernova remnants such as sn1006. this interpretationresolves a problem of our earlier, purely thermal, interpretation for thisemission, namely that the density compression across the shock was required tobe much larger than the theoretically expected factor of 4. we estimate thatthe lobe is expanding to the southwest with a velocity of ~2600 km/s, roughlymach 8 relative to the ambient medium. we discuss the spatial variation ofspectral index across the shock region, concluding that our observationsconstrain gamma_max for the accelerated particles to be 10^8 at the strongestpart of the shock, consistent with expectations from diffusive shockacceleration theory. finally, we consider the implications of these results forthe production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (uhecrs) and tev emission fromcentaurus a, concluding that the shock front region is unlikely to be asignificant source of uhecrs, but that tev emission from this region isexpected at levels comparable to current limits at tev energies, for plausibleassumed magnetic field strengths.

0903.2663	the jet-heated x-ray filament in the centaurus a northern middle radio  lobe	we present results from a 40 ks {\em xmm-newton} observation of the x-rayfilament coincident with the southeast edge of the centaurus a northern middleradio lobe (nml). we find that the x-ray filament consists of five spatiallyresolved x-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. the spectrum ofeach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from0.3-0.7 kev and subsolar elemental abundances. in four of the five knots,non-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling outsynchrotron or ic/cmb mechanisms for their emission. the internal pressures ofthe knots exceed that of the ambient ism or the equipartition pressure of thenml by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be shortlived ($\sim3\times10^6$ yrs). based on energetic arguments, it is implausiblethat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galacticnucleus of cen a or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation ofthe nml. in our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the x-rayknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a directinteraction with the jet. the lifetimes of the x-ray knots in the nml areroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the sw inner lobe,suggesting they were created in the same agn outburst. the most plausible modelof the nml is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is beingre-energized by the current outburst. we also report the discovery of a largescale (at least 35 kpc radius) gas halo around cen a.

0904.0610	gas sloshing and bubbles in the galaxy group ngc 5098	we present results from chandra observations of the galaxy pair andassociated galaxy group ngc 5098, and find evidence for both gas sloshing andagn heating. the x-ray brightness images show diffuse emission with a spiralstructure, centered on ngc 5098a, and a sharp edge in the diffuse emissionsurrounding much of the galaxy at about 30 kpc. the spiral structure in thex-ray surface brightness and temperature maps, the offset between the peak ofthe cool gas and the central agn, and the structure of the cold front edges allsuggest gas sloshing in the core. the most likely perturber is the nearbygalaxy ngc 5098b, which has been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere. detailedimages of the core reveal several x-ray cavities, two of which, just north andsoutheast of the central agn, correlate with radio emission and have brightx-ray rims, similar to buoyant bubbles seen in the icm of other systems. weestimate the pressures in the bubbles and rims and show that they are roughlyequal, consistent with these being young features, as suggested by their closeproximity to the central agn. we assume that the other x-ray cavities in thecore, which show no correlation with existing radio observations, are ghostcavities from previous agn outbursts. an estimate of the mechanical energyrequired to inflate the cavities indicates that it is sufficient to offsetradiative cooling of the gas for 15 myr. therefore, for a typical cycle time of10^7 yrs, the central agn energy output is enough to balance cooling over longtimescales.

0706.4013	a chandra study of the lobe/ism interactions around the inner radio  lobes of centaurus a: constraints on the temperature structure and transport  processes	we present results from deeper {\em chandra} observations of the southwestradio lobe of centaurus a, first described by kraft et al. (2003). we find thatthe sharp x-ray surface brightness discontinuity extends around $\sim$75% ofthe periphery of the radio lobe, and detect significant temperature jumps inthe brightest regions of this discontinuity nearest to the nucleus. thisdemonstrates that this discontinuity is indeed a strong shock which is theresult of an overpressure which has built up in the entire lobe over time.additionally, we demonstrate that if the mean free path for ions to transferenergy and momentum to the electrons behind the shock is as large as thespitzer value, the electron and proton temperatures will not have equilibratedalong the sw boundary of the radio lobe where the shock is strongest. thus theproton temperature of the shocked gas could be considerably larger than theobserved electron temperature, and the total energy of the outburstcorrespondingly larger as well. we investigate this using a simpleone-dimensional shock model for a two-fluid (proton/electron) plasma. we findthat for the thermodynamic parameters of the cen a shock the electrontemperature rises rapidly from $\sim$0.29 kev (the temperature of the ambientism) to $\sim$3.5 kev at which point heating from the protons is balanced byadiabatic losses. the proton and electron temperatures do not equilibrate in atimescale less than the age of the lobe. we note that the measured electrontemperature of similar features in other nearby powerful radio galaxies in poorenvironments may considerably underestimate the strength and velocity of theshock.

0706.4014	the disturbed 17 kev cluster associated with the radio galaxy 3c 438	we present results from a {\em chandra} observation of the cluster gasassociated with the fr ii radio galaxy 3c 438. this radio galaxy is embeddedwithin a massive cluster with gas temperature $\sim$17 kev and bolometricluminosity of 6$\times10^{45}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. it is unclear if this hightemperature represents the gravitational mass of the cluster, or if this is analready high ($\sim$ 11 kev) temperature cluster that has been heatedtransiently. we detect a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas thatextends $\sim$600 kpc through the cluster. the radio galaxy 3c 438 is too small($\sim$110 kpc across) and too weak to have created this large disturbance inthe gas. the discontinuity must be the result of either an extremely powerfulnuclear outburst or the major merger of two massive clusters. if the observedfeatures are the result of a nuclear outburst, it must be from an earlier epochof unusually energetic nuclear activity. however, the energy required($\sim10^{63}$ ergs) to move the gas on the observed spatial scales stronglysupports the merger hypothesis. in either scenario, this is one of the mostextreme events in the local universe.

0906.5364	luminosity functions of lmxbs in centaurus a: globular clusters versus  the field	we study the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low mass x-ray binaries(lmxb) in the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a, concentrating primarily ontwo aspects of binary populations: the xlf behavior at the low luminosity limitand comparison between globular cluster and field sources. the 800 ksecexposure of the deep chandra vlp program allows us to reach a limitingluminosity of 8e35 erg/s, about 2-3 times deeper than previous investigations.we confirm the presence of the low luminosity break in the overall lmxb xlf atlog(l_x)=37.2-37.6 below which the luminosity distribution follows a constantdn/d(ln l). separating globular cluster and field sources, we find astatistically significant difference between the two luminosity distributionswith a relative underabundance of faint sources in the globular clusterpopulation. this demonstrates that the samples are drawn from distinct parentpopulations and may disprove the hypothesis that the entire lmxb population inearly type galaxies is created dynamically in globular clusters. as a plausibleexplanation for this difference in the xlfs, we suggest that there is anenhanced fraction of helium accreting systems in globular clusters, which arecreated in collisions between red giants and neutron stars. due to the 4 timeshigher ionization temperature of he, such systems are subject to accretion diskinstabilities at approximately 20 times higher mass accretion rate, andtherefore are not observed as persistent sources at low luminosities.

0911.2115	long term monitoring of the dynamics and particle acceleration of knots  in the jet of centaurus a	we present new and archival multi-frequency radio and x-ray data forcentaurus a obtained over almost 20 years at the vla and with chandra, withwhich we measure the x-ray and radio spectral indices of jet knots, fluxdensity variations in the jet knots, polarization variations, and propermotions. we compare the observed properties with current knot formation modelsand particle acceleration mechanisms. we rule out impulsive particleacceleration as a formation mechanism for all of the knots as we detect thesame population of knots in all of the observations and we find no evidence ofextreme variability in the x-ray knots. we find the most likely mechanism forall the stationary knots is a collision resulting in a local shock followed bya steady state of prolonged, stable particle acceleration and x-ray synchrotronemission. in this scenario, the x-ray-only knots have radio counterparts thatare too faint to be detected, while the radio-only knots are due to weak shockswhere no particles are accelerated to x-ray emitting energies. although thebase knots are prime candidates for reconfinement shocks, the presence of amoving knot in this vicinity and the fact that there are two base knots arehard to explain in this model. we detect apparent motion in three knots;however, their velocities and locations provide no conclusive evidence for oragainst a faster moving `spine' within the jet. the radio-only knots, bothstationary and moving, may be due to compression of the fluid.

1001.2567	the mysterious merger of ngc6868 and ngc6861 in the telescopium group	we use chandra x-ray observations of the hot gas in and around ngc6868 andngc6861 in the telescopium galaxy group (as0851) to probe the interactionhistory between these galaxies. mean surface brightness profiles for ngc6868and ngc6861 are each well described by double beta-models, suggesting that theyare each the dominant galaxy in a galaxy subgroup about to merge. surfacebrightness and temperature maps of the brightest group galaxy ngc6868 show acold front edge ~23 kpc to the north, and a cool 0.62 kev spiral-shaped tail tothe south. analysis of the temperature and density across the cold frontconstrains the relative motion between ngc6868 and the ambient group gas to beat most transonic; while the spiral morphology of the tail strongly suggeststhat the cold front edge and tail are the result of gas sloshing due to thesubgroup merger. the cooler central region of ngc6861 is surrounded by a sheathof hot gas to the east and hot, bifurcated tails of x-ray emission to the westand northwest. we discuss supersonic infall of the ngc6861 subroup, sloshingfrom the ngc6868 and ngc6861 subgroup merger, and agn heating as possibleexplanations for these features, and discuss possible scenarios that maycontribute to the order of magnitude discrepancy between the margorrian andblack hole mass - sigma predictions for its central black hole.

1002.0395	metal transport by gas sloshing in m87	we present the results of an xmm-newton mosaic covering the central ~200 kpcof the nearby virgo cluster. we focus on a strong surface brightnessdiscontinuity in the outskirts of the brightest cluster galaxy, m87. using bothxmm-newton and suzaku, we derive accurate temperature and metallicity profilesacross this feature and show that it is a cold front probably due to sloshingof the virgo icm. it is also associated with a discontinuity in the chemicalcomposition. the gas in the inner, bright region of the front is ~40% moreabundant in fe than the gas outside the front, suggesting the important role ofsloshing in transporting metals through the icm. for the first time, we providea quantitative estimate of the mass of fe transported by a cold front. thisamounts to ~6% of the total fe mass within the radial range affected bysloshing, significantly more than the amount of metals transported by the agnin the same cluster core. the very low fe abundance of only ~0.2 solarimmediately outside the cold front at a radius of 90 kpc suggests we arewitnessing first-hand the transport of higher metallicity gas into a pristineregion, whose abundance is typical of the cluster outskirts. the mg/fe and o/feabundance ratios remain approximately constant over the entire radial rangebetween the centre of m87 and the faint side of the cold front, which requiresthe presence of a centrally peaked distribution not only for fe but also forcore-collapse type supernova products. this peak may stem from the starformation triggered as the bcg assembled during the protocluster phase.

1003.5334	feedback under the microscope ii: heating, gas uplift, and mixing in the  nearest cluster core	using a combination of deep 574ks chandra data, xmm-newton high-resolutionspectra, and optical halpha+nii images, we study the nature and spatialdistribution of the multiphase plasma in m87. our results provide directobservational evidence of `radio mode' agn feedback in action, stripping thecentral galaxy of its lowest entropy gas and preventing star-formation. thislow entropy gas was entrained with and uplifted by the buoyantly risingrelativistic plasma, forming long "arms". these arms are likely oriented within15-30 degrees of our line-of-sight. the mass of the uplifted gas in the arms iscomparable to the gas mass in the approximately spherically symmetric 3.8 kpccore, demonstrating that the agn has a profound effect on its immediatesurroundings. the coolest x-ray emitting gas in m87 has a temperature of ~0.5kev and is spatially coincident with halpha+nii nebulae, forming a multiphasemedium where the cooler gas phases are arranged in magnetized filaments. weplace strong upper limits of 0.06 msun/yr on the amount of plasma coolingradiatively from 0.5 kev and show that a uniform, volume-averaged heatingmechanism could not be preventing the cool gas from further cooling. all of thebright halpha filaments appear in the downstream region of the &lt;3 myr old shockfront, at smaller radii than ~0.6'. we suggest that shocks induce shearingaround the filaments, thereby promoting mixing of the cold gas with the ambienthot icm via instabilities. by bringing hot thermal particles into contact withthe cool, line-emitting gas, mixing can supply the power and ionizing particlesneeded to explain the observed optical spectra. mixing of the coolest x-rayemitting plasma with the cold optical line emitting filamentary gas promotesefficient conduction between the two phases, allowing non-radiative coolingwhich could explain the lack of x-ray gas with temperatures under 0.5 kev.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1008.2921	radio and deep chandra observations of the disturbed cool core cluster  abell 133	we present results based on new chandra and multi-frequency radioobservations of the disturbed cool core cluster abell 133. the diffuse gas hasa complex bird-like morphology, with a plume of emission extending from twosymmetric wing-like features, and capped with a filamentary radio relic. x-rayobservations indicate the presence of either high temperature gas ornon-thermal emission in the region of the relic. we find evidence for a weakelliptical x-ray surface brightness edge surrounding the core, consistent witha sloshing cold front. the plume is consistent with having formed due to upliftby a buoyantly rising radio bubble, now seen as the radio relic. our resultsare inconsistent with the previous suggestion that the x-ray wings formed dueto the passage of a weak shock through the cool core. we instead conclude thatthe wings are due to x-ray cavities formed by gas displacement by the radiorelic. the central cd galaxy contains two small-scale cold gas clumps that areslightly offset from their optical and uv counterparts, suggestive of agalaxy-galaxy merger event. on larger scales, there is evidence for clustersubstructure in both optical observations and the x-ray temperature map. wesuggest that abell 133 has recently undergone a merger event with aninterloping subgroup, initiating gas sloshing in the core. we show that theadditional buoyant force from a passing subcluster can have a significanteffect on the rise trajectories of buoyant bubbles, although this effect alonecannot fully explain the morphology of abell 133. the radio observations reveala previously unreported background giant radio galaxy at z = 0.293, thenorthern lobe of which overlies the radio relic in the core of abell 133. arough estimate indicates that the contribution of this background lobe to thetotal radio emission in the region of the relic is modest (&lt; 13%).

1108.1200	self-similar scaling and evolution in the galaxy cluster x-ray  luminosity-temperature relation	we investigate the form and evolution of the x-ray luminosity-temperature(lt) relation of a sample of 114 galaxy clusters observed with chandra at0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3. the clusters were divided into subsamples based on their x-raymorphology or whether they host strong cool cores. we find that when the coreregions are excluded, the most relaxed clusters (or those with the strongestcool cores) follow an lt relation with a slope that agrees well with simpleself-similar expectations. this is supported by an analysis of the gas densityprofiles of the systems, which shows self-similar behaviour of the gas profilesof the relaxed clusters outside the core regions. by comparing our data withclusters in the rexcess sample, which extends to lower masses, we find evidencethat the self-similar behaviour of even the most relaxed clusters breaks ataround 3.5kev. by contrast, the lt slopes of the subsamples of unrelaxedsystems (or those without strong cool cores) are significantly steeper than theself-similar model, with lower mass systems appearing less luminous and highermass systems appearing more luminous than the self-similar relation. we arguethat these results are consistent with a model of non-gravitational energyinput in clusters that combines central heating with entropy enhancements frommerger shocks. such enhancements could extend the impact of central energyinput to larger radii in unrelaxed clusters, as suggested by our data. we alsoexamine the evolution of the lt relation, and find that while the data appearinconsistent with simple self-similar evolution, the differences can beplausibly explained by selection bias, and thus we find no reason to rule outself-similar evolution. we show that the fraction of cool core clusters in our(non-representative) sample decreases at z&gt;0.5 and discuss the effect of thison measurements of the evolution in the lt relation.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1205.3103	weak-lensing mass measurements of five galaxy clusters in the south pole  telescope survey using magellan/megacam	we use weak gravitational lensing to measure the masses of five galaxyclusters selected from the south pole telescope (spt) survey, with the primarygoal of comparing these with the spt sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray basedmass estimates. the clusters span redshifts 0.28 &lt; z &lt; 0.43 and have massesm_500 &gt; 2 x 10^14 h^-1 m_sun, and three of the five clusters were discovered bythe spt survey. we observed the clusters in the g'r'i' passbands with themegacam imager on the magellan clay 6.5m telescope. we measure a mean ratio ofweak lensing (wl) aperture masses to inferred aperture masses from the sz data,both within an aperture of r_500,sz derived from the sz mass, of 1.04 +/- 0.18.we measure a mean ratio of spherical wl masses evaluated at r_500,sz tospherical sz masses of 1.07 +/- 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical wl massesevaluated at r_500,wl to spherical sz masses of 1.10 +/- 0.24. we explorepotential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons and conclude thatall are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms beingcluster concentration uncertainty and n-body simulation calibration bias.expanding the sample of spt clusters with wl observations has the potential tosignificantly improve the spt cluster mass calibration and the resultingcosmological constraints from the spt cluster survey. these are the first wldetections using megacam on the magellan clay telescope.

1206.2355	irregular sloshing cold fronts in the nearby merging groups ngc 7618 and  ugc 12491: evidence for kelvin-helmholtz instabilities	we present results from two \sim30 ks chandra observations of the hotatmospheres of the merging galaxy groups centered around ngc 7618 and ugc12491. our images show the presence of arc-like sloshing cold fronts wrappedaround each group center and \sim100 kpc long spiral tails in both groups. mostinterestingly, the cold fronts are highly distorted in both groups, exhibiting'wings' along the fronts. these features resemble the structures predicted fromnon-viscous hydrodynamic simulations of gas sloshing, where kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities (khis) distort the cold fronts. this is in contrast to thestructure seen in many other sloshing and merger cold fronts, which are smoothand featureless at the current observational resolution. both magnetic fieldsand viscosity have been invoked to explain the absence of khis in these smoothcold fronts, but the ngc 7618/ugc 12491 pair are two in a growing number ofboth sloshing and merger cold fronts that appear distorted. magnetic fieldsand/or viscosity may be able to suppress the growth of khis at the cold frontsin some clusters and groups, but clearly not in all. we propose that thepresence or absence of khi-distortions in cold fronts can be used as a measureof the effective viscosity and/or magnetic field strengths in the icm.

1208.1612	contribution of the accretion disk, hot corona, and obscuring torus to  the luminosity of seyfert galaxies: integral and spitzer observations	we estimate the relative contributions of the supermassive black hole (smbh)accretion disk, corona, and obscuring torus to the bolometric luminosity ofseyfert galaxies, using spizter mid-infrared (mir) observations of a completesample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei from the integral all-sky hard x-ray(hx) survey. this is the first hx-selected (above 15 kev) sample of agns withcomplementary high angular resolution, high signal to noise, mir data.correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between hxand mir luminosities: l_mir l_hx^(0.74+/-0.06). assuming that the observed miremission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dustytorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (asinferred from the declining fraction of obscured agns), the intrinsic diskluminosity, l_d, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the coronain the 2-300 kev energy band, l_c, with the l_d/l_c ratio varying by a factorof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. this ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller thanfor typical quasars producing the cosmic x-ray background (cxb). therefore,over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, hx radiation carries a large, androughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of agns. we estimate thecumulative bolometric luminosity density of local agns at ~(1-3)x10^40erg/s/mpc^3. finally, the compton temperature ranges between kt_c~2 and ~6 kevfor nearby agns, compared to kt_c~2 kev for typical quasars, confirming thatradiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulatingsmbh growth.

1211.4874	kelvin-helmholtz instabilities at the sloshing cold fronts in the virgo  cluster as a measure for the effective icm viscosity	sloshing cold fronts (cfs) arise from minor merger triggered gas sloshing.their detailed structure depends on the properties of the intra-cluster medium(icm): hydrodynamical simulations predict the cfs to be distorted bykelvin-helmholtz instabilities (khis), but aligned magnetic fields, viscosity,or thermal conduction can suppress the khis. thus, observing the detailedstructure of sloshing cfs can be used to constrain these icm properties. bothsmooth and distorted sloshing cfs have been observed, indicating that the khiis suppressed in some clusters, but not in all. consequently, we need toaddress at least some sloshing clusters individually before drawing generalconclusions about the icm properties. we present the first detailed attempt toconstrain the icm properties in a specific cluster from the structure of itssloshing cf. proximity and brightness make the virgo cluster an ideal target.we combine observations and virgo-specific hydrodynamical sloshing simulations.here we focus on a spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity as a mechanismto suppress the khi, but discuss the alternative mechanisms in detail. weidentify the cf at 90 kpc north and north-east of the virgo center as the bestlocation in the cluster to observe a possible khi suppression. for viscosities$\gtrsim$ 10% of the spitzer value khis at this cf are suppressed. we describein detail the observable signatures at low and high viscosities, i.e. in thepresence or absence of khis. we find indications for a low icm viscosity inarchival xmm-newton data and demonstrate the detectability of the predictedfeatures in deep chandra observations.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1407.2942	mass calibration and cosmological analysis of the spt-sz galaxy cluster  sample using velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ and x-ray $y_\textrm{x}$  measurements	we present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the south poletelescope sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey (spt-sz) galaxy cluster sample.using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 x-ray yxmeasurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate themass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. thecalibrations using $\sigma_v$ and yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. we use the fullcluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. thespt cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the wmap9 orplanck+wmap9 polarization (wp) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrinomasses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ ev, we find the datasets to be consistent at the1.0$\sigma$ level for wmap9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for planck+wp. allowing for larger$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. when we combine the cluster andplanck+wp datasets with bao and snia, the preferred cluster masses are$1.9\sigma$ higher than the yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the$\sigma_v$ calibration. given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of thedata. using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. within a $\nu$cdm model we find $\sum m_\nu =0.148\pm0.081$ ev. we present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of stateparameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with alcdm model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).

0803.3595	evidence for non-hydrostatic gas motions in the hot ism of centaurus a	we present preliminary results from a deep (600 ks) {\em chandra} observationof the hot interstellar medium of the nearby early-type galaxy centaurus a (cena). we find a surface brightness discontinuity in the gas $\sim$3.5 kpc fromthe nucleus spanning a 120$^\circ$ arc. the temperature of the gas is0.60$\pm$0.05 and 0.68$\pm$0.10 kev, interior and exterior to thediscontinuity, respectively. the elemental abundance is poorly constrained bythe spectral fits, but if the abundance is constant across the discontinuity,there is a factor of 2.3$\pm$0.4 pressure jump across the discontinuity. thiswould imply that the gas is moving at 470$\pm$100 km s$^{-1}$, or mach1.0$\pm$0.2 (1.2$\pm$0.2) relative to the sound speed of the gas external(internal) to the discontinuity. alternatively, pressure balance could bemaintained if there is a large (factor of $\sim$7) discontinuity in theelemental abundance. we suggest that the observed discontinuity is the resultof non-hydrostatic motion of the gas core (i.e. sloshing) due to the recentmerger. in this situation, both gas motions and abundance gradients areimportant in the visibility of the discontinuity. cen a is in the late stagesof merging with a small late-type galaxy, and a large discontinuity in densityand abundance across a short distance demonstrates that the gas of the twogalaxies remains poorly mixed even several hundred million years after themerger. the pressure discontinuity may have had a profound influence on thetemporal evolution of the kpc-scale jet. the jet could have decollimatedcrossing the discontinuity and thereby forming the northeast radio lobe.

1409.6300	stripped elliptical galaxies as probes of icm physics: i. tails, wakes,  and flow patterns in and around stripped ellipticals	elliptical cluster galaxies are progressively stripped of their atmospheresdue to their motion through the intra-cluster medium (icm). deep x-rayobservations reveal the fine-structure of the galaxy's remnant atmosphere andits gas tail and wake. this fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions(galaxy potential, initial gas contents, orbit through the host cluster),orbital stage (early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), and icm plasmaproperties (thermal conductivity, viscosity, magnetic field structure). we aimto disentangle dynamic and plasma effects in order to use stripped ellipticalsas probes of icm plasma properties. this first paper of a series investigatesthe hydrodynamics of progressive gas stripping by means of inviscidhydrodynamical simulations. we distinguish a long-lasting initial relaxationphase and a quasi-steady stripping phase. during quasi-steady stripping, theicm flow around the remnant atmosphere resembles the flow around solid bodies,including a `deadwater' region in the near wake. gas is stripped from theremnant atmosphere predominantly at its sides via kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities. the downstream atmosphere is largely shielded from the icm windand thus shaped into a tail. observationally, both, this `remnant tail' and thestripped gas in the wake can appear as a `tail', but only in the wake cangalactic gas mix with the ambient icm. while the qualitative results aregeneric, the simulations presented here are tailored to the virgo ellipticalgalaxy m89 (ngc 4552) for the most direct comparison to observations. papers iiand iii of this series describe the effect of viscosity and compare to chandraand xmm-newton observations, respectively.

1409.6312	stripped elliptical galaxies as probes of icm physics: ii. stirred, but  mixed? viscous and inviscid gas stripping of the virgo elliptical m89	elliptical galaxies moving through the intra-cluster medium (icm) areprogressively stripped of their gaseous atmospheres. x-ray observations revealthe structure of galactic tails, wakes, and the interface between the galacticgas and the icm. this fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions (galaxypotential, initial gas contents, orbit in the host cluster), orbital stage(early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), as well as on the stillill-constrained icm plasma properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity,magnetic field structure). paper i describes flow patterns and stages ofinviscid gas stripping. here we study the effect of a spitzer-like temperaturedependent viscosity corresponding to reynolds numbers, re, of 50 to 5000 withrespect to the icm flow around the remnant atmosphere. global flow patterns areindependent of viscosity in this reynolds number range. viscosity influencestwo aspects: in inviscid stripping, kelvin-helmholtz instabilities (khis) atthe sides of the remnant atmosphere lead to observable horns or wings.increasing viscosity suppresses khis of increasing length scale, and thusobservable horns and wings. furthermore, in inviscid stripping, strippedgalactic gas can mix with the ambient icm in the galaxy's wake. this mixing issuppressed increasingly with increasing viscosity, such that viscously strippedgalaxies have long x-ray bright, cool wakes. we provide mock x-ray images fordifferent stripping stages and conditions. while these qualitative results aregeneric, we tailor our simulations to the virgo galaxy m89 (ngc 4552), wherere~ 50 corresponds to a viscosity of 10% of the spitzer level. paper iiicompares new deep chandra and archival xmm-newton data to our simulations.

1410.0025	x-ray cavities in a sample of 83 spt-selected clusters of galaxies:  tracing the evolution of agn feedback in clusters of galaxies out to z=1.2	x-ray cavities are key tracers of mechanical (or radio mode) heating arisingfrom the active galactic nuclei (agn) in brightest cluster galaxies. we reporton a survey for x-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4&lt;z&lt;1.2)clusters of galaxies selected by their sunyaev-zel'dovich signature in thesouth pole telescope data. based on chandra x-ray images, we find a total of 6clusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistentwith the picture of radio jets inflating x-ray cavities in the intraclustermedium. the majority of these detections are of relatively low significance andrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. further, due to thelimitations of chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (&lt;10 kpc),unresolved x-ray cavities at high (z&gt;0.5) redshift. despite these limitations,our results suggest that the power generated by agn feedback in brightestcluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of theuniverse (&gt;7 gyrs at z=0.8). on average, the detected x-ray cavities havepowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.integrating over 7 gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in thebrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9m_sun ofmaterial to power these outflows. this level of accretion indicates thatsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,in the quasar era, but at late times as well. we also find that x-ray cavitiesat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 kev per particle into thehot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.this value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, breakself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres.

1410.6485	turbulent heating in galaxy clusters brightest in x-rays	the hot, x-ray-emitting intracluster medium (icm) is the dominant baryonicconstituent of clusters of galaxies. in the cores of many clusters, radiativeenergy losses from the icm occur on timescales significantly shorter than theage of the system. unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulationsof cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations.various sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses havebeen proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holesin the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma.regardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy istransferred to the icm has remained open. here we present a plausible solutionto this question based on deep chandra x-ray observatory data and a newdata-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the icm heating ratedue to the dissipation of turbulence. we find that turbulent heating issufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locallyat each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gascooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of x-raygas-rich systems.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1501.07271	gas density fluctuations in the perseus cluster: clumping factor and  velocity power spectrum	x-ray surface brightness fluctuations in the core of the perseus cluster areanalyzed, using deep observations with the chandra observatory. the amplitudeof gas density fluctuations on different scales is measured in a set of radialannuli. it varies from 8 to 12 per cent on scales of ~10-30 kpc within radii of30-160 kpc from the cluster center and from 9 to 7 per cent on scales of ~20-30kpc in an outer, 60-220 kpc annulus. using a statistical linear relationbetween the observed amplitude of density fluctuations and predicted velocity,the characteristic velocity of gas motions on each scale is calculated. thetypical amplitudes of the velocity outside the central 30 kpc region are 90-140km/s on ~20-30 kpc scales and 70-100 km/s on smaller scales ~7-10 kpc. thevelocity power spectrum is consistent with cascade of turbulence and its slopeis in a broad agreement with the slope for canonical kolmogorov turbulence. thegas clumping factor estimated from the power spectrum of the densityfluctuations is lower than 7-8 per cent for radii ~30-220 kpc from the center,leading to a density bias of less than 3-4 per cent in the cluster core.uncertainties of the analysis are examined and discussed. future measurementsof the gas velocities with the astro-h, athena and smart-x observatories willdirectly measure the gas density-velocity perturbation relation and furtherreduce systematic uncertainties in these quantities.

1508.00013	on the nature of x-ray surface brightness fluctuations in m87	x-ray images of galaxy clusters and gas-rich elliptical galaxies show awealth of small-scale features which reflect fluctuations in density and/ortemperature of the intra-cluster medium. in this paper we study thesefluctuations in m87/virgo, to establish whether sound waves/shocks, bubbles oruplifted cold gas dominate the structure. we exploit the strong dependence ofthe emissivity on density and temperature in different energy bands todistinguish between these processes. using simulations we demonstrate that ouranalysis recovers the leading type of fluctuation even in the presence ofprojection effects and temperature gradients. we confirm the isobaric nature ofcool filaments of gas entrained by buoyantly rising bubbles, extending to 7' tothe east and south-west, and the adiabatic nature of the weak shocks at 40" and3' from the center. for features of 5--10 kpc, we show that the central 4'x 4'region is dominated by cool structures in pressure equilibrium with the ambienthotter gas while up to 30 percent of the variance in this region can beascribed to adiabatic fluctuations. the remaining part of the central 14'x14'region, excluding the arms and shocks described above, is dominated byapparently isothermal fluctuations (bubbles) with a possible admixture (at thelevel of about 30 percent) of adiabatic (sound waves) and by isobaricstructures. larger features, of about 30 kpc, show a stronger contribution fromisobaric fluctuations. the results broadly agree with an agn feedback modelmediated by bubbles of relativistic plasma.

0806.0866	chandra's view of the ram pressure stripped galaxy m86	we present results from a mosaic of nine chandra observations of m86 and thesurrounding field. we detect three main diffuse components: the virgo icm at~2.4 kev, the extended halo of m86 at ~1.2 kev, and the cooler central andstripped gas of m86 at ~0.8 kev. the most striking feature is a long tail ofemission, which consists of a plume ~ 4' north of m86 and two main extensionsemanating from the plume. based on the morphology and temperature structure ofthe tail, we conclude that it is formed by ram pressure stripping of m86 as itfalls into the virgo cluster and interacts with the virgo icm, in agreementwith earlier work. the tail is 150 kpc in projection, and a simple estimategives a lower limit on the true length of the tail of 380 kpc, making this thelongest ram pressure stripped tail presently known. the total gas mass in theplume (7x10^8 m_sun) and tail (1x10^9 m_sun) is about three times that in thecore of m86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was strippedrapidly and recently. the projected position of the plume can be understood ifm86 has an aspherical potential, as suggested by optical isophotes. rampressure stripping from an aspherical potential can also explain the split"double tails" seen in m86 and in other virgo cluster galaxies in the field.the large line-of-sight velocity of m86 (1550 km/s with respect to m87), itsposition relative to the virgo cluster, and the orientation of the tail tightlyconstrain its orbital parameters. the data are inconsistent with a radialorbit, and imply inner and outer turning radii of r_i ~ 300 kpc and r_o &gt; 8.8mpc, indicating that m86 is, at best, only weakly bound to the virgo cluster.

astro-ph;0102291	chandra observation of rxj1720.1+2638: a nearly relaxed cluster with a  fast moving core?	we have analyzed the chandra observation of the distant (z=0.164) galaxycluster rxj1720.1+2638 in which we find sharp features in the x-ray surfacebrightness on opposite sides of the x-ray peak: an edge at about 250 h_50^{-1}kpc to the south-east and a plateau at about 130 h_50^{-1} kpc to thenorth-west. the surface brightness edge and the plateau can be modeled as a gasdensity discontinuity (jump) and a slope change (break). the temperatureprofiles suggest that the jump and the break are the boundaries of a central,group-size (d=380h_50^{-1} kpc), dense, cold (t=4 kev) gas cloud, embedded in adiffuse hot (t=10 kev) intracluster medium. the density jump and thetemperature change across the discontinuity are similar to the ``cold fronts''discovered by chandra in a2142 and a3667, and suggest subsonic motion of thiscentral gas cloud with respect to the cluster itself. the most naturalexplanation is that we are observing a merger in the very last stage before thecluster becomes fully relaxed. however, the data are also consistent with analternative scenario in which rxj1720.1+2638 is the result of the collapse oftwo co-located density perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbationcollapse followed by a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse thatsurrounded, but did not destroy, the first one. we also show that, because ofthe core motion, the total mass inside the cluster core, derived under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, may underestimate the true cluster mass.if widespread, such motion may partially explain the discrepancy between x-rayand the strong lensing mass determinations found in some clusters.

astro-ph;0108476	chandra observation of ms 1455.0+2232: cold fronts in a massive cooling  flow cluster?	we present the chandra observation of the cluster of galaxies ms 1455.0+2232.  from previous asca and rosat observations, this cluster was identified as a``relaxed'' cluster that hosts one of the most massive cooling flows detected.with higher angular resolution, the chandra x-ray image shows the presence oftwo surface brightness edges on opposite sides of the x-ray peak: the first at190 kpc to the north and the second at 450 kpc to the south. even though thelow exposure of this observation limits our ability to constrain thetemperature jump across both edges, we show that the northern edge is likely tobe a ``cold front'' similar to others observed recently by chandra in theclusters a2142, a3667, rx j1720.1+2638, and a2256. the observed cold front ismost likely produced by the motion, from south to north, of a group-size darkmatter halo. the most natural explanation for the presence of this observedmoving subclump is that ms 1455.0+2232 is a merger cluster in the very laststage before it becomes fully relaxed. this scenario, however, appears to beunlikely as the cluster shows no further sign of ongoing merger. moreover, itis not clear if a massive cooling flow could have survived this kind of merger.we propose an alternative scenario in which, as for rx j1720.1+2638, ms1455.0+2232 is the result of the hierarchical collapse of two co-locateddensity perturbations, the first a group-scale perturbation collapse followedby a second cluster-scale perturbation collapse that surrounded, but did notdestroy, the first. we suggest that a cooling flow may have begun inside thealready collapsed group-scale perturbation and may have been later amplified bythe gas compression induced by the infall of the overlying main cluster mass.

astro-ph;0109420	chandra observations of cold fronts in cluster of galaxies	high-resolution chandra images of several clusters of galaxies reveal sharp,edge-like discontinuities in their gas density. the gas temperature is higherin front of the edge where the density is low, corresponding to approximatelycontinuous pressure across the edge. this new phenomenon was called ``coldfronts'', to contrast it to shock fronts that should look similar in x-rayimages but where the temperature should jump in the opposite direction. thefirst cold fronts were discovered in merging clusters, where they appear todelineate the boundaries of dense cool subcluster remnants moving through andbeing stripped by the surrounding shock-heated gas. later, chandra revealedcold fronts in the central regions of several apparently relaxed clusters. toexplain the gas bulk motion in these clusters, we propose either a peculiarcluster formation history that resulted in an oscillating core, or gas sloshing(without the involvement of the underlying dark matter peak) caused by pastsubcluster infall or central agn activity. we review these observations anddiscuss their implications for the x-ray cluster mass estimates.

astro-ph;0110523	interaction of radio lobes with the hot intracluster medium: driving  convective outflow in hydra a	the radio lobes of hydra a lie within cavities surrounded by a rim ofenhanced x-ray emission in the intracluster gas. although the bright rimappears cooler than the surrounding gas, existing chandra data do not excludethe possibility that the rim is produced by a weak shock. a temperature mapshows that cool gas extends out along the radio axis of hydra a. the age of theradio source and equipartition pressure of the radio lobe argue against ashock, and comparison with similar structure in the perseus cluster alsosuggests that the rim is cool. we show that the cool bright rim cannot be theresult of shock induced cooling, or due to the effect of magnetic fields inshocks. the most likely source of low entropy (cool) gas is entrainment by therising cavity. this requires some means of communicating the bouyant force onthe cavity to the surrounding gas. the magnetic field required to produce thefaraday rotation in hydra a has the appropriate properties for this, if thefaraday screen is mainly in this bright rim. in hydra a, the mass outflow dueto the rising cavities could be sufficient to balance cooling driven inflow, sopreventing the build up of low entropy gas in the cluster core.

astro-ph;0111340	chandra observations of the x-ray jet in centaurus a	we present high angular resolution x-ray images and spectra from two {\emchandra} acis-i observations of the x-ray jet in the nearby radio galaxycentaurus a. we find that the x-ray emission from the jet is composed of a lowsurface brightness diffuse component extending continuously from within atleast 60 pc of the active nucleus into the ne radio lobe 4 kpc from thenucleus, along with 31 discrete compact knots, most of which are extended atthe resolution of our observation. we find that there are small but significantdifferences between the x-ray and radio morphologies of the inner jet at thearcsecond level, making it unlikely that a single, spatially coincidentpopulation of ultrarelativistic electrons is responsible for the emission inboth energy regimes. we suggest that the x-ray knots of the inner jet areindeed the sites of particle acceleration and shocks, and the x-ray and radioknot offsets are caused by a combination of particle diffusion and energy loss.these offsets may be a common feature of all jets in radio galaxies, or atleast jets in fr i type galaxies, and may be fundamental to the physics of suchjets. the x-ray spectra of several regions of the jet are well fit by absorbedpower-law models with photon indices $\sim$2.2-2.5, although the spectrum ofone bright knot located $\sim$1 kpc from the nucleus (knot b) is harder (photonindex = 2.0).

astro-ph;0208208	a high resolution picture of the intracluster gas	chandra has significantly advanced our knowledge of the processes in theintracluster gas. the discovery of remarkably regular ``cold fronts'', orcontact discontinuities, in merging clusters showed that gas dynamicinstabilities at the boundaries between the moving gases are often suppressed,most likely by specially structured magnetic fields.  cold fronts are not limited to mergers -- chandra observed them in the coresof more than 2/3 of the cooling flow clusters, where they often divide the coolcentral and the hotter ambient gas phases. the natural state of the low-entropycentral gas in clusters thus appears to be to slosh subsonically in the centralpotential well, with several interesting implications. hydrostatic equilibriumis not reached and the hydrostatic total mass estimates cannot be valid atsmall radii (r&lt;100 kpc). the kinetic energy dissipated by the sloshing gas maybe sufficient to compensate for radiative cooling. in the absence of a recentmerger, the cause of such sloshing is unclear. it might be related to themechanical energy generated by the central agn, evidence of which (the bubbles)is also observed by chandra in a large fraction of the cooling flow clusters.  heat conduction across cold fronts is suppressed completely. in the bulk ofthe gas, it is reduced by a factor of ~10 or more relative to the classicvalue, as shown by merger temperature maps. a spatial correlation between thegas temperature maps and the radio halo maps is observed in several mergers,which may provide clues for the relativistic particle acceleration mechanisms.

astro-ph;0301367	chandra temperature map of abell 754 and constraints on thermal  conduction	we use chandra data to derive a detailed gas temperature map of the nearby,hot, merging galaxy cluster a754. combined with the x-ray and optical images,the map reveals a more complex merger geometry than previously thought,possibly involving more than two subclusters or a cool gas cloud sloshingindependently from its former host subcluster. in the cluster central region,we detect spatial variations of the gas temperature on all linear scales, from100 kpc (the map resolution) and up, which likely remain from a merger shockpassage. these variations are used to derive an upper limit on effectivethermal conductivity on a 100 kpc scale, which is at least an order ofmagnitude lower than the spitzer value. this constraint pertains to the bulk ofthe intracluster gas, as compared to the previously reported estimates for coldfronts (which are rather peculiar sites). if the conductivity in a tangledmagnetic field is at the recently predicted higher values (i.e., about 1/5 ofthe spitzer value), the observed suppression can be achieved, for example, ifthe intracluster gas consists of magnetically isolated domains.

0811.1217	merging cold fronts in the galaxy pair ngc 7619 and ngc 7626	we present results from {\it chandra} observations of the galaxy pair ngc7619 and ngc 7626, the two dominant members of the pegasus group. the x-rayimages show a brightness edge associated with each galaxy, which we identify asmerger cold fronts. the edges are sharp, and the axes of symmetry of the edgesare roughly anti-parallel, suggesting that these galaxies are falling towardsone another in the plane of the sky. the detection of merger cold frontsimplies a merging subgroup scenario, since the alternative is that the galaxiesare falling into a pre-existing $\sim1$ kev halo without a dominant galaxy ofits own, and such objects are not observed. we estimate the 3d velocities fromthe cold fronts and show that the velocity vectors are indeed most likely closeto the plane of the sky, with a relative velocity of $\sim1190\kms$. therelative velocity is consistent with what is expected from the infall of tworoughly equal mass subgroups whose total viral mass equals that of the pegasusgroup. we conclude that the pegasus cluster is currently forming from a majormerger of two subgroups, dominated by ngc 7619 and ngc 7626. ngc 7626 containsa strong radio source, a core with two symmetric jets and radio lobes. althoughwe find no associated structure in the x-ray surface brightness map, thetemperature map reveals a clump of cool gas just outside the southern lobe,presumably entrained by the lobe, and an extension of cooler gas into the lobeitself. the jet axis is parallel with the projected direction of motion of ngc7626 (inferred from the symmetry axis of the merger cold front), and thesouthern leading jet is foreshortened as compared to the northern trailing one,possibly due to the additional ram pressure the forward jet encounters.

0812.2720	chandra cluster cosmology project iii: cosmological parameter  constraints	chandra observations of large samples of galaxy clusters detected in x-raysby rosat provide a new, robust determination of the cluster mass functions atlow and high redshifts. statistical and systematic errors are now sufficientlysmall, and the redshift leverage sufficiently large for the mass functionevolution to be used as a useful growth of structure based dark energy probe.in this paper, we present cosmological parameter constraints obtained fromchandra observations of 36 clusters with &lt;z&gt;=0.55 derived from 400deg^2 rosatserendipitous survey and 49 brightest z=~0.05 clusters detected in the all-skysurvey. evolution of the mass function between these redshifts requiresomega_lambda&gt;0 with a ~5sigma significance, and constrains the dark energyequation of state parameter to w0=-1.14+-0.21, assuming constant w and flatuniverse. cluster information also significantly improves constraints whencombined with other methods. fitting our cluster data jointly with the latestsupernovae, wmap, and baryonic acoustic oscillations measurements, we obtainw0=-0.991+-0.045 (stat) +-0.039 (sys), a factor of 1.5 reduction in statisticaluncertainties, and nearly a factor of 2 improvement in systematics compared toconstraints that can be obtained without clusters. the joint analysis of thesefour datasets puts a conservative upper limit on the masses of light neutrinos,sum m_nu&lt;0.33 ev at 95% cl. we also present updated measurements of omega_m*hand sigma_8 from the low-redshift cluster mass function.
