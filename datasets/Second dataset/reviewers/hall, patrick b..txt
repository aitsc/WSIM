0903.3230	clustering of low-redshift (z &lt;= 2.2) quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey	we present measurements of the quasar two-point correlation function,\xi_{q}, over the redshift range z=0.3-2.2 based upon data from the sdss. usinga homogeneous sample of 30,239 quasars with spectroscopic redshifts from thedr5 quasar catalogue, our study represents the largest sample used for thistype of investigation to date. with this redshift range and an areal coverageof approx 4,000 deg^2, we sample over 25 h^-3 gpc^3 (comoving) assuming thecurrent lcdm cosmology. over this redshift range, we find that theredshift-space correlation function, xi(s), is adequately fit by a singlepower-law, with s_{0}=5.95+/-0.45 h^-1 mpc and \gamma_{s}=1.16+0.11-0.16 whenfit over s=1-25 h^-1 mpc. using the projected correlation function we calculatethe real-space correlation length, r_{0}=5.45+0.35-0.45 h^-1 mpc and\gamma=1.90+0.04-0.03, over scales of rp=1-130 h^-1 mpc. dividing the sampleinto redshift slices, we find very little, if any, evidence for the evolutionof quasar clustering, with the redshift-space correlation length stayingroughly constant at s_{0} ~ 6-7 h^-1 mpc at z&lt;2.2 (and only increasing atredshifts greater than this). comparing our clustering measurements to thosereported for x-ray selected agn at z=0.5-1, we find reasonable agreement insome cases but significantly lower correlation lengths in others. we find thatthe linear bias evolves from b~1.4 at z=0.5 to b~3 at z=2.2, withb(z=1.27)=2.06+/-0.03 for the full sample. we compare our data to analyticalmodels and infer that quasars inhabit dark matter haloes of constant mass m ~2x 10^12 h^-1 m_sol from redshifts z~2.5 (the peak of quasar activity) to z~0.[abridged]

1004.1167	the sloan digital sky survey quasar catalog v. seventh data release	we present the fifth edition of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) quasarcatalog, which is based upon the sdss seventh data release. the catalog, whichcontains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, represents the conclusionof the sdss-i and sdss-ii quasar survey. the catalog consists of the sdssobjects that have luminosities larger than m_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with h_0= 70 km/s/mpc omega_m = 0.3, and omega_lambda = 0.7) have at least one emissionline with fwhm larger than 1000 km/s or have interesting/complex absorptionfeatures, are fainter than i &gt; 15.0 and have highly reliable redshifts. thecatalog covers an area of 9380 deg^2. the quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars atredshifts greater than four, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than five.the catalog contains 9210 quasars with i &lt; 18; slightly over half of theentries have i&lt; 19. for each object the catalog presents positions accurate tobetter than 0.1" rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) ccd-based photometrywith typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology andselection method. the catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and x-rayemission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-areasurveys. the calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200ang. at a spectral resolution r = 2000 the spectra can be retrieved from thesdss public database using the information provided in the catalog. over 96% ofthe objects in the catalog were discovered by the sdss. we also include asupplemental list of an additional 207 quasars with sdss spectra whose archivephotometric information is incomplete.

1007.3464	chandra x-ray observations of two unusual bal quasars	we report sensitive chandra x-ray non-detections of two unusual, luminousiron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars (felobals). the observationsdo detect a non-bal, wide-binary companion quasar to one of the felobalquasars. we combine x-ray-derived column density lower limits (assuming solarmetallicity) with column densities measured from ultraviolet spectra and cloudyphotoionization simulations to explore whether constant density slabs at broadline region densities can match the physical parameters of these two baloutflows, and find that they cannot. in the "overlapping-trough" object sdssj0300+0048, we measure the column density of the x-ray absorbing gas to be n_h&gt;= 1.8 x 1024 cm-2. from the presence of fe ii uv78 absorption but lack of feii uv195/uv196 absorption, we infer the density in that part of the absorbingregion to be n_e ~ 106 cm-3. we do find that a slab of gas at that densitymight be able to explain this object's absorption. in the fe iii-dominantobject sdss j2215-0045, the x-ray absorbing column density of n_h &gt;= 3.4 x 1024cm-2 is consistent with the fe iii-derived n_h &gt;= 2 x 1022 cm-2 provided theionization parameter is log u &gt; 1.0 for both the n_e = 1011 cm-3 and n_e = 1012cm-3 scenarios considered (such densities are required to produce fe iiiabsorption without fe ii absorption). however, the velocity width of theabsorption rules out its being concentrated in a single slab at thesedensities. instead, this object's spectrum can be explained by a low density,high ionization and high temperature disk wind that encounters and ablateshigher density, lower ionization fe iii-emitting clumps.

1010.3728	implications of dramatic broad absorption line variability in the quasar  fbqs j1408+3054	we have observed a dramatic change in the spectrum of the formerly heavilyabsorbed `overlapping-trough' iron low-ionization broad absorption line(felobal) quasar fbqs j1408+3054. over a time span of between 0.6 to 5rest-frame years, the mg ii trough outflowing at 12,000 km/s decreased inequivalent width by a factor of two and the fe ii troughs at the same velocitydisappeared. the most likely explanation for the variability is that astructure in the bal outflow moved out of our line of sight to the ultravioletcontinuum emitting region of the quasar's accretion disk. given the size ofthat region, this structure must have a transverse velocity of between 2600km/s and 22,000 km/s. in the context of a simple outflow model, we show thatthis bal structure is located between approximately 5800 and 46,000schwarzschild radii from the black hole. that distance corresponds to 1.7 to 14pc, 11 to 88 times farther from the black hole than the h-beta broad-lineregion. the high velocities and the parsec-scale distance for at least this onefelobal outflow mean that not all felobal outflows can be associated withgalaxy-scale outflows in ultraluminous infrared galaxies transitioning tounobscured quasars. the change of fbqs j1408+3054 from an felobal to a lobalquasar also means that if (some) felobal quasars have multiwavelengthproperties which distinguish them from hibal quasars, then some lobal quasarswill share those properties. finally, we extend previous work on howmultiple-epoch spectroscopy of bal and non-bal quasars can be used to constrainthe average lifetime of bal episodes (currently &gt;60 rest-frame years at 90%confidence).

1011.1268	biases in the quasar mass-luminosity plane	we find that the recently reported departure from the eddington luminositylimit for the highest quasar black hole masses at a given redshift is anartifact due to biases in black hole mass measurements. this sub-eddingtonboundary (with non-unity slope) in the quasar mass-luminosity plane wasinitially reported by steinhardt &amp; elvis (2010a) using the fwhm-based blackhole mass catalogue of shen et al. (2008). however, the significance of theboundary is reduced when the fwhm-based mass-scaling relationship isrecalibrated following wang et al. (2009) and using the most updatedreverberation mapping estimates of black hole masses. furthermore, thisboundary is not seen using mass estimates based on the line dispersion of thesame quasars' mgii emission lines. thus, the initial report of a sub-eddingtonboundary with non-unity slope was due to biases in estimating masses using thefwhm of a fit of one or two gaussians to quasar mgii emission lines. we provideevidence that using the line dispersion of the mgii line produces less biasedblack hole mass estimates.

1011.2282	unification of luminous type 1 quasars through civ emission	using a sample of 30,000 quasars from sdss-dr7, we explore the range ofproperties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as civ1549. specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between l_uv andemission line eqw (the baldwin effect) and the "blueshifting" ofhigh-ionization emission lines. the blueshift of the civ emission line isnearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (rq) quasarsand 360 km/s for radio-loud (rl) quasars, and the baldwin effect is present inboth rq and rl samples. composite spectra are constructed as a function of civemission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships betweendifferent line species and the sed. within a two-component disk+wind model ofthe broad emission line region (belr), where the wind filters the continuumseen by the disk component, we find that rl quasars are consistent with beingdominated by the disk component, while balqsos are consistent with beingdominated by the wind component. some rq objects have emission line featuressimilar to rl quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (bh) spinto form radio jets. our results suggest that there could be significantsystematic errors in the determination of l_bol and bh mass that make itdifficult to place these findings in a more physical context. however, it ispossible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of belrparameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the sed, whichultimately must be tied to bh mass and accretion rate.

1104.1828	supermassive black hole mass estimates using sloan digital sky survey  quasar spectra at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2	we present mgii-based black hole mass estimates for 27,602 quasars withrest-frame uv spectra available in the sloan digital sky survey data releasethree. this estimation is possible due to the existence of an empiricalcorrelation between the radius of the broad line region and the continuumluminosity at 3000 angstroms. we regenerate this correlation by applying ourmeasurement method to uv spectra of low-redshift quasars in the hst/iuedatabases which have corresponding reverberation mapping estimates of the hbetabroad line region's radius. our mass estimation method uses the line dispersionrather than the full width at half maximum of the low-ionization mgii emissionline. we measure mgii line dispersions for quasars whose spectra have beenreconstructed using the most significant eigenspectra produced throughprincipal component analysis. we have tested the reliability of usingreconstructed spectra in black hole mass estimation using a monte carlosimulation and by comparing the results from original and reconstructed datarelease three spectra. we show that using reconstructed spectra not only makesbias-free mass estimation possible for quasars with low spectroscopicsignal-to-noise ratio, but also reduces the intrinsic scatter of thedistribution of the black hole masses to lower than 0.15 dex.

0709.3474	quasar clustering at $25\kpch$ from a complete sample of binaries	we present spectroscopy of binary quasar candidates selected from datarelease 4 of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr4) using kernel densityestimation (kde). we present 27 new sets of observations, 10 of which arebinary quasars, roughly doubling the number of known $g &lt; 21$ binaries withcomponent separations of 3 to 6". only 3 of 49 spectroscopically identifiedobjects are non-quasars, confirming that the quasar selection efficiency of thekde technique is $\sim95$%. several of our observed binaries arewide-separation lens candidates that merit additional higher-resolutionobservations. one interesting pair may be an m star binary, or an m star-binaryquasar superposition. our candidates are initially selected by uv-excess ($u-g&lt; 1$), but are otherwise selected irrespective of the relative colors of thequasar pair, and we thus use them to suggest optimal color similarity andphotometric redshift approaches for targeting binary quasars, or projectedquasar pairs. from a sample that is complete on proper scales of $23.7 &lt;r_{prop} &lt; 29.7\kpch$, we determine the projected quasar correlation functionto be $w_p=24.0 \pm^{16.9}_{10.8}$, which is $2\sigma$ lower than recentestimates. we argue that our low $w_p$ estimates may indicate redshiftevolution in the quasar correlation function from $z\sim1.9$ to $z\sim1.4$ onscales of $r_{prop} \sim25\kpch$. the size of this evolution broadly tracksquasar clustering on larger scales, consistent with merger-driven models ofquasar origin. although our sample alone is insufficient to detect evolution inquasar clustering on small scales, an $i$-selected dr6 kde quasar catalog,which will contain several hundred $z \leqsim 5$ binary quasars, could easilyconstrain any clustering evolution at $r_{prop} \sim25\kpch$.

1104.3861	a population of x-ray weak quasars: phl 1811 analogs at high redshift	we report the results from chandra and xmm-newton observations of a sample of10 type 1 quasars selected to have unusual uv emission-line properties (weakand blueshifted high-ionization lines; strong uv fe emission) similar to thoseof phl 1811, a confirmed intrinsically x-ray weak quasar. these quasars wereidentified by the sloan digital sky survey at high redshift (z~2.2); eight areradio quiet while two are radio intermediate. all of the radio-quiet phl 1811analogs are notably x-ray weak by a mean factor of ~13. these sources lackbroad absorption lines and have blue uv/optical continua, suggesting they areintrinsically x-ray weak. however, their average x-ray spectrum appears to beharder than those of typical quasars, which may indicate the presence of heavyintrinsic x-ray absorption. our radio-quiet phl 1811 analogs support aconnection between an x-ray weak spectral energy distribution and phl 1811-likeuv emission lines; this connection provides an economical way to identify x-rayweak type 1 quasars. the fraction of radio-quiet phl 1811 analogs in theradio-quiet quasar population is estimated to be &lt; 1.2%. we have investigatedcorrelations between relative x-ray brightness and uv emission-line propertiesfor a sample combining radio-quiet phl 1811 analogs, phl 1811, and typical type1 quasars. these correlation analyses suggest that phl 1811 analogs may haveextreme wind-dominated broad emission-line regions. observationally,radio-quiet phl 1811 analogs appear to be a subset (~30%) of radio-quietweak-line quasars. the existence of a subset of quasars in whichhigh-ionization "shielding gas" covers most of the belr, but little more thanthe belr, could potentially unify the phl 1811 analogs and wlqs. the tworadio-intermediate phl 1811 analogs are x-ray bright. one of them appears tohave jet-dominated x-ray emission, while the nature of the other remainsunclear.

1105.1689	polar broad absorption line quasars: an open question	it has been argued that certain broad absorption line quasars are viewedwithin 35 degrees of the axis of a relativistic radio jet, based on two-epochradio flux density variability. it is true if the surface brightness of a radiosource is observed to change by a sufficiently large amount, the inferredbrightness temperature will exceed 10^12 k and doppler beaming in our directionmust be invoked to avoid a compton cooling catastrophe. however, flux densitychanges cannot be linked to surface brightness changes without knowledge of thesize of the source. if an optically thick source changes in projected area butnot surface brightness, its brightness temperature is constant and its fluxvariability yields no constraint on its orientation. moreover, as pointed outby rees, spherical expansion of an emission source at relativistic speedsyields an apparently superluminal increase in its projected area, which canexplain short-timescale flux density variability without requiring arelativistic jet oriented near to our line of sight. therefore, two-epoch radioflux density variability by itself cannot unambiguously identify sources withjets directed towards us. only vlbi imaging can robustly determine the fractionof broad absorption line quasars which are polar.

1109.1515	civ emission and the ultraviolet through x-ray spectral energy  distribution of radio-quiet quasars	in the restframe uv, two of the parameters that best characterize the rangeof emission-line properties in quasar broad emission-line regions are theequivalent width and the blueshift of the civ line relative to the quasar restframe. we explore the connection between these emission-line properties and theuv through x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) for radio-quiet (rq)quasars. our sample consists of a heterogeneous compilation of 406 quasars fromthe sloan digital sky survey and palomar-green survey that have well-measuredciv emission-line and x-ray properties (including 164 objects with measuredgamma). we find that rq quasars with both strong civ emission and small civblueshifts can be classified as "hard-spectrum" sources that are (relatively)strong in the x-ray as compared to the uv. on the other hand, rq quasars withboth weak civ emission and large civ blueshifts are instead "soft-spectrum"sources that are (relatively) weak in the x-ray as compared to the uv. thiswork helps to further bridge optical/soft x-ray "eigenvector 1" relationshipsto the uv and hard x-ray. based on these findings, we argue that future workshould consider systematic errors in bolometric corrections (and thus accretionrates) that are derived from a single mean sed. detailed analysis of the civemission line may allow for sed-dependent corrections to these quantities.

1112.0679	a description of quasar variability measured using repeated sdss and  poss imaging	we provide a quantitative description and statistical interpretation of theoptical continuum variability of quasars. the sloan digital sky survey (sdss)has obtained repeated imaging in five uv-to-ir photometric bands for 33,881spectroscopically confirmed quasars. about 10,000 quasars have an average of 60observations in each band obtained over a decade along stripe 82 (s82), whereasthe remaining ~25,000 have 2-3 observations due to scan overlaps. the observedtime lags span the range from a day to almost 10 years, and constrain quasarvariability at rest-frame time lags of up to 4 years, and at rest-framewavelengths from 1000a to 6000a. we publicly release a user-friendly catalog ofquasars from the sdss data release 7 that have been observed at least twice insdss or once in both sdss and the palomar observatory sky survey, and we use itto analyze the ensemble properties of quasar variability. based on a dampedrandom walk (drw) model defined by a characteristic time scale and anasymptotic variability amplitude that scale with the luminosity, black holemass, and rest wavelength for individual quasars calibrated in s82, we canfully explain the ensemble variability statistics of the non-s82 quasars suchas the exponential distribution of large magnitude changes. all available dataare consistent with the drw model as a viable description of the opticalcontinuum variability of quasars on time scales of ~5-2000 days in the restframe. we use these models to predict the incidence of quasar contamination intransient surveys such as those from ptf and lsst.

1306.2680	broad absorption line quasars with redshifted troughs: high-velocity  infall or rotationally dominated outflows?	we report the discovery in the sloan digital sky survey and the sdss-iiibaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of seventeen broad absorption line(bal) quasars with high-ionization troughs that include absorption redshiftedrelative to the quasar rest frame. the redshifted troughs extend to velocitiesup to v=12,000 km/s and the trough widths exceed 3000 km/s in all but one case.approximately 1 in 1000 bal quasars with blueshifted c iv absorption also hasredshifted c iv absorption; objects with c iv absorption present only atredshifted velocities are roughly four times rarer. in more than half of ourobjects, redshifted absorption is seen in c ii or al iii as well as c iv,making low-ionization absorption at least ten times more common among balquasars with redshifted troughs than among standard bal quasars. however, the civ absorption equivalent widths in our objects are on average smaller thanthose of standard bal quasars with low-ionization absorption. we considerseveral possible ways of generating redshifted absorption. the two most likelypossibilities may be at work simultaneously, in the same objects or indifferent ones. rotationally dominated outflows seen against a quasar'sextended continuum source can produce redshifted and blueshifted absorption,but variability consistent with this scenario is seen in only one of the fourobjects with multiple spectra. the infall of relatively dense andlow-ionization gas to radii as small as 400 schwarzschild radii can inprinciple explain the observed range of trough profiles, but current models donot easily explain the origin and survival of such gas. whatever the origin(s)of the absorbing gas in these objects, it must be located at small radii toexplain its large redshifted velocities, and thus offers a novel probe of theinner regions of quasars.

1308.6010	modeling quasar accretion disc temperature profiles	microlensing observations indicate that quasar accretion discs havehalf-light radii larger than expected from standard theoretical predictionsbased on quasar fluxes or black hole masses. blackburne and colleagues havealso found a very weak wavelength dependence of these half-light radii. weconsider disc temperature profile models that might match these observations.nixon and colleagues have suggested that misaligned accretion discs aroundspinning black holes will be disrupted at radii small enough for thelense-thirring torque to overcome the disc's viscous torque. gas in precessingannuli torn off a disc will spread radially and intersect with the remainingdisc, heating the disc at potentially large radii. however, if the intersectionoccurs at an angle of more than a degree or so, highly supersonic collisionswill shock-heat the gas to a compton temperature of t~10^7 k, and the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of discs with such shock-heated regions are poorfits to observations of quasar seds. torn discs where heating occurs inintermittent weak shocks that occur whenever the intersection angle reaches atenth of a degree pose less of a conflict with observations, but do not havesignificantly larger half-light radii than standard discs. we also study twophenomenological disc temperature profile models. we find that discs with atemperature spike at relatively large radii and lowered temperatures at radiiinside the spike yield improved and acceptable fits to microlensing sizes inmost cases. such temperature profiles could in principle occur in sub-kepleriandiscs partially supported by magnetic pressure. however, such discs overpredictthe fluxes from quasars studied with microlensing except in the limit ofnegligible continuum emission from radii inside the temperature spike.

0801.4586	c_2 in peculiar dq white dwarfs	white dwarfs (wds) with carbon absorption features in their optical spectraare known as dq wds. the subclass of peculiar dq wds are cool objects(t_eff&lt;6000 k) which show molecular absorption bands that have centroidwavelengths ~100-300 angstroms shortward of the bandheads of the c_2 swanbands. these "peculiar dq bands" have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such asc_2h. we point out that c_2h does not show strong absorption bands withwavelengths matching those of the peculiar dq bands and neither does any othersimple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool wd atmosphere. the moststraightforward explanation for the peculiar dq bands is that they arepressure-shifted swan bands of c_2. while current models of wd atmospheressuggest that, in general, peculiar dq wds do not have higher photosphericpressures than normal dq wds do, that finding requires confirmation by improvedmodels of wd atmospheres and of the behavior of c_2 at high pressures andtemperatures. if it is eventually shown that the peculiar dq bands cannot beexplained as pressure-shifted swan bands, the only explanation remaining wouldseem to be that they arise from highly rotationally excited c_2 (j_peak&gt;45). ineither case, the absorption band profiles can in principle be used to constrainthe pressure and the rotational temperature of c_2 in the line-forming regionsof normal and peculiar dq wd atmospheres, which will be useful for comparisonwith models. finally, we note that progress in understanding magnetic dq wdsmay require models which simultaneously consider magnetic fields, highpressures and rotational excitation of c_2.

0803.2335	rapidly spinning black holes in quasars: an open question	wang et al. (2006) estimated an average radiative efficiency of 30% -- 35%for quasars at moderate redshift. we find that their method is not independentof quasar lifetimes and thus that quasars do not necessarily have such highefficiencies. nonetheless, it is possible to derive interrelated constraints onquasar lifetimes, eddington ratios, and radiative efficiencies of supermassiveblack holes. we derive such constraints using a statistically complete sampleof quasars with black hole mass estimates from broad mg ii, made both with andwithout the radiation pressure correction of marconi et al. (2008). we concludethat for quasars with l/ledd &gt; 0.02, lifetimes can range from 140 to 750 myrfor schwarzschild black holes. coupled with observed black hole masses, quasarlifetimes of &lt; 140 myr would imply that radiatively inefficient accretion or bhmergers must be important in the accretion history of quasars. given reasonableassumptions about the quasar population, if the average quasar lifetime is &lt; 1gyr, and if radiatively inefficient accretion is unimportant, then not many bhswith eddington ratio &lt; 0.2 can be rapidly spinning.

astro-ph;0203252	unusual broad absorption line quasars from the sloan digital sky survey	the sloan digital sky survey has confirmed the existence of populations ofbroad absorption line (bal) quasars with various unusual properties. we presentand discuss twenty-three such objects and consider the implications of theirwide range of properties for models of bal outflows and quasars in general. wehave discovered one bal quasar with a record number of absorption lines. twoother similarly complex objects with many narrow troughs show broad mgiiabsorption extending longward of their systemic host galaxy redshifts. this canbe explained as absorption of an extended continuum source by therotation-dominated base of a disk wind. five other objects have absorptionwhich removes an unprecedented ~90% of all flux shortward of mgii. theabsorption in one of them has varied across the ultraviolet with an amplitudeand rate of change as great as ever seen. this same object may also show broadh-beta absorption. numerous reddened bal quasars have been found, including atleast one reddened mini-bal quasar with very strong feii emission. the fivereddest objects have continuum reddenings of e(b-v)~0.5, and in two of them wefind strong evidence that the reddening curve is even steeper than that of thesmc. we have found at least one object with absorption from feiii but not feii.this may be due to a high column density of moderately high-ionization gas, butthe feiii level populations must also be affected by some sort of resonance.finally, we have found two luminous, probably reddened high-redshift objectswhich may be bal quasars whose troughs partially cover different regions of thecontinuum source as a function of velocity.

astro-ph;0204162	broad emission line shifts in quasars: an orientation measure for  radio-quiet quasars?	using a sample of 3814 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey, we confirmthat high-ionization, broad, emission lines such as civ are significantlyblueshifted with respect to low-ionization, broad, emission lines such as mgii.civ emission line peaks have a range of shifts from a redshift of 500 km/s toblueshifts well in excess of 2000 km/s as compared to mgii. we confirm previousresults that suggest an anti-correlation between the shift of the civ emissionline peak and the rest equivalent width of the civ emission line. furthermore,using composite spectra, we are able to show that the apparent shift of the civemission line peak is not a shift so much as it is a lack of flux in the redwing for the composite with the largest apparent shift. this observation shouldstrongly constrain models for the broad emission line region in quasars. theemission line blueshift and equivalent width of civ are also discussed in lightof the baldwin effect and as a function of other quasar properties such asspectral index, radio and x-ray detection. we find a possible correlation withboth the radio and broad absorption line properties of the quasars that issuggestive of orientation as the cause of the civ velocity shifts.

astro-ph;0303341	the incidence of strong-lensing clusters in the red-sequence cluster  survey	the incidence of giant arcs due to strong-lensing clusters of galaxies isknown to be discrepant with current theoretical expectations. this resultderives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in theframework of the currently favored $\lambda$cdm cosmology, and one possibleexplanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.in this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the red-sequencecluster survey (rcs), which again shows significant disagreement withtheoretical predictions. we briefly describe a total of eight strong lenssystems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. based on thedetails of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arcsystems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in thecurrently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.specifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall highredshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population isresponsible for much of the observed lensing. the lack of lensing clusters at$z&lt;0.64$ in the rcs indicates that a property associated with clusters at earlytimes results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination ofellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changesin the cluster mass profiles is responsible. cluster mass, which should evolveto globally higher values toward lower redshifts, is clearly not the mostsignificant consideration for the formation of giant arcs.

astro-ph;0304166	peculiar broad absorption line quasars found in dposs	with the recent release of large (i.e., &gt; hundred million objects),well-calibrated photometric surveys, such as dposs, 2mass, and sdss,spectroscopic identification of important targets is no longer a simple issue.in order to enhance the returns from a spectroscopic survey, candidate sourcesare often preferentially selected to be of interest, such as brown dwarfs orhigh redshift quasars. this approach, while useful for targeted projects, risksmissing new or unusual species. we have, as a result, taken the alternativepath of spectroscopically identifying interesting sources with the solecriterion being that they are in low density areas of the g - r and r - icolor-space defined by the dposs survey. in this paper, we present threepeculiar broad absorption line quasars that were discovered during thisspectroscopic survey, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. pssj0052+2405 is an iron lobal quasar at a redshift z = 2.4512 with very broadabsorption from many species. pss j0141+3334 is a reddened lobal quasar at z =3.005 with no obvious emission lines. pss j1537+1227 is a iron lobal at aredshift of z = 1.212 with strong narrow mgii and feii emission. follow-up highresolution spectroscopy of these three quasars promises to improve ourunderstanding of bal quasars. the sensitivity of particular parameter spaces,in this case a two-color space, to the redshift of these three sources isdramatic, raising questions about traditional techniques of defining quasarpopulations for statistical analysis.

astro-ph;0305093	a large, uniform sample of x-ray emitting agn: selection approach and an  initial catalog from the rosat all-sky and sloan digital sky surveys	many open questions in x-ray astronomy are limited by the relatively smallnumber of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when raresubclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution orcorrelations between wavebands. we describe initial results of a program aimedto ultimately yield 10^4 x-ray source identifications--a sample about an orderof magnitude larger than earlier efforts. the technique employs x-ray data fromthe rosat all-sky survey (rass), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followupfrom the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). optical objects in the sdss catalogsare automatically cross-correlated with rass x-ray source positions; thenpriorities for follow-on sdss optical spectra of candidate counterparts areautomatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios forvarious classes of x-ray emitters. sdss parameters for optical morphology,magnitude, colors, plus first radio data, serve as proxies for object class.  initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalogof 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/agn that are probable rassidentifications. most of the ids are new, and only a few percent of the agn arelikely to be random superpositions. the magnitude and redshift ranges of thecounterparts extend over 15&lt;m&lt;21 and 0.03&lt;z&lt;3.6. although most ids are quasarsand sy 1s, a variety of other agn subclasses are also sampled. substantialnumbers of rare agn are found, including more than 130 narrow-line seyfert 1sand 45 bl lac candidates. these results already provide a sizeable set of newids, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate thecapability of the rass/sdss approach to efficiently proceed towards the largesthomogeneously selected/observed sample of x-ray emitting agn. abridged abstract

astro-ph;0404151	detections of the 2175 \aa dust feature at 1.4z 1.5 from the sloan  digital sky survey	the strongest spectroscopic dust extinction feature in the milky way, thebroad absorption bump at 2175 \aa, is generally believed to be caused byaromatic carbonaceous materials -- very likely a mixture of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) molecules, the most abundant and widespread organic moleculesin the milky way galaxy. in this paper we report identifications of thisabsorption feature in three galaxies at $1.4 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.5$ whichproduce intervening mgii absorption toward quasars discovered by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the observed spectra can be fit using galactic-typeextinction laws, characterized by parameters [r_v, e(b-v)] ~ [0.7, 0.14], [1.9,0.13], and [5.5, 0.23], respectively, where r_v=a_v/e(b-v) is thetotal-to-selective extinction ratio, e(b-v) = a_b-a_v is the color-excess.these discoveries imply that the dust in these distant quasar absorptionsystems is similar in composition to that of milky way, but with a range ofdifferent grain size distributions. the presence of complex aromatichydrocarbon molecules in such distant galaxies is important for bothastrophysical and astrobiological investigations.

astro-ph;0405239	a quasar without broad lyman-alpha emission	the z=3.02 quasar sdss j095253.83+011421.9 exhibits broad metal-line emission(civ fwhm=9000 km/s), but broad ly-alpha emission is not present. instead, onlya narrow ly-alpha line is observed (fwhm=1140 km/s). the large civ/ly-alpharatio in the broad-line region (blr) emission from this object can be matchedmost closely by a blr dominated by gas at very high densities (10^15 cm^-3),which suppresses the ly-alpha emission, and illuminated by an incidentpower-law extending to ~200 micron, which yields increased emission from purelycollisionally excited coolant lines (such as civ, nv and ovi) but not fromrecombination lines like ly-alpha. however, the strong ciii emission predictedby this model is not observed, and the observed broad ciii] emission must comefrom a lower-density blr component and should be accompanied by broad ly-alphaemission which is not observed. the least unlikely explanation for thisspectrum seems to be that any intrinsic broad ly-alpha emission is removed bysmooth nv absorption in the red wing of the ly-alpha emission line and bysmooth ly-alpha absorption in the blue wing of the ly-alpha emission line. thispostulated smooth absorption would be in addition to the strong, associated,narrow absorption seen in numerous ions. smooth absorption in ly-alpha, nv andovi but not in civ would be unusual, but not impossible, although it issuspicious that the postulated absorption must almost exactly cancel thepostulated intrinsic broad emission. we conclude that the spectrum of sdssj0952+0114 appears unique (among ~3600 sdss spectra of quasars at z&gt;2.12)because of some_combination_ of unusual parameters, and we discuss possibleobservations to determine the combination of circumstances responsible for thespectrum.

astro-ph;0406293	dust reddening in sdss quasars	we explore the form of extragalactic reddening toward quasars using a sampleof 9566 quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;2.2, and accurate optical colors from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we confirm that dust reddening is the primaryexplanation for the red ``tail'' of the color distribution of sdss quasars. ourfitting to 5-band photometry normalized by the modal quasar color as a functionof redshift shows that this ``tail'' is well described by smc-like reddeningbut not by lmc-like, galactic, or gaskell et al. (2004) reddening. extension tolonger wavelengths using a subset of 1886 sdss-2mass matches confirms theseresults at high significance. we carry out monte-carlo simulations that matchthe observed distribution of quasar spectral energy distributions using alorentzian dust reddening distribution; 2% of quasars selected by the main sdsstargeting algorithm (i.e., which are not extincted out of the sample) havee_{b-v} &gt; 0.1; less than 1% have e_{b-v} &gt; 0.2, where the extinction isrelative to quasars with modal colors. reddening is uncorrelated with thepresence of intervening narrow-line absorption systems, but reddened quasarsare much more likely to show narrow absorption at the redshift of the quasarthan are unreddened quasars. thus the reddening towards quasars is dominated bysmc-like dust at the quasar redshift.

astro-ph;0408504	an empirical algorithm for broad-band photometric redshifts of quasars  from the sloan digital sky survey	we present an empirical algorithm for obtaining photometric redshifts ofquasars using 5-band sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometry. our algorithmgenerates an empirical model of the quasar color-redshift relation, comparesthe colors of a quasar candidate with this model, and calculates possiblephotometric redshifts. using the 3814 quasars of the sdss early data releasequasar catalog to generate a median color-redshift relation as a function ofredshift we find that, for this same sample, 83% of our predicted redshifts arecorrect to within |delta z|&lt;0.3. the algorithm also determines the probabilitythat the redshift is correct, allowing for even more robust photometricredshift determination for smaller, more restricted samples. we apply thistechnique to a set of 8740 quasar candidates selected by the final version ofthe sdss quasar-selection algorithm. the photometric redshifts assigned tonon-quasars are restricted to a few well-defined values. in addition, 90% ofthe objects with spectra that have photometric redshifts between 0.8 and 2.2are quasars with accurate (|delta z|&lt;0.3) photometric redshifts. many of thesequasars lie in a single region of color space; judicious application ofcolor-cuts can effectively select quasars with accurate photometric redshiftsfrom the sdss database. when the sdss is complete, this technique will allowthe determination of photometric redshifts for ~10^6 faint sdss quasarcandidates, enabling advances in our knowledge of the quasar luminosityfunction, gravitational lensing of quasars, and correlations among quasars andbetween galaxies.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0507418	the optical - infrared colors of corals qsos: searching for dust  reddening associated with high redshift damped lyman alpha systems	the presence of dust in quasar absorbers, such as damped lyman alpha (dla)systems, may cause the background qso to appear reddened. we investigate theextent of this potential reddening by comparing the optical-to-infrared (ir)colors of qsos with and without intervening absorbers. our qso sample is basedon the complete optical and radio absorption line system (corals) survey ofellison et al (2001). we have obtained near-simultaneous b and k bandmagnitudes for subset of the corals sample and supplemented our observationswith further measurements published in the literature. to account forredshift-related color changes, the b-k colors are normalized using the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) qso composite. the mean normalized b-k color of thedla sub-sample is +0.12, whereas the mean for the no-dla sample is -0.10; bothdistributions have rms scatters ~0.5. neither a student's t-test nor a ks testindicate that there is any significant difference between the two colordistributions. based on simulations which redden the colors of qsos withintervening dlas, we determine a reddening limit which corresponds to e(b-v) &lt;0.04 (smc-like extinction) at 99% confidence (3 sigma), assuming that e(b-v) isthe same for all dlas. finally, we do not find any general correlation betweenabsorber properties (such as [fe/zn] or neutral hydrogen column density) andb-k color. one of these two qsos shows evidence for strong associatedabsorption from x-ray observations, an alternative explanation for its very redcolor. we conclude that the presence of intervening galaxies causes a minimalreddening of the background qso.

astro-ph;0603588	cosmological constraints from the red-sequence cluster survey	[abridged] we present a first cosmological analysis of a refined clustercatalog from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). the input cluster sample isderived from 72.07 square degrees of imaging data [...] the catalog contains956 clusters over 0.35&lt;z&lt;0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error.the calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked againstpublicly available sloan digital sky survey imaging [...] we analyze thecluster sample via a general self-calibration technique including scatter inthe mass-richness relation [...]. we fit simultaneously for omega_m andsigma_8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness tomass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the richness-mass relation.the principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (orlack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster massobservables) and available results on both from independent measures. from anunconstrained analysis, omega_m and sigma_8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and0.67+0.18-0.13 respectively. an analysis including gaussian priors on the slopeand zeropoint of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results:0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. both analyses are in good agreement with thecurrent literature. the parameters describing the mass-richness relation in theunconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and agree with existingfollow-up data on both the rcs-1 and other cluster samples. our resultsdirectly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with muchlarger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probesof cosmology.

astro-ph;0606417	chandra observations of red sloan digital sky survey quasars	we present short \chandra observations of twelve bright (i&lt;18) z_em~1.5quasars from the sloan digital sky survey chosen to have significantly redderoptical colors than most quasars at the same redshift. of the five quasars withoptical properties most consistent with dust reddening at the quasar redshift,four show indirect evidence of moderate x-ray absorption (inferred n_h~10^22cm^-2) with a dust-to-gas ratio &lt;1% of the smc value. the remaining sevenobjects show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic x-ray absorption. thus,while optically red quasars are marginally more likely to show signatures ofx-ray absorption than optically selected quasars with normal colors,dust-reddened type 1 agn (as opposed to fully obscured type 2 agn) are unlikelyto contribute significantly to the remaining unresolved hard x-ray background.the red quasar population includes objects with intrinsically red continua aswell as objects with dust-reddened continua. improved sample selection is thusneeded to increase our understanding of either subpopulation. to identifydust-reddened quasars likely to exhibit x-ray absorption, some measure ofspectral curvature is preferable to simple cuts in observed or relativebroad-band colors.

astro-ph;0610656	broad absorption line variability in repeat quasar observations from the  sloan digital sky survey	we present a time-variability analysis of 29 broad absorption line quasars(balqsos) observed in two epochs by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). thesespectra are selected from a larger sample of balqsos with multiple observationsby virtue of exhibiting a broad civ $\lambda$1549 absorption trough separatedfrom the rest frame of the associated emission peak by more than 3600 kms$^{-1}$. detached troughs facilitate higher precision variabilitymeasurements, since the measurement of the absorption in these objects is notcomplicated by variation in the emission line flux. we have undertaken astatistical analysis of these detached-trough balqso spectra to explore therelationships between bal features that are seen to vary and the dynamics ofemission from the quasar central engine. we have measured variability withinour sample, which includes three strongly variable bals. we have also verifiedthat the statistical behavior of the overall sample agrees with current modelpredictions and previous studies of bal variability. specifically, we observethat the strongest bal variability occurs among the smallest equivalent widthfeatures and at velocities exceeding 12,000 km s$^{-1}$, as predicted by recentdisk-wind modeling.

astro-ph;0611922	a balmer-line broad absorption line quasar	i report the discovery of blueshifted broad absorption line (bal) troughs inat least six transitions of the balmer series of hydrogen (hbeta to h9) and incaii, mgii and excited feii in the quasar sdss j125942.80+121312.6. this isonly the fourth active galactic nucleus known to exhibit balmer absorption, allfour in conjunction with low-ionization bal systems containing excited fe ii.the substantial population in the n=2 shell of h i in this quasar's absorberlikely arises from ly-alpha trapping. in an absorber sufficiently opticallythick to show balmer absorption, soft x-rays from the quasar penetrate to large\tau_ly\alpha and ionize h i. recombination then creates ly-alpha photons thatincrease the n=2 population by a factor \tau_ly\alpha since they require about\tau_ly\alpha scatterings to diffuse out of the absorber. observing ly-alphatrapping in a quasar absorber requires a large but compton-thin column of gasalong our line of sight which includes substantial h i but not too much dust.presumably the rarity of balmer-line bal troughs reflects the rarity of suchconditions in quasar absorbers.

astro-ph;0612202	near-infrared properties of moderate-redshift galaxy clusters:  luminosity functions and density profiles	we present k-band imaging for 15 of the canadian network for observationalcosmology (cnoc1) clusters. the cluster luminosity density and number densityprofiles can be described by nfw models with concentration parameters of c_{l}= 4.28 \pm 0.70 and c_{g} = 4.13 \pm 0.57 respectively. comparing these to thedynamical mass analysis of the same clusters shows that the galaxy luminosityand number density profiles are similar to the dark matter profile, and are notless concentrated like in local clusters. the luminosity functions show thatthe evolution of k^{*} over the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 is consistent witha scenario where the majority of stars in cluster galaxies form athigh-redshift (z_{f} &gt; 1.5) and evolve passively thereafter. the best-fit forthe faint-end slope of the luminosity function is alpha = -0.84 pm 0.08, whichindicates that it does not evolve between z = 0 and z = 0.3. using principalcomponent analysis of the spectra we classify cluster galaxies as eitherstar-forming/recently-star-forming (em+bal) or non-starforming (ell) andcompute their respective luminosity functions. the faint-end slope of the ellluminosity function is much shallower than for the em+bal galaxies at z = 0.3,and suggests the number of faint ell galaxies in clusters decreases by a factorof ~3 from z = 0 to z = 0.3. the redshift evolution of k^{*} for both em+baland ell types is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formedat high-redshift. passive evolution in both classes, as well as the totalcluster luminosity function, demonstrates that the bulk of the stellarpopulation in all bright cluster galaxies is formed at high-redshift andsubsequent transformations in morphology/color/spectral-type have little effecton the total stellar mass.

astro-ph;0612612	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): deep near-infrared  imaging and the selection of distant galaxies	we present deep near-infrared jhk imaging of four 10'x10' fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the multiwavelength survey byyale-chile (musyc) with ispi on the ctio 4m telescope. the typical point sourcelimiting depths are j~22.5, h~21.5, and k~21 (5sigma; vega). the effectiveseeing in the final images is ~1.0". we combine these data with musyc ubvrizimaging to create k-selected catalogs that are unique for their uniform size,depth, filter coverage, and image quality. we investigate the rest-frameoptical colors and photometric redshifts of galaxies that are selected usingcommon color selection techniques, including distant red galaxies (drgs),star-forming and passive bzks, and the rest-frame uv-selected bm, bx, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs). these techniques are effective at isolating largesamples of high redshift galaxies, but none provide complete or uniform samplesacross the targeted redshift ranges. the drg and bm/bx/lbg criteria identifypopulations of red and blue galaxies, respectively, as they were designed todo. the star-forming bzks have a very wide redshift distribution, a wide rangeof colors, and may include galaxies with very low specific star formationrates. in comparison, the passive bzks are fewer in number, have a differentdistribution of k magnitudes, and have a somewhat different redshiftdistribution. by combining these color selection criteria, it appears possibleto define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit overspecific redshift ranges. however, the redshift dependence of both thecompleteness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit tothe usefulness of these techniques.

astro-ph;0702214	clustering of high redshift ($z\ge 2.9$) quasars from the sloan digital  sky survey	(abridged) we study the two-point correlation function of a uniformlyselected sample of 4,426 luminous optical quasars with redshift $2.9 \le z\le5.4$ selected over 4041 deg$^2$ from the fifth data release of the sloandigital sky survey. for a real-space correlation function of the form$\xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are$r_0 = 15.2 \pm 2.7 h^{-1}$ mpc and $\gamma = 2.0 \pm 0.3$, over a scale range$4\le r_p\le 150 h^{-1}$ mpc. thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably morestrongly clustered than their $z \approx 1.5$ counterparts, which have acomoving clustering length $r_0 \approx 6.5 h^{-1}$ mpc. dividing our sampleinto two redshift bins: $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $z\ge 3.5$, and assuming apower-law index $\gamma=2.0$, we find a correlation length of $r_0 = 16.9 \pm1.7 h^{-1}$ mpc for the former, and $r_0 = 24.3 \pm 2.4 h^{-1}$ mpc for thelatter. following martini &amp; weinberg, we relate the clustering strength andquasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. using the sheth &amp;tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range$4\sim 50$ myr for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$; and $30\sim 600$ myr forquasars with $z\ge 3.5$. the corresponding duty cycles are $0.004\sim 0.05$ forthe lower redshift bin and $0.03\sim 0.6$ for the higher redshift bin. theminimum mass of halos in which these quasars reside is $2-3\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $4-6\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $z\ge 3.5$.

astro-ph;0703369	near-infrared properties of moderate-redshift galaxy clusters: halo  occupation number, mass-to-light ratios and omega_m	using k-band imaging for 15 of the canadian network for observationalcosmology (cnoc1) clusters we examine the near-infrared properties ofmoderate-redshift (0.19 &lt; z &lt; 0.55) galaxy clusters. we find that the number ofk-band selected cluster galaxies within r_{500} (the halo occupation number,hon) is well-correlated with the the cluster dynamical mass (m_{500}) and x-raytemperature (t_{x}); however, the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relationsis 37% and 46% respectively. comparison with clusters in the local universeshows that the hon-m_{500} relation does not evolve significantly between z = 0and z ~ 0.3. this suggests that if dark matter halos are disrupted or undergosignificant tidal-stripping in high-density regions as seen in numericalsimulations, the stellar mass within the halos is tightly bound, and notremoved during the process. the total k-band cluster light (l_{200,k}) andk-band selected richness (parameterized by b_{gc,k}) are also correlated withboth the cluster t_{x} and m_{200}. the total (intrinsic) scatter in thel_{200,k}-m_{200} and b_{gc,k}-m_{200} relations are 43%(31%) and 35%(18%)respectively and indicates that for massive clusters both l_{200,k} andb_{gc,k} can predict m_{200} with similar accuracy as t_{x}, l_{x} or opticalrichness (b_{gc}). examination of the mass-to-light ratios of the clustersshows that similar to local clusters, the k-band mass-to-light ratio is anincreasing function of halo mass. using the k-band mass-to-light ratios of theclusters, we apply the oort technique and find omega_{m,0} = 0.22 pm 0.02,which agrees well with recent combined concordance cosmology parameters, but,similar to previous cluster studies, is on the low-density end of preferredvalues.

astro-ph;0703758	on the spectral evolution of cool, helium-atmosphere white dwarfs:  detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of dz stars	we present a detailed analysis of a large spectroscopic and photometricsample of dz white dwarfs based on our latest model atmosphere calculations. werevise the atmospheric parameters of the trigonometric parallax sample ofbergeron, leggett, &amp; ruiz (12 stars) and analyze 147 new dz white dwarfsdiscovered in the sloan digital sky survey. the inclusion of metals andhydrogen in our model atmosphere calculations leads to different atmosphericparameters than those derived from pure helium models. calcium abundances arefound in the range from log (ca/he) = -12 to -8. we also find that fits of thecoolest objects show peculiarities, suggesting that our physical models may notcorrectly describe the conditions of high atmospheric pressure encountered inthe coolest dz stars. we find that the mean mass of the 11 dz stars withtrigonometric parallaxes, &lt;m&gt; = 0.63 mo, is significantly lower than thatobtained from pure helium models, &lt;m&gt; = 0.78 mo, and in much better agreementwith the mean mass of other types of white dwarfs. we determine hydrogenabundances for 27% of the dz stars in our sample, while only upper limits areobtained for objects with low signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic data. weconfirm with a high level of confidence that the accretion rate of hydrogen isat least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of metals (and up to five insome cases) to be compatible with the observations. we find a correlationbetween the hydrogen abundance and the effective temperature, suggesting forthe first time empirical evidence of a lower temperature boundary for thehydrogen screening mechanism. finally, we speculate on the possibility that thedza white dwarfs could be the result of the convective mixing of thinhydrogen-rich atmospheres with the underlying helium convection zone.

astro-ph;9806151	an optical/near-infrared study of radio-loud quasar environments ii.  imaging results	we use optical and near-ir imaging to examine the properties of thesignificant excess population of k&gt;=19 galaxies found in the fields of 31 z=1-2radio-loud quasars by hall, green &amp; cohen (1998). the excess occurs on twospatial scales: a component at &lt;40'' from the quasars significant compared tothe galaxy surface density at &gt;40'' in the same fields, and a component roughlyuniform to ~100'' significant compared to the galaxy surface density seen inrandom-field surveys in the literature. the r-k color distributions of theexcess galaxy populations are indistinguishable and are significantly redderthan the color distribution of the field population.  the excess galaxies are consistent with being predominantly early-typegalaxies at the quasar redshifts, and there is no evidence that they areassociated with intervening mgii absorption systems. the average excess within0.5 mpc (~65'') of the quasars corresponds to abell richness class ~0 comparedto the galaxy surface density at &gt;0.5 mpc from the quasars, and to abellrichness class ~1.5 compared to that from the literature.  we discuss the spectral energy distributions (seds) of galaxies in fieldswith data in several passbands. most candidate quasar-associated galaxies areconsistent with being 2-3 gyr old early-types at the quasar redshifts of z~1.5.however, some objects have seds consistent with being 4-5 gyr old at z~1.5, anda number of others are consistent with ~2 gyr old but dust-reddened galaxies atthe quasar redshifts. these potentially different galaxy types suggest theremay be considerable dispersion in the properties of early-type cluster galaxiesat z~1.5. there is also a population of galaxies whose seds are best modelledby background galaxies at z&gt;2.5.

astro-ph;9812195	properties of candidate cluster galaxies at z=1--2	i discuss the properties of a population of candidate cluster galaxiesrecently identified in the fields of radio-loud quasars at z=1--2. themagnitude, spatial, and color distributions of the excess galaxies in thesefields are consistent with the quasars residing in moderately rich galaxyoverdensities dominated by early-type galaxies.  the broadband seds of very red galaxies in several fields suggest that thereis considerable dispersion in the properties of early-type galaxies in theseclusters at z~1.5. most excess galaxies are best fit as 2--3 gyr oldellipticals, but some are either 4--5 gyr old or considerably more metal-rich,and others must be extremely dusty. the latter are part of a ``j-band dropout''population which includes a number of galaxies in one field which are probablyat z~2.5, background to the quasar.  finally, i discuss narrowband redshifted h-alpha imaging in two fields whichhas yielded at least one detection. at z&gt;1.3 cluster galaxy star formationrates can be measured from h-alpha in the near-ir, rest-frame 1500-angstromlight in the optical, and eventually rest-frame far-ir emission using scuba, tohelp determine the star formation histories of cluster galaxies as function ofredshift.

0810.2747	a catalog of broad absorption line quasars in sloan digital sky survey  data release 5	we present a catalog of 5039 broad absorption line (bal) quasars (qsos) inthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 (dr5) qso catalog that haveabsorption troughs covering a continuous velocity range &gt;= 2000 km/s. we havefit ultraviolet (uv) continua and line emission in each case, enabling us toreport common diagnostics of bal strengths and velocities in the range -25,000to 0 km/s for siiv $\lambda$1400, civ $\lambda$1549, aliii $\lambda$1857, andmgii $\lambda$2799. we calculate these diagnostics using the spectrum listed inthe dr5 qso catalog, and also for spectra from additional sdss observing epochswhen available. in cases where bal qsos have been observed with chandra orxmm-newton, we report the x-ray monochromatic luminosities of these sources.  we confirm and extend previous findings that bal qsos are more stronglyreddened in the rest-frame uv than non-bal qsos and that bal qsos arerelatively x-ray weak compared to non-bal qsos. the observed bal fraction isdependent on the spectral signal-to-noise (s/n); for higher-s/n sources, wefind an observed bal fraction of approximately 15%. bal qsos show a similarbaldwin effect as for non-bal qsos, in that their civ emission equivalentwidths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. however, bal qsos haveweaker civ emission in general than do non-bal qsos. sources with higher uvluminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the baloutflow velocity and uv absorption strength are correlated with relative x-rayweakness. these results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend onstrong x-ray absorption to shield the outflow from over-ionization and enableradiative acceleration....

0810.4144	quasar clustering from sdss dr5: dependences on physical properties	using a homogenous sample of 38,208 quasars with a sky coverage of $4000 {\rmdeg^2}$ drawn from the sdss data release five quasar catalog, we study thedependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole mass, quasarcolor, and radio loudness. at $z&lt;2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly onluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\sim10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. these weak dependences areconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,virial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted anyclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantitythat best correlates with clustering strength. however, the most luminous andmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\sim 2\sigma$ level)than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase ofthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. we do not observe a strongdependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. on theother hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quietquasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial black hole mass),consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 agn.thus radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in thebiased halo clustering picture. using the sheth et al.(2001) formula for thelinear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is $\sim10^{13} h^{-1}m_\odot$, compared to $\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}m_\odot$ forradio-quiet quasar hosts at $z\sim 1.5$.
