hep-th;0311059	influence of super-horizon scales on cosmological observables generated  during inflation	using the techniques of out-of-equilibrium field theory, we study theinfluence on the properties of cosmological perturbations generated duringinflation on observable scales coming from fluctuations corresponding today toscales much bigger than the present hubble radius. we write the effectiveaction for the coarse-grained inflaton perturbations integrating out thesub-horizon modes, which manifest themselves as a colored noise and lead tomemory effects. using the simple model of a scalar field with cubicself-interactions evolving in a fixed de sitter background, we evaluate thetwo- and three-point correlation function on observable scales. our basicprocedure shows that perturbations do preserve some memory of thesuper-horizon-scale dynamics, in the form of scale-dependent imprints in thestatistical moments. in particular, we find a blue tilt of the power-spectrumon large scales, in agreement with the recent results of the wmap collaborationwhich show a suppression of the lower multipoles in the cosmic microwavebackground anisotropies, and a substantial enhancement of the intrinsicnon-gaussianity on large scales

0902.4204	weak lensing signal in unified dark matter models	weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for studying both the geometryand the dynamics of the universe. its power spectrum contains information onthe sources emitting photons and on the large--scale structures that thesehotons cross. we calculate the weak lensing cosmic convergence and shear powerspectra, in linear theory and limber's approximation, for two different classesof cosmological models: the standard \lambdacdm and unified dark matter (udm)models. the latter models attempt to solve the problems of the dark matter inthe dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters and of the late-time accelerationof the universe expansion by introducing a scalar field that mimics both darkmatter and dark energy. a crucial feature of the udm models is the speed ofsound c_\infty, that is the value of the sound speed at late times, on whichstructure formation depends. in this paper, we provide the predictions of theudm models for the weak lensing signal,with various values of c_\infty. weconsider both the cosmic microwave background and background galaxies atdifferent redshifts as sources for the weak lensing power spectra. we find thatthe power spectra in udm models are more sensitive to the variations ofc_\infty for sources located at low redshifts. moreover, we find that forc_\infty&gt;10^{-3} (in units of the speed of light), the udm weak lensingconvergence power spectrum c^{\kappa\kappa}(l) for background galaxies isstrongly suppressed with respect to the \lambdacdm spectrum, particularly atsmall angular scales l\gtrsim100.

0903.0894	cmb anisotropies at second order iii: bispectrum from products of the  first-order perturbations	we calculate the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)temperature anisotropies induced by the second-order fluctuations in theboltzmann equation. in this paper, which is one of a series of papers on thenumerical calculation of the bispectrum from the second-order fluctuations, weconsider the terms that are products of the first-order perturbations, andleave intrinsically second-order terms and perturbations in the recombinationhistory to the subsequent papers. we show that the bispectrum has the maximumsignal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordialbispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of thefirst-order terms in position space. however, detailed calculations show thattheir shapes are sufficiently different: the cross-correlation coefficientreaches 0.5 at the maximum multipole of l_{max}~ 200, and then weakens to 0.3at l_{max}~ 2000. the differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acousticoscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not beingscale-invariant. this implies that the contamination of the primordialbispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of thefirst-order terms) is small. the expected signal-to-noise ratio of the productsof the first-order terms is ~ 0.4 at l_{max}~ 2000 for a full-sky, cosmicvariance limited experiment. we therefore conclude that the products of thefirst-order terms may be safely ignored in the analysis of the future cmbexperiments. the expected contamination of the local-form f_{nl} isf^{local}_{nl}~ 0.9 at l_{max}~ 200, and f^{local}_{nl}~ 0.5 at l_{max}~ 2000.

0906.3232	directional variations of the non-gaussianity parameter f_nl	we investigate local variations of the primordial non-gaussianity parameterf_nl in the wmap data, looking for possible influence of foregroundcontamination in the full-sky estimate of f_nl. we first improve the needletbispectrum estimate in (rudjord et al. 2009) on the full-sky to f_nl= 73 +/- 31using the kq75 mask on the co-added v+w channel. we find no particular valuesof f_nl estimates close to the galactic plane and conclude that foregrounds areunlikely to affect the estimate of f_nl in the v and w bands even for thesmaller kq85 mask. in the q band however, we find unexpectedly high values off_nl in local estimates close to the galactic mask, as well as significantdiscrepancies between q band estimates and v/w band estimates. we thereforeconclude that the q band is too contaminated to be used for non-gaussianitystudies even with the larger kq75 mask. we further noted that the local f_nlestimates on the v+w channel are positive on all equatorial bands from thenorth to the south pole. the probability for this to happen in a universe withf_nl = 0 is less than one percent.

0906.4944	anisotropic bispectrum of curvature perturbations from primordial  non-abelian vector fields	we consider a primordial su(2) vector multiplet during inflation in modelswhere quantum fluctuations of vector fields are involved in producing thecurvature perturbation. recently, a lot of attention has been paid to modelspopulated by vector fields, given the interesting possibility of generatingsome level of statistical anisotropy in the cosmological perturbations. thescenario we propose is strongly motivated by the fact that, for non-abeliangauge fields, self-interactions are responsible for generating extra terms inthe cosmological correlation functions, which are naturally absent in theabelian case. we compute these extra contributions to the bispectrum of thecurvature perturbation, using the delta n formula and the schwinger-keldyshformalism. the primordial violation of rotational invariance (due to theintroduction of the su(2) gauge multiplet) leaves its imprint on thecorrelation functions introducing, as expected, some degree of statisticalanisotropy in our results. we calculate the non-gaussianity parameter f_{nl},proving that the new contributions derived from gauge bosons self-interactionscan be important, and in some cases the dominat ones. we study the shape of thebispectrum and we find that it turns out to peak in the local configuration,with an amplitude that is modulated by the preferred directions that breakstatistical isotropy.

0907.4753	the high redshift integrated sachs-wolfe effect	in this paper we rely on the quasar (qso) catalog of the sloan digital skysurvey data release six (sdss dr6) of about one million photometricallyselected qsos to compute the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect at highredshift, aiming at constraining the behavior of the expansion rate and thusthe behaviour of dark energy at those epochs. this unique sample significantlyextends previous catalogs to higher redshifts while retaining high efficiencyin the selection algorithm. we compute the auto-correlation function (acf) ofqso number density from which we extract the bias and the stellarcontamination. we then calculate the cross-correlation function (ccf) betweenqso number density and cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperaturefluctuations in different subsamples: at high z&gt;1.5 and low z&lt;1.5 redshifts andfor two different choices of qso in a conservative and in a more speculativeanalysis. we find an overall evidence for a cross-correlation different fromzero at the 2.7\sigma level, while this evidence drops to 1.5\sigma at z&gt;1.5.we focus on the capabilities of the isw to constrain the behaviour of the darkenergy component at high redshift both in the \lambdacdm and early dark energycosmologies, when the dark energy is substantially unconstrained byobservations. at present, the inclusion of the isw data results in a poorimprovement compared to the obtained constraints from other cosmologicaldatasets. we study the capabilities of future high-redshift qso survey and findthat the isw signal can improve the constraints on the most importantcosmological parameters derived from planck cmb data, including the highredshift dark energy abundance, by a factor \sim 1.5.

0909.5621	anisotropic trispectrum of curvature perturbations induced by primordial  non-abelian vector fields	motivated by the interest in models of the early universe where statisticalisotropy is broken and can be revealed in cosmological observations, weconsider an su(2) theory of gauge interactions in a single scalar fieldinflationary scenario. we calculate the trispectrum of curvature perturbations,as a natural follow up to a previous paper of ours, where we studied thebispectrum in the same kind of models. the choice of a non-abelian set-up turnsout to be very convenient: on one hand, gauge boson self-interactions can bevery interesting being responsible for extra non-trivial terms (naturallyabsent in the abelian case) appearing in the cosmological correlationfunctions; on the other hand, its results can be easily reduced to the u(1)case. as expected from the presence of the vector bosons, preferred spatialdirections arise and the trispectrum reveals anisotropic signatures. weevaluate its amplitude tau_{nl}, which receives contributions both from scalarand vector fields, and verify that, in a large subset of its parameter space,the latter contributions can be larger than the former. we carry out a shapeanalysis of the trispectrum; in particular we discuss, with some examples, howthe anisotropy parameters appearing in the analytic expression of thetrispectrum can modulate its profile and we show that the amplitude of theanisotropic part of the trispectrum can be of the same order of magnitude asthe isotropic part.

1004.1637	non-gaussian halo assembly bias	the strong dependence of the large-scale dark matter halo bias on the (local)non-gaussianity parameter, f_nl, offers a promising avenue towards constrainingprimordial non-gaussianity with large-scale structure surveys. in this paper,we present the first detection of the dependence of the non-gaussian halo biason halo formation history using n-body simulations. we also present an analyticderivation of the expected signal based on the extended press-schechterformalism. in excellent agreement with our analytic prediction, we find thatthe halo formation history-dependent contribution to the non-gaussian halo bias(which we call non-gaussian halo assembly bias) can be factorized in a formapproximately independent of redshift and halo mass. the correction to thenon-gaussian halo bias due to the halo formation history can be as large as100%, with a suppression of the signal for recently formed halos andenhancement for old halos. this could in principle be a problem for realisticgalaxy surveys if observational selection effects were to pick galaxiesoccupying only recently formed halos. current semi-analytic galaxy formationmodels, for example, imply an enhancement in the expected signal of ~23% and~48% for galaxies at z=1 selected by stellar mass and star formation rate,respectively.

1007.1969	constraining primordial non-gaussianity with high-redshift probes	we present an analysis of the constraints on the amplitude of primordialnon-gaussianity of local type described by the dimensionless parameter $f_{\rmnl}$. these constraints are set by the auto-correlation functions (acfs) of twolarge scale structure probes, the radio sources from nrao vla sky survey (nvss)and the quasar catalogue of sloan digital sky survey release six (sdss dr6qsos), as well as by their cross-correlation functions (ccfs) with the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature map (integrated sachs-wolfe effect).several systematic effects that may affect the observational estimates of theacfs and of the ccfs are investigated and conservatively accounted for. ourapproach exploits the large-scale scale-dependence of the non-gaussian halobias. the derived constraints on {$f_{\rm nl}$} coming from the nvss ccf andfrom the qso acf and ccf are weaker than those previously obtained from thenvss acf, but still consistent with them. finally, we obtain the constraints on$f_{\rm nl}=53\pm25$ ($1\,\sigma$) and $f_{\rm nl}=58\pm24$ ($1\,\sigma$) fromnvss data and sdss dr6 qso data, respectively.

0708.3786	temperature and polarization cmb maps from primordial non-gaussianities  of the local type	the forthcoming planck experiment will provide high sensitivity polarizationmeasurements that will allow us to further tighten the f_nl bounds from thetemperature data. monte carlo simulations of non-gaussian cmb maps have beenused as a fundamental tool to characterize non-gaussian signatures in the data,as they allow us to calibrate any statistical estimators and understand theeffect of systematics, foregrounds and other contaminants. we describe analgorithm to generate high-angular resolution simulations of non-gaussian cmbmaps in temperature and polarization. we consider non-gaussianities of thelocal type, for which the level of non-gaussianity is defined by thedimensionless parameter, f_nl. we then apply the temperature and polarizationfast cubic statistics recently developed by yadav et al. to a set ofnon-gaussian temperature and polarization simulations. we compare our resultsto theoretical expectations based on a fisher matrix analysis, test theunbiasedness of the estimator, and study the dependence of the error bars onf_nl. all our results are in very good agreement with theoretical predictions,thus confirming the reliability of both the simulation algorithm and the fastcubic temperature and polarization estimator.

0710.5505	light-cone averages in a swiss-cheese universe	we analyze a toy swiss-cheese cosmological model to study the averagingproblem. in our model, the cheese is the eds model and the holes areconstructed from a ltb solution. we study the propagation of photons in theswiss-cheese model, and find a phenomenological homogeneous model to describeobservables. following a fitting procedure based on light-cone averages, wefind that the the expansion scalar is unaffected by the inhomogeneities. thisis because of spherical symmetry. however, the light-cone average of thedensity as a function of redshift is affected by inhomogeneities. the effectarises because, as the universe evolves, a photon spends more and more time inthe (large) voids than in the (thin) high-density structures. thephenomenological homogeneous model describing the light-cone average of thedensity is similar to the concordance model. although the sole source in theswiss-cheese model is matter, the phenomenological homogeneous model behaves asif it has a dark-energy component. finally, we study how the equation of stateof the phenomenological model depends on the size of the inhomogeneities, andfind that the equation-of-state parameters w_0 and w_a follow a power-lawdependence with a scaling exponent equal to unity. that is, the equation ofstate depends linearly on the distance the photon travels through voids. weconclude that within our toy model, the holes must have a present size of about250 mpc to be able to mimic the concordance model.

1207.0500	testing gravity using large-scale redshift-space distortions	we use luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ii to test thecosmological structure growth in two alternatives to the standard lcdm+grcosmological model. we compare observed three-dimensional clustering in sdssdr7 with theoretical predictions for the standard vanilla lcdm+gr model,unified dark matter cosmologies and the normal branch dgp. in computing theexpected correlations in udm cosmologies, we derive a parameterized formula forthe growth factor in these models. for our analysis we apply the methodologytested in raccanelli et al. 2010 and use the measurements of samushia et al.2011, that account for survey geometry, non-linear and wide-angle effects andthe distribution of pair orientation. we show that the estimate of the growthrate is potentially degenerate with wide-angle effects, meaning that extremelyaccurate measurements of the growth rate on large scales will need to take sucheffects into account. we use measurements of the zeroth and second ordermoments of the correlation function from sdss dr7 data and the large suite ofdark matter simulations, and perform a likelihood analysis to constrain theparameters of the models. using information on the clustering up to r_max = 120mpc/h, and after marginalizing over the bias, we find, for udm models, a speedof sound &lt; 6.1e-4, and, for the ndgp model, a cross-over scale r_c &gt; 340 mpc,at 95% confidence level.

1210.3257	the anisotropic power spectrum and bispectrum in the f(phi) f^2  mechanism	a suitable coupling of the inflaton phi to a vector kinetic term f^2 givesfrozen and scale invariant vector perturbations. we compute the cosmologicalperturbations zeta that result from such coupling by taking into account theclassical vector field that unavoidably gets generated at large scales duringinflation. this generically results in a too anisotropic power spectrum ofzeta. specifically, the anisotropy exceeds the 1% level (10% level) ifinflation lasted ~5 e-folds (~50 e-folds) more than the minimal amount requiredto produce the cmb modes. this conclusion applies, among others, to theapplication of this mechanism for magnetogenesis, for anisotropic inflation,and for the generation of anisotropic perturbations at the end of inflationthrough a waterfall field coupled to the vector (in this case, the unavoidablecontribution that we obtain is effective all throughout inflation, and it isindependent of the waterfall field). for a tuned duration of inflation, a 1%(10%) anisotropy in the power spectrum corresponds to an anisotropic bispectrumwhich is enhanced like the local one in the squeezed limit, and with aneffective local f_{nl} ~3 (~30). more in general, a significant anisotropy ofthe perturbations may be a natural outcome of all models that sustain higherthan 0 spin fields during inflation.

1306.4160	anisotropy in solid inflation	in the model of solid / elastic inflation, inflation is driven by a sourcethat has the field theoretical description of a solid. to allow for prolongedslow roll inflation, the solid needs to be extremely insensitive to the spatialexpansion. we point out that, because of this property, the solid is alsorather inefficient in erasing anisotropic deformations of the geometry. thisallows for a prolonged inflationary anisotropic solution, providing the firstexample with standard gravity and scalar fields only which evades theconditions of the so called cosmic no-hair conjecture. we compute the curvatureperturbations on the anisotropic solution, and the correspondingphenomenological bound on the anisotropy. finally, we discuss the analogybetween this model and the f (phi) f^2 model, which also allows for anisotropicinflation thanks to a suitable coupling between the inflaton phi and a vectorfield. we remark that the bispectrum of the curvature perturbations in solidinflation is enhanced in the squeezed limit and presents a nontrivial angulardependence, as had previously been found for the f (phi) f^2 model.

1307.3483	the effective field theory of inflation models with sharp features	we describe models of single-field inflation with small and sharp stepfeatures in the potential (and sound speed) of the inflaton field, in thecontext of the effective field theory of inflation. this approach allows us tostudy the effects of features in the power-spectrum and in the bispectrum ofcurvature perturbations, from a model-independent point of view, byparametrizing the features directly with modified "slow-roll" parameters. wecan obtain a self-consistent power-spectrum, together with enhancednon-gaussianity, which grows with a quantity $\beta$ that parametrizes thesharpness of the step. with this treatment it is straightforward to generalizeand include features in other coefficients of the effective action of theinflaton field fluctuations. our conclusion in this case is that, excludingextrinsic curvature terms, the only interesting effects at the level of thebispectrum could arise from features in the first slow-roll parameter$\epsilon$ or in the speed of sound $c_s$. finally, we derive an upper bound onthe parameter $\beta$ from the consistency of the perturbative expansion of theaction for inflaton perturbations. this constraint can be used for anestimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, to show that the observable which ismost sensitive to features is the power-spectrum. this conclusion would changeif we consider the contemporary presence of a feature and a speed of sound $c_s&lt; 1$, as, in such a case, contributions from an oscillating foldedconfiguration can potentially make the bispectrum the leading observable forfeature models.

1307.5276	parametrized modified gravity constraints after planck	we constrain $f(r)$ and chameleon-type modified gravity in the framework ofthe berstchinger-zukin parametrization using the recent released planck data,including both cmb temperature power spectrum and lensing potential powerspectrum. some other external data sets are included, such as bao measurementsfrom the 6dfgs, sdss dr7 and boss dr9 surveys, hst $h_0$ measurement andsupernovae from union2.1 compilation. we also use wmap9yr data for consistencycheck and comparison. for $f(r)$ gravity, wmap9yr results can only give quite aloose constraint on the modified gravity parameter $b_0$, which is related tothe present value of the compton wavelength of the extra scalar degree offreedom, $b_0&lt;3.37$ at $95\% {\rm c.l.}$ we demonstrate that this constraintmainly comes from the late isw effect. with only planck cmb temperaturepower-spectrum data, we can improve the wmap9yr result by a factor $3.7$($b_0&lt;0.91$ at $95\% {\rm c.l.}$). if the planck lensing potentialpower-spectrum data are also taken into account, the constraint can be furtherstrenghtened by a factor $5.1$ ($b_0&lt;0.18$ at $95\% {\rm c.l.}$). this majorimprovement mainly comes from the small-scale lensing signal. furthermore, bao,hst and supernovae data could slightly improve the $b_0$ bound ($b_0&lt;0.12$ at$95\% {\rm c.l.}$).for the chameleon-type model, we find that the data setwhich we used cannot constrain the compton wavelength $b_0$ and the potentialindex $s$ of chameleon field, but can give a tight constraint on the parameter$\beta_1=1.043^{+0.163}_{-0.104}$ at $95\% {\rm c.l.}$ ($\beta_1=1$ in generalrelativity), which accounts for the non-minimal coupling between the chameleonfield and the matter component. in addition, we find that both modified gravitymodels we considered favor a relatively higher hubble parameter than theconcordance lcdm model in general relativity.

1404.2241	the bias of weighted dark matter halos from peak theory	we give an analytical form for the weighted correlation function of peaks ina gaussian random field. in a cosmological context, this approach strictlydescribes the formation bias and is the main result here. nevertheless, we showits validity and applicability to the evolved cosmological density field andhalo field, using gaussian random field realisations and dark matter n-bodynumerical simulations. using this result from peak theory we compute the biasof peaks (and dark matter halos) and show that it reproduces results from thesimulations at the ${\mathcal o}(10\%)$ level. our analytical formula for thebias predicts a scale-dependent bias with two characteristics: a broad bandshape which, however, is most affected by the choice of weighting scheme andevolution bias, and a more robust, narrow feature localised at the bao scale,an effect that is confirmed in simulations. this scale-dependent bias smoothsthe bao feature but, conveniently, does not move it. we provide a simpleanalytic formula to describe this effect. we envision that our analyticsolution will be of use for galaxy surveys that exploit galaxy clustering.

1411.2521	parity-violating and anisotropic correlations in pseudoscalar inflation	a pseudo-scalar inflaton field can have interesting phenomenologicalsignatures associated with parity violation. the existing analyses of thesesignatures typically assume statistical isotropy. in the present work weinstead investigate the possibility that a pseudo-scalar inflaton is coupled toa vector field carrying a small but non-negligible vacuum expectation value(vev) coherent over our hubble patch. we show that, in such case, correlatorsinvolving the primordial curvature perturbations and gravitational wavesviolate both statistical isotropy and parity symmetry. we compute the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) temperature anisotropies (t) and polarization (e/b)generated by these primordial modes. the cmb two-point correlation functionspresent distinct signals of broken rotational and parity invariance.specifically, we find non-vanishing tt, te, ee and bb correlators between$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2 = \ell_1 \pm 1$ multipoles, and non-vanishing tb and ebcorrelators between $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2 = \ell_1 \pm 2$ multipoles. suchsignatures are specific of the models under consideration and they cannot begenerated if one of parity and isotropy is preserved. as a specific example weconsider the simple case in which the vector field has just an "electric"background component decaying in the standard way as $a^{-2}$. in this case astrong scale-dependent quadrupolar modulation of the primordial power spectrais generated and we find that almost noiseless data of the large-scaletemperature and e-mode polarization anisotropies (like, e.g., the ones providedby wmap or $planck$) should be able to constrain the quadrupolar amplitudecoefficients $g_{2m}$ of the primordial scalar power spectrum (normalized atthe pivot scale comparable to the present horizon size $k_0^{-1} = 14~{\rmgpc}$) down to $g_{2m} = 30$ (68%cl).

1505.02193	parity-violating cmb correlators with non-decaying statistical  anisotropy	we examine the cosmological correlators induced by the simultaneous breakingof parity and of statistical isotropy, e.g., in presence of the coupling ${\call} = f(\phi) ( - \frac{1}{4} f^2 + \frac{\gamma}{4} f \tilde{f} )$ between theinflaton $\phi$ and a vector field with vacuum expectation value ${\bf a}$. fora suitably chosen function $f$, the energy in the vector field $\rho_{\rm a}$does not decay during inflation. this results in nearly scale-invariantsignatures of broken statistical isotropy and parity. specifically, we findthat the scalar-scalar correlator of primordial curvature perturbationsincludes a quadrupolar anisotropy, $p_\zeta ( {\bf k}) = p(k)[ 1 + g_* (\hat{\bf k} \cdot \hat{\bf a})^2]$, and a (angle-averaged) scalar bispectrumthat is a linear combination of the first $3$ legendre polynomials,$b_\zeta(k_1, k_2, k_3) = \sum_l c_l p_l (\hat{\bf k}_1 \cdot \hat{\bf k}_2)p(k_1) p(k_2) + 2~{\rm perms} $, with $c_0 : c_1 : c_2 = 2 : -3 : 1$ ($c_1 \neq0$ is a consequence of parity violation, corresponding to the constant $\gamma\neq 0$). the latter is one of the main results of this paper, which providesfor the first time a clear example of an inflationary model where anon-negligible $c_1$ contribution to the bispectrum is generated. thescalar-tensor and tensor-tensor correlators induce characteristic signatures inthe cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies (t) and polarization(e/b modes); namely, non-diagonal contributions to $\langle a_{\ell_1 m_1}a_{\ell_2 m_2}^* \rangle$, with $|\ell_1 - \ell_2| = 1$ in tt, te, ee and bb,and $|\ell_1 - \ell_2| = 2$ in tb and eb. the latest cmb bounds on the scalarobservables ($g_*$, $c_0$, $c_1$ and $c_2$), translate into the upper limit$\rho_{\rm a} / \rho_\phi \lesssim 10^{-9}$ at $\gamma=0$. we find that theupper limit on the vector energy density becomes much more stringent as$\gamma$ grows.

1506.08575	the two faces of mimetic horndeski gravity: disformal transformations  and lagrange multiplier	we show that very general scalar-tensor theories of gravity (including, e.g.,horndeski models) are generically invariant under disformal transformations.however there is a special subset, when the transformation is not invertible,that yields new equations of motion which are a generalization of the so-called"mimetic" dark matter theory recently introduced by chamsedinne and mukhanov.these conclusions hold true irrespective of whether the scalar field in theaction of the assumed scalar-tensor theory of gravity is the same or differentthan the scalar field involved in the transformation. the new equations ofmotion for our general mimetic theory can also be derived from an actioncontaining an additional lagrange multiplier field. the general mimeticscalar-tensor theory has the same number of derivatives in the equations ofmotion as the original scalar-tensor theory. as an application we show that thesimplest mimetic scalar-tensor model is able to mimic the cosmologicalbackground of a flat flrw model with a barotropic perfect fluid with anyconstant equation of state.

1507.05903	future constraints on angle-dependent non-gaussianity from large radio  surveys	we investigate how well future large-scale radio surveys could measuredifferent shapes of primordial non-gaussianity; in particular we focus onangle-dependent non-gaussianity arising from primordial anisotropic sources,whose bispectrum has an angle dependence between the three wavevectors that ischaracterized by legendre polynomials $\mathcal{p}_l$ and expansioncoefficients $c_l$. we provide forecasts for measurements of galaxy powerspectrum, finding that large-scale structure (lss) data could allowmeasurements of primordial non-gaussianity competitive or improving uponcurrent constraints set by cmb experiments, for all the shapes considered. weargue that the best constraints will come from the possibility to assignredshift information to radio galaxy surveys, and investigate a few possiblescenarios for the emu and ska surveys. a realistic (futuristic) modeling couldprovide constraints of $f_{\rm nl}^{\rm loc} \approx 1 (0.5)$ for the localshape, $f_{\rm nl}$ of $\mathcal{o}(10) (\mathcal{o}(1))$ for the orthogonal,equilateral and folded shapes, and $c_{l=1} \approx 80 (2)$, $c_{l=2} \approx400 (10)$ for angle-dependent non-gaussianity. the more futuristic forecastsshow the potential of lss analyses to considerably improve current constraintson non-gaussianity, and so on models of the primordial universe. finally, wefind the minimum requirements that would be needed to reach$\sigma(c_{l=1})=10$, which can be considered as a typical (lower) valuepredicted by some (inflationary) models.

astro-ph;0002240	projected bispectrum in spherical harmonics and its application to  angular galaxy catalogues	we present a theoretical and exact analysis of the bispectrum of projectedgalaxy catalogues. the result can be generalized to evaluate the projection inspherical harmonics of any 3d bispectrum and therefore has applications tocosmic microwave background and gravitational lensing studies. by expanding the2d distribution of galaxies on the sky in spherical harmonics, we show how the3-point function of the coefficients can be used in principle to determine thebias parameter of the galaxy sample. if this can be achieved, it would allow alifting of the degeneracy between the bias and the matter density parameter ofthe universe which occurs in linear analysis of 3d galaxy catalogues. inprevious papers we have shown how a similar analysis can be done in threedimensions, and we show here, through an error analysis and by implementing themethod on a simulated projected catalogue, that ongoing three-dimensionalgalaxy redshift surveys (even with all the additional uncertainties introducedby partial sky coverage, redshift-space distortions and smaller numbers) willdo far better than all-sky projected catalogues with similar selectionfunction.

astro-ph;0005543	tracking extended quintessence	we study the cosmological role of a tracking field $\phi$ in extendedquintessence scenarios (teq), where the dynamical vacuum energy driving theacceleration of the universe today is coupled with the ricci scalar, $r$, witha term of the form $f(\phi)r/2$, where $f(\phi) = 1/8\pig+\xi(\phi^{2}-\phi_{0}^{2})$. tracker solutions for these nmc models, withinverse power-law potentials, possess an initial enhancement of the scalarfield dynamics, named $r$-boost, caused by the ricci scalar in the klein-gordonequation. during this phase the field performs a "gravitational" slow rollingwhich we model analytically, with energy density scaling as $(1+z)^{2}$. weevolve linear perturbations in teq models assuming gaussian scale-invariantinitial spectrum. we obtain significant changes in the integrated sachs wolfeeffect and in the acoustic peaks locations on the cosmic microwave background,as well as in the turnover on the matter power spectrum. all these correctionsmay assume positive as well as negative values, depending on the sign of thenmc parameter $\xi$. we give analytical formulas describing all these effects.we show that they can be as large as $10 - 30%$ with respect to equivalentcosmological constant and ordinary tracking quintessence models, respecting allthe existing experimental constraints on scalar-tensor theories of gravity.these results demonstrate that the next decade data will provide deepconstraints on the nature of the dark energy in the universe, as well as thestructure of the theory of gravity.

astro-ph;0009006	constraining cosmological parameters with the clustering properties of  galaxy clusters in optical and x-ray bands	(abridged) we use a theoretical model to predict the clustering properties ofgalaxy clusters. our technique accounts for past light-cone effects on theobserved clustering and follows the non-linear evolution of the dark mattercorrelation function and cluster bias factor. a linear treatment ofredshift-space distortions is also included. we perform a maximum-likelihoodanalysis by comparing the theoretical predictions to a set of observationaldata, both in the optical (apm and edcc catalogues) and x-ray band (rass1bright sample, bcs, xbacs, reflex). in the framework of cdm models, we computethe constraints on cosmological parameters. our results show that x-ray dataare more powerful than optical ones, allowing smaller regions in the parameterspace. we find that the clustering properties of clusters are almostindependent of the matter density parameter and of the presence of acosmological constant, while they appear to be strongly dependent on the shapeparameter. using the x-ray data only, we obtain gamma~0.1 and 0.4&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.1for the einstein-de sitter model, while 0.14&lt;gamma&lt;0.22 and 0.6&lt;sigma_8&lt;1.3 foropen and flat models with omega_0m=0.3. finally, we use our model to makepredictions on the correlation length of galaxy clusters expected in futuresurveys. in particular, we show the results for an optical catalogue withcharacteristics similar to the eis project and for a very deep x-ray cataloguewith the characteristics of the xmm/lss survey. we find that clusters at highredshifts are expected to have larger a correlation length than local ones.

astro-ph;0109097	constraints on flat cosmologies with tracking quintessence from cosmic  microwave background observations	we constrain cosmological parameters in flat cosmologies with tracking darkenergy (or quintessence) using the existing data on cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropies. we perform a maximum likelihood analysis using combineddata from cobe/dmr, boomerang, dasi and maxima, obtaining estimates for thedark energy density $\omega_{q}$ and equation of state $w_{q}$, the physicalbaryon density $\omega_{b}h^{2}$, the scalar perturbation spectral index$n_{s}$, the ratio $r$ between the tensor and scalar perturbation amplitude (orthe tensor spectral index $n_{t}$). dark energy is found to be the dominantcosmological component $\omega_{q}=0.71^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, with equation ofstate $w_{q}=-0.82^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ (68% c.l.). our best fit value of thephysical baryon density is in good agreement with the primordialnucleosynthesis bound. we find no significant evidence for deviations fromscale-invariance, although a scalar spectral index slightly smaller than unityis marginally preferred. finally, we find that the contribution of cosmologicalgravitational waves is negligible. these results confirm that quintessence isslightly preferred with respect to ordinary cosmological constant by thepresent cmb data.

astro-ph;0109483	a reconstruction of the initial conditions of the universe by optimal  mass transportation	reconstructing the density fluctuations in the early universe that evolvedinto the distribution of galaxies we see today is a challenge of moderncosmology [ref.]. an accurate reconstruction would allow us to testcosmological models by simulating the evolution starting from the reconstructedstate and comparing it to the observations. several reconstruction techniqueshave been proposed [8 refs.], but they all suffer from lack of uniquenessbecause the velocities of galaxies are usually not known. here we show thatreconstruction can be reduced to a well-determined problem of optimisation, andpresent a specific algorithm that provides excellent agreement when testedagainst data from n-body simulations. by applying our algorithm to the newredshift surveys now under way [ref.], we will be able to recover reliably theproperties of the primeval fluctuation field of the local universe and todetermine accurately the peculiar velocities (deviations from the hubbleexpansion) and the true positions of many more galaxies than is feasible by anyother method.  a version of the paper with higher-quality figures is available athttp://www.obs-nice.fr/etc7/nature.pdf

astro-ph;0112161	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the bias of galaxies and the density of  the universe	we compute the bispectrum of the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and useit to measure the bias parameter of the galaxies. this parameter quantifies thestrength of clustering of the galaxies relative to the mass in the universe. byanalysing 80 million triangle configurations in the wavenumber range 0.1 &lt; k &lt;0.5 h/mpc (i.e. on scales roughly between 5 and 30 mpc/h) we find that thelinear bias parameter is consistent with unity: b_1=1.04 pm 0.11, and thequadratic (nonlinear) bias is consistent with zero: b_2=-0.054 pm 0.08. thus,at least on large scales, optically-selected galaxies do indeed trace theunderlying mass distribution. the bias parameter can be combined with the2dfgrs measurement of the redshift distortion parameter beta =omega_m^{0.6}/b_1, to yield omega_m = 0.27 pm 0.06 for the matter density ofthe universe, a result which is determined entirely from this survey,independently of other datasets. our measurement of the matter density of theuniverse should be interpreted as omega_m at the effective redshift of thesurvey (z=0.17).

astro-ph;0112456	predicting the clustering properties of galaxy clusters detectable for  the planck satellite	we study the clustering properties of the galaxy clusters detectable for theplanck satellite due to their thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. we take thepast light-cone effect and the redshift evolution of both the underlying darkmatter correlation function and the cluster bias factor into account. atheoretical mass-temperature relation allows us to convert the sensitivitylimit of a catalogue into a minimum mass for the dark matter haloes hosting theclusters. we confirm that the correlation length is an increasing function ofthe sensitivity limits defining the survey. using the expected characteristicsof the planck cluster catalogue, which will be a quite large and unbiasedsample, we predict the two-point correlation function and power spectrum fordifferent cosmological models. we show that the wide redshift distribution ofthe planck survey, will allow to constrain the cluster clustering properties upto z=1. the dependence of our results on the main cosmological parameters (thematter density parameter, the cosmological constant and the normalisation ofthe density power-spectrum) is extensively discussed. we find that the futureplanck clustering data place only mild constraints on the cosmologicalparameters, because the results depend on the physical characteristics of theintracluster medium, like the baryon fraction and the mass-temperaturerelation. once the cosmological model and the hubble constant are determined,the clustering data will allow a determination of the baryon fraction with anaccuracy of few per cent.

astro-ph;0306416	large-scale curvature perturbations with spatial and time variations of  the inflaton decay rate	we present a gauge-invariant formalism to study the evolution of thecurvature and entropy perturbations in the case in which spatial and timevariations of the inflaton decay rate into ordinary matter are present. duringthe reheating stage after inflation curvature perturbations can vary with timeon super-horizon scales sourced by a a gauge-invariant inflaton decay rateperturbation. we show that the latter is a function not only of the spatialvariations of the decay rate generated during inflation, as envisaged in arecently proposed scenario, but also of the time variation of the inflatondecay rate during reheating. if only the second source is present, the finalcurvature perturbation at the end of the reheating stage is proportional to thecurvature perturbation at the beginning of reheating with a coefficient ofproportionality which can be either smaller or larger than unity depending uponthe underlying physics governing the time variation of the inflaton decay rate.as a consequence, we show that the standard consistency relation between theamplitude of curvature perturbations, the amplitude of tensor perturbations andthe tensor spectral index of one-single field models of inflation is violatedand there is the possibility that the tensor-to-curvature amplitude ratio islarger than in the standard case.

astro-ph;0403480	approaching lambda without fine-tuning	we address the fine-tuning problem of dark energy cosmologies which ariseswhen the dark energy density needs to initially lie in a narrow range in orderfor its present value to be consistent with observations. as recently noticed,this problem becomes particularly severe in canonical quintessence scenarios,when trying to reproduce the behavior of a cosmological constant, i.e. when thedark energy equation of state w_q approaches -1: these models may be reconciledwith a large basin of attraction only by requiring a rapid evolution of w_q atlow reshifts, which is in conflict with the most recent estimates from type iasupernovae discovered by hubble space telescope. next, we focus onscalar-tensor theories of gravity, discussing the implications of a couplingbetween the quintessence scalar field and the ricci scalar (``extendedquintessence''). we show that, even if the equation of state today is veryclose to -1, by virtue of the scalar-tensor coupling the quintessencetrajectories still possess the attractive feature which allows to reach thepresent level of cosmic acceleration starting by a set of initial conditionswhich covers tens of orders of magnitude; this effect, entirely ofgravitational origin, represents a new important consequence of the possiblecoupling between dark energy and gravity.

astro-ph;0611126	the bispectrum of redshifted 21-cm fluctuations from the dark ages	brightness-temperature fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm background fromthe cosmic dark ages are generated by irregularities in the gas-densitydistribution and can then be used to determine the statistical properties ofdensity fluctuations in the early universe. we first derive the most generalexpansion of brightness-temperature fluctuations up to second order in terms ofall the possible sources of spatial fluctuations. we then focus on thethree-point statistics and compute the angular bispectrum ofbrightness-temperature fluctuations generated prior to the epoch of hydrogenreionization. for simplicity, we neglect redshift-space distortions. we findthat low-frequency radio experiments with arcmin angular resolution can easilydetect non-gaussianity produced by non-linear gravity with high signal-to-noiseratio. the bispectrum thus provides a unique test of the gravitationalinstability scenario for structure formation, and can be used to measure thecosmological parameters. detecting the signature of primordial non-gaussianityproduced during or right after an inflationary period is more challenging butstill possible. an ideal experiment limited by cosmic variance only and with anangular resolution of a few arcsec has the potential to detect primordialnon-gaussianity with a non-linearity parameter of f_nl ~ 1. additional sourcesof error as weak lensing and an imperfect foreground subtraction could severelyhamper the detection of primordial non-gaussianity which will benefit from theuse of optimal estimators combined with tomographic techniques.

astro-ph;9608004	redshift evolution of clustering	we discuss how the redshift dependence of the observed two-point correlationfunction of various classes of objects can be related to theoreticalpredictions. this relation involves first a calculation of the redshiftevolution of the underlying matter correlations. the next step is to relatefluctuations in mass to those of any particular class of cosmic objects; ingeneral terms, this means a model for the bias and how it evolves with cosmicepoch. only after these two effects have been quantified can one perform anappropriate convolution of the non-linearly evolved two-point correlationfunction of the objects with their redshift distribution to obtain the`observed' correlation function for a given sample. this convolution in itselftends to mask the effect of evolution by mixing amplitudes at differentredshifts. we develop a formalism which incorporates these requirements and, inparticular, a set of plausible models for the evolution of the bias factor. weapply this formalism to the spatial, angular and projected correlationfunctions from different samples of high-redshift objects, assuming a simplephenomenological model for the initial power-spectrum and an einstein-de sittercosmological model. we find that our model is roughly consistent with data onthe evolution of qso and galaxy clustering, but only if the effective degree ofbiasing is small. we discuss the differences between our analysis and othertheoretical studies of clustering evolution and argue that the dominant barrierto making definitive predictions is uncertainty about the appropriate form ofthe bias and its evolution with cosmic epoch.

astro-ph;9804259	gravitational wave background from a cosmological population of  core-collapse supernovae	we analyse the stochastic background of gravitational radiation emitted by acosmological population of core-collapse supernovae. the supernova rate as afunction of redshift is deduced from an observation-based determination of thestar formation rate density evolution. we then restrict our analysis to therange of progenitor masses leading to black hole collapse. in this case, themain features of the gravitational-wave emission spectra have been shown to be,to some extent, independent of the initial conditions and of the equation ofstate of the collapsing star, and to depend only on the black hole mass andangular momentum. we calculate the overall signal produced by the ensemble ofblack-hole collapses throughout the universe, assuming a flat cosmology withvanishing cosmological constant. within a wide range of parameter values, wefind that the spectral strain amplitude has a maximum at a few hundred hz withan amplitude between $10^{-28}$ and $10^{-27} hz^{-1/2}$; the correspondingclosure density, $\omega_{gw}$, has a maximum amplitude ranging between$10^{-11}$ and $10^{-10}$ in the frequency interval $\sim 1.5-2.5$ khz.contrary to previous claims, our observation-based determination leads to aduty cycle of order 0.01, making our stochastic backgound a non-continuous one.although the amplitude of our background is comparable to the sensitivity thatcan be reached by a pair of advanced ligo detectors, the characteristicshot-noise structure of the predicted signal might be in principle exploited todesign specific detection strategies.

astro-ph;9806028	large-scale bias in the universe ii: redshift space bispectrum	the determination of the density parameter $\omega_0$ from the large-scaledistribution of galaxies is one of the major goals of modern cosmology.however, if galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution,linear perturbation theory leads to a degeneracy between $\omega_0$ and thelinear bias parameter $b$, and the density parameter cannot be estimated. inmatarrese, verde &amp; heavens (1997) we developed a method based on second-orderperturbation theory to use the bispectrum to lift this degeneracy by measuringthe bias parameter in an $\omega_0$-independent way. the formalism wasdeveloped assuming that one has perfect information on the positions ofgalaxies in three dimensions. in galaxy redshift surveys, the three-dimensionalinformation is imperfect, because of the contaminating effects of peculiarvelocities, and the resulting clustering pattern in redshift space isdistorted. in this paper, we combine second-order perturbation theory with amodel for collapsed, virialised structures, to extend the method to redshiftspace, and demonstrate that the method should be successful in determining withreasonable accuracy the bias parameter from state-of-the-art surveys such asthe anglo-australian 2 degree field survey and the sloan digital sky survey.

astro-ph;9902290	measuring and modelling the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble  deep field north	(abridged) the evolution of galaxy clustering from z=0 to z=4.5 is analyzedusing the angular correlation function and the photometric redshiftdistribution of galaxies brighter than i_{ab}\le 28.5 in the hdf north. thereliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis ofthe available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes andinvestigating the effects of photometric errors. the redshift bins in which theclustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account theuncertainties of the photometric redshifts. the results show that the comovingcorrelation length has a small decrease in the range 0&lt;z&lt;1 followed by anincrease at higher z. we compare these results with the theoretical predictionsof a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of cdm. thecomparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that theobserved high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with aneffective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. assuming an einstein-desitter universe, we obtain b\simeq 2 at z=2 and b\simeq 5 at z=4. a comparisonof the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z=3 with those reported forlbg suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: moreabundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm ofhierarchical galaxy formation. the strong clustering and high bias measured atz=3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted forthe various cosmologies here considered. at z=4, the strong clustering observedin the hdf requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be alreadyformed by that epoch. this feature could be a discriminant test for thecosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.

astro-ph;9904282	the correlation function of x-ray galaxy clusters in the rass1 bright  sample	we analyse the spatial clustering properties of the rass1 bright sample, anx-ray flux-limited catalogue of galaxy clusters selected from the southern partof the $rosat$ all-sky survey. the two-point correlation function $\xi(r)$ ofthe whole sample is well fitted (in an einstein-de sitter model) by thepower-law $\xi=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, with $r_0= 21.5^{+3.4}_{-4.4} h^{-1}$ mpcand $\gamma=2.11^{+0.53}_{-0.56}$ (95.4 per cent confidence level with onefitting parameter). we use the rass1 bright sample as a first application of atheoretical model which aims at predicting the clustering properties of x-rayclusters in flux-limited surveys for different cosmological scenarios. themodel uses the theoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperatureand x-ray cluster luminosity, and fully accounts for the redshift evolution ofthe underlying dark matter clustering and cluster bias factor. the comparisonbetween observational results and theoretical predictions shows that theeinstein-de sitter models display too low a correlation length, while modelswith a matter density parameter $\omega_{\rm 0m}=0.3$ (with or without acosmological constant) are successful in reproducing the observed clustering.the dependence of the correlation length $r_0$ on the x-ray limiting flux andluminosity of the sample is generally consistent with the predictions of allour models. quantitative agreement is however only reached for $\omega_{\rm 0m}= 0.3$ models. the model presented here can be reliably applied to futuredeeper x-ray cluster surveys: the study of their clustering properties willprovide a useful complementary tool to the traditional cluster abundanceanalyses to constrain the cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;9906066	extended quintessence	we study quintessence cosmologies in the context of scalar-tensor theories ofgravity, where a scalar field $\phi$, assumed to provide most of the cosmicenergy density today, is non-minimally coupled to the ricci curvature scalar$r$. such `extended quintessence' cosmologies have the appealing feature thatthe same field causing the time (and space) variation of the cosmologicalconstant is the source of a varying newton's constant \`a lajordan-brans-dicke. we investigate here two classes of models, where thegravitational sector of the lagrangian is $f(\phi)r$ with $f(\phi)=\xi\phi^{2}$ (induced gravity, ig) and $f(\phi)=1+\xi\phi^{2}$ (non-minimalcoupling, nmc). as a first application of this idea we consider a specificmodel, where the quintessence field, $\phi$, obeying the simplest inverse powerpotential, has $\omega_{\phi}=0.6$ today, in the context of the cold darkmatter scenario, with scale-invariant adiabatic initial perturbations. we findthat, if $\xi\lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ for ig and $\xi\lesssim 5\times10^{-3}(\sqrt{g}\phi_{0})^{-1}$ for nmc ($\phi_{0}$ is the present quintessencevalue) our quintessence field satisfies the existing solar system experimentalconstraints. using linear perturbation theory we then obtain the polarizationand temperature anisotropy spectra of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) aswell as the matter power-spectrum. the perturbation behavior possessesdistinctive features, that we name `qr-effects', regarding acoustic peaklocation and height, late time integrated sachs-wolfe effect, as well asturnover and amplitude in the matter power spectrum. these features could bedetected in the upcoming observations on cmb and large-scale structure.

astro-ph;9909273	predicting the clustering of x-ray selected galaxy clusters in  flux-limited surveys	(abridged) we present a model to predict the clustering properties of x-rayclusters in flux-limited surveys. our technique correctly accounts for pastlight-cone effects on the observed clustering and follows the non-linearevolution in redshift of the underlying dm correlation function and clusterbias factor. the conversion of the limiting flux of a survey into thecorresponding minimum mass of the hosting dm haloes is obtained by usingtheoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature and x-rayluminosity of clusters. finally, our model is calibrated to reproduce theobserved cluster counts adopting a temperature-luminosity relation moderatelyevolving with redshift. we apply our technique to three existing catalogues:bcs, xbacs and reflex samples. moreover, we consider an example of possiblefuture space missions with fainter limiting flux. in general, we find that theamplitude of the spatial correlation function is a decreasing function of thelimiting flux and that the eds models always give smaller correlationamplitudes than open or flat models with low matter density parameter. in thecase of xbacs, the comparison with previous estimates of the observationalspatial correlation shows that only the predictions of models with omega_0m=0.3are in good agreement with the data, while the eds models have too low acorrelation strength. finally, we use our technique to discuss the beststrategy for future surveys. our results show that the choice of a wide areacatalogue, even with a brighter limiting flux, is preferable to a deeper, butwith smaller area, survey.

0810.4145	lensed cmb temperature and polarization maps from the millennium  simulation	we have constructed the first all-sky cmb temperature and polarization lensedmaps based on a high-resolution cosmological n-body simulation, the millenniumsimulation (ms). we have exploited the lensing potential map obtained using amap-making procedure (carbone et al. 2008) which integrates along theline-of-sight the ms dark matter distribution by stacking and randomizing thesimulation boxes up to $z = 127$, and which semi-analytically supplies thelarge-scale power in the angular lensing potential that is not correctlysampled by the n-body simulation. the lensed sky has been obtained by properlymodifying the latest version of the lenspix code (lewis 2005) to account forthe ms structures. we have also produced all-sky lensed maps of the so-called$\psi_e$ and $\psi_b$ potentials, which are directly related to the electricand magnetic types of polarization. the angular power spectra of the simulatedlensed temperature and polarization maps agree well with semi-analyticestimates up to $l &lt; 2500$, while on smaller scales we find a slight excess ofpower which we interpret as being due to non-linear clustering in the ms. wealso observe how non-linear lensing power in the polarised cmb is transferredto large angular scales by suitably misaligned modes in the cmb and the lensingpotential. this work is relevant in view of the future cmb probes, as a way toanalyse the lensed sky and disentangle the contribution from primordialgravitational waves.
