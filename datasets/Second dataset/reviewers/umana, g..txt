0901.2447	the dusty nebula surrounding hr car: a spitzer view	we present mid-ir observations of the galactic luminous blue variable (lbv)hr car and its associated nebula carried out with the spitzer space telescopeusing both irac and irs, as part of a gto program aimed to study stellar ejectafrom evolved stars. our observations reveal a rich mid-ir spectrum of the innernebula showing both solid state and atomic gas signatures. stronglow-excitation atomic fine structure lines such as $ 26.0 \mu$m [\ion{fe}{2}]and $ 34.8 \mu$m [\ion{si}{2}], indicate, for the first time, the presence of apdr in this object class. while the physics and chemistry of the low-excitationgas appears to be dominated by photodissociation, a possible contribution dueto shocks can be inferred from the evidence of gas phase fe abundanceenhancement. the presence of amorphous silicates, inferred from the observedcharacteristic broad feature at $10 \mu$m located in the inner nebula, suggeststhat dust has formed during the lbv outburst. this is in contrast with thedetection of crystalline dust in other probably more evolved galactic lbvs,which is similar to the crystalline dust observed in red supergiants. this hasbeen considered to be evidence of dust production during evolutionary phasesprior to the outburst.

0908.0638	spitzer detection of pah and silicate features in post-agb stars and  young planetary nebulae	we have observed a small sample of hot post-agb stars with the infrared arraycamera (irac) and the infrared spectrograph (irs) on-board the spitzer spacetelescope. the stars were selected from the literature on the basis of theirfar-infrared excess (i.e., post-agb candidates) and b spectral type (i.e.,close to the ionization of the envelope). the combination of our iracobservations with 2mass and iras catalog data, along with previous radioobservations in the cm range (where available) allowed us to model the seds ofour targets and find that in almost all of them at least two shells of dust atdifferent temperatures must be present, the hot dust component ranging up to1000 k. in several targets grains larger than 1 micron are needed to match thefar-ir data points. in particular, in iras 17423-1755 grains up to 100 micronmust be introduced to match the emission in the mm range.  we obtained irs spectra to identify the chemistry of the envelopes and foundthat more than 1/3 of the sources in our sample have mixed chemistry, showingboth mid-ir bands attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) andsilicate features. the analysis of the pah features indicates that thesemolecules are located in the outflows, far away from the central stars. weconsider the larger than expected percentage of mixed-chemistry targets as aselection bias towards stars with a disk or torus around them. our resultsstrengthen the current picture of mixed chemistry being due to the spatialsegregation of different dust populations in the envelopes.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0909.4680	7 mm continuum observations of ultra compact hii regions	ultra compact hii (uchii) regions are indicators of high-mass star formationsites and are distributed mainly in the galactic plane. we intend toinvestigate the possible contribution of the forthcoming esa planck mission tothe science of uchii regions by evaluating the possibility of detecting uchiisthat are bright in the radio regime. we performed new 7 mm observations of asample of uchii regions. for each source in our sample, the free-free radiospectrum has been modeled. along with far-ir measurements, our spectra allow usto estimate the flux densities of the sources in the millimeter andsub-millimeter bands. the possibility of planck detecting the selected sourcescan be assessed by comparing the estimated flux densities to the expectedsensitivity in each planck channel. we conclude that, in the case of thepresent sample, located close to the galactic center, planck will have a verylow detection rate. in contrast, assuming that our sample is representative ofthe whole uchii-region population, we derive a very high probability ofdetecting this kind of source with planck if located instead close to theanticenter.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1011.0685	from pre- to young planetary nebulae: radio continuum variability	searching for variability, we have observed a sample of hot post-agb starsand young planetary nebulae candidates with the very large array at 4.8, 8.4,and 22.4 ghz. the sources had been previously detected in the radio continuum,which is a proof that the central stars have started ionising theircircumstellar envelopes and an increase in radio flux with time can be expectedas a result of the progression of the ionisation front. such a behaviour hasbeen found in iras 18062+2410, whose radio modelling has allowed us todetermine that its ionised mass has increased from 10^{-4} to 3.3 10^{-4} m_sunin 8 years and its envelope has become optically thin at lower frequencies.  different temporal behaviours have been found for three other sources. iras17423-1755 has shown a possibly periodic pattern and an inversion of its radiospectral index, as expected from a varying stellar wind. we estimate that theradio flux arises from a very compact region around the central star (10^{15}cm) with an electron density of 2 10^6 cm^{-3}. iras 22568+6141 and 17516-2525have decreased their radio flux densities of about 10% per year over 4 years.  while a linear increase of the flux density with time points out to theprogression of the ionisation front in the envelope, decreases as well asquasi-periodic patterns may indicate the presence of unstable stellarwinds/jets or thick dusty envelopes absorbing ionising photons.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1106.6018	identification of three new proto-planetary nebulae exhibiting the  unidentified feature at 21 um	among its great findings, the iras mission showed the existence of anunidentified mid-ir feature around 21 um. since its discovery, this feature hasbeen detected in all c-rich proto-pne of intermediate spectral type (a-g) and -weakly - in a few pne and agb stars, but the nature of its carriers remainsunknown. in this paper, we show the detection of this feature in the spectra ofthree new stars transiting from the agb to the pn stage obtained with thespitzer space telescope. following a recent suggestion, we try to model theseds of our targets with amorphous carbon and feo, which might be responsiblefor the unidentified feature. the fit thus obtained is not completelysatisfactory, since the shape of the feature is not well matched. in theattempt to relate the unidentified feature to other dust features, we retrievedmid-ir spectra of all the 21-um sources currently known from iso and spitzeron-line archives and noticed a correlation between the flux emitted in the21-um feature and that emitted at 7 and 11 um (pah bands and hac broademission). such a correlation may point to a common nature of the carriers.

0710.0817	the radio lighthouse cu virginis: the spindown of a single main sequence  star	the fast rotating star cu virginis is a magnetic chemically peculiar starwith an oblique dipolar magnetic field. the continuum radio emission has beeninterpreted as gyrosyncrotron emission arising from a thin magnetosphericlayer. previous radio observations at 1.4 ghz showed that a 100% circularpolarized and highly directive emission component overlaps to the continuumemission two times per rotation, when the magnetic axis lies in the plane ofthe sky. this sort of radio lighthouse has been proposed to be due to cyclotronmaser emission generated above the magnetic pole and propagatingperpendicularly to the magnetic axis. observations carried out with theaustralia telescope compact array at 1.4 and 2.5 ghz one year after thisdiscovery show that this radio emission is still present, meaning that thephenomenon responsible for this process is steady on a timescale of years. theemitted radiation spans at least 1 ghz, being observed from 1.4 to 2.5 ghz. onthe light of recent results on the physics of the magnetosphere of this star,the possibility of plasma radiation is ruled out. the characteristics of thisradio lighthouse provides us a good marker of the rotation period, since thepeaks are visible at particular rotational phases. after one year, they show adelay of about 15 minutes. this is interpreted as a new abrupt spinning down ofthe star. among several possibilities, a quick emptying of the equatorialmagnetic belt after reaching the maximum density can account for the magnitudeof the breaking. the study of the coherent emission in stars like cu vir, aswell as in pre main sequence stars, can give important insight into the angularmomentum evolution in young stars. this is a promising field of investigationthat high sensitivity radio interferometers such as ska can exploit.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

0710.1142	millimeter observations of planetary nebulae: a contribution to the  planck pre-launch catalogue	we present new millimetre 43 ghz observations of a sample of radio-brightplanetary nebulae. such observations were carried out to have a gooddetermination of the high-frequency radio spectra of the sample in order toevaluate, together with far-ir measurements (iras), the fluxes emitted by theselected source in the millimetre and sub-millimetre band. this spectral range,even very important to constraint the physics of circumstellar environment, isstill far to be completely exploited. to estimate the millimetre andsub-millimetre fluxes, we extrapolated and summed together the ionized gas(free-free radio emission) and dust (thermal emission) contributions at thisfrequency range. by comparison of the derived flux densities to the foreseensensitivity we investigate the possible detection of such source for all thechannels of the forthcoming esa's planck mission. we conclude that almost 80%of our sample will be detected by planck, with the higher detection rate in thehigher frequency channels, where there is a good combination of brighterintrinsic flux from the sources and reduced extended galactic foregroundscontamination despite a worst instrumental sensitivity. from the new 43 ghz,combined with single-dish 5 ghz observations from the literature, we deriveradio spectral indexes, which are consistent with optically thin free-freenebula. this result indicates that the high frequency radio spectrum of oursample sources is dominated by thermal free-free and other emission, ifpresent, are negligible.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1303.5065	planck 2013 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). knowledge of the beam profiles is necessary for determiningthe transfer function to go from the observed to the actual sky anisotropypower spectrum. the main beam distortions affect the beam window function,complicating the reconstruction of the anisotropy power spectrum at highmultipoles, whereas the sidelobes affect the low and intermediate multipoles.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on the measurementsperformed during jupiter observations. by stacking the data from multiplejupiter transits, the main beam profiles are measured down to -20 db at 30 and44 ghz, and down to -25 db at 70 ghz. the main beam solid angles are determinedto better than 0.2% at each lfi frequency band. the planck pre-launch opticalmodel is conveniently tuned to characterize the main beams independently of anynoise effects. this approach provides an optical model whose beams fullyreproduce the measurements in the main beam region, but also allows adescription of the beams at power levels lower than can be achieved by thejupiter measurements themselves. the agreement between the simulated beams andthe measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequency band. the simulatedbeams are used for the computation of the window functions for the effectivebeams. the error budget for the window functions is estimated from both mainbeam and sidelobe contributions, and accounts for the radiometer bandshapes.the total uncertainties in the effective beam window functions are: 2% and 1.2%at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively (at $\ell \approx 600$), and 0.7% at 70 ghz (at$\ell \approx 1000$).

1303.5066	planck 2013 results. v. lfi calibration	we discuss the methods employed to photometrically calibrate the dataacquired by the low frequency instrument on planck. our calibration is based ona combination of the orbital dipole plus the solar dipole, caused respectivelyby the motion of the planck spacecraft with respect to the sun and by motion ofthe solar system with respect to the cmb rest frame. the latter provides asignal of a few mk with the same spectrum as the cmb anisotropies and isvisible throughout the mission. in this data release we rely on thecharacterization of the solar dipole as measured by wmap. we also presentpreliminary results (at 44ghz only) on the study of the orbital dipole, whichagree with the wmap value of the solar system speed within our uncertainties.we compute the calibration constant for each radiometer roughly once per hour,in order to keep track of changes in the detectors' gain. since non-idealitiesin the optical response of the beams proved to be important, we implemented afast convolution algorithm which considers the full beam response in estimatingthe signal generated by the dipole. moreover, in order to further reduce theimpact of residual systematics due to sidelobes, we estimated time variationsin the calibration constant of the 30ghz radiometers (the ones with the largestsidelobes) using the signal of a reference load. we have estimated thecalibration accuracy in two ways: we have run a set of simulations to assessthe impact of statistical errors and systematic effects in the instrument andin the calibration procedure, and we have performed a number of consistencychecks on the data and on the brightness temperature of jupiter. calibrationerrors for this data release are expected to be about 0.6% at 44 and 70 ghz,and 0.8% at 30 ghz.

1303.5068	planck 2013 results. vii. hfi time response and beams	this paper characterizes the effective beams,the effective beam windowfunctions and the associated errors for the planck hfi detectors. the effectivebeam is the angular response including the effect of the optics,detectors,dataprocessing and the scan strategy. the window function is the representation ofthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiasedmeasurement of the cmb angular power spectrum. the hfi is a scanning instrumentand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of thetelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data anddeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) themerging of several surveys to produce maps. the time response functions aremeasured using observations of jupiter and saturn and by minimizing surveydifference residuals. the scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angularresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of mars. themain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each hfi frequencyband. observations of jupiter and saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) toabout 0.1% of the total solid angle. time response residuals remain as longtails in the scanning beams, but contribute less than 0.1% of the total. thebias and uncertainty in the beam products are estimated using ensembles ofsimulated planet observations that include the impact of instrumental noise andknown systematic effects.the correlation structure of these ensembles iswell-described by five error eigenmodes that are sub-dominant to samplevariance and instrumental noise in the harmonic domain. a suite of consistencytests provide confidence that the error model represents a sufficientdescription of the data. the total error in the effective beam window functionsis below 1% at 100ghz up to ell~1500$,and below 0.5% at 143 and 217ghz up to~2000.

1303.5070	planck 2013 results. ix. hfi spectral response	the planck high frequency instrument (hfi) spectral response was determinedthrough a series of ground based tests conducted with the hfi focal plane in acryogenic environment prior to launch. the main goal of the spectraltransmission tests was to measure the relative spectral response (includingout-of-band signal rejection) of all hfi detectors. this was determined bymeasuring the output of a continuously scanned fourier transform spectrometercoupled with all hfi detectors. as there is no on-board spectrometer withinhfi, the ground-based spectral response experiments provide the definitive dataset for the relative spectral calibration of the hfi. the spectral response ofthe hfi is used in planck data analysis and component separation, this includesextraction of co emission observed within planck bands, dust emission,sunyaev-zeldovich sources, and intensity to polarization leakage. the hfispectral response data have also been used to provide unit conversion andcolour correction analysis tools. verifications of the hfi spectral responsedata are provided through comparisons with photometric hfi flight data. thisvalidation includes use of hfi zodiacal emission observations to demonstrateout-of-band spectral signal rejection better than 10^8. the accuracy of the hfirelative spectral response data is verified through comparison withcomplementary flight-data based unit conversion coefficients and colourcorrection coefficients. these coefficients include those based upon hfiobservations of co, dust, and sunyaev-zeldovich emission. general agreement isobserved between the ground-based spectral characterization of hfi andcorresponding in-flight observations, within the quoted uncertainty of each;explanations are provided for any discrepancies.

1303.5071	planck 2013 results x. energetic particle effects: characterization,  removal, and simulation	this paper presents the detection, interpretation and removal of the signalresulting from interactions of high energy particles with the planck highfrequency instrument (hfi). these interactions fall into two categories,heating the 0.1 k bolometer plate and glitches in each detector time stream.glitch shapes are not simple single pole exponential decays and fall into athree families. the glitch shape for each family has been characterizedempirically in flight data and removed from the detector time streams. thespectrum of the count rate/unit energy is computed for each family and acorrespondence to where on the detector the particle hit is made. most of thedetected glitches are from galactic protons incident on the si die framesupporting the micromachined bolometric detectors. at hfi, the particle flux is~ 5 per square cm and per second and is dominated by protons incident on thespacecraft with an energy &gt;39 mev, leading to a rate of typically one event persecond and per detector. different categories of glitches have differentsignature in timestreams. two of the glitch types have a low amplitudecomponent that decays over nearly 1 second. this component produces an excessnoise if not properly removed from the time ordered data. we have used a glitchdetection and subtraction method based on the joint fit of populationtemplates. the application of this novel glitch removal method removes excessnoise from glitches. using realistic simulations, we find this method does notintroduce signal bias.

1303.5072	planck 2013 results. xii. component separation	planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bandsbetween 30 and 857 ghz. these observations allow robust reconstruction of theprimordial cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations overnearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on galactic foregrounds. thispaper describes the component separation framework adopted by planck. we testfour foreground-cleaned cmb maps derived using qualitatively differentcomponent separation algorithms. the quality of our reconstructions isevaluated through detailed simulations and internal comparisons, and shownthrough various tests to be internally consistent and robust for cmb powerspectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. the parameterconstraints on lambdacdm cosmologies derived from these maps are consistentwith those presented in the cross-spectrum based planck likelihood analysis. wechoose two of the cmb maps for specific scientific goals. we also present mapsand frequency spectra of the galactic low-frequency, co, and thermal dustemission. the component maps are found to provide a faithful representation ofthe sky, as evaluated by simulations. for the low-frequency component, thespectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about beta = -4 to -2.considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequencycomponents, the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta &lt;-3.2) with strong anomalous microwave emission, corresponding to a spinningdust spectrum peaking below 20 ghz, a flat index of beta &gt; -2.3 with strongfree-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5076	planck 2013 results. xvi. cosmological parameters	we present the first results based on planck measurements of the cmbtemperature and lensing-potential power spectra. the planck spectra at highmultipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flatsix-parameter lcdm cosmology. in this model planck data determine thecosmological parameters to high precision. we find a low value of the hubbleconstant, h0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/mpc and a high value of the matter densityparameter, omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreementwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) surveys. includingcurvature, we find that the universe is consistent with spatial flatness topercent-level precision using planck cmb data alone. we present results from ananalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data setsin addition to planck and high-resolution cmb data. none of these models arefavoured significantly over standard lcdm. the deviation of the scalar spectralindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changesin the matter content of the universe. we find a 95% upper limit of r&lt;0.11 onthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. there is no evidence for additional neutrino-likerelativistic particles. using bao and cmb data, we find n_eff=3.30+/-0.27 forthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of0.23 ev for the summed neutrino mass. our results are in excellent agreementwith big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of n_eff=3.046. we find noevidence for dynamical dark energy. despite the success of the standard lcdmmodel, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the cmb power spectrum atlow multipoles, as noted previously by the wmap team. while not of decisivesignificance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis ofthe planck temperature data.

1303.5077	planck 2013 results. xvii. gravitational lensing by large-scale  structure	on the arcminute angular scales probed by planck, the cmb anisotropies aregently perturbed by gravitational lensing. here we present a detailed study ofthis effect, detecting lensing independently in the 100, 143, and 217ghzfrequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. we usethe temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a(noisy) map of the cmb lensing potential, which provides an integrated measureof the mass distribution back to the cmb last-scattering surface. our lensingpotential map is significantly correlated with other tracers of mass, a factwhich we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scalestructure. we estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, findinggenerally good agreement with expectations from the best-fitting lcdm model forthe planck temperature power spectrum, showing that this measurement at z=1100correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time structureswhich source the lensing potential. when combined with the temperature powerspectrum, our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameterconstraints; it improves cmb-alone constraints on curvature by a factor of twoand also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the primordialperturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing ameasurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent oflarge-scale polarization data. discarding scale information, our measurementcorresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude of the lensing potential powerspectrum, or a 2% constraint on the rms amplitude of matter fluctuations atz~2.

1303.5079	planck 2013 results. xix. the integrated sachs-wolfe effect	based on cmb maps from the 2013 planck mission data release, this paperpresents the detection of the isw effect, i.e., the correlation between the cmband large-scale evolving gravitational potentials. the significance ofdetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. weinvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previousstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) correlation of the cmb with theplanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). thisdetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation betweenlensing and the isw effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)cross-correlation with tracers of lss, yielding around 3 sigma significance,based on a combination of radio (nvss) and optical (sdss) data. (iii) aperturephotometry on stacked cmb fields at the locations of known large-scalestructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously exploredcatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared toexpectations. more recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging fromnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale andamplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected fromnumerical simulations within lcmd. where they can be compared, thesemeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from wmap, which hadalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance. planck's broaderfrequency coverage confirms that the signal is achromatic, bolstering the casefor isw detection. as a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure tofilter the cmb data, presenting maps of the isw temperature perturbation. theseresults provide complementary and independent evidence for the existence of adark energy component that governs the current accelerated expansion of theuniverse.

1303.5080	planck 2013 results. xx. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster counts	we present constraints on cosmological parameters using number counts as afunction of redshift for a sub-sample of 189 galaxy clusters from the planck sz(psz) catalogue. the psz is selected through the signature of thesunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect, and the sub-sample used here has asignal-to-noise threshold of seven, with each object confirmed as a cluster andall but one with a redshift estimate. we discuss the completeness of the sampleand our construction of a likelihood analysis. using a relation between mass$m$ and sz signal $y$ calibrated to x-ray measurements, we derive constraintson the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density parameter$\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a flat $\lambda$cdm model. we test the robustness ofour estimates and find that possible biases in the $y$--$m$ relation and thehalo mass function are larger than the statistical uncertainties from thecluster sample. assuming the x-ray determined mass to be biased low relative tothe true mass by between zero and 30%, motivated by comparison of the observedmass scaling relations to those from a set of numerical simulations, we findthat $\sigma_8=0.75\pm 0.03$, $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29\pm 0.02$, and$\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3} = 0.764 \pm 0.025$. the value of$\sigma_8$ is degenerate with the mass bias; if the latter is fixed to a valueof 20% we find $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.27)^{0.3}=0.78\pm 0.01$ and atighter one-dimensional range $\sigma_8=0.77\pm 0.02$. we find that the largervalues of $\sigma_8$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ preferred by planck'smeasurements of the primary cmb anisotropies can be accommodated by a mass biasof about 40%. alternatively, consistency with the primary cmb constraints canbe achieved by inclusion of processes that suppress power on small scalesrelative to the $\lambda$cdm model, such as a component of massive neutrinos(abridged).

1303.5081	planck 2013 results. xxi. all-sky compton parameter power spectrum and  high-order statistics	we have constructed the first all-sky map of the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich(tsz) effect by applying specifically tailored component separation algorithmsto the 100 to 857 ghz frequency channel maps from the planck survey. these mapsshow an obvious galaxy cluster tsz signal that is well matched with blindlydetected clusters in the planck sz catalogue. to characterize the signal in thetsz map we have computed its angular power spectrum.  at large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 60$), the major foreground contaminant isthe diffuse thermal dust emission. at small angular scales ($\ell &gt; 500$) theclustered cosmic infrared background (cib) and residual point sources are themajor contaminants.  these foregrounds are carefully modelled and subtracted.  we measure the tsz power spectrum in angular scales, $0.17^{\circ} \lesssim\theta \lesssim 3.0^{\circ}$, that were previously unexplored. the measured tszpower spectrum is consistent with that expected from the planck catalogue of szsources, with additional clear evidence of signal from unresolved clusters and,potentially, diffuse warm baryons.  we use the tsz power spectrum to obtain the following cosmologicalconstraints:  $\sigma_8(\omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.28)^{3.2/8.1}=0.784 \pm 0.016 (68% c.l.).  marginalized band-powers of the planck tsz power spectrum and the best-fitmodel are given.  the non-gaussianity of the compton parameter map is further characterized bycomputing its 1d probability distribution function and its bispectrum. theseare used to place additional independent constraints on $\sigma_{8}$.

1303.5089	planck 2013 results. xxix. planck catalogue of sunyaev-zeldovich sources	we describe the all-sky planck catalogue of clusters and cluster candidatesderived from sunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect detections using the first 15.5months of planck satellite observations. the catalogue contains 1227 entries,making it over six times the size of the planck early sz (esz) sample and thelargest sz-selected catalogue to date. it contains 861 confirmed clusters, ofwhich 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-upobservations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. the remaining366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into threeclasses according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be trueclusters. the planck sz catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue,with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from(0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}msun. confirmation of cluster candidates through comparisonwith existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is thestatistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness andstatistical reliability. the outputs of the validation process are provided asadditional information. this gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 clusterredshifts, and for all these planck clusters we also include a mass estimatedfrom a newly-proposed sz-mass proxy. a refined measure of the sz comptonparameter for the clusters with x-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an x-rayflux for all the planck clusters not previously detected in x-ray surveys.

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1312.5446	planck intermediate results. xvii. emission of dust in the diffuse  interstellar medium from the far-infrared to microwave frequencies	the dust-hi correlation is used to characterize the emission properties ofdust in the diffuse interstellar medium. we cross-correlate sky maps fromplanck, wmap, and dirbe, at 17 frequencies from 23 to 3000 ghz, with the parkessurvey of the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen, over a contiguousarea of 7500 deg$^2$ centred on the southern galactic pole. our analysis yieldsfour specific results. (1) the dust temperature is observed to beanti-correlated with the dust emissivity and opacity. we interpret this resultas evidence for dust evolution within the diffuse ism. the mean dust opacity ismeasured to be $(7.1 \pm 0.6) 10^{-27} cm^2/h \times (\nu/353\,ghz)^{1.53\pm0.03}$ for $100 &lt; \nu &lt;353$ghz. (2) we map the spectral index ofdust emission at millimetre wavelengths, which is remarkably constant at$\beta_{mm} = 1.51\pm 0.13$. we compare it with the far infrared spectral indexbeta_fir derived from greybody fits at higher frequencies, and find asystematic difference, $\beta_{mm}-\beta_{fir} = -0.15$, which suggests thatthe dust sed flattens at $\nu &lt; 353\,$ghz. (3) we present spectral fits of themicrowave emission correlated with hi from 23 to 353 ghz, which separate dustand anomalous microwave emission. the flattening of the dust sed can beaccounted for with an additional component with a blackbody spectrum, whichaccounts for $(26 \pm 6)$% of the dust emission at 100 ghz and could representmagnetic dipole emission. alternatively, it could account for an increasingcontribution of carbon dust, or a flattening of the emissivity of amorphoussilicates, at millimetre wavelengths. these interpretations make differentpredictions for the dust polarization sed. (4) we identify a galacticcontribution to the residuals of the dust-hi correlation, which we model withvariations of the dust emissivity on angular scales smaller than that of ourcorrelation analysis.

1312.7086	spitzer observations of a circumstellar nebula around the candidate  luminous blue variable mwc 930	mwc 930 is a star just ~2{\deg} above the galactic plane whose nature is notclear and that has not been studied in detail so far. while a post-asymptoticgiant branch (agb) classification was proposed in the past, studies of itsoptical spectrum and photometry pointed toward strong variability, thereforethe object was reclassified as a luminous blue variable (lbv) candidate. lbvstypically undergo phases of strong mass loss in the form of eruptions that cancreate shells of ejecta around the star. our goal is to search for the presenceof such a circumstellar nebula in mwc 930 and investigate its properties. to doso, we make use of space-based infrared data from our spitzer campaignperformed with the infrared array camera (irac) and the infrared spectrograph(irs) as well as data from optical and infrared (ir) surveys. in our spitzerimages, we clearly detect an extended shell around mwc 930 at wavelengthslonger than 5 um. the mid-infrared spectrum is dominated by the central starand mostly shows forbidden lines of [feii], with an underlying continuum thatdecreases with wavelength up to ~15 um and then inverts its slope, displaying asecond peak around 60 um, evidence for cold dust grains formed in a pasteruption. by modeling the sed, we identify two central components, besides thestar and the outer shell. these extra sources of radiation are interpreted asmaterial close to the central star, maybe due to a recent ejection. features ofc-bearing molecules or grains are not detected.

1402.2983	the candidate luminous blue variable g79.29+0.46: a comprehensive study  of its ejecta through a multiwavelength analysis	we present a multiwavelength analysis of the nebula around the candidateluminous blue variable g79.29+0.46. the study is based on our radioobservations performed at the expanded very large array and at the green banktelescope and on archival infrared datasets, including recent images obtainedby the herschel space observatory. we confirm that the radio central object ischaracterized by a stellar wind and derive a current mass-loss rate of about1.4x10-6 msun yr-1. we find the presence of a dusty compact envelope close tothe star, with a temperature between 40 and 1200 k. we estimate for the outerejecta an ionised gas mass of 1.51 msun and a warm (60--85 k) dust mass of 0.02msun. diagnostics of the far-infrared spectra indicate the presence of aphoto-dissociation region around the ionised gas. finally, we model the nebulawith the photo-ionization code cloudy, using as input parameters thoseestimated from our analysis. we find for the central star a luminosity of10^5.4 lsun and an effective temperature of 20.4 kk.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0872	planck intermediate results. xx. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust with simulations of mhd turbulence	polarized emission observed by planck hfi at 353 ghz towards a sample ofnearby fields is presented, focusing on the statistics of polarizationfractions $p$ and angles $\psi$. the polarization fractions and columndensities in these nearby fields are representative of the range of valuesobtained over the whole sky. we find that: (i) the largest polarizationfractions are reached in the most diffuse fields; (ii) the maximum polarizationfraction $p_\mathrm{max}$ decreases with column density $n_\mathrm{h}$ in themore opaque fields with $n_\mathrm{h} &gt; 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$; and (iii)the polarization fraction along a given line of sight is correlated with thelocal spatial coherence of the polarization angle. these observations arecompared to polarized emission maps computed in simulations of anisotropicmagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence in which we assume a uniform intrinsicpolarization fraction of the dust grains. we find that an estimate of thisparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction$p_\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered onlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. this emphasizes the impactof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. thedecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecularclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentiallydue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation ofvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such ananti-correlation. in the simulations, polarization fractions are also found toanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\mathcal{s}$.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.6728	planck intermediate results. xxxii. the relative orientation between the  magnetic field and structures traced by interstellar dust	the role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structuresobserved in the interstellar medium (ism) is a debated topic. the planckall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353ghz provide therequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation betweenthe structures of the galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, bothin the diffuse ism and in molecular clouds. the data reveal structures, orridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the stokes q and/or u maps.we focus on structures at intermediate and high galactic latitudes with columndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. we measure the magnetic fieldorientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present analgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensitymap. we use analytical models to account for projection effects. comparingpolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratiobetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magneticfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. we find thatthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on thestructures. this trend becomes more striking for increasing polarizationfraction and decreasing column density. we interpret the increase of alignmentwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. thedecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss ofcorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. inmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. we discuss our results inthe context of models and mhd simulations, which describe the formation ofstructures in the magnetized ism.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1502.01582	planck 2015 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the european space agency's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the earlyuniverse and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14~may 2009 and scanned themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12~august 2009 and23~october 2013. in february~2015, esa and the planck collaboration releasedthe second set of cosmology products based on data from the entire planckmission, including both temperature and polarization, along with a set ofscientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. thispaper gives an overview of the main characteristics of the data and the dataproducts in the release, as well as the associated cosmological andastrophysical science results and papers. the science products include maps ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb), the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect,and diffuse foregrounds in temperature and polarization, catalogues of compactgalactic and extragalactic sources (including separate catalogues ofsunyaev-zeldovich clusters and galactic cold clumps), and extensive simulationsof signals and noise used in assessing the performance of the analysis methodsand assessment of uncertainties. the likelihood code used to assesscosmological models against the planck data are described, as well as a cmblensing likelihood. scientific results include cosmological parameters derivingfrom cmb power spectra, gravitational lensing, and cluster counts, as well asconstraints on inflation, non-gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, darkenergy, and modified gravity.

1502.01584	planck 2015 results. iv. low frequency instrument beams and window  functions	this paper presents the characterization of the in-flight beams, the beamwindow functions, and the associated uncertainties for the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). the structure of the paper is similar to that presented inthe 2013 planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalizationand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.the in-flight assessment of the lfi main beams relies on measurements performedduring observations of jupiter. by stacking data from seven jupiter transits,the main beam profiles are measured down to -25 db at 30 and 44 ghz, and downto -30 db at 70 ghz. it has been confirmed that the agreement between thesimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each lfi frequencyband (within the 20 db contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and70 ghz; 0.2% at 44 ghz). simulated polarized beams are used for the computationof the effective beam window functions. the error budget for the windowfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, andaccounts for the radiometer band shapes. the total uncertainties in theeffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 ghz, respectively(at $\ell \approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 ghz (at $\ell \approx 1000$).

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.01597	planck 2015 results. xxiv. cosmology from sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  counts	we present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from theplanck full mission data set. our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detectedvia their sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, andis more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 planck cluster cosmologysample. the counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatibleconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. taking advantage of thelarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution inredshift and signal-to-noise. we use mass estimates from two recent studies ofgravitational lensing of background galaxies by planck clusters to providepriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $1-b$. in addition, we use lensing ofcosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature fluctuations by planck clustersas a third independent constraint on this parameter. these various calibrationsimply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations invarying degrees of tension with those coming from planck analysis of primaryfluctuations in the cmb; for the lowest estimated values of $1-b$ the tensionis mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largestestimated value it remains substantial. we also examine constraints onextensions to the base flat $\lambda cdm$ model by combining the cluster andcmb constraints. the combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because itsimultaneously lowers the implied value of the hubble parameter, therebyexacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates.improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-levelto 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide astringent test of the base $\lambda cdm$ model.

1502.01598	planck 2015 results. xxvii. the second planck catalogue of  sunyaev-zeldovich sources	we present the all-sky planck catalogue of sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) sourcesdetected from the 29 month full-mission data. the catalogue (psz2) is thelargest sz-selected sample of galaxy clusters yet produced and the deepestall-sky catalogue of galaxy clusters. it contains 1653 detections, of which1203 are confirmed clusters with identified counterparts in external data-sets,and is the first sz-selected cluster survey containing &gt; $10^3$ confirmedclusters. we present a detailed analysis of the survey selection function interms of its completeness and statistical reliability, placing a lower limit of83% on the purity. using simulations, we find that the y5r500 estimates arerobust to pressure-profile variation and beam systematics, but accurateconversion to y500 requires. the use of prior information on the clusterextent. we describe the multi-wavelength search for counterparts in ancillarydata, which makes use of radio, microwave, infra-red, optical and x-raydata-sets, and which places emphasis on the robustness of the counterpartmatch. we discuss the physical properties of the new sample and identify apopulation of low-redshift x-ray under- luminous clusters revealed by szselection. these objects appear in optical and sz surveys with consistentproperties for their mass, but are almost absent from rosat x-ray selectedsamples.

1502.01599	planck 2015 results. xxviii. the planck catalogue of galactic cold  clumps	we present the planck catalogue of galactic cold clumps (pgcc), an all-skycatalogue of galactic cold clump candidates detected by planck. this catalogueis the full version of the early cold core (ecc) catalogue, which was madeavailable in 2011 with the early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) andcontained 915 high s/n sources. it is based on the planck 48 months missiondata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. the pgcccatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of galactic coldsources. the three highest planck bands (857, 545, 353 ghz) have been combinedwith iras data at 3 thz to perform a multi-frequency detection of sourcescolder than their local environment. after rejection of possible extragalacticcontaminants, the pgcc catalogue contains 13188 galactic sources spread acrossthe whole sky, i.e., from the galactic plane to high latitudes, following thespatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. the mediantemperature of pgcc sources lies between 13 and 14.5 k, depending on thequality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8to 20 k after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. usingseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as theirmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. the pgcc sources are locatedmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards thegalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.because of this diversity and because the pgcc catalogue contains sources invery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate theevolution from molecular clouds to cores. finally, the catalogue also includes54 additional sources located in the smc and lmc.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

1505.02779	planck intermediate results. xxxviii. e- and b-modes of dust  polarization from the magnetized filamentary structure of the interstellar  medium	the quest for a b-mode imprint from primordial gravity waves on thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) requires thecharacterization of foreground polarization from galactic dust. we present astatistical study of the filamentary structure of the 353 ghz planck stokesmaps at high galactic latitude, relevant to the study of dust emission as apolarized foreground to the cmb. we filter the intensity and polarization mapsto isolate filaments in the range of angular scales where the power asymmetrybetween e-modes and b-modes is observed. using the smoothed hessian major axisfilament finder, we identify 259 filaments at high galactic latitude, withlengths larger or equal to 2\deg\ (corresponding to 3.5 pc in length for atypical distance of 100 pc). these filaments show a preferred orientationparallel to the magnetic field projected onto the plane of the sky, derivedfrom their polarization angles. we present mean maps of the filaments in stokesi, q, u, e, and b, computed by stacking individual images rotated to align theorientations of the filaments. combining the stacked images and the histogramof relative orientations, we estimate the mean polarization fraction of thefilaments to be 11 %. furthermore, we show that the correlation between thefilaments and the magnetic field orientations may account for the e and basymmetry and the $c_{\ell}^{te}/c_{\ell}^{ee}$ ratio, reported in the powerspectra analysis of the planck 353 ghz polarization maps. future models of thedust foreground for cmb polarization studies will need to take into account theobserved correlation between the dust polarization and the structure ofinterstellar matter.

1505.08022	planck 2015 results. v. lfi calibration	we present a description of the pipeline used to calibrate the planck lowfrequency instrument (lfi) timelines into thermodynamic temperatures for theplanck 2015 data release, covering four years of uninterrupted operations. asin the 2013 data release, our calibrator is provided by the spin-synchronousmodulation of the cosmic microwave background dipole, but we now use theorbital component, rather than adopting the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) solar dipole. this allows our 2015 lfi analysis to provide anindependent solar dipole estimate, which is in excellent agreement with that ofhfi and within $1\sigma$ (0.3% in amplitude) of the wmap value. this 0.3% shiftin the peak-to-peak dipole temperature from wmap and a global overhaul of theiterative calibration code increases the overall level of the lfi maps by 0.45%(30 ghz), 0.64% (44 ghz), and 0.82% (70 ghz) in temperature with respect to the2013 planck data release, thus reducing the discrepancy with the power spectrummeasured by wmap. we estimate that the lfi calibration uncertainty is now atthe level of 0.20% for the 70 ghz map, 0.26% for the 44 ghz map, and 0.35% forthe 30 ghz map. we provide a detailed description of the impact of all thechanges implemented in the calibration since the previous data release.

1506.04531	scorpio: a deep survey of radio emission from the stellar life-cycle	radio emission has been detected in a broad variety of stellar objects fromall stages of stellar evolution. however, most of our knowledge originates fromtargeted observations of small samples, which are strongly biased to sourceswhich are peculiar at other wavelengths. in order to tackle this problem wehave conducted a deep 1.4 ghz survey by using the australian telescope compactarray (atca), following the same observing setup as that used for the australiatelescope large area survey (atlas) project, this time choosing a region moreappropriate for stellar work. in this paper, the scorpio project is presentedas well as results from the pilot experiment. the achieved rms is about 30 /ujyand the angular resolution ~10 arcsec. about six hundred of point-like sourceshave been extracted just from the pilot field. a very small percentage of themare classified in simbad or the nasa/ipac extragalactic database (ned). about80 % of the extracted sources are reported in one of the inspected cataloguesand 50 % of them appears to belong to a reddened stellar/galactic population.the evaluation of extragalactic contaminants is very difficult without furtherinvestigations. interesting results have been obtained for extended radiosources that fall in the scorpio field. many bubble-like structures have beenfound, some of which are classified at other wavelengths. however, for all ofthese sources, our project has provided us with images of unprecedentedsensitivity and angular resolution at 2.1 ghz.

1508.04171	planck intermediate results. xxxix. the planck list of high-redshift  source candidates	the planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,has a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,submillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in thehigh-redshift universe traced by their dust emission. a novel method, based ona component-separation procedure using a combination of planck and iras data,has been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectralenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857ghz at 5' resolution. a totalof 2151 planck high-z source candidates (the phz) have been detected in thecleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545ghz above 500mjy. embedded inthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-zcandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent withredshifts z&gt;2, assuming a dust temperature of 35k and a spectral index of 1.5.first follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed thatthis list consists of two distinct populations. a small fraction (around 3%) ofthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensedstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects(with flux density at 545ghz ranging from 350mjy up to 1jy) at redshift 2 to 4.however, the vast majority of the phz sources appear as overdensities of dustystar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z&gt;2, and may beconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. the phz provides an original sample,complementary to the planck sunyaev-zeldovich catalogue; by extending thepopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sourcesat z&gt;1.5, the phz may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. hence thephz opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,and the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.

1509.06555	planck 2015 results. xxiii. the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich effect--cosmic  infrared background correlation	we use planck data to detect the cross-correlation between the thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (tsz) effect and the infrared emission from the galaxies thatmake up the the cosmic infrared background (cib). we first perform a stackinganalysis towards planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. we detect infrared emissionproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that theinfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tsz effect. modelling theemission with a navarro--frenk--white profile, we find that the radial profileconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. this indicatesthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared fluxthan cluster-core galaxies. we also study the cross-correlation between tsz andcib anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on powerspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected inplanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tsz map built from planck frequency maps;and (iii) using cross-spectra between planck frequency maps. with the threedifferent methods, we detect the tsz-cib cross-power spectrum at significancelevels of (i) 6 $\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\sigma$. we model thetsz-cib cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with themeasurements. the amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducialmodel is $a_{\rm tsz-cib}= 1.2\pm0.3$. this result is consistent withpredictions for the tsz-cib cross-correlation assuming the best-fitcosmological model from planck 2015 results along with the tsz and cib scalingrelations.

1510.00134	searching for oh maser emission towards the mipsgal compact galactic  bubbles	we conducted radio observations searching for oh 18-cm maser emission from asample of 169 unclassified mipsgal compact galactic bubbles. these sources arethought to be the circumstellar envelopes of different kinds of evolved stars.our observations were aimed at shedding light on the nature of mipsgal bubbles,since their characterisation is a fundamental aid for the development ofaccurate physical models of stellar and galaxy evolution. the maser emission isobservatively linked to the last stages of the life of low- andintermediate-mass stars, which may constitute a significant fraction of themipsgal bubbles. in particular oh masers are usually observed towards post-agbstars. our observations were performed with the green bank telescope and, foreach source, produced spectra around the four oh 18-cm transitions. theobservations were compared with archive interferometer data in order to excludepossible contamination from nearby sources. the main result is that the ohmaser emission is not a common feature among the mipsgal bubbles, with only onecertain detection. we conclude that among the mipsgal bubbles the post-agbstars could be very rare.

1511.05156	planck intermediate results. xl. the sunyaev-zeldovich signal from the  virgo cluster	the virgo cluster is the largest sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) source in the sky,both in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. planck's wide angularscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow adetailed study of this large object through the sz effect. virgo is wellresolved by planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well withthe morphology observed from x-rays, but extends beyond the observed x-raysignal. we find a good agreement between the sz signal (or compton paranmeter,y_c) observed by planck and the expected signal inferred from x-rayobservations and simple analytical models. due to its proximity to us, the gasbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity byintegrating the sz signal over tens of square degrees. we study the signal inthe outskirts of virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrainedsimulation of the environment of virgo. planck data suggest that significantamounts of low-density plasma surround virgo out to twice the virial radius. wefind the sz signal in the outskirts of virgo to be consistent with a simplemodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assumingthat the temperature stays in the kev range beyond the virial radius. theobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallowpressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. this reservoir of gas atlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hotintergalactic medium. taking the lack of symmetry of virgo into account, wefind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of sz and x-ray data,in agreement with predictions.

0807.3684	radio continuum properties of young planetary nebulae	we have selected a small sample of post-agb stars in transition towards theplanetary nebula and present new very large array multi-frequency high-angularresolution radio observations of them. the multi-frequency data are used tocreate and model the targets' radio continuum spectra, proving that these starsstarted their evolution as very young planetary nebulae. in the optically thinrange, the slopes are compatible with the expected spectral index (-0.1). twotargets (iras 18062+2410 and 17423-1755) seem to be optically thick even athigh frequency, as observed in a handful of other post-agb stars in theliterature, while a third one (iras 20462+3416) shows a possible contributionfrom cold dust. in iras 18062+2410, where we have three observations spanning aperiod of four years, we detect an increase in its flux density, similar tothat observed in crl 618.  high-angular resolution imaging shows bipolar structures that may be due tocircumstellar tori, although a different hypothesis (i.e., jets) could alsoexplain the observations. further observations and monitoring of these sourceswill enable us to test the current evolutionary models of planetary nebulae.

astro-ph;0007097	coherent radio emission from the magnetic chemically peculiar star cu  virginis	radio observations of the magnetic chemically peculiar star cu vir, carriedout with the vla in three different days, show that the radio emission at 20 cmis characterized by a strong enhancement at particular rotational phases. thisradio emission is found to be right hand polarized with a degree ofpolarization close to 100 %. as common for this class of stars, the magneticaxis of cu vir is oblique with respect to the rotational axis. by comparing the20 cm radio light curve with the effective magnetic field available from theliterature, a coincidence of the main peaks of the radio emission with themagnetic nulls has been found. this happens when the magnetic axis lies in theplane of the sky. we suggest that the high degree of polarization, togetherwith the high directivity of the radiation, can be explained in terms ofcoherent radio emission. the data have been interpreted on the basis of theelectron cyclotron maser emission from electrons accelerated in current sheetsout of the alfven radius toward the stellar surface and eventually reflectedoutward by magnetic mirroring.

astro-ph;0109469	radio monitoring of a sample of x- and gamma-ray loud blazars	in this paper we present the results of a 4-year (1996 - 1999) radio fluxdensity monitoring program for a sample of x- and $\gamma$-ray loud blazars.our program started in january 1996 and was carried out on monthly basis at thefrequencies of 5 ghz and 8.4 ghz with the 32-m antennas located in medicina(bologna, italy) and noto (siracusa, italy). 22 ghz data collected in medicinafrom january 1996 to june 1997 will also be presented. the sample of selectedsources comprises most radio loud blazars with $\delta \ge -10^{\circ}$characterised by emission in the x- and $\gamma$-ray regimes, and targetsources for the bepposax x-ray mission. all sources in the sample, exceptj1653+397 (mkn 501), are variable during the four years of our monitoringprogram. we classified the type of variability in each source by means of astructure function analysis. we also computed th$\alpha_{5}^{8.4}$ for allepochs with nearly simultaneous observations ate spectral index and found that$\alpha_{5}^{8.4}$ starts flattening at the very beginning o f a radio flare,or flux density increase.

astro-ph;0402432	a three-dimensional model for the radio emission of magnetic chemically  peculiar stars	in this paper we present a three-dimensional numerical model for the radioemission of magnetic chemically peculiar stars, on the hypothesis thatenergetic electrons emit by the gyrosynchrotron mechanism. for this class ofradio stars, characterized by a mainly dipolar magnetic field whose axis istilted with respect to the rotational axis, the geometry of the magnetosphereand its deformation due to the stellar rotation are determined. the radioemitting region is determined by the physical conditions of the magnetosphereand of the stellar wind. free-free absorption by the thermal plasma trapped inthe inner magnetosphere is also considered. several free parameters areinvolved in the model, such as the size of the emitting region, the energyspectrum and the number density of the emitting electrons, and thecharacteristics of the plasma in the inner magnetosphere. by solving theequation of radiative transfer, along a path parallel to the line of sight, theradio brightness distribution and the total flux density as a function ofstellar rotation are computed. as the model is applied to simulate the observed5 ghz lightcurves of hd37479 and hd37017, several possible magnetosphereconfigurations are found. after simulations at other frequencies, in spite ofthe large number of parameters involved in the modeling, two solutions in thecase of hd37479 and only one solution in the case of hd37017 match the observedspectral indices. the results of our simulations agree with the magneticallyconfined wind-shock model in a rotating magnetosphere. the x-ray emission fromthe inner magnetosphere is also computed, and found to be consistent with theobservations.

astro-ph;0610395	stellar magnetosphere reconstruction from radio data. multi-frequency  vla observations and 3d-simulations of cu virginis	in order to fully understand the physical processes in the magnetospheres ofthe magnetic chemically peculiar stars, we performed multi-frequency radioobservations of cu virginis. the radio emission of this kind of stars arisesfrom the interaction between energetic electrons and magnetic field. the radiodata were acquired with the vla and cover the whole rotational period of cuvirginis. for each observed frequency the radio light curves of the total fluxdensity and fraction of circular polarization were fitted using athree-dimensional mcp magnetospheric model simulating the stellar radioemission as a function of the magnetospheric physical parameters. theobservations show a clear correlation between the radio emission and theorientation of the magnetosphere of this oblique rotator. radio emission isexplained as the result of the acceleration of the wind particles in thecurrent sheets just beyond the alfv\'en radius, that eventually return towardthe star following the magnetic field and emitting radiation by gyrosyncrotronmechanism. the accelerated electrons have a hard energetic spectrum($n(e)\propto e^{-2}$) and the acceleration process has an efficiency of about$10^{-3}$. the alfv\'en radius we determined is in the range of $12-17 r_\ast$and, for a dipolar field of 3000 gauss at the magnetic pole of the star, wedetermine a mass loss from the star of about $10^{-12}$ m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$.in the inner magnetosphere a detectable x-ray emission is expected.

astro-ph;0610399	a 1.2 mm mambo survey of post-agb stars	we performed a millimetric survey of a sample of 24 post-agb stars aimed tosearch for emission from circumstellar matter, in order to investigate thephysical properties of the outer parts of the envelopes. the observations wereconducted using the 37-channel max-planck millimeter bolometer array at the30-meter iram telescope. the continuum emission toward the detected sources wasused to quantify the mass of the emitting dust. we combined our observationswith data available in literature to construct the spectral energy distribution(sed) of the sources. when the observational data cover a spectral range wideenough, some properties of circumstellar envelopes were derived by comparisonwith spectra computed using a radiative transfer code. of the 24 objects in oursample, we detected millimetric continuum emission toward 11 sources. two othersources were detected at flux level close to 3$\sigma$. the derivedcircumstellar dust masses range between 0.4 and $24 \times 10^{-4}$m$_{\odot}$, but these results are affected from the uncertain about the sourcedistances. the parameters derived from the sed fits are consistent with thevalues characteristic for these kind of object. as confirmed from the fluxdensity extrapolated in the first light channels of the atacama largemillimetric array, such sources would be good targets for future highresolution mapping with the alma facility.
