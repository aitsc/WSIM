0904.0083	on the starting redshift for cosmological simulations: focusing on halo  properties	we systematically study the effects of varying the starting redshift z_i forcosmological simulations in the highly non-linear regime. our primary focuslies with the (individual) properties of dark matter halos -- namely the mass,spin, triaxiality, and concentration -- where we find that even substantialvariations in z_i leave only a small imprint, at least for the probed massrange m \in [10^{10}, 10^{13}] msun/h and when investigated at redshift z=0. wefurther compare simulations started by using the standard zel'dovichapproximation to runs based upon initial conditions produced with second orderlagrangian perturbation theory. here we observe the same phenomenon, i.e. thatdifferences in the studied (internal) properties of dark matter haloes arepractically undetectable. these findings are (for the probed mass range) inagreement with other work in the literature. we therefore conclude that thecommonly used technique for setting up cosmological simulations leads to stableresults at redshift z=0 for the mass, the spin parameter, the triaxiality, andthe concentration of dark matter haloes.

0904.1425	n-body simulations for testing the stability of triaxial galaxies in  mond	we perform a stability test of triaxial models in modified newtonian dynamics(mond) using n-body simulations. the triaxial models considered here havedensities that vary with $r^{-1}$ in the center and $r^{-4}$ at large radii.the total mass of the model varies from $10^8\msun$ to $10^{10}\msun$,representing the mass scale of dwarfs to medium-mass elliptical galaxies,respectively, from deep mond to quasi-newtonian gravity. we build triaxialgalaxy models using the schwarzschild technique, and evolve the systems for 200keplerian dynamical times (at the typical length scale of 1.0 kpc). we findthat the systems are virial overheating, and in quasi-equilibrium with therelaxation taking approximately 5 keplerian dynamical times (1.0 kpc). for allsystems, the change of the inertial (kinetic) energy is less than 10% (20%)after relaxation. however, the central profile of the model is flattened duringthe relaxation and the (overall) axis ratios change by roughly 10% within 200keplerian dynamical times (at 1.0kpc) in our simulations. we further find thatthe systems are stable once they reach the equilibrium state.

0908.3480	on the separation between baryonic and dark matter: evidence for phantom  dark matter?	the recent years have seen combined measurements of x-ray and (weak) lensingcontours for colliding galaxy clusters such as, for instance, the famous"bullet" cluster. these observations have revealed offsets in the peaks of thebaryonic and (dominant) gravitational matter component of order ~(100-200) kpc.such discrepancies are difficult to explain using modified theories for gravityother than dark matter. or are they not? here we use the concept of "phantomdark matter" that is based upon a newtonian interpretation of the mondiangravitational potential. we show that this idea is in fact capable of producingsubstantial offsets in idealistic density configurations, involving a uniformexternal field. however, when analysed in a mondian cosmological framework wededuce that the size (and probablity) of the effect is too small to explain theobserved offsets found in the most recent observations, at least in thesimplest incarnation of phantom dark matter as discussed here. the lensingcenters in merging galaxy clusters are likely very close to the centers of truemass even in a mondian cosmology. this gives the support to the idea thatneutrino-like non-collisional matter might be responsible for the observedoffsets of lensing and x-ray peaks.

0909.1916	the grouping, merging and survival of subhaloes in the simulated local  group	we use a simulation performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study a realistic local group-like object. weemploy this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of thepopulation of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may haveon the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. we focus on the processesof tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and groupingbefore infall. the tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition betweenthe phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occursat the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape oftheir mass function with redshift. although the satellites often form groups,they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. theinfall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiardistribution of the local group satellites, but only if it occurred recently.mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an earlystage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 gyr ago, when they are still outside thehost haloes. such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distantearly type milky way companions. once the subhaloes enter the host halo themergers become very rare.

0909.4423	constrained simulations of the local group: on the radial distribution  of substructures	we examine the properties of satellites found in high resolution simulationsof the local group. we use constrained simulations designed to reproduce themain dynamical features that characterize the local neighborhood, i.e. withintens of mpc around the local group (lg). specifically, a lg-like object isfound located within the 'correct' dynamical environment and consisting ofthree main objects which are associated with the milky way, m31 and m33. byrunning two simulations of this lg from identical initial conditions - one withand one without baryons modeled hydrodynamically - we can quantify the effectof gas physics on the $z=0$ population of subhaloes in an environment similarto our own. we find that above a certain mass cut, $m_{\rm sub} &gt;2\times10^{8}h^{-1} m_{\odot}$ subhaloes in hydrodynamic simulations are moreradially concentrated than those in simulations with out gas. this is caused bythe collapse of baryons into stars that typically sit in the central regions ofsubhaloes, making them denser. the increased central density of such a subhalo,results in less mass loss due to tidal stripping than the same subhalosimulated with only dark matter. the increased mass in hydrodynamic subhaloeswith respect to dark matter ones, causes dynamical friction to be moreeffective, dragging the subhalo towards the centre of the host. this results inthese subhaloes being effectively more radially concentrated then their darkmatter counterparts.

0912.1498	investigating the influence of magnetic fields upon structure formation  with amiga - a c code for cosmological magnetohydrodynamics	despite greatly improved observational methods, the presence of magneticfields at cosmological scales and their role in the process of large-scalestructure formation still remains unclear. in this paper we want to address thequestion how the presence of a hypothetical primordial magnetic field on largescales influences the cosmic structure formation in numerical simulations. as atool for carrying out such simulations, we present our new numerical codeamiga. it combines an n-body code with an eulerian grid-based solver for thefull set of mhd equations in order to conduct simulations of dark matter,baryons and magnetic fields in a self-consistent way in a fully cosmologicalsetting. our numerical scheme includes effective methodes to ensure propercapturing of shocks and highly supersonic flows and a divergence-free magneticfield. the high accuracy of the code is demonstrated by a number of numericaltests. we then present a series of cosmological mhd simulations and confirmthat, in order to have a significant effect on the distribution of matter onlarge scales, the primordial magnetic field strength would have to besignificantly higher than the current observational and theoreticalconstraints.

1002.2853	the impact of baryonic physics on the shape and radial alignment of  substructures in cosmological dark matter haloes	we use two simulations performed within the constrained local universesimulation (clues) project to study both the shape and radial alignment of (thedark matter component of) subhaloes; one of the simulations is a dark matteronly model while the other run includes all the relevant gas physics and starformation recipes. we find that the involvement of gas physics does not have astatistically significant effect on either property -- at least not for themost massive subhaloes considered in this study. however, we observe in bothsimulations including and excluding gasdynamics a (pronounced) evolution of thedark matter shapes of subhaloes as well as of the radial alignment signal sinceinfall time. further, this evolution is different when positioned in thecentral and outer regions of the host halo today; while subhaloes tend tobecome more aspherical in the central 50% of their host's virial radius, theradial alignment weakens in the central regime while strengthening in the outerparts. we confirm that this is due to tidal torquing and the fact thatsubhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.

1004.2929	boosting hierarchical structure formation with scalar-interacting dark  matter	we investigate the effect of long-range scalar interactions in dark matter(dm) models of cosmic structure formation with a particular focus on theformation times of haloes. utilising $n$-body simulations with $512^3$ dmparticles we show that in our models dark matter haloes form substantiallyearlier: tracing objects up to redshift $z\sim6$ we find that the formationtime, as characterised by the redshift $z_{1/2}$ at which the halo hasassembled half of its final mass, is gradually shifted from $z_{1/2}\approx1.83$ in the fiducial lcdm model to $z_{1/2}\approx 2.54$ in the most extremeself-interaction model. this is accompanied by a shift of the redshift thatmarks the transition between merger and steady accretion epochs from$z_{*}\approx 4.32$ in the \lcdm\ halos to $z_{*}\approx 6.39$ in our strongestinteraction model. in other words, the scalar-interacting model employed inthis work produces more structures at high redshifts, prolonging at the sametime the steady accretion phases. these effects taken together can help thelcdm model to account for a high redshift reionisation as indicated by the wmapdata and can alleviate issues related to the survival of the thin-diskdominated galaxies at low redshifts.

1010.1531	the preferred direction of infalling satellite galaxies in the local  group	using a high resolution dm simulation of the local group (lg), conductedwithin the framework of the constrained local universe simulation (clues)project, we investigate the nature of how satellites of the mw and m31 areaccreted. satellites of these galaxies are accreted anisotropically, enteringthe virial radius of their hosts from specific "spots" with respect to thelarge scale structure. furthermore, material which is tidally stripped fromthese satellites is also, at z=0, distributed anisotropically and ischaracterized by an ellipsoidal sub-volume embedded in the halo. the angularpattern created by the locus of satellite infall points and the projectedstripped dm is investigated within a coordinate system determined by thelocation of the lg companion and the simulated virgo cluster across concentricshells ranging from 0.1 to 5 r_vir. remarkably, the principal axis of theellipsoidal sub-volume shows a coherent alignment extending from well withinthe halo to a few r_vir. a spherical harmonics transform applied to the angulardistributions confirms the visual impression: namely, the angular distributionsof both the satellites entry points and stripped dm is dominated by the l=2quadrupole term, whose major principal axis is aligned across the shellsconsidered. it follows that the structure of the outer (r&gt;0.5 r_vir) regions ofthe main halos is closely related to the cosmic web within which it isembedded. given the hypothesis that a large fraction of the stellar halo of themilky way has been accreted from satellites, the present results can be appliedto the stellar halo of the mw and m31. we predict that the remnants of tidallystripped satellites should be embedded in streams of material composed of darkmatter and stars. the present results can therefore shed light on the existenceof satellites embedded within larger streams of matter, such as the segue 2satellite.

1104.0949	haloes gone mad: the halo-finder comparison project	[abridged] we present a detailed comparison of fundamental dark matter haloproperties retrieved by a substantial number of different halo finders. thesecodes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (fof),spherical-overdensity (so) and phase-space based algorithms. we furtherintroduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allowshalo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against thosepresented here. this set includes mock haloes containing various levels anddistributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as acosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. all thehalo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location ofour mock haloes. they further returned lists of particles (potentially)belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of thecircular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. all the findersbased in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was locatedclose to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the massrecovered varies from finder to finder. those finders based in phase spacecould resolve central substructure although they found difficulties inaccurately recovering its properties. via a resolution study we found that mostof the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than30-40 particles. however, also here the phase space finders excelled byresolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. by comparing the halo findersusing a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkablywell on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass,position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).

1104.2447	a comparison of galaxy group luminosity functions from semi-analytic  models	semi-analytic models (sams) are currently one of the primary tools with whichto model statistically significant ensembles of galaxies. the underlyingphysical prescriptions inherent to each sam are, in many cases, different fromone another. several sams have been applied to the dark matter merger treesextracted from the millennium run, including those associated with thewell-known munich and durham lineages. we compare the predicted luminositydistributions of galaxy groups using four publicly available sams (de lucia etal. 2006; bower et al. 2006; bertone et al. 2007; font et al. 2008), in orderto explore a galactic environment in which the models have not been explored tothe same degree as they have in the field or in rich clusters. we identify acharacteristic "wiggle" in the group galaxy luminosity function generated usingthe de lucia et al. (2006) sam, that is not present in the durham-based models,consistent to some degree with observations. however, a comparison betweenconditional luminosity functions of groups between the models and observationsof yang et al. (2007) suggest that neither model is a particularly good match.the luminosity function wiggle is interpreted as the result of the two-mode agnfeedback implementation used in the munich models, which itself results inflattened magnitude gap distribution. an associated analysis of the magnitudegap distribution between first- and second-ranked group galaxies shows thatwhile the durham models yield distributions with approximately equal luminosityfirst- and second-ranked galaxies, in agreement with observations, the de luciaet al. models favours the scenario in which the second-ranked galaxy isapproximately one magnitude fainter than the primary,especially when thedynamic range of the mock data is limited to 3 magnitudes.

1107.2944	renegade subhaloes in the local group	using a dark matter only constrained local universe simulation (clues) weexamine the existence of subhaloes that change their affiliation from one ofthe two prominent hosts in the local group (i.e. the milky way and theandromeda galaxy) to the other, and call these objects "renegade subhaloes". inlight of recent claims that the two magellanic clouds (mcs) may have originatedfrom another region (or even the outskirts) of the local group or that theyhave been spawned by a major merger in the past of the andromeda galaxy, weinvestigate the nature of such events. however, we cannot confirm that renegadesubhaloes enter as deep into the potential well of their present host nor thatthey share the most simplest properties with the mcs, namely mass and relativevelocity. our simulation rather suggests that these renegade subhaloes appearto be flying past one host before being pulled into the other. a merger is notrequired to trigger such an event, it is rather the distinct environment of oursimulated local group facilitating such behavior. since just a small fractionof the full z=0 subhalo population are renegades, our study indicates that itwill be intrinsically difficult to distinguish them despite clear differencesin their velocity, radial distribution, shape and spin parameter distributions.

1107.4366	disentangling the dark matter halo from the stellar halo	the outer haloes of the milky way and andromeda galaxies contain as muchimportant information on their assembly and formation history as the propertiesof the discs resident in their centres. in this paper we have used theconstrained local universe simulation project to disentangle the stellar and dmcomponent of three galaxies that resemble the mw, m31 and m33 using both dmonly and dm + gas-dynamical simulations. stars that are accreted insubstructures and then stripped follow a completely different radialdistribution than the stripped dm: the stellar halo is much more centrallyconcentrated than dm. in order to understand how the same physical process canlead to different z=0 radial profiles, we examined the potential at accretionof each stripped particle. we found that star particles sit at systematicallyhigher potentials than dm, making them harder to strip. we then searched for athreshold in the potential of accreted particles \phi_[th], above which dmparticles behave as star particles. we found such a threshold at &gt;16\phi_{subhalo}, where \phi_{subhalo} is the potential at a subhaloes edge atthe time of accretion. thus a rule as simple as selecting particles accordingto their potential at accretion is able to reproduce the effect that thecomplicated physics of star formation has on the stellar distribution. thisniversal result reproduces the stellar halo to an accuracy of within ~2%.studies which make use of dm particles as a proxy for stars will undoubtedlymiscalculate their proper radial distribution and structure unless particlesare selected according to their potential at accretion. furthermore, we haveexamined the time it takes to strip a given star or dm particle afteraccretion. we find that, owing to their higher binding energies, stars takelonger to be stripped than dm. the stripped dm halo is thus considerably olderthan the stripped stellar halo.

1107.5045	too small to succeed? lighting up massive dark matter subhaloes of the  milky way	using constrained local universe simulations (clues) of the formation of thelocal group in a cosmological context we investigate the recently highlightedproblem that the majority of the most massive dark subhaloes of the milky wayare too dense to host any of its bright satellites. in particular, we examinethe influence of baryonic processes and find that they leave a twofold effecton the relation between the peak of the rotation curve and its position (vmaxand rmax). satellites with a large baryon fraction experience adiabaticcontraction thus decreasing rmax while leaving vmax more or less unchanged.subhaloes with smaller baryon fractions undergo a decrease in vmax possibly dueto outflows of material. furthermore, the situation of finding subhaloes insimulations that lie outside the confidence interval for possible hosts of thebright mw dwarf spheroidals, appears to be far more prominent in cosmologieswith a high sigma8 normalisation and depends on the mass of the host. weconclude that the problem cannot be simply solved by including baryonicprocesses and hence demands further investigations.

1108.3606	formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies via mergers of disky dwarfs	we perform collisionless n-body simulations to investigate whether binarymergers between rotationally-supported dwarfs can lead to the formation ofdwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs). our simulation campaign is based on a hybridapproach combining cosmological simulations and controlled numericalexperiments. we select merger events from a constrained local universe (clues)simulation of the local group (lg) and record the properties of the interactingdwarf-sized halos. this information is subsequently used to seed controlledexperiments of binary encounters between dwarf galaxies consisting ofexponential stellar disks embedded in cosmologically-motivated dark matterhalos. these simulations are designed to reproduce eight cosmological mergerevents, with initial masses of the interacting systems in the range ~ (5-60) x10^7 mo, occurring quite early in the history of the lg, more than 10 gyr ago.we compute the properties of the merger remnants as a distant observer wouldand demonstrate that at least three of the simulated encounters produce systemswith kinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dsphs inthe lg. tracing the history of the remnants in the cosmological simulation toz=0, we find that two dsph-like objects remain isolated at distances largerthan 800 kpc from either the milky way or m31. these systems constituteplausible counterparts of the remote dsphs cetus and tucana which reside in thelg outskirts, far from the tidal influence of the primary galaxies. we concludethat merging of rotationally-supported dwarfs represents a viable mechanism forthe formation of dsphs in the lg and similar environments.

1109.2671	the dynamical state of dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations i:  correlations with mass assembly history	using a statistical sample of dark matter haloes drawn from a suite ofcosmological n-body simulations of the cold dark matter (cdm) model, wequantify the impact of a simulated halo's mass accretion and merging history ontwo commonly used measures of its dynamical state, the virial ratio eta and thecentre of mass offset delta r. quantifying this relationship is importantbecause the degree to which a halo is dynamically equilibrated will influencethe reliability with which we can measure characteristic equilibrium propertiesof the structure and kinematics of a population of haloes. we begin byverifying that a halo's formation redshift zform correlates with its virialmass mvir and we show that the fraction of its recently accreted mass and thelikelihood of it having experienced a recent major merger increases withincreasing mvir and decreasing zform. we then show that both eta and delta rincrease with increasing mvir and decreasing zform, which implies that massiverecently formed haloes are more likely to be dynamically unrelaxed than theirless massive and older counterparts. our analysis shows that both eta and deltar are good indicators of a halo's dynamical state, showing strong positivecorrelations with recent mass accretion and merging activity, but we argue thatdelta r provides a more robust and better defined measure of dynamical statefor use in cosmological n-body simulations at z~0. we find that delta r &lt; 0.04is sufficient to pick out dynamically relaxed haloes at z=0. finally, we assessour results in the context of previous studies, and consider theirobservational implications.

1111.7257	dm haloes in the fifth-force cosmology	we investigate how long-range scalar interactions affect the properties ofdark matter haloes. for doing so we employ the rebel model which implements anadditional interaction between dark matter particles. on the phenomenologicallevel this is equivalent to a modification of gravity. we analyse thedifferences between five rebel models and $\lambda$cdm using a series of highresolution cosmological simulations. emphasis is placed on investigating howhalo properties change in the presence of a fifth force. we report that thedensity profile of rebel haloes is well described by the nfw profile but withmean concentrations from $5\%$ to a few times higher than the standard$\lambda$cdm value. we also find a slight increase of the halo spin for haloesmore massive than $5\times10^{11}\m_{\odot}$, reflecting a higher rotationalsupport of those haloes due to scalar forces. in addition, the dark matterhaloes in our models are more spherical than their counterparts in$\lambda$cdm. the rebel haloes are also more virialised, with a largedifference from $\lambda$cdm for strong fifth forces and a much smaller changefor weak scalar interactions.

0710.4029	an analytical model of surface mass densities of cold dark matter haloes  - with an application to macho microlensing optical depths	the cold dark matter (cdm) scenario generically predicts the existence oftriaxial dark matter haloes which contain notable amounts of substructure.however, analytical halo models with smooth, spherically symmetric densityprofiles are routinely adopted in the modelling of light propagation effectsthrough such objects. in this paper, we address the biases introduced by thisprocedure by comparing the surface mass densities of actual n-body haloesagainst the widely used analytical model suggested by navarro, frenk and white(1996) (nfw).  we conduct our analysis in the redshift range of 0.0 - 1.5. in cluster sizedhaloes, we find that triaxiality can cause scatter in the surface mass densityof the haloes up to sigma_+ = +60% and sigma_- = -70%, where the 1-sigma limitsare relative to the analytical nfw model given value. subhaloes can increasethis scatter to sigma_+ = +70% and sigma_- = -80%. in galaxy sized haloes, thetriaxial scatter can be as high as sigma_+ = +80% and sigma_- = -70%, and withsubhaloes the values can change to sigma_+ = +40% and sigma_- = -80%.  we present an analytical model for the surface mass density scatter as afunction of distance to the halo centre, halo redshift and halo mass. theanalytical description enables one to investigate the reliability of resultsobtained with simplified halo models. additionally, it provides the means toadd simulated surface density scatter to analytical density profiles. as anexample, we discuss the impact of our results on the calculation ofmicrolensing optical depths for machos in cdm haloes.

1201.3365	the cosmic web and the orientation of angular momenta	we use a 64$h^{-1}$mpc dark matter (dm) only cosmological simulation toexamine the large scale orientation of haloes and substructures with respectthe cosmic web. a web classification scheme based on the velocity shear tensoris used to assign to each halo in the simulation a web type: knot, filament,sheet or void. using $\sim10^6$ haloes that span ~3 orders of magnitude in massthe orientation of the halo's spin and the orbital angular momentum ofsubhaloes with respect to the eigenvectors of the shear tensor is examined. wefind that the orbital angular momentum of subhaloes tends to align with theintermediate eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor for all haloes in knots,filaments and sheets. this result indicates that the kinematics ofsubstructures located deep within the virialized regions of a halo isdetermined by its infall which in turn is determined by the large scalevelocity shear, a surprising result given the virilaized nature of haloes. thenon-random nature of subhalo accretion is thus imprinted on the angularmomentum measured at z = 0. we also find that haloes' spin axis is aligned withthe third eigenvector of the velocity shear tensor in filaments and sheets: thehalo spin axis points along filaments and lies in the plane of cosmic sheets.

1201.3367	a kinematic classification of the cosmic web	a new approach for the classification of the cosmic web is presented. inextension of the previous work of hahn et al.

1204.0515	size matters: the non-universal density profile of subhaloes in sph  simulations and implications for the milky way's dsphs	we use dark matter only and full hydrodynamical constrained local universesimulations (clues) of the formation of the local group to study the densityprofile of subhaloes of the simulated milky way and andromeda galaxies. we showthat the einasto model provides the best description of the subhaloes' densityprofile, as opposed to the more commonly used nfw profile or any generalisationof it. we further find that the einasto shape parameter \nein\ is stronglycorrelated with the total subhalo mass, pointing towards the notion of anon-universality of the subhaloes' density profile. we observe that the effectof mass loss due to tidal stripping, in both the dark matter only and thehydrodynamical run, is the reduction of the shape parameter \nein\ between theinfall and the present time. assuming now that the dsphs of our galaxy followthe einasto profile and using the maximum and minimum values of \nein\ from ourhydrodynamical simulation as a gauge, we can improve the observationalconstraints on the \rmax-\vmax\ pairs obtained for the brightest satellitegalaxies of the milky way. when considering only the subhaloes with$-13.2\lesssim m_v\lesssim-8.8$, i.e. the range of luminosity of the classicaldwarfs, we find that all our simulated objects are consistent with the observeddsphs if their haloes follow the einasto model with $1.6\lesssim n_{\rm e}\lesssim5.3$. the numerically motivated einasto profile for the observed dsphswill alleviate the recently presented "massive failures" problem.

1210.2578	galaxies going mad: the galaxy-finder comparison project	with the ever increasing size and complexity of fully self-consistentsimulations of galaxy formation within the framework of the cosmic web, thedemands upon object finders for these simulations has simultaneously grown. tothis extent we initiated the halo finder comparison project that gatheredtogether all the experts in the field and has so far led to two comparisonpapers, one for dark matter field haloes (knebe et al. 2011), and one for darkmatter subhaloes (onions et al. 2012). however, as state-of-the-art simulationcodes are perfectly capable of not only following the formation and evolutionof dark matter but also account for baryonic physics (e.g. hydrodynamics, starformation, feedback) object finders should also be capable of taking theseadditional processes into consideration. here we report on a comparison ofcodes as applied to the constrained local universe simulation (clues) of theformation of the local group which incorporates much of the physics relevantfor galaxy formation. we compare both the properties of the three main galaxiesin the simulation (representing the mw, m31, and m33) as well as theirsatellite populations for a variety of halo finders ranging from phase-space tovelocity-space to spherical overdensity based codes, including also a merebaryonic object finder. we obtain agreement amongst codes comparable to (if notbetter than) our previous comparisons, at least for the total, dark, andstellar components of the objects. however, the diffuse gas content of thehaloes shows great disparity, especially for low-mass satellite galaxies. thisis primarily due to differences in the treatment of the thermal energy duringthe unbinding procedure. we acknowledge that the handling of gas in halofinders is something that needs to be dealt with carefully, and the precisetreatment may depend sensitively upon the scientific problem being studied.

1210.4559	the velocity shear tensor: tracer of halo alignment	the alignment of dm halos and the surrounding large scale structure (lss) isexamined in the context of the cosmic web. halo spin, shape and the orbitalangular momentum of subhaloes is investigated relative to the lss using theeigenvectors of the velocity shear tensor evaluated on a grid with a scale of 1mpc/h, deep within the non-linear regime. knots, filaments, sheets and voidsare associated with regions that are collapsing along 3, 2, 1 or 0 principaldirections simultaneously. each halo is tagged with a web classification (i.e.knot halo, filament halo, etc) according to the nature of the collapse at thehalo's position. the full distribution of shear eigenvalues is found to besubstantially different from that tagged to haloes, indicating that theobserved velocity shear is significantly biased. we find that larger masshaloes live in regions where the shear is more isotropic, namely the expansionor collapse is more spherical. a correlation is found between the halo's shapeand the eigenvectors of the shear tensor, with the longest (shortest) axis ofthe halo's shape being aligned with the slowest (fastest) collapsingeigenvector. this correlation is web independent, suggesting that the velocityshear is a fundamental tracer of the halo alignment. a similar result is foundfor the alignment of halo spin with the cosmic web. it has been shown that highmass haloes exhibit a spin flip with respect to the lss: we find the mass atwhich this spin flip occurs is web dependent and not universal as suggestedpreviously. although weaker than haloes, subhalo orbits too exhibit analignment with the lss, providing a possible insight into the highly correlatedco-rotation of the milky way's satellite system. the present study suggeststhat the velocity shear tensor constitutes the natural framework for studyingthe directional properties of the non-linear lss and of halos and galaxies.

1212.0095	the halo mass function through the cosmic ages	in this paper we investigate how the halo mass function evolves withredshift, based on a suite of very large (with n_p = 3072^3 - 6000^3 particles)cosmological n-body simulations. our halo catalogue data spans a redshift rangeof z = 0-30, allowing us to probe the mass function from the dark ages to thepresent. we utilise both the friends-of-friends (fof) and spherical overdensity(so) halofinding methods to directly compare the mass function derived usingthese commonly used halo definitions. the mass function from so haloes exhibitsa clear evolution with redshift, especially during the recent era of darkenergy dominance (z &lt; 1). we provide a redshift-parameterised fit for the somass function valid for the entire redshift range to within ~20% as well as ascheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities.the fof mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. we provide a`universal' fit for the fof mass function, fitted to data across the entireredshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our dataversus this fit. the relative evolution of the mass functions derived via thetwo methods is compared and we find that the mass functions most closely matchat z=0. the disparity at z=0 between the fof and so mass functions resides intheir high mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in so haloes is ~80%of that in fof haloes. this difference grows with redshift so that, by z&gt;20,the so algorithm finds a ~50-80% lower collapsed fraction in high mass haloesthan does the fof algorithm, due in part to the significant over-linkingeffects known to affect the fof method.

1212.0701	subhaloes gone notts: spin across subhaloes and finders	we present a study of a comparison of spin distributions of subhaloes foundassociated with a host halo. the subhaloes are found within two cosmologicalsimulation families of milky way-like galaxies, namely the aquarius and ghalosimulations. these two simulations use different gravity codes and cosmologies.we employ ten different substructure finders, which span a wide range ofmethodologies from simple overdensity in configuration space to full 6-d phasespace analysis of particles.we subject the results to a common post-processingpipeline to analyse the results in a consistent manner, recovering thedimensionless spin parameter. we find that spin distribution is an excellentindicator of how well the removal of background particles (unbinding) has beencarried out. we also find that the spin distribution decreases for substructurethe nearer they are to the host halo's, and that the value of the spinparameter rises with enclosed mass towards the edge of the substructure.finally subhaloes are less rotationally supported than field haloes, with thepeak of the spin distribution having a lower spin parameter.

1212.1454	cosmic vorticity and the origin of halo spins	in the standard model of cosmology, structure emerges out of non-rotationalflow and the angular momentum of collapsing halos is induced by tidal torques.the growth of halo angular momentum in the linear and quasi-linear phases isassociated with a shear, curl-free, flow and it is well described within thelinear framework of tidal torque theory (ttt). however, ttt is renderedirrelevant as haloes approach turn around and virialization. at that stage theflow field around halos has non-zero vorticity. using a cosmologicalsimulation, we have examined the importance of the curl of the velocity field(vorticity) in determining halo spin, finding a strong alignment between thetwo. we have also examined the alignment of vorticity with the principle axesof the shear tensor, finding that it tends to be perpendicular to the axisalong which material is collapsing fastest (e1). this behavior is independentof halo masses and cosmic web environment. our results agree with previousfindings on the tendency of halo spin to be perpendicular to e1, and of thespin of (simulated) halos and (observed) galaxies to be aligned with thelarge-scale structure. our results imply that angular momentum growth proceedsin two distinct phases. in the first phase angular momentum emerges out of ashear, curl-free, potential flow, as described by ttt. in the second phase, inwhich haloes approach virialization, the angular momentum emerges out of avortical flow and halo spin becomes strongly aligned with the vorticity of theambient flow field.

1304.0585	structure finding in cosmological simulations: the state of affairs	the ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations ofcosmic structure formation demands equally sophisticated tools for theiranalysis. during the past decade, the art of object finding in thesesimulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. amultitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques havebeen spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will providethe same (physical) information about the structures of interest. here wesummarize and extent previous work of the "halo finder comparison project": weinvestigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders.to this extent we decipher and discuss differences in halo finding methods,clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties.we observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objectsleading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and vmax function,but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by allfinders differ. the strength of the variation, however, depends on the propertystudied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass, and the peak valueof the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derivedquantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. our study indicatesthat the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codesstems from the distinct particle collection methods and -- to a minor extent --the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles isimplemented. we close with a discussion of the relevance and implications ofthe scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analyticalgalaxy formation models, gravitational lensing, and observables in general.

1305.2448	streams going notts: the tidal debris finder comparison project	while various codes exist to systematically and robustly find haloes andsubhaloes in cosmological simulations (knebe et al., 2011, onions et al.,2012), this is the first work to introduce and rigorously test codes that findtidal debris (streams and other unbound substructure) in fully cosmologicalsimulations of structure formation. we use one tracking and three non-trackingcodes to identify substructure (bound and unbound) in a milky way typesimulation from the aquarius suite (springel et al., 2008) and post-processtheir output with a common pipeline to determine the properties of thesesubstructures in a uniform way. by using output from a fully cosmologicalsimulation, we also take a step beyond previous studies of tidal debris thathave used simple toy models. we find that both tracking and non-tracking codesagree well on the identification of subhaloes and more importantly, the {\emunbound tidal features} associated with them. the distributions of basicproperties of the total substructure distribution (mass, velocity dispersion,position) are recovered with a scatter of $\sim20%$. using the tracking code asour reference, we show that the non-tracking codes identify complex tidaldebris with purities of $\sim40%$. analysing the results of the substructurefinders, we find that the general distribution of {\em substructures} differsignificantly from the distribution of bound {\em subhaloes}. most importantly,both bound and unbound {\em substructures} together constitute $\sim18%$ of thehost halo mass, which is a factor of $\sim2$ higher than the fraction inself-bound {\em subhaloes}. however, this result is restricted by the remainingchallenge to cleanly define when an unbound structure has become part of thehost halo. nevertheless, the more general substructure distribution provides amore complete picture of a halo's accretion history.

1305.5557	cold versus warm dark matter simulations of a galaxy group	the differences between cold (cdm) and warm (wdm) dark matter in theformation of a group of galaxies is examined by running two identicalsimulations where in the wdm case the initial power spectrum has been alteredto mimic a 1kev dark matter particle. the cdm initial conditions wereconstrained to reproduce at z = 0 the correct local environment within which a"local group" (lg) of galaxies may form. two significant differences betweenthe two simulations are found. while in the cdm case a group of galaxies thatresembles the real lg forms, the wdm run fails to reproduce a viable lg,instead forming a diffuse group which is still expanding at z = 0. this issurprising since, due to the suppression of small scale power in its powerspectrum, wdm is naively expected to only affect the collapse of small haloesand not necessarily the dynamics on a scale of a group of galaxies. furthermorethe concentration of baryons in halo center's is greater in cdm than in wdm andthe properties of the disks differ.

1306.0898	the dependence of dark matter profiles on the stellar to halo mass  ratio: a prediction for cusps vs cores	we use 31 simulated galaxies from the magicc project to investigate theeffects of baryonic feedback on the density profiles of dark matter (dm)haloes. the sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4e9&lt;mhalo/msun&lt;7.8e11, hostinggalaxies with stellar masses: 5.0e5&lt;m*/msun&lt;8.3e10, i.e. from dwarf to l*. thegalaxies are simulated with several baryonic prescriptions, including a rangeof stellar feedbacks. the main result is a clear dependence of the inner slopeof the dm density profile, \alpha\ in \rho r^\alpha, on the ratio betweenstellar-to-halo mass (m*/mhalo). this relation is independent of the stellarfeedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp vs core formation. whenm*/mhalo is low, ~0.01%, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient tosignificantly alter the inner dm density and the galaxy retains a cuspyprofile. at higher m*/mhalo, feedback drives the expansion of the dm andgenerates cored profiles. the flattest profiles form where m*/mhalo~0.5%. abovethis ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitationalpotential enough to oppose this supernova-driven expansion process, resultingin smaller cores and cuspier profiles. combining the dependence of \alpha\ onm*/mhalo with the abundance matching relation between m* and mhalo provides aprediction for how \alpha\ varies with m*. further, using the tully-fisherrelation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dm inner slope on theobserved rotation velocity of galaxies. the most cored galaxies are expected tohave vrot~50km/s, with \alpha\ decreasing for more massive disc galaxies:spirals with vrot~150km/s have central slopes \alpha&lt;-0.8, approaching the nfwprofile. this novel prediction for the dependence of \alpha\ on disc galaxymass can be tested using current observational data sets, and can be applied totheoretical modeling of mass profiles and populations of disc galaxies.

0801.1851	dark matter halo profiles in scale-free cosmologies	we explore the dependence of the central logarithmic slope of dark matterhalo density profiles $\alpha$ on the spectral index $n$ of the linear matterpower spectrum $p(k)$ using cosmological $n$-body simulations of scale-freemodels (i.e. $p(k) \propto k^n$). for each of our simulations we identifysamples of well resolved haloes in dynamical equilibrium and we analyse theirmass profiles. by parameterising the mass profile using a ``generalised''navarro, frenk &amp; white profile in which the central logarithmic slope $\alpha$is allowed to vary while preserving the $r^{-3}$ asymptotic form at largeradii, we obtain preferred central slopes for haloes in each of our models.there is a strong correlation between $\alpha$ and $n$, such that $\alpha$becomes shallower as $n$ becomes steeper. however, if we normalise our massprofiles by $r_{-2}$, the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the densityprofile is -2, we find that these differences are no longer present. weconclude that there is no evidence for convergence to a unique centralasymptotic slope, at least on the scales that we can resolve.

1307.3577	sussing merger trees: the merger trees comparison project	merger trees follow the growth and merger of dark-matter haloes over cosmichistory. as well as giving important insights into the growth of cosmicstructure in their own right, they provide an essential backbone tosemi-analytic models of galaxy formation. this paper is the first in a seriesto arise from the sussing merger trees workshop in which ten differenttree-building algorithms were applied to the same set of halo catalogues andtheir results compared. although many of these codes were similar in nature,all algorithms produced distinct results. our main conclusions are that auseful merger-tree code should possess the following features: (i) the use ofparticle ids to match haloes between snapshots; (ii) the ability to skip atleast one, and preferably more, snapshots in order to recover subhaloes thatare temporarily lost during merging; (iii) the ability to cope with (andideally smooth out) large, temporary flucuations in halo mass. finally, toenable different groups to communicate effectively, we defined a commonterminology that we used when discussing merger trees and we encourage othersto adopt the same language. we also specified a minimal output format to recordthe results.

0801.3241	the tidal streams of disrupting subhaloes in cosmological dark matter  haloes	(abridged) we present a detailed analysis of the properties of tidallystripped material from disrupting substructure haloes or subhaloes in a sampleof high resolution cosmological n-body host haloes ranging from galaxy- tocluster-mass scales. we focus on devising methods to recover the infall massand infall eccentricity of subhaloes from the properties of their tidallystripped material (i.e. tidal streams). our analysis reveals that there is arelation between the scatter of stream particles about the best-fit debrisplane and the infall mass of the progenitor subhalo. this allows us toreconstruct the infall mass from the spread of its tidal debris in space. wealso find that the spread in radial velocities of the debris material (asmeasured by an observer located at the centre of the host) correlates with theinfall eccentricity of the subhalo, which allows us to reconstruct its orbitalparameters. we devise an automated method to identify leading and trailing armsthat can, in principle at least, be applied to observations of stellar streamsfrom satellite galaxies. this method is based on the energy distribution ofmaterial in the tidal stream. using this method, we show that the massassociated with leading and trailing arms differ. while our analysis indicatesthat tidal streams can be used to recover certain properties of theirprogenitor subhaloes (and consequently satellites), we do not find strongcorrelations between host halo properties and stream properties. this likelyreflects the complicated relationship between the stream and the host, which ina cosmological context is characterised by a complex mass accretion history, anasymmetric mass distribution and the abundance of substructure.

1310.0825	subhaloes gone notts: the clustering properties of subhaloes	we present a study of the substructure finder dependence of subhaloclustering in the aquarius simulation. we run 11 different subhalo finders onthe haloes of the aquarius simulation and we study their differences in thedensity profile, mass fraction and 2-point correlation function of subhaloes inhaloes. we also study the mass and vmax dependence of subhalo clustering. asthe aquarius simulation has been run at different resolutions, we study theconvergence with higher resolutions. we find that the agreement between findersis at around the 10% level inside r200 and at intermediate resolutions when amass threshold is applied, and better than 5% when vmax is restricted insteadof mass. however, some discrepancies appear in the highest resolution,underlined by an observed resolution dependence of subhalo clustering. thisdependence is stronger for the smallest subhaloes, which are more clustered inthe highest resolution, due to the detection of subhaloes within subhaloes (thesub-subhalo term). this effect modifies the mass dependence of clustering inthe highest resolutions. we discuss implications of our results for models ofsubhalo clustering and their relation with galaxy clustering.

1312.0276	cosmic variance of the local hubble flow in large-scale cosmological  simulations	the increasing precision in the determination of the hubble parameter hasreached a per cent level at which large-scale cosmic flows induced byinhomogeneities of the matter distribution become non-negligible. here we uselarge-scale cosmological n-body simulations to study statistical properties ofthe local hubble parameter as measured by local observers. we show that thedistribution of the local hubble parameter depends not only on the scale ofinhomogeneities, but also on how one defines the positions of observers in thecosmic web and what reference frame is used. observers located in random darkmatter haloes measure on average lower expansion rates than those at randompositions in space or in the centres of cosmic voids, and this effect isstronger from the halo rest frames compared to the cmb rest frame. we comparethe predictions for the local hubble parameter with observational constraintsbased on type ia supernovae (snia) and cmb observations. due to cosmicvariance, for observers located in random haloes we show that the hubbleconstant determined from nearby snia may differ from that measured from the cmbby 0.8 per cent at 1sigma statistical significance. this scatter is too smallto significantly alleviate a recently claimed discrepancy between currentmeasurements assuming a flat lcdm model. however, for observers located in thecentres of the largest voids permitted by the standard lcdm model, we find thathubble constant measurements from snia would be biased high by 5 per cent,rendering this tension inexistent in this extreme case.

0802.1628	the dynamics of subhalos in warm dark matter models	we present a comparison of the properties of substructure halos (subhalos)orbiting within host halos that form in cold dark matter (cdm) and warm darkmatter (wdm) cosmologies. our study focuses on selected properties of thesesubhalos, namely their anisotropic spatial distribution within the hosts; theexistence of a "backsplash'' population; the age-distance relation; the degreeto which they suffer mass loss; and the distribution of relative (infall)velocities with respect to the hosts. we find that the number density ofsubhalos in our wdm model is suppressed relative to that in the cdm model, aswe would expect. interestingly, our analysis reveals that backsplash subhalosexist in both the wdm and cdm models. indeed, there are no statisticallysignificant differences between the spatial distributions of subhalos in thecdm and wdm models. there is evidence that subhalos in the wdm model sufferenhanced mass loss relative to their counterparts in the cdm model, reflectingtheir lower central densities. we note also a tendency for the (infall)velocities of subhalos in the wdm model to be higher than in the cdm model.nevertheless, we conclude that observational tests based on either the spatialdistribution or the kinematics of the subhalo population are unlikely to helpus to differentiate between the cdm model and our adopted wdm model.

0802.1917	on the relation between radial alignment of dark matter subhalos and  host mass in cosmological simulations	we explore the dependence of the radial alignment of subhalos on the mass ofthe host halo they orbit in. as the effect is seen on a broad range of scalesincluding massive clusters as well as galactic systems it only appears naturalto explore this phenomenon by means of cosmological simulations covering thesame range in masses. we have 25 well resolved host dark matter halos at ourdisposal ranging from 10^15 msun/h down to 10^12 msun/h each consisting oforder of a couple of million particles within the virial radius. we observethat subhalos tend to be more spherical than isolated objects. both thedistributions of sphericity and triaxiality of subhalos are gaussiandistributed with peak values of s approx. 0.80 and t approx. 0.56, irrespectiveof host mass. interestingly we note that the radial alignment is independent ofhost halo mass and the distribution of \cos\theta (i.e. the angle between themajor axis e_a of each subhalo and the radius vector of the subhalo in thereference frame of the host) is well fitted by a simple power law p(\cos\theta)proportional to \cos^4\theta with the same fitting parameters for all hosthalos.

1401.5005	hydrodynamical simulations of coupled and uncoupled quintessence models  i: halo properties and the cosmic web	we present the results of a series of adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations ofseveral quintessence models (both with a free and an interacting scalar field)in comparison to a standard \lcdm\ cosmology. for each we use $2\times1024^3$particles in a $250$\hmpc\ periodic box assuming wmap7 cosmology. in this workwe focus on the properties of haloes in the cosmic web at $z=0$. the web isclassified into \emph{voids}, \emph{sheets}, \emph{filaments} and \emph{knots}depending on the eigenvalues of the velocity shear tensor, which are anexcellent proxy for the underlying overdensity distribution. we find that theproperties of objects classified according to their surrounding environmentshows a substantial dependence on the underlying cosmology; for example, while$v_{\rm max}$ shows average deviations of $\approx5$ per cent across thedifferent models when considering the full halo sample, comparing objectsclassified according to their environment, the size of the deviation can be aslarge as $20$ per cent.  we also find that halo spin parameters are positively correlated to thecoupling, whereas halo concentrations show the opposite behaviour. furthermore,when studying the concentration-mass relation in different environments, wefind that in all cosmologies underdense regions have a larger normalization anda shallower slope. while this behaviour is found to characterize all themodels, differences in the best-fit relations are enhanced in (coupled) darkenergy, thus providing a clearer prediction for this class of models.

1402.2381	sussing merger trees: the influence of the halo finder	merger tree codes are routinely used to follow the growth and merger of darkmatter haloes in simulations of cosmic structure formation. whereas in srisawatet. al. we compared the trees built using a wide variety of such codes here westudy the influence of the underlying halo catalogue upon the resulting trees.we observe that the specifics of halo finding itself greatly influences theconstructed merger trees. we find that the choices made to define the halo massare of prime importance. for instance, amongst many potential options differentfinders select self-bound objects or spherical regions of defined overdensity,decide whether or not to include substructures within the mass returned andvary in their initial particle selection. the impact of these decisions is seenin tree length (the period of time a particularly halo can be traced backthrough the simulation), branching ratio (essentially the merger rate of\subhalos) and mass evolution. we therefore conclude that the choice of theunderlying halo finder is more relevant to the process of building merger treesthan the tree builder itself. we also report on some built-in features ofspecific merger tree codes that (sometimes) help to improve the quality of themerger trees produced.

1403.7525	the life and death of cosmic voids	we investigate the formation, growth, merger history, movement, anddestruction of cosmic voids detected via the watershed transform code vide in acosmological n-body dark matter {\lambda}cdm simulation. by adapting a methodused to construct halo merger trees, we are able to trace individual voids backto their initial appearance and record the merging and evolution of theirprogenitors at high redshift. for the scales of void sizes captured in oursimulation, we find that the void formation rate peaks at scale factor 0.3,which coincides with a growth in the void hierarchy and the emergence of darkenergy. voids of all sizes appear at all scale factors, though the medianinitial void size decreases with time. when voids become detectable they havenearly their present-day volumes. almost all voids have relatively stablegrowth rates and suffer only infrequent minor mergers. dissolution of a voidvia merging is very rare. instead, most voids maintain their distinct identityas annexed subvoids of a larger parent. the smallest voids are collapsing atthe present epoch, but void destruction ceases after scale factor 0.3. inaddition, voids centers tend to move very little, less than 0.01 of theireffective radii per ln a, over their lifetimes. overall, most voids exhibitlittle radical dynamical evolution; their quiet lives make them pristine probesof cosmological initial conditions and the imprint of dark energy.

1404.5959	a mass-dependent density profile for dark matter haloes including the  influence of galaxy formation	we introduce a mass dependent density profile to describe the distribution ofdark matter within galaxies, which takes into account the stellar-to-halo massdependence of the response of dark matter to baryonic processes. the study isbased on the analysis of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies from dwarf tomilky way mass, drawn from the magicc project, which have been shown to match awide range of disk scaling relationships. we find that the best fit parametersof a generic double power-law density profile vary in a systematic manner thatdepends on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of each galaxy. thus, the quantitymstar/mhalo constrains the inner ($\gamma$) and outer ($\beta$) slopes of darkmatter density, and the sharpness of transition between the slopes($\alpha$),reducing the number of free parameters of the model to two. due to the tightrelation between stellar mass and halo mass, either of these quantities issufficient to describe the dark matter halo profile including the effects ofbaryons. the concentration of the haloes in the hydrodynamical simulations isconsistent with n-body expectations up to milky way mass galaxies, at whichmass the haloes become twice as concentrated as compared with pure dark matterruns. this mass dependent density profile can be directly applied to rotationcurve data of observed galaxies and to semi analytic galaxy formation models asa significant improvement over the commonly used nfw profile.

1407.0394	the universal nature of subhalo accretion	we examine the angular infall pattern of subhaloes onto host haloes in thecontext of the large-scale structure. we find that this infall pattern isessentially driven by the shear tensor of the ambient velocity field. darkmatter subhaloes are found to be preferentially accreted along the principalaxis of the shear tensor which corresponds to the direction of weakestcollapse. we examine the dependence of this preferential infall on subhalomass, host halo mass and redshift. although strongest for the most massivehosts and the most massive subhaloes at high redshift, the preferential infallof subhaloes is effectively universal in the sense that its always aligned withthe axis of weakest collapse of the velocity shear tensor. it is the same sheartensor that dictates the structure of the cosmic web and hence the shear fieldemerges as the key factor that governs the local anisotropic pattern ofstructure formation. since the small (sub-mpc) scale is strongly correlatedwith the mid-range (~10 mpc) scale - a scale accessible by current surveys ofpeculiar velocities - it follows that findings presented here open a new windowinto the relation between the observed large scale structure unveiled bycurrent surveys of peculiar velocities and the preferential infall direction ofthe local group. this may shed light on the unexpected alignments of dwarfgalaxies seen in the local group

1410.1241	sussing merger trees : the impact of halo merger trees on galaxy  properties in a semi-analytic model	a halo merger tree forms the essential backbone of a semi-analytic model forgalaxy formation and evolution. recent studies have pointed out that extractingmerger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial;different tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. thesedifferences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used asinput for models of galaxy formation. we investigate the impact of differenthalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. we find that the z=0 galaxyproperties in our model show differences between trees when using a commonparameter set. the star formation history of the universe and the properties ofsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with differentconstruction methods. independently calibrating the semi-analytic model foreach tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxyproperties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionaryhistories of galaxies. furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,resulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differingby factors of 2. such a change alters the regimes where star formation isprimarily suppressed by supernovae. therefore, halo merger trees extracted froma common halo catalogue using different, but reliable, algorithms can result ina difference in the semi-analytic model. given the uncertainties in galaxyformation physics, however, these differences may not necessarily be viewed assignificant.

1412.5228	halogen: a tool for fast generation of mock halo catalogues	we present a simple method of generating approximate synthetic halocatalogues: halogen. this method uses a combination of $2^{nd}$-orderlagrangian perturbation theory (2lpt) in order to generate the large-scalematter distribution, analytical mass functions to generate halo masses, and asingle-parameter stochastic model for halo bias to position haloes. halogenrepresents a simplification of similar recently published methods.  our method is constrained to recover the 2-point function at intermediate($10mpc/h&lt;r&lt;50mpc/h$) scales, which we show is successful to within 2 per cent.larger scales ($\sim100mpc/h$) are reproduced to within 15 per cent. we compareseveral other statistics (e.g. power spectrum, point distribution function,redshift space distortions) with results from n-body simulations to determinethe validity of our method for different purposes. one of the benefits ofhalogen is its flexibility, and we demonstrate this by showing how it can beadapted to varying cosmologies and simulation specifications.  a driving motivation for the development of such approximate schemes is theneed to compute covariance matrices and study the systematic errors for largegalaxy surveys, which requires thousands of simulated realisations. we discussthe applicability of our method in this context, and conclude that it is wellsuited to mass production of appropriate halo catalogues.  the code is publicly available at https://github.com/savila/halogen

1412.7729	nifty cosmology: galaxy/halo mock catalogue comparison project on  clustering statistics	we present a comparison of major methodologies of fast generating mock haloor galaxy catalogues. the comparison is done for two-point and the three-pointclustering statistics. the reference catalogues are drawn from the bigmultidarkn-body simulation. both friend-of-friends (including distinct halos only) andspherical overdensity (including distinct halos and subhalos) catalogs havebeen used with the typical number density of a large-volume galaxy surveys. wedemonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the powerspectrum at quasilinear and even smaller scales. with respect to variousclustering statistics a methodology based on perturbation theory and arealistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with n-body simulations.however, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum,only the method based on semi-n-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1%level) at small scales, i.e., r&lt;25 mpc/h or k&gt;0.15 h/mpc. full n-body solutionswill remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. nevertheless, wehave demonstrated that the far more efficient approximate solvers can reach afew percent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scalesinteresting for the large-scale structure analysis after calibration with a fewreference n-body calculations. this makes them useful for massive productionaimed at covariance studies, to scan large parameter spaces, and to estimateuncertainties in data analysis techniques, such as baryon acoustic oscillationreconstruction, redshift distortion measurements, etc.

1509.02537	the sensitivity of harassment to orbit: mass loss from early-type dwarfs  in galaxy clusters	we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of the orbital dependence ofharassment on early-type dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within arealistic, virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance.we find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating theirstellar disks for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. comparing tothe orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, we find that the majorityof the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. wealso study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systemsof early-type dwarfs. we find these are significantly altered only ifharassment is very strong. this suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs inclusters such as virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars orglobular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embeddeddeep within their dark matter halo. we demonstrate that this result is actuallyconsistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite theapparent contradiction. those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar strippingare found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift=0, which mixesthem in with less strongly harassed galaxies. however when placed onphase-space diagrams, strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lowervelocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. this remains true in acosmological simulation, even when halos have a wide range of masses andconcentrations. thus phase-space diagrams may be a useful tool for determiningthe relative likelihood that galaxies have been strongly or weakly harassed.

1511.00011	cosmic dawn (coda): the first radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of  reionization and galaxy formation in the local universe	cosmic reionization by starlight from early galaxies affected theirevolution, thereby impacting reionization, itself. star formation suppression,for example, may explain the observed underabundance of local group dwarfsrelative to n-body predictions for cold dark matter. reionization modellingrequires simulating volumes large enough ~(100 mpc)^3 to sample reionization"patchiness", while resolving millions of galaxy sources above ~10^8 msun,combining gravitational and gas dynamics with radiative transfer. modelling thelocal group requires initial cosmological density fluctuations pre-selected toform the well-known structures of the local universe today. cosmic dawn("coda") is the first such fully-coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation ofreionization of the local universe. our new hybrid cpu-gpu code,ramses-cudaton, performs hundreds of radiative transfer and ionizationrate-solver timesteps on the gpus for each hydro-gravity timestep on the cpus.coda simulated (91 mpc)^3 with 4096^3 particles and cells, to redshift 4.23, onornl supercomputer titan, utilizing 8192 cores and 8192 gpus. globalreionization ended slightly later than observed. however, a simple temporalrescaling which brings the evolution of ionized fraction into agreement withobservations also reconciles ionizing flux density, cosmic star formationhistory, cmb electron scattering optical depth and galaxy uv luminosityfunction with their observed values. haloes below ~3 x 10^9 msun were severelyaffected by the rising uv background: photoionization heating suppressed theirstar formation. for most of reionization, star formation was dominated byhaloes between 10^10 - 10^11msun. intergalactic filaments display sheathedstructures, with hot envelopes surrounding cooler cores, but do notself-shield, unlike regions denser than 100 rho_average.

(2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

1512.01253	how does our choice of observable influence our estimation of the centre  of a galaxy cluster? insights from cosmological simulations	galaxy clusters are an established and powerful test-bed for theories of bothgalaxy evolution and cosmology. accurate interpretation of cluster observationsoften requires robust identification of the location of the centre. using astatistical sample of clusters drawn from a suite of cosmological simulationsin which we have explored a range of galaxy formation models, we investigatehow the location of this centre is affected by the choice of observable -stars, hot gas, or the full mass distribution as can be probed by thegravitational potential. we explore several measures of cluster centre: theminimum of the gravitational potential, which would expect to define the centreif the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium; the peak of the density; the centreof bcg; and the peak and centroid of x-ray luminosity. we find that the centreof bcg correlates more strongly with the minimum of the gravitational potentialthan the x-ray defined centres, while agn feedback acts to significantlyenhance the offset between the peak x-ray luminosity and minimum gravitationalpotential. these results highlight the importance of centre identification wheninterpreting clusters observations, in particular when comparing theoreticalpredictions and observational data.

astro-ph;0103082	bumpy power spectra and galaxy clusters	the evolution of the abundance of galaxy clusters is not a reliable measureof omega if there are features on scales of a few mpc in the primordial powerspectrum. conversely, if we know the cosmological model parameters from othermeasurements, the cluster abundance evolution permits us to probe features inthe power spectrum that are in the nonlinear regime at the present epoch, andhence difficult to discern directly from current epoch measurements.  we have investigated the influence of an artificially introduced gaussianfeature on an otherwise unperturbed scdm power spectrum. using these modifiedspectra as an input to cosmological n-body simulations, we are able to showthat in terms of the cluster abundance evolution, a scdm model displayscharacteristics similar to an ocdm model. however, strong modifications wouldalso be visible at a redshift z=0 in the dark matter power spectrum whereasminor alterations to the usual scdm spectrum are washed away by non-linearevolution effects. we therefore conclude that features with characteristicssuch as discussed here might not be detectable using observations of the galaxypower spectrum, the local cluster abundance or the large-scale velocity fieldas measured by the velocity distribution of galaxy clusters. the only quantitythat shows a pronounced difference at the present epoch between our modelsunder investigation is the halo-halo correlation function which appears to bestrongly biased with respect to an unmodified scdm model. this is due to a lackof power on certain scales which subsequently modifies the relative amplitudeof high-and low-k waves. apart from observations of the evolution of clusterabundance, measurements of the lyman-alpha forest at high redshift could putconstraints on possible features in the power spectrum, too.

astro-ph;0103503	mlapm - a c code for cosmological simulations	we present a computer code written in c that is designed to simulatestructure formation from collisionless matter. the code is purely grid-basedand uses a recursively refined cartesian grid to solve poisson's equation forthe potential, rather than obtaining the potential from a green's function.refinements can have arbitrary shapes and in practice closely follow thecomplex morphology of the density field that evolves. the timestep shortens bya factor two with each successive refinement. it is argued that an appropriatechoice of softening length is of great importance and that the softening shouldbe at all points an appropriate multiple of the local inter-particleseparation. unlike tree and p3m codes, multigrid codes automatically satisfythis requirement. we show that at early times and low densities in cosmologicalsimulations, the softening needs to be significantly smaller relative to theinter-particle separation than in virialized regions. tests of the ability ofthe code's poisson solver to recover the gravitational fields of bothvirialized halos and zel'dovich waves are presented, as are tests of the code'sability to reproduce analytic solutions for plane-wave evolution. the timesrequired to conduct a lcdm cosmological simulation for various configurationsare compared with the times required to complete the same simulation with theart, ap3m and gadget codes. the power spectra, halo mass functions andhalo-halo correlation functions of simulations conducted with different codesare compared.

astro-ph;0105183	two-body relaxation in cosmological simulations	it is logically possible that early two-body relaxation in simulations ofcosmological clustering influences the final structure of massive clusters.convergence studies in which mass and spatial resolution are simultaneouslyincreased, cannot eliminate this possibility. we test the importance oftwo-body relaxation in cosmological simulations with simulations in which thereare two species of particles. the cases of two mass ratios, sqrt(2):1 and 4:1,are investigated. simulations are run with both a spatially fixed softeninglength and adaptive softening using the publicly available codes gadget andmlapm, respectively.  the effects of two-body relaxation are detected in both the density profilesof halos and the mass function of halos. the effects are more pronounced with afixed softening length, but even in this case they are not so large as tosuggest that results obtained with one mass species are significantly affectedby two-body relaxation.  the simulations that use adaptive softening are less affected by two-bodyrelaxation and produce slightly higher central densities in the largest halos.they run about three times faster than the simulations that use a fixedsoftening length.

astro-ph;0105316	merger histories in warm dark matter structure formation scenario	observations on galactic scales seem to be in contradiction with recent highresolution n-body simulations. this so-called cold dark matter (cdm) crisis hasbeen addressed in several ways, ranging from a change in fundamental physics byintroducing self-interacting cold dark matter particles to a tuning of complexastrophysical processes such as global and/or local feedback. all these effortsattempt to soften density profiles and reduce the abundance of satellites insimulated galaxy halos. in this paper, we explore a somewhat different approachwhich consists of filtering the dark matter power spectrum on small scales,thereby altering the formation history of low mass objects. the physicalmotivation for damping these fluctuations lies in the possibility that the darkmatter particles have a different nature i.e. are warm (wdm) rather than cold.we show that this leads to some interesting new results in terms of the mergerhistory and large-scale distribution of low mass halos, as compared to thestandard cdm scenario. however, wdm does not appear to be the ultimatesolution, in the sense that it is not able to fully solve the cdm crisis, eventhough one of the main drawbacks, namely the abundance of satellites, can beremedied. indeed, the cuspiness of the halo profiles still persists, at allredshifts, and for all halos and sub-halos that we investigated. despite thepersistence of the cuspiness problem of dm halos, wdm seems to be still worthtaking seriously, as it alleviates the problems of overabundant sub-structuresin galactic halos and possibly the lack of angular momentum of simulated diskgalaxies. wdm also lessens the need to invoke strong feedback to solve theseproblems, and may provide a natural explanation of the clustering propertiesand ages of dwarfs.

astro-ph;0302443	top-down fragmentation of a warm dark matter filament	we present the first high-resolution n-body simulations of the fragmentationof dark matter filaments. such fragmentation occurs in top-down scenarios ofstructure formation, when the dark matter is warm instead of cold. in aprevious paper (knebe et al. 2002, hereafter paper i), we showed that wdmdiffers from the standard cold dark matter (cdm) mainly in the formationhistory and large-scale distribution of low-mass haloes, which form later andtend to be more clustered in wdm than in cdm universes, tracing more closelythe filamentary structures of the cosmic web. therefore, we focus ourcomputational effort in this paper on one particular filament extracted from awdm cosmological simulation and compare in detail its evolution to that of thesame cdm filament. we find that the mass distribution of the halos forming viafragmentation within the filament is broadly peaked around a jeans mass of afew 10^9 msun, corresponding to a gravitational instability of smooth regionswith an overdensity contrast around 10 at these redshifts. our results confirmthat wdm filaments fragment and form gravitationally bound haloes in a top-downfashion, whereas cdm filaments are built bottom-up, thus demonstrating theimpact of the nature of the dark matter on dwarf galaxy properties.

astro-ph;0311202	anisotropy in the distribution of satellite galaxy orbits	nearby clusters such as virgo and coma possess galaxy distributions whichtend to be aligned with the principal axis of the cluster itself. this has alsobeen confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of some 300 abell clusterswhere the effect has been linked to the dynamical state of the cluster.moreover, the orbits of satellite galaxies in galactic systems like our ownmilky way also demonstrate a high degree of anisotropy - the so-called holmbergeffect, the origin of which has been the subject of debate for more than 30years. this study presents the analysis of cosmological simulations focusing onthe orbits of satellite galaxies within dark matter halos. the apocentres ofthe orbits of these satellites are preferentially found within a cone ofopening angle ~40 around the major axis of the host halo, in accordance withthe observed anisotropy found in galaxy clusters. we do, however, note that alink to the dynamical age of the cluster is not well established as both ouroldest dark matter halos do show a clear anisotropy signal. further analysisconnects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along thefilaments: the orbits are determined rather by the environment of the host halothan some "dynamical selection" during their life within the host's virialradius.

astro-ph;0404255	the evolution of substructure ii: linking dynamics to environment	we present results from a series of high-resolution n-body simulations thatfocus on the formation and evolution of eight dark matter halos, each of ordera million particles within the virial radius. we follow the time evolution ofhundreds of satellite galaxies with unprecedented time resolution, relatingtheir physical properties to the differing halo environmental conditions. theself-consistent cosmological framework in which our analysis was undertakenallows us to explore satellite disruption within live host potentials, anatural complement to earlier work conducted within static potentials. our hosthalos were chosen to sample a variety of formation histories, ages, andtriaxialities; despite their obvious differences, we find striking similaritieswithin the associated substructure populations. namely, all satellite orbitsfollow nearly the same eccentricity distribution with a correlation betweeneccentricity and pericentre. we also find that the destruction rate of thesubstructure population is nearly independent of the mass, age, and triaxialityof the host halo. there are, however, subtle differences in the velocityanisotropy of the satellite distribution. we find that the local velocity biasat all radii is greater than unity for all halos and this increases as we movecloser to the halo centre, where it varies from 1.1 to 1.4. for the globalvelocity bias we find a small but slightly positive bias, although when werestrict the global velocity bias calculation to satellites that have had atleast one orbit, the bias is essentially removed.

(2003) that the milky way satellites are found preferentiallycloser to the galactic centre and simulations underestimate the amount ofcentral substructure, respectively. further, this universal substructureprofile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. boththe halo finder mhf and the halo tracker mht will become part of the opensource mlapm distribution.

astro-ph;0404427	the evolution of substructure iii: the outskirts of clusters	we present an investigation of satellite galaxies in the outskirts of galaxyclusters taken from a series of high-resolution n-body simulations. we focus onthe so-called "backsplash population", i.e. satellite galaxies that once wereinside the virial radius of the host but now reside beyond it. we find thatthis population is significant in number and needs to be appreciated wheninterpreting the various galaxy morphology environmental relationships anddecoupling the degeneracy between nature and nurture. specifically, we findthat approximately half of the galaxies with current clustercentric distance inthe interval 1-2 virial radii of the host are backsplash galaxies which oncepenetrated deep into the cluster potential, with 90% of these entering towithin 50% of the virial radius. these galaxies have undergone significanttidal disruption, loosing on average 40% of their mass. this results in a massfunction for the backsplash population different to those galaxies infallingfor the first time. we further show that these two populations arekinematically distinct and should be observable within existent spectroscopicsurveys.

astro-ph;0507380	the importance of interactions for mass loss from satellite galaxies in  cold dark matter haloes	we investigate the importance of interactions between dark mattersubstructures for the mass loss they suffer whilst orbiting within a sample ofhigh resolution galaxy cluster mass cold dark matter haloes formed incosmological n-body simulations. we have defined a quantitative measure thatgauges the degree to which interactions are responsible for mass loss fromsubstructures. this measure indicates that interactions are more prominent inyounger systems when compared to older more relaxed systems. we show that thisis due to the increased number of encounters a satellite experiences and ahigher mass fraction in satellites. this is in spite of the uniformity in thedistributions of relative distances and velocities of encounters betweensubstructures within the different host systems in our sample. using a simplemodel to relate the net force felt by a single satellite to the mass loss itsuffers, we show that interactions with other satellites account for ~30% ofthe total mass loss experienced over its lifetime. the relation between the ageof the host and the importance of interactions increases the scatter about thismean value from ~25% for the oldest to ~45% for the youngest system we havestudied. we conclude that satellite interactions play a vital role in theevolution of substructure in dark matter halos and that a significant fractionof the tidally stripped material can be attributed to these interactions.

astro-ph;0512156	the sense of rotation of subhaloes in cosmological dark matter haloes	we present a detailed analysis of the velocity distribution and orientationof orbits of subhaloes in high resolution cosmological simulations of darkmatter haloes. we find a trend for substructure to preferentially revolve inthe same direction as the sense of rotation of the host halo: there is anexcess of prograde satellite haloes. throughout our suite of nine host haloes(eight cluster sized objects and one galactic halo) there are on average 59% ofthe satellites corotating with the host. even when including satellites out tofive virial radii of the host, the signal still remains pointing out therelation of the signal with the infall pattern of subhaloes. however, thefraction of prograde satellites weakens to about 53% when observing the dataalong a (random) line-of-sight and deriving the distributions in a way anobserver would infer them. this decrease in the observed prograde fraction hasits origin in the technique used by the observer to determine the sense ofrotation, which results in a possible misclassification of non-circular orbits.we conclude that the existence of satellites on corotating orbits is anotherprediction of the cold dark matter structure formation scenario, although therewill be difficulties to verify it observationally. since the galactic halosimulation gave the same result as the cluster-sized simulations, we assumethat the fraction of prograde orbits is independent of the scale of the system,though more galactic simulations would be necessary to confirm this.

astro-ph;0512281	the impact of box size on the properties of dark matter haloes in  cosmological simulations	we investigate the impact finite simulation box size has on the structuraland kinematic properties of cold dark matter haloes forming in cosmologicalsimulations. our approach involves generating a single realisation of theinitial power spectrum of density perturbations and studying how truncation ofthis power spectrum on scales larger than l_cut affects the structure of darkmatter haloes at z=0. in particular, we have examined the cases of l_cut =f_cut l_box with f_cut=1 (i.e. no truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. in common withprevious studies, we find that the suppression of long wavelength perturbationsreduces the strength of clustering, as measured by a suppression of the 2-pointcorrelation function xi(r), and reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes,as reflected in the depletion of the high mass end of the mass function n(m).interestingly, we find that truncation has little impact on the internalproperties of haloes. the masses of high mass haloes decrease in a systematicmanner as l_cut is reduced, but the distribution of concentrations isunaffected. on the other hand, the median spin parameter is ~50% lower in runswith f_cut&lt;1. we argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth phase ofthe halo's angular momentum by tidal torquing, and that the absence of anymeasurable trend in concentration and the weak trend observed in halo shapereflect the importance of virialisation and complex mass accretion historiesfor these quantities. these results are of interest for studies that requirehigh mass resolution and statistical samples of simulated haloes, such assimulations of the population of first stars. our analysis shows thatlarge-scale tidal fields have relatively little effect on the internalproperties of cold dark matter haloes and hence may be ignored in such studies.

astro-ph;0602394	machos in dark matter haloes	using eight dark matter haloes extracted from fully-self consistentcosmological n-body simulations, we perform microlensing experiments. ahypothetical observer is placed at a distance of 8.5 kpc from the centre of thehalo measuring optical depths, event durations and event rates towards thedirection of the large magellanic cloud. we simulate 1600 microlensingexperiments for each halo. assuming that the whole halo consists of machos, f =1.0, and a single macho mass is m_m = 1.0 msun, the simulations yield meanvalues of tau = 4.7^{+5.0}_{-2.2} 10^{-7} and gamma = 1.6^{+1.3}_{-0.6} 10^{-6}events/star/year. we find that triaxiality and substructure can have majoreffects on the measured values so that tau and gamma values of up to threetimes the mean can be found. if we fit our values of tau and gamma to the machocollaboration observations (alcock et al. 2000), we find f =0.23^{+0.15}_{-0.13} and m_m = 0.44^{+0.24}_{-0.16}. five out of the eighthaloes under investigation produce f and m_m values mainly concentrated withinthese bounds.

0809.1439	phase-space density profiles in scale-free cosmologies	we use a set of high-resolution simulations of scale-free einstein-de sittercosmologies to investigate the logarithmic slope of the phase-space densityprofile $q(r) = \rho(r)/\sigma^3(r)$ of dark matter (dm) haloes. the initialconditions for the simulations are determined by a power law power spectrum ofthe form $p(k) \propto k^n$. we compute the q(r) profiles using the radial,tangential and full velocity dispersion, and the velocity anisotropy parameter,$\beta(r)$. we express q(r) as a single power-law $q(r) \propto r^\alpha$ andderive a median slope $\alpha$ in each simulation and for each definition of q.our main findings are: 1. the various q(r) profiles follow a power law to agood approximation. 2. the slopes depend on the concentration parameter c ofthe dm haloes, where for $c \gtrsim 10$ the slopes steepen with risingconcentration and for $c \lesssim 10$ the trend flattens and even turns around.3. the asymptotic value of $\beta$ as $r\to r_{\mathrm{vir}}$ increases withthe value of c. 4. in accordance with zait et al. 2007 $\alpha_{\mathrm{rad}}$becomes more negative as the asymptotic value of $\beta$ at the virial radiusincreases. 5. this introduces a weak dependence of the $q(r)$ slopes on theslope of the power spectrum.

astro-ph;0609361	triaxial vs. spherical dark matter halo profiles	when analysing dark matter halos forming in cosmological n-body simulationsit is common practice to obtain the density profile utilizing spherical shells.however, it is also known that the systems under investigation are far fromspherical symmetry and rather follow a triaxial mass distribution. in thisstudy we present an estimator for the error introduced by spherically averagingan elliptical mass distribution. we systematically investigate the differencesarising when using a triaxial density profile under the assumption of sphericalsymmetry. we show that the variance in the density can be as large as 50% inthe outer parts of dark matter halos for extreme (but still credible) axisratios of 0.55:0.67:1. the inner parts are less affected but still show ascatter at the 16% level for these prolate systems. for more moderateellipticities, i.e. axis ratios of 0.73:0.87:1, the error is smaller but stillas large as 10-20% depending on distance. we further provide a simple formulathat allows to estimate this variance as a function of radius for arbitraryaxis ratios. we conclude that highly prolate and/or oblate systems are betterfit by analytical profiles that take into account the triaxial nature ofcosmological objects.

astro-ph;9912257	on effects of resolution in dissipationless cosmological simulations	we present a study of numerical effects in dissipationless cosmologicalsimulations. the numerical effects are evaluated and studied by comparingresults of a series of 64^3-particle simulations of varying force resolutionand number of time steps, performed using three different n-body techniques:the particle mesh (pm), the adaptive p3m (ap3m) code, and the adaptiverefinement tree (art) code. this study can therefore be interesting both as ananalysis of numerical effects and as a systematic comparison of differentcodes. we find that the ap3m and the art codes produce similar results, giventhat convergence is reached within the code type. we also find that numericaleffects may affect the high-resolution simulations in ways that have not beendiscussed before. in particular, our study revealed the presence of two-bodyscattering, effects of which can be greatly amplified by inaccuracies of timeintegration. this process appears to affect the correlation function of matter,mass function and inner density of dark matter halos and other statistics atscales much larger than the force resolution, although different statistics maybe affected in different fashion. we discuss the conditions at which strongtwo-body scattering is possible and discuss the choice of the force resolutionand integration time step. furthermore, we discuss recent claims thatsimulations with force softening smaller than the mean interparticle separationare not trustworthy and argue that this claim is incorrect in general andapplies only to the phase-sensitive statistics. our conclusion is that,depending on the choice of mass and force resolution and integration time step,a force resolution as small as 0.01 of the mean interparticle separation can bejustified.
