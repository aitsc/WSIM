0903.1414	evidence for energy injection and a fine-tuned central engine at optical  wavelengths in grb 070419a	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral analysis ofthe fred grb 070419a. the early-time emission in the $\gamma$-ray and x-raybands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while atlate times the x-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. incontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ upto 10$^6$ s). we investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of thestandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical lightcurve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a lorenzfactor $\gamma \approx 350$ at this time. in contrast, the shallow opticaldecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shockcomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peaktime for it to be explained within the standard model. this predicts anincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emissionfrom t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. a highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due tounrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that isnot observed. we conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tunedenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required tocreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that areinvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical x-ray light curves of grbs.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0907.2462	a new analysis of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 051103, a  possible extragalactic sgr giant flare	grb 051103 is considered to be a candidate soft gamma repeater (sgr)extragalactic giant magnetar flare by virtue of its proximity on the sky tom81/m82, as well as its time history, localization, and energy spectrum. wehave derived a refined interplanetary network localization for this burst whichreduces the size of the error box by over a factor of two. we examine its timehistory for evidence of a periodic component, which would be one signature ofan sgr giant flare, and conclude that this component is neither detected nordetectable under reasonable assumptions. we analyze the time-resolved energyspectra of this event with improved time- and energy resolution, and concludethat although the spectrum is very hard, its temporal evolution at late timescannot be determined, which further complicates the giant flare association. wealso present new optical observations reaching limiting magnitudes of r &gt; 24.5,about 4 magnitudes deeper than previously reported. in tandem withserendipitous observations of m81 taken immediately before and one month afterthe burst, these place strong constraints on any rapidly variable sources inthe region of the refined error ellipse proximate to m81. we do not find anyconvincing afterglow candidates from either background galaxies or sources inm81, although within the refined error region we do locate two uv bright starforming regions which may host sgrs. a supernova remnant (snr) within the errorellipse could provide further support for an sgr giant flare association, butwe were unable to identify any snr within the error ellipse. these data stilldo not allow strong constraints on the nature of the grb 051103 progenitor, andsuggest that candidate extragalactic sgr giant flares will be difficult,although not impossible, to confirm.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

0709.3255	a new calibration of galactic cepheid period-luminosity relations from b  to k bands, and a comparison to lmc pl relations	the universality of the cepheid period-luminosity relations has been underdiscussion since metallicity effects have been assumed to play a role in thevalue of the intercept and, more recently, of the slope of these relations. thegoal of the present study is to calibrate the galactic pl relations in variousphotometric bands (from b to k) and to compare the results to thewell-established pl relations in the lmc. we use a set of 59 calibrating stars,the distances of which are measured using five different distance indicators:hubble space telescope and revised hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surfacebrightness and interferometric baade-wesselink parallaxes, and classicalzero-age-main-sequence-fitting parallaxes for cepheids belonging to openclusters or ob stars associations. a detailed discussion of absorptioncorrections and projection factor to be used is given. we find no significantdifference in the slopes of the pl relations between lmc and our galaxy. weconclude that the cepheid pl relations have universal slopes in all photometricbands, not depending on the galaxy under study (at least for lmc and milkyway). the possible zero-point variation with metal content is not discussed inthe present work, but an upper limit of 18.50 for the lmc distance modulus canbe deduced from our data.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1310.0313	grb 091024a and the nature of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts	we present a broadband study of gamma-ray burst (grb) 091024a within thecontext of other ultra-long-duration grbs. an unusually long burst detected bykonus-wind, swift, and fermi, grb 091024a has prompt emission episodes covering~1300 s, accompanied by bright and highly structured optical emission capturedby various rapid-response facilities, including the 2-m autonomous roboticfaulkes north and liverpool telescopes, kait, s-lotis, and sro. we alsoobserved the burst with 8- and 10-m class telescopes and determine the redshiftto be z = 1.0924 \pm 0.0004. we find no correlation between the optical andgamma-ray peaks and interpret the optical light curve as being of externalorigin, caused by the reverse and forward shock of a highly magnetized jet (r_b~ 100-200). low-level emission is detected throughout the near-backgroundquiescent period between the first two emission episodes of the konus-winddata, suggesting continued central-engine activity; we discuss the implicationsof this ongoing emission and its impact on the afterglow evolution andpredictions. we summarize the varied sample of historical grbs withexceptionally long durations in gamma-rays (&gt;~ 1000 s) and discuss thelikelihood of these events being from a separate population; we suggestultra-long grbs represent the tail of the duration distribution of the long grbpopulation.

1311.4340	new constraints on grb jet geometry and relativistic shock physics	we use high--quality, multi-band observations of swift grb120404a, fromgamma-ray to radio frequencies, together with the new hydrodynamics code of vaneerten et al. (2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1404.4085	interaction-powered supernovae: rise-time vs. peak-luminosity  correlation and the shock-breakout velocity	interaction of supernova (sn) ejecta with the optically thick circumstellarmedium (csm) of a progenitor star can result in a bright, long-lived shockbreakout event. candidates for such sne include type iin and superluminous sne.if some of these sne are powered by interaction, then there should be arelation between their peak luminosity, bolometric light-curve rise time, andshock-breakout velocity. given that the shock velocity during shock breakout isnot measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between therise time and the peak luminosity of these sne. here, we present a sample of 15sne iin for which we have good constraints on their rise time and peakluminosity from observations obtained using the palomar transient factory. wereport on a possible correlation between the r-band rise time and peakluminosity of these sne, with a false-alarm probability of 3%. assuming thatthese sne are powered by interaction, combining these observables and theoryallows us to deduce lower limits on the shock-breakout velocity. the lowerlimits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected forsne (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). this supports the suggestion that the early-time lightcurves of sne iin are caused by shock breakout in a dense csm. we note thatsuch a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms. performing such atest on other classes of sne (e.g., superluminous sne) can be used to rule outthe interaction model for a class of events.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

0804.1331	high resolution spectroscopy for cepheids distance determination. iii. a  relation between gamma-velocities and gamma-asymmetries	galactic cepheids in the vicinity of the sun have a residual line-of-sightvelocity, or gamma-velocity, which shows a systematic blueshift of about 2 km/scompared to an axisymmetric rotation model of the milky way. this term iseither related to the space motion of the star and, consequently, to thekinematic structure of our galaxy, or it is the result of the dynamicalstructure of the cepheids' atmosphere. we aim to show that these residualgamma-velocities are an intrinsic property of cepheids. we observed ninegalactic cepheids with the harps spectroscope, focusing specifically on 17spectral lines. for each spectral line of each star, we computed thegamma-velocity (resp. gamma-asymmetry) as an average value of the interpolatedradial velocity (resp. line asymmetry) curve. for each cepheid in our sample, alinear relation is found between the gamma-velocities of the various spectrallines and their corresponding gamma-asymmetries, showing that residualgamma-velocities stem from the intrinsic properties of cepheids. we alsoprovide a physical reference to the stellar gamma-velocity: it should be zerowhen the gamma-asymmetry is zero. following this definition, we provide veryprecise and physically calibrated estimates of the gamma-velocities for allstars of our sample. to understand this very subtle gamma-asymmetry effect,further numerical studies are needed. cepheids' atmosphere are stronglyaffected by pulsational dynamics, convective flows, nonlinear physics, andcomplex radiative transport. hence, all of these effects have to beincorporated simultaneously and consistently into the numerical models toreproduce the observed line profiles in detail.

astro-ph;0104329	rapid ubvri follow-up of the highly collimated optical afterglow of  grb010222	(abridged) we present the earliest optical observations of the opticalcounterpart to the grb 010222, obtained with the flwo 1.2-m telescope in ubvripassbands, starting 3.64 hours after the burst. we also present late r-bandobservations of the afterglow obtained with the 1.8-m vatt ~25 days after theburst. the temporal analysis of our data joined with published data indicates asteepening decay, independent of wavelength, asymptotically approachingt^{-0.80+/-0.05} at early times (t &lt;&lt; 1 day) and t^{-1.30+/-0.05} at latetimes, with a sharp break at t_b=0.72+/-0.1 days. this is the second earliestobserved break of any afterglow (after grb 980519), which clearly indicates theimportance of rapid multi-band follow-up for grb afterglow research. theoptical spectral energy distribution, corrected for small galactic reddening,can be fit fairly well by a single power-law with a slope of -1.07+/-0.09.however, when we fit using our bvri data only, we obtain a shallower slope of-0.88+/- 0.1, in excellent agreement with the slope derived from ourlow-resolution spectrum (-0.89 +/- 0.03). the spectral slope and light curvedecay slopes we derive are not consistent with a jet model despite the presenceof a temporal break. significant host dust extinction with a star-burstreddening law would flatten the spectral index to match jet predictions andstill be consistent with the observed spectral energy distribution. we derivean opening angle of 2.1 deg, smaller than any listed in the recent compilationof frail et al. the total beamed energy corrected for the jet geometry is4x10^50 erg, very close to the ``standard'' value of 5x10^50 erg found by frailet al. for a number of other bursts with light-curve breaks.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

astro-ph;0602163	evidence for a supernova associated with the x-ray flash 020903	we present ground-based and hubble space telescope optical observations ofthe x-ray flash (xrf) 020903, covering 300 days. the afterglow showed a veryrapid rise in the first day, followed by a relatively slow decay in the nextfew days. there was a clear bump in the light curve after ~25 days, accompaniedby a drastic change in the spectral energy distribution. the light curve andthe spectral energy distribution are naturally interpreted as the emergence --and subsequent decay -- of a supernova (sn), similar to sn 1998bw. at peakluminosity, the sn is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 mag fainter than sn1998bw.this argues in favor of the existence of a supernova associated with this x-rayflash. a spectrum obtained 35 days after the burst shows emission lines fromthe host galaxy. we use this spectrum to put an upper limit on the oxygenabundance of the host at [o/h] &lt; -0.6 dex. we also discuss a possible trendbetween the softness of several bursts and the early behavior of the opticalafterglow, in the sense that xrfs and x-ray rich grbs seem to have a plateauphase or even a rising light curve. this can be naturally explained in modelswhere xrfs are similar to grbs but seen off the jet axis.
