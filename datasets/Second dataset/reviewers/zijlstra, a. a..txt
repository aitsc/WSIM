0903.1123	the global gas and dust budget of the large magellanic cloud: agb stars  and supernovae, and the impact on the ism evolution	we report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the the interstellarmedium (ism) of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). recent observations from thespitzer space telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the lmc. this is the first time we canquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from agb stars over a completegalaxy, fully based on observations. the integrated mass-loss rate over allintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich agb candidates in the lmc is8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. this numbercould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich starsare included. this is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass starswhere formed, and the initial mass functions. agb stars are one of the mostimportant gas sources in the lmc, with supernovae (sne), which produces about2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. at the moment, the star formation rate exceedsthe gas feedback from agb stars and sne in the lmc, and the current starformation depends on gas already present in the ism. this suggests that as thegas in the ism is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline inthe lmc, unless gas is supplied externally. our estimates suggest `a missingdust-mass problem' in the lmc, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: theaccumulated dust mass from agb stars and possibly sne over the dust life time(400--800 myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ism. another dustsource is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

0905.1124	unusual dust emission from planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic study of a sample of 25planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds. the low-resolution modules are usedto analyze the dust features present in the infrared spectra. this studycomplements a previous work by the same authors where the same sample wasanalyzed in terms of neon and sulfur abundances. over half of the objects (14)show emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, typical of carbon-rich dustenvironments. we compare the hydrocarbon emission in our objects to those ofgalactic hii regions and planetary nebulae, and lmc/smc hii regions. amorphoussilicates are seen in just two objects, enforcing the now well-known-fact thatoxygen-rich dust is less common at low metallicities. besides these commonfeatures, some planetary nebulae show very unusual dust. nine objects show astrong silicon carbide feature at 11um and twelve of them show magnesiumsulfide emission starting at 25um. the high percentage of spectra with siliconcarbide in the magellanic clouds is not common. two objects show a broad bandwhich may be attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and weaklow-excitation atomic lines. it is likely that these nebulae are very young.the spectra of the remaining eight nebulae are dominated by the emission offine-structure lines with a weak continuum due to thermal emission of dust,although in a few cases the s/n in the spectra is low, and weak dust featuresmay not have been detected.

0706.3831	the massive expanding molecular torus in the planetary nebula ngc 6302	we measure the mass and kinematics of the massive molecular torus in theplanetary nebula ngc 6302. the nebula is the proto-typical butterfly nebula.the origin of the wing-like morphology is disputed: determining the mass-losshistory of the confining torus is an important step in understanding theformation of this structure. we performed submillimeter observations with jcmtand the sma interferometer. the continuum emission as well as the j=2-1 and 3-2transitions of 12co and 13co are analysed at arcsecond resolution. the coemission indicates a mass of the torus of ~ 2msun +/- 1msun. the 12co and 13coemission matches the dark lane seen in absorption in the halpha image of theobject. the co torus is expanding with a velocity of ~ 8 km/s, centred atvlsr=-31.5 km/s. the size and expansion velocity of the torus indicates thatthe torus was ejected from ~ 7500 yr to 2900 yr ago, with a mass-loss rate of5x10^{-4}msun/yr. we also see a ballistic component in the co images with avelocity gradient of 140 km/s/pc.  the derived mass-loss history of the torus favours binary interaction as thecause of the ejection of the torus. we predict the existence of a companionwith an orbital period p &lt; 1 month.

0906.2870	knots in the helix nebula found in h2	we present a deep and wide field-of-view (4'x 7') image of the planetarynebula (pn) ngc 7293 (the helix nebula) in the 2.12 micron h2 v=1-0 s(1) line.the excellent seeing (0.4'') at the subaru telescope, allows the details ofcometary knots to be examined. the knots are found at distances of 2.2'-6.4'from the central star (cs). at the inner edge and in the inner ring (up to 4.5'fromthe cs), the knot often show a `tadpole' shape, an elliptical head with abright crescent inside and a long tail opposite to the cs. in detail, there arevariations in the tadpole shapes, such as narrowing tails, widening tails,meandering tails, or multi-peaks within a tail. in the outer ring (4.5'-6.4'from the cs), the shapes are more fractured, and the tails do not collimateinto a single direction. the transition in knot morphology from the inner edgeto the outer ring is clearly seen. the number density of knots governs the h2surface brightness in the inner ring: h2 exists only within the knots. possiblemechanisms which contribute to the shaping of the knots are discussed,including photo-ionization and streaming motions. a plausible interpretation ofour images is that inner knots are being overrun by a faster wind, but thatthis has not (yet) reached the outer knots. based on h2 formation anddestruction rates, h2 gas can survive in knots from formation during the lateasymptotic giant branch (agb) phase throughout the pn phase. these observationsprovide new constraints on the formation and evolution of knots, and on thephysics of molecular gas embedded within ionized gas.

0909.2642	near-ir spectra of iphas extremely red galactic agb stars	we present a library of 139 near-ir spectra of cool asymptotic giant branchstars that will be useful for comparison with theoretical model atmospherecalculations and for modeling the integrated emission from intermediate-agestellar populations. the source list was selected from the `extremely red'region of the int photometric h alpha survey (iphas) colour-colour plane thatis overwhelmingly dominated by very late-type stars. the spectral library alsoincludes a large fraction of s-type and carbon stars. we present a number ofspectral classification sequences highlighting the various molecular featuresidentified and discuss a number of rare features with uncertain identificationsin the literature. with its focus on particularly cool photospheres thiscatalogue serves as a companion to recent spectroscopic atlases of mk standardsin the near-ir. finally the relationship between iphas (r'-i') and (r'-h alpha)colours and spectroscopically determined properties is discussed and a strongcorrelation between (r'-h alpha) colour and the c/o abundance index for s-typeand carbon stars is noted. this relation has the potential to separate o-rich,s-type and carbon stars in the galaxy based on their photometry alone.

0909.3857	the structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by iphas early a  stars	this study is an investigation of the stellar density profile of the galacticdisc in the anticentre direction. we select over 40,000 early a stars fromiphas photometry in the galactic longitude range 160 &lt; l &lt; 200 close to theequatorial plane (-1 &lt; b &lt; +1). we then compare their observedreddening-corrected apparent magnitude distribution with simulated photometryobtained from parameterised models in order to set constraints on theanticentre stellar density profile. by selecting a stars, we are appraising theproperties of a population only ~100 myrs old. we find the stellar densityprofile of young stars is well fit to an exponential with length scale of (3020\pm 120_{statistical} \pm 180_{systematic}) pc, which is comparable to thatobtained in earlier studies, out to a galactocentric radius of r_t = (13.0 \pm0.5_{statistical} \pm 0.6_{systematic}) kpc. at larger radii the rate ofdecline appears to increase with the scale length dropping to (1200 \pm300_{statistical} \pm 70_{systematic}) pc. this result amounts to a refinementof the conclusions reached in previous studies that the stellar density profileis abruptly truncated. the iphas a star data are not compatible with modelsthat propose a sudden change in metallicity at r_g = 10 kpc.

1004.1967	when an old star smolders: on the detection of hydrocarbon emission from  s-type agb stars	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) produce characteristic infraredemission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysicalenvironments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (uv)radiation. although pahs are expected to form in carbon-rich agb stars, theyhave up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companionprovides a hard radiation field. in this letter, we present low-resolutioninfrared spectra of four s-type agb stars, selected from a sample of 90 s-typeagb stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the spitzer satellite.the spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of pahmolecules. we confirm the correlation between the temperature of the centralstar and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a widevariety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 k. three offour sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lowertemperatures. we argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these s-starshas a rich aliphatic component. the fourth star, bz cma, deviates from thiscorrelation. based on the similarity with the evolved binary tu tau, we predictthat bz cma has a hot companion as well.

1006.1075	the orbital period of v458 vulpeculae, a post double common-envelope  nova	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of v458 vulpeculae (nova vul2007 no. 1) spread over a period of 15 months starting 301 days after itsdiscovery. our data reveal radial velocity variations in the heii {\lambda}5412and heii {\lambda}4686 emission lines. a period analysis of the radial velocitycurves resulted in a period of 98.09647 \pm 0.00025 min (0.06812255 \pm0.00000017 d) which we identify with the orbital period of the binary system.v458 vul is therefore the planetary nebula central binary star with theshortest period known. we explore the possibility of the system being composedof a relatively massive white dwarf (m1 \gsim 1.0 msun) accreting matter from apost-asymptotic giant branch star which produced the planetary nebula observed.in this scenario, the central binary system therefore underwent twocommon-envelope episodes. a combination of previous photoionisation modellingof the nebular spectra, post-asymptotic giant branch evolutionary tracks andthe orbital period favour a mass of m2 \sim 0.6 msun for the donor star.therefore, the total mass of the system may exceed the chandrasekhar mass,which makes v458 vul a type ia supernova progenitor candidate.

1006.5016	spitzer spectroscopy of mass loss and dust production by evolved stars  in globular clusters	we have observed a sample of 35 long-period variables and four cepheidvariables in the vicinity of 23 galactic globular clusters using the infraredspectrograph on the spitzer space telescope. the long-period variables in thesample cover a range of metallicities from near solar to about 1/40th solar.the dust mass-loss rate from the stars increases with pulsation period andbolometric luminosity. higher mass-loss rates are associated with greatercontributions from silicate grains. the dust mass-loss rate also depends onmetallicity. the dependence is most clear when segregating the sample by dustcomposition, less clear when segregating by bolometric magnitude, and absentwhen segregating by period. the spectra are rich in solid-state and molecularfeatures. emission from alumina dust is apparent across the range ofmetallicities. spectra with a 13-um dust emission feature, as well as anassociated feature at 20 um, also appear at most metallicities. molecularfeatures in the spectra include h_2o bands at 6.4-6.8 um, seen in both emissionand absorption, so_2 absorption at 7.3-7.5 um, and narrow emission bands fromco_2 from 13.5 to 16.8 um. the star lynga 7 v1 has an infrared spectrumrevealing it to be a carbon star, adding to the small number of carbon starsassociated with galactic globular clusters.

1102.4581	carbon chemistry in galactic bulge planetary nebulae	galactic bulge planetary nebulae show evidence of mixed chemistry withemission from both silicate dust and pahs. this mixed chemistry is unlikely tobe related to carbon dredge up, as third dredge-up is not expected to occur inthe low mass bulge stars. we show that the phenomenon is widespread, and isseen in 30 nebulae out of 40 of our sample, selected on the basis of theirinfrared flux. hst images and uves spectra show that the mixed chemistry is notrelated to the presence of emission-line stars, as it is in the galactic diskpopulation. we also rule out interaction with the ism as origin of the pahs.instead, a strong correlation is found with morphology, and the presence of adense torus. a chemical model is presented which shows that hydrocarbon chainscan form within oxygen-rich gas through gas-phase chemical reactions. the modelpredicts two layers, one at $a_v\sim 1.5$ where small hydrocarbons form fromreactions with c$^+$, and one at $a_v\sim 4$, where larger chains (and byimplication, pahs) form from reactions with neutral, atomic carbon. thesereactions take place in a mini-pdr. we conclude that the mixed chemistryphenomenon occurring in the galactic bulge planetary nebulae is best explainedthrough hydrocarbon chemistry in an uv-irradiated, dense torus.

0709.3065	vlt / infrared integral field spectrometer observations of molecular  hydrogen lines in the knots in the planetary nebula ngc 7293 (the helix  nebula)	knots are commonly found in nearby planetary nebulae (pne) and star formingregions. within pne, knots are often found to be associated with the brightestparts of the nebulae and understanding the physics involved in knots may revealthe processes dominating in pne. as one of the closest pne, the helix nebula(ngc 7293) is an ideal target to study such small-scale (~300 au) structures.we have obtained infrared integral spectroscopy of a comet-shaped knot in thehelix nebula using sinfoni on the very large telescope at high spatialresolution (50-125 mas). with spatially resolved 2 micron spectra, we find thatthe h2 rotational temperature within the cometary knots is uniform. therotational-vibrational temperature of the cometary knot (situated in theinnermost region of the nebula, 2.5 arcmin away from the central star), is 1800k, higher than the temperature seen in the outer regions (5-6 arcmin from thecentral star) of the nebula (900 k), showing that the excitation temperaturevaries across the nebula. the obtained intensities are reasonably well fittedwith 27 km s-1 c-type shock model. this ambient gas velocity is slightly higherthan the observed [heii] wind velocity of 13 km s-1. the gas excitation canalso be reproduced with a pdr (photo dominant region) model, but this requiresan order of magnitude higher uv radiation. both models have limitations,highlighting the need for models that treats both hydrodynamical physics andthe pdr.

0709.3199	spitzer space telescope spectral observations of agb stars in the fornax  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we have observed five carbon-rich agb stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal(dsph) galaxy, using the infrared spectrometer on board the spitzer spacetelescope. the stars were selected from a near-infrared survey of fornax andinclude the three reddest stars, with presumably the highest mass-loss rates,in that galaxy. such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-agepopulation (2-8 gyr old and metallicity of [fe/h] -1) of fornax. the primaryaim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosityand metallicity, by comparing agb stars in several galaxies with differentmetallicities. the spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfermodel. we find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 msunyr-1. the other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 msun yr-1. wefind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggestthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in therange 240 to 800. the c2h2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because ofthe higher c/o ratio. in contrast, the sic fraction is reduced at lowmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. the total mass-loss rate from allknown carbon-rich agb stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is ofthe order of 2x10^-5 msun yr-1. this is much lower than that of the dwarfirregular galaxy wlm, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.the difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of wlm. thesuppressed gas-return rate to the ism accentuates the difference between therelatively gas-rich dwarf irregular and the gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies.our study will be useful to constrain gas and dust recycling processes in lowmetallicity galaxies.

(2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

0710.3010	it's a wonderful tail: the mass loss history of mira	recent observations of the mira ab binary system have revealed a surroundingarc-like structure and a stream of material stretching 2 degrees away inopposition to the arc. the alignment of the proper motion vector and thearc-like structure shows the structures to be a bow shock and accompanyingtail. we have successfully hydrodynamically modelled the bow shock and tail asthe interaction between the asymptotic giant branch (agb) wind launched frommira a and the surrounding interstellar medium. our simulations show that thewake behind the bow shock is turbulent: this forms periodic density variationsin the tail similar to those observed. we investigate the possiblity ofmass-loss variations, but find that these have limited effect on the tailstructure. the tail is estimated to be approximately 450,000 years old, and ismoving with a velocity close to that of mira itself. we suggest that theduration of the high mass-loss phase on the agb may have been underestimated.finally, both the tail curvature and the rebrightening at large distance can bequalitatively understood if mira recently entered the local bubble. this isestimated to have occured 17 pc downstream from its current location.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1208.4950	on the metallicity dependence of crystalline silicates in oxygen-rich  asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants	we investigate the occurrence of crystalline silicates in oxygen-rich evolvedstars across a range of metallicities and mass-loss rates. it has beensuggested that the crystalline silicate feature strength increases withincreasing mass-loss rate, implying a correlation between lattice structure andwind density. to test this, we analyse spitzer irs and infrared spaceobservatory sws spectra of 217 oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and 98red supergiants in the milky way, the large and small magellanic clouds andgalactic globular clusters. these encompass a range of spectral morphologiesfrom the spectrally-rich which exhibit a wealth of crystalline and amorphoussilicate features to 'naked' (dust-free) stars. we combine spectroscopic andphotometric observations with the grams grid of radiative transfer models toderive (dust) mass-loss rates and temperature. we then measure the strength ofthe crystalline silicate bands at 23, 28 and 33 microns. we detect crystallinesilicates in stars with dust mass-loss rates which span over 3 dex, down torates of ~10^-9 solar masses/year. detections of crystalline silicates are moreprevalent in higher mass-loss rate objects, though the highest mass-loss rateobjects do not show the 23-micron feature, possibly due to the low temperatureof the forsterite grains or it may indicate that the 23-micron band is goinginto absorption due to high column density. furthermore, we detect a change inthe crystalline silicate mineralogy with metallicity, with enstatite seenincreasingly at low metallicity.

0712.0384	initial data release from the int photometric h-alpha survey of the  northern galactic plane (iphas)	the int/wfc photometric h-alpha survey of the northern galactic plane (iphas)is an imaging survey being carried out in h-alpha, r' and i' filters, with thewide field camera (wfc) on the 2.5-metre isaac newton telescope (int) to adepth of r'=20 (10 sigma). the survey is aimed at revealing large scalestructure in our local galaxy, and also the properties of key early and latepopulations making up the milky way. mapping emission line objects enables aparticular focus on objects in the young and old stages of stellar evolutionranging from early t-tauri stars to late planetary nebulae. in this paper wepresent the iphas initial data release, primarily a photometric catalogue ofabout 200 million unique objects, coupled with associated image data coveringabout 1600 square degrees in three passbands. we note how access to the primarydata products has been implemented through use of standard virtual observatorypublishing interfaces. simple traditional web access is provided to the mainiphas photometric catalogue, in addition to a number of common catalogues (suchas 2mass) which are of immediate relevance. access through the astrogrid vodesktop opens up the full range of analysis options, and allows fullintegration with the wider range of data and services available through thevirtual observatory. the idr represents the largest dataset published primarilythrough vo interfaces to date, and so stands as an examplar of the future ofsurvey data mining. examples of data access are given, including across-matching of iphas photometry with sources in the ukidss galactic planesurvey that validates the existing calibration of the best data.

1303.5607	3he: does the problem persists?	to understand the chemical evolution of the galaxy, we need to understand thecontribution of pne in the 3he abundance. 3he abundances have been detectedonly in a couple of pne, their abundances are consistent with the standardmodels, in which 3he is produced in significant quantities by stars of1-2m_sun. however, for all the other pne observed to date there have been nodetections, therefore only upper limits in their abundance can be calculated.observations of the 3he+ emission line using the vla towards the pne ic 418,ngc 6572 and ngc 7009 were used to obtain upper limits for their 3he abundance.because the abundance of 3he in hii regions, the ism and the proto-solar systemis much lower than what is predicted, new chemical models were proposed. theresulting evolution of 3he, based on stellar evolution models, can beconsistent with the values determined in pre-solar material and the ism if 96percent of the population of stars with mass below 2.5m_sun has undergoneenhanced 3he depletion. this implies that unless the combined sample of pnethat has been observed so far is very atypical, the solution to the "the 3heproblem" lies elsewhere. however, the results presented here suggest that moreobservations are needed in order to make a strong conclusion about the stellarevolution models.

1307.5711	alignment of the angular momentum vectors of planetary nebulae in the  galactic bulge	we use high-resolution h {\alpha} images of 130 planetary nebulae (pne) toinvestigate whether there is a preferred orientation for pne within thegalactic bulge. the orientations of the full sample have an uniformdistribution. however, at a significance level of 0.01, there is evidence for anon-uniform distribution for those planetary nebulae with evident bipolarmorphology. if we assume that the bipolar pne have an unimodal distribution ofthe polar axis in galactic coordinates, the mean galactic position angle isconsistent with 90{\deg}, i.e. along the galactic plane, and the significancelevel is better than 0.001 (the equivalent of a 3.7{\sigma} significance levelfor a gaussian distribution).  the shapes of pne are related to angular momentum of the original star orstellar system, where the long axis of the nebula measures the angular momentumvector. in old, low-mass stars, the angular momentum is largely in binaryorbital motion. consequently, the alignment of bipolar nebulae that we havefound indicates that the orbital planes of the binary systems are orientedperpendicular to the galactic plane. we propose that strong magnetic fieldsaligned along the galactic plane acted during the original star formationprocess to slow the contraction of the star forming cloud in the directionperpendicular to the plane. this would have produced a propensity for widerbinaries with higher angular momentum with orbital axes parallel to thegalactic plane. our findings provide the first indication of a strong,organized magnetic field along the galactic plane that impacted on the angularmomentum vectors of the resulting stellar population.

1312.0272	submillimeter polarisation and magnetic field properties in the  envelopes of proto-planetary nebulae crl 618 and oh 231.8+4.2	we have carried out continuum and line polarisation observations of twoproto-planetary nebulae (ppne), crl 618 and oh 231.8+4.2, using thesubmillimeter array (sma) in its compact configuration. the frequency range ofobservations, 330-345 ghz, includes the co(j=3-2) line emission. crl 618 and oh231.8+4.2 show quadrupolar and bipolar optical lobes, respectively, surroundedby a dusty envelope reminiscent of their agb phase. we report a detection ofdust continuum polarised emission in both ppne above 4 sigma but no molecularline polarisation detection above a 3 sigma limit. oh 231.8+4.2 is slightlymore polarised on average than crl 618 with a mean fractional polarisation of4.3 and 0.3 per cent, respectively. this agrees with the previous finding thatsilicate dust shows higher polarisation than carbonaceous dust. in bothobjects, an anti-correlation between the fractional polarisation and theintensity is observed. neither ppne show a well defined toroidal equatorialfield, rather the field is generally well aligned and organised along the polardirection. this is clearly seen in crl 618 while in the case of oh 231.8+4.2,the geometry indicates an x-shaped structure coinciding overall with adipole/polar configuration. however in the later case, the presence of afragmented and weak toroidal field should not be discarded. finally, in bothppne, we observed that the well organised magnetic field is parallel with themajor axis of the 12co outflow. this alignment could indicate the presence of amagnetic outflow launching mechanism. based on our new high resolution data wepropose two scenarios to explain the evolution of the magnetic field in evolvedstars.

1402.2485	modelling the alumina abundance of oxygen-rich evolved stars in the  large magellanic cloud	in order to determine the composition of the dust in the circumstellarenvelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars we have computed agrid of modust radiative-transfer models for a range of dust compositions,mass-loss rates, dust shell inner radii and stellar parameters. we compare theresulting colours with the observed oxygen-rich agb stars from the sage-speclarge magellanic cloud (lmc) sample, finding good overall agreement for starswith a mid-infrared excess. we use these models to fit a sample of 37 o-richagb stars in the lmc with optically thin circumstellar envelopes, for which5$-$35-$\mu$m spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) spectra and broadbandphotometry from the optical to the mid-infrared are available. from themodelling, we find mass-loss rates in the range $\sim 8\times10^{-8}$ to$5\times10^{-6}$ m$_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, and we show that a grainmixture consisting primarily of amorphous silicates, with contributions fromamorphous alumina and metallic iron provides a good fit to the observedspectra. furthermore, we show from dust models that the akari [11]$-$[15]versus [3.2]$-$[7] colour-colour diagram, is able to determine the fractionalabundance of alumina in o-rich agb stars.

1403.1856	pah formation in o-rich planetary nebulae	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) have been observed in o-richplanetary nebulae towards the galactic bulge. this combination of oxygen-richand carbon-rich material, known as dual-dust or mixed chemistry, is notexpected to be seen around such objects. we recently proposed that pahs couldbe formed from the photodissociation of co in dense tori. in this work, usingvisir/vlt, we spatially resolved the emission of the pah bands and ionisedemission from the [siv] line, confirming the presence of dense central tori inall the observed o-rich objects. furthermore, we show that for most of theobjects, pahs are located at the outer edge of these dense/compact tori, whilethe ionised material is mostly present in the inner parts of these tori,consistent with our hypothesis for the formation of pahs in these systems. thepresence of a dense torus has been strongly associated with the action of acentral binary star and, as such, the rich chemistry seen in these regions mayalso be related to the formation of exoplanets in post-common-envelope binarysystems.

1403.6715	the ionization structure of multiple shell planetary nebulae: i. ngc  2438	in recent times an increasing number of extended haloes and multiple shellsaround planetary nebulae have been discovered. these faint extensions to themain nebula trace the mass-loss history of the star, modified by the subsequentevolution of the nebula. integrated models predict that some haloes may berecombining, and not in ionization equilibrium. but parameters such as theionization state and thus the contiguous excitation process are not well known.the haloes are very extended, but faint in surface brightness - 10^3 timesbelow the main nebula. the observational limits lead to the need of anextremely well studied main nebula, to model the processes in the shells andhaloes of one object. ngc2438 is a perfect candidate to explore the physicalcharacteristics of the halo. long-slit spectroscopic data were obtained. thesedata are supplemented by imaging data from the hst archive, and archival vlaobservations. the use of diagnostic diagrams draws limits for physicalproperties in the models. cloudy is used to model the nebular properties, andto derive a more accurate distance and ionized mass. we derive an accurateextinction e(b-v)=0.16, and distance of 1.9kpc. this puts the nebula behind thenearby open cluster m46. the low-excitation species are found to be dominatedby clumps. the emission line ratios show no evidence for shocks. we find theshell in ionization equilibrium: a significant amount of uv radiationinfiltrates the inner nebula. thus the shell still seems to be ionized. thespatially resolved cloudy model supports the hypothesis that photoionization isthe dominant process in this nebula, far out into the shell. previous modelspredicted that the shell would be recombining, but this is not confirmed by thedata. we note that these models used a smaller distance, and thereforedifferent input parameters, than derived by us.

1404.2431	herschel planetary nebula survey (herplans) - first detection of oh+ in  planetary nebulae	we report the first detections of oh$^+$ emission in planetary nebulae (pne).as part of an imaging and spectroscopy survey of 11 pne in the far-ir using thepacs and spire instruments aboard the herschel space observatory, we performeda line survey in these pne over the entire spectral range between 51 and672$\mu$m to look for new detections. oh$^+$ rotational emission lines at152.99, 290.20, 308.48, and 329.77$\mu$m were detected in the spectra of threeplanetary nebulae: ngc 6445, ngc 6720, and ngc 6781. excitation temperaturesand column densities derived from these lines are in the range of 27 to 47 kand 2$\times$10$^{10}$ to 4 $\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. in pne,the oh+ rotational line emission appears to be produced in thephotodissociation region (pdr) in these objects. the emission of oh+ isobserved only in pne with hot central stars (t$_{eff}$ &gt; 100000 k), suggestingthat high-energy photons may play a role in the oh+ formation and its lineexcitation in these objects, as it seems to be the case for ultraluminousgalaxies.

1404.6353	accelerated post-agb evolution, initial-final mass relations, and the  star-formation history of the galactic bulge	we study the star-formation history of the galactic bulge, as derived fromthe age distribution of the central stars of planetary nebulae that belong tothis stellar population. the high resolution imaging and spectroscopicobservations of 31 compact planetary nebulae are used to derive their centralstar masses. the bloecker tracks with the cluster ifmr result in ages, whichare unexpectedly young. we find that the bloecker post-agb tracks need to beaccelerated by a factor of three to fit the local white dwarf masses. thisacceleration extends the age distribution. we adjust the ifmr as a freeparameter to map the central star ages on the full age range of bulge stellarpopulations. this fit requires a steeper ifmr than the cluster relation. wefind a star-formation rate in the galactic bulge, which is approximatelyconstant between 3 and 10 gyr ago. the result indicates that planetary nebulaeare mainly associated with the younger and more metal-rich bulge populations.the constant rate of star-formation between 3 and 10 gyr agrees withsuggestions that the metal-rich component of the bulge is formed during anextended process, such as a bar interaction.

1405.0800	the evolving spectrum of the planetary nebula hen 2-260	we analysed the planetary nebula hen 2-260 using optical spectroscopy andphotometry. we compared our observations with the data from literature tosearch for evolutionary changes. the nebular line fluxes were modelled with thecloudy photoionization code to derive the stellar and nebular parameters. theplanetary nebula shows a complex structure and possibly a bipolar outflow. thenebula is relatively dense and young. the central star is just starting $\rmo^+$ ionization ($\rm t_{eff} \approx 30,000 \, k$). comparison of ourobservations with literature data indicates a 50% increase of the [oiii] 5007\aa\ line flux between 2001 and 2012. we interpret it as the result of theprogression of the ionization of $\rm o^{+}$. the central star evolves tohigher temperatures at a rate of $\rm 45 \pm 7\,k\, yr^{-1}$. the heating rateis consistent with a final mass of $\rm 0.626 ^{+0.003}_{-0.005} \, m_{\odot}$or $\rm 0.645 ^{+0.008}_{-0.008} \, m_{\odot}$ for two different sets ofpost-agb evolutionary tracks from literature. the photometric monitoring of hen2-260 revealed variations on a timescale of hours or days. the variability maybe caused by pulsations of the star. the temperature evolution of the centralstar can be traced using spectroscopic observations of the surroundingplanetary nebula spanning a timescale of roughly a decade. this allows us toprecisely determine the stellar mass, since the pace of the temperatureevolution depends critically on the core mass. the kinematical age of thenebula is consistent with the age obtained from the evolutionary track. thefinal mass of the central star is close to the mass distribution peak forcentral stars of planetary nebulae found in other studies. the object belongsto a group of young central stars of planetary nebulae showing photometricvariability.

1412.7344	the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and  far-infrared dust emission from ngc 2403 and m83	we examine the relation between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission at 8 microns and far-infrared emission from hot dust grains at 24microns and from large dust grains at 160 and 250 microns in the nearby spiralgalaxies ngc 2403 and m83 using data from the spitzer space telescope andherschel space observatory. we find that the pah emission in ngc 2403 is bettercorrelated with emission at 250 microns from dust heated by the diffuseinterstellar radiation field (isrf) and that the 8/250 micron surfacebrightness ratio is well-correlated with the stellar surface brightness asmeasured at 3.6 microns. this implies that the pahs in ngc 2403 are intermixedwith cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ism) and thatthe pahs are excited by the diffuse isrf. in m83, the pah emission appears morestrongly correlated with 160 micron emission originating from large dust grainsheated by star forming regions. however, the pah emission in m83 is low wherethe 24 micron emission peaks within star forming regions, and enhancements inthe 8/160 micron surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dustand the star forming regions within the spiral arms. this suggests that thepahs observed in the 8 micron band are not excited locally within star formingregions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star formingregions or locally by young, non-photoionising stars that have migrateddownstream from the spiral density waves. the results from just these twogalaxies show that pahs may be excited by different stellar populations indifferent spiral galaxies.

1504.03349	witnessing the emergence of a carbon star	during the late stages of their evolution, sun-like stars bring the productsof nuclear burning to the surface. most of the carbon in the universe isbelieved to originate from stars with masses up to a few solar masses. althoughthere is a chemical dichotomy between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich evolvedstars, the dredge-up itself has never been directly observed. in the last threedecades, however, a few stars have been shown to display both carbon- andoxygen-rich material in their circumstellar envelopes. two models have beenproposed to explain this dual chemistry: one postulates that a recent dredge-upof carbon produced by nucleosynthesis inside the star during the asymptoticgiant branch changed the surface chemistry of the star. the other modelpostulates that oxygen-rich material exists in stable keplerian rotation aroundthe central star. the two models make contradictory, testable, predictions onthe location of the oxygen-rich material, either located further from the starthan the carbon-rich gas, or very close to the star in a stable disk. using thefaint object infrared camera (forcast) instrument on board the stratosphericobservatory for infrared astronomy (sofia) telescope, we obtained images of thecarbon-rich planetary nebula (pn) bd+30 3639 which trace both carbon-richpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and oxygen-rich silicate dust. with thesuperior spectral coverage of sofia, and using a 3d photoionisation and dustradiative transfer model we prove that the o-rich material is distributed in ashell in the outer parts of the nebula, while the c-rich material is located inthe inner parts of the nebula. these observations combined with the model,suggest a recent change in stellar surface composition for the double chemistryin this object. this is evidence for dredge-up occurring ~1000yr ago.

0807.2998	the magellanic zoo: mid-infrared spitzer spectroscopy of evolved stars  and circumstellar dust in the magellanic clouds	we observed a sample of evolved stars in the large and small magellanicclouds (lmc and smc) with the infrared spectrograph on the spitzer spacetelescope. comparing samples from the smc, lmc, and the galaxy reveals that thedust-production rate depends on metallicity for oxygen-rich stars, but carbonstars with similar pulsation properties produce similar quantities of dust,regardless of their initial metallicity. other properties of the oxygen-richstars also depend on metallicity. as the metallicity decreases, the fraction ofnaked (i.e. dust-free) stars increases, and among the naked stars, the strengthof the 8 um absorption band from sio decreases. our sample includes severalmassive stars in the lmc with long pulsation periods which produce significantamounts of dust, probably because they are young and relatively metal rich.little alumina dust is seen in circumstellar shells in the smc and lmc, unlikein galactic samples. three oxygen-rich sources also show emission frommagnesium-rich crystalline silicates. many also show an emission feature at 14um. the one s star in our sample shows a newly detected emission featurecentered at 13.5 um. at lower metallicity, carbon stars with similar amounts ofamorphous carbon in their shells have stronger absorption from molecularacetylene (c_2h_2) and weaker emission from sic and mgs dust, as discovered inprevious studies.

astro-ph;0101107	the peculiar cluster hs 327 in the large magellanic cloud: can oh/ir  stars and carbon stars be twins?	the obscured oh/ir star iras05298-6957 in the lmc was recently noticed to bemember of the small double cluster hs 327 that also contains a carbon star (vanloon et al., 1998, a&amp;a 329, 169). hence they are coeval and have (nearly) thesame progenitor mass, which can only be understood if hot bottom burning (hbb)has prevented iras05298-6957 from being a carbon star. we present extensivevisual and near-ir photometric data for &gt;10^4 stars in and around hs 327, andspectroscopic data for some of the brightest agb stars amongst these.colour-magnitude diagrams are used to estimate the age for the cluster and itsmembers, and luminosities are derived for the stars for which spectra have beenobtained. the age for iras05298-6957 and the carbon star is estimated to beabout 200 myr. this corresponds to a main-sequence progenitor mass of about 4.0m_sun --- the first direct measurement of the lower mass threshold for hbb.this agrees with stellar evolution models that, however, fail to reproduce thelow luminosity of the carbon star.

astro-ph;0203234	the extended atmosphere and evolution of the rv tau star r scuti	we analyze iso/sws spectra of the rv tau star r scuti. the infrared spectraare dominated by h2o emission bands. the near- and mid-infrared excess isattributed to h2o; the dust contribution is less important. we also identifyco, sio and co2 bands. the various molecular emission bands originate from anextended atmosphere, an atmosphere above the photosphere. the extendedatmosphere of r sct is formed from matter which gradually have lifted up fromthe photosphere through the pulsations of the star.  in contrast to the abundant molecules around the star, the silicate dustfeature is weak and the dust mass-loss rate is only 10^{-11} solar mass peryear. this implies that there might be a process to inhibit dust formation frommolecules.  rv tau stars are commonly considered as post-agb stars. while a detached dustenvelope around r sct is consistent with such an interpretation, we show thatits period evolution is slower than expected. we argue that r sct may be athermal-pulsing agb star, observed in a helium-burning phase.

0808.2441	extremely red stellar objects revealed by iphas	we present photometric analysis and follow-up spectroscopy for a populationof extremely red stellar objects extracted from the point-source catalogue ofthe int photometric h-alpha survey (iphas) of the northern galactic plane. thevast majority of these objects have no previous identification. analysis ofoptical, near- and mid-infrared photometry reveals that they are mostlyhighly-reddened asymptotic giant branch stars, with significant levels ofcircumstellar material. we show that the distribution of these objects tracesgalactic extinction, their highly reddened colours being a product of bothinterstellar and circumstellar reddening. this is the first time that such alarge sample of evolved low-mass stars has been detected in the visual andallows optical counterparts to be associated with sources from recent infraredsurveys.  follow-up spectroscopy on some of the most interesting objects in the samplehas found significant numbers of s-type stars which can be clearly separatedfrom oxygen-rich objects in the iphas colour-colour diagram. we show that thisis due to the positions of different molecular bands relative to thenarrow-band h-alpha filter used for iphas observations. the iphas (r' -h-alpha) colour offers a valuable diagnostic for identifying s-type stars. aselection method for identifying s-type stars in the galactic plane is brieflydiscussed and we estimate that over a thousand new objects of this type may bediscovered, potentially doubling the number of known objects in this short butimportant evolutionary phase.

astro-ph;0501247	three-micron spectra of agb stars and supergiants in nearby galaxies	the dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied usinginfrared l-band spectra of agb stars (both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich) andm-type supergiants in the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc) andin the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy. the spectra cover sio bands foroxygen-rich stars, and acetylene (c2h2), ch and hcn bands for carbon-rich agbstars. the equivalent width of acetylene is found to be high even at lowmetallicity. the high c2h2 abundance can be explained with a highcarbon-to-oxygen (c/o) ratio for lower metallicity carbon stars. in contrast,the hcn equivalent width is low: fewer than half of the extra-galactic carbonstars show the 3.5micron hcn band, and only a few lmc stars show high hcnequivalent width. hcn abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbonelemental abundances. the amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initialmass, and stars with high luminosity (i.e. high initial mass) could have a highhcn abundance. ch bands are found in both the extra-galactic and galacticcarbon stars. none of the oxygen-rich lmc stars show sio bands, except onepossible detection in a low quality spectrum. the limits on the equivalentwidths of the sio bands are below the expectation of up to 30angstrom for lmcmetallicity. several possible explanations are discussed. the observationsimply that lmc and smc carbon stars could reach mass-loss rates as high astheir galactic counterparts, because there are more carbon atoms available andmore carbonaceous dust can be formed. on the other hand, the lack of siosuggests less dust and lower mass-loss rates in low-metallicity oxygen-richstars. the effect on the ism dust enrichment is discussed.

astro-ph;0607303	detection of a far-infrared bow-shock nebula around r hya: the first  miriad results	we present the first results of the miriad (mips [multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer] infra-red imaging of agb [asymptotic giant branch]dustshells) project using the spitzer space telescope. the primary aim of theproject is to probe the material distribution in the extended circumstellarenvelopes (cse) of evolved stars and recover the fossil record of their massloss history. hence, we must map the whole of the cses plus the surrounding skyfor background subtraction, while avoiding the central star that is brighterthan the detector saturation limit. with our unique mapping strategy, we haveachieved better than one mjy/sr sensitivity in three hours of integration andsuccessfully detected a faint (&lt; 5 mjy/sr), extended (~400 arcsec) far-infrarednebula around the agb star r hya. based on the parabolic structure of thenebula, the direction of the space motion of the star with respect to thenebula shape, and the presence of extended h alpha emission co-spatial to thenebula, we suggest that the detected far-ir nebula is due to a bow shock at theinterface of the interstellar medium and the agb wind of this moving star. thisis the first detection of the stellar-wind bow-shock interaction for an agbstar and exemplifies the potential of spitzer as a tool to examine the detailedstructure of extended far-ir nebulae around bright central sources. \

astro-ph;0608108	the "principes de asturias" nebula: a new quadrupolar planetary nebula  from the iphas survey	the isaac newton telescope photometric h-alpha survey (iphas) is currentlymapping the northern galactic plane reaching to r'=20 mag with typically 1"resolution. hundreds of planetary nebulae (pne), both point-like and resolved,are expected to be discovered. we report on the discovery of the first new pnfrom this survey: it is an unusual object located at a large galactocentricdistance and has a very low oxygen abundance. the nebula shows an intricatemorphology: there is an inner ring surrounding the central star, bright innerlobes with an enhanced waist, and very faint lobular extensions reaching up tomore than 100". we classify it as a quadrupolar pn, a rather unusual class ofplanetary showing two pairs of misaligned lobes. from long-slit spectroscopy wederive te[nii] =12800+-1000k, ne = 390+-40 cm-3, and chemical abundancestypical of peimbert's type i nebulae (he/h =0.13, n/o =1.8) with an oxygenabundance of 12 + log(o/h)=8.17+-0.15. a kinematic distance of 7.0 kpc isderived, implying an unusually large size of &gt;4 pc for the nebula. thephotometry of the central star indicates the presence of a relatively coolcompanion. this, and the evidence for a dense circumstellar disk andquadrupolar morphology, all of which are rare among pne, support the hypothesisthat this morphology is related to binary interaction.

astro-ph;0609036	massive young stellar objects in the large magellanic cloud: water  masers and eso-vlt 3-4 micron spectroscopy	we investigate the conditions of star formation in the large magellaniccloud. we have conducted a survey for water maser emission arising from massiveyoung stellar objects in the 30 doradus region (n 157) and several other h iiregions in the large magellanic cloud (n 105a, n 113 and n 160a). we haveidentified a new maser source in 30 dor at the systemic velocity of the lmc. wehave obtained 3-4 micron spectra, with the eso very large telescope, of twocandidate young stellar objects. n 105a irs1 shows h recombination lineemission and its spectral energy distribution (sed) and mid-infrared coloursare consistent with a massive young star ionising the molecular cloud. n 157birs1 is identified as an embedded young object, based on its sed and atentative detection of water ice. the data on these four h ii regions arecombined with mid-infrared archival images from the spitzer space telescope tostudy the location and nature of the embedded massive young stellar objects andsignatures of stellar feedback. our analysis of 30 dor, n 113 and n 160aconfirms the picture that the feedback from the massive o and b-type stars,which creates the h ii regions, also triggers further star formation on theinterfaces of the ionised gas and the surrounding molecular cloud. although inthe dense cloud n 105a star formation seems to occur without evidence ofmassive star feedback, the general conditions in the lmc seem favourable forsequential star formation as a result of feedback. in an appendix we presentwater maser observations of the galactic red giants r doradus and w hydrae.

astro-ph;0701054	magnetic fields in planetary nebulae and post-agb nebulae	magnetic fields are an important but largely unknown ingredient of planetarynebulae. they have been detected in oxygen-rich agb and post-agb stars, and mayplay a role in the shaping of their nebulae. here we present scubasub-millimeter polarimetric observations of four bipolar planetary nebulae andpost-agb stars, including two oxygen-rich and two carbon-rich nebulae, todetermine the geometry of the magnetic field by dust alignment. three of thefour sources (ngc 7027, ngc 6537 and ngc 6302) present a well-defined toroidalmagnetic field oriented along their equatorial torus or disk. ngc 6302 may alsoshow field lines along the bipolar outflow. crl 2688 shows a complex fieldstructure, where part of the field aligns with the torus, whilst an other partapproximately aligns with the polar outflow. it also presents markedasymmetries in its magnetic structure. ngc 7027 shows evidence for adisorganized field in the south-west corner, where the scuba shows anindication for an outflow. the findings show a clear correlation between fieldorientation and nebular structure.

astro-ph;9408039	bd+30 3639: the infrared spectrum during post-agb stellar evolution	we present a radiative-transfer calculation which reproduces the infraredspectrum of the planetary nebula bd~+30$^{\circ}$3639. we calculate thetransfer process through absorption and scattering in a spherical-symmetricmulti-grain dust shell. the emission of transiently heated particles is takeninto account, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. we obtain anacceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the pah infrared bands. atsubmillimetre wavelengths the observed emission is larger than the modelpredicts, indicating that large dust conglomerates (``f{}luffy grains'') may beneeded as an additional constituent. the fit favours a distance of $\ge 2\,$kpc, which implies that bd~+30$^\circ$3639 has evolved from a massiveprogenitor of several solar masses. a low dust-to-gas mass ratio is found inthe ionised region. the calculations yield an original mass-loss rate of$2\times10^{-4} \msolar \peryr$ on the asymptotic giant branch. using thismass-loss rate, we calculate how the infrared spectrum has evolved during thepost-agb evolution. we show in particular the evolution of the iras coloursduring the preceding post-agb evolution.

astro-ph;9705030	chemical abundances of planetary nebulae in the sagittarius dwarf  elliptical galaxy	spectrophotometry and imaging of the two planetary nebulae he2-436 andwray16-423, recently discovered to be in the sagittarius dwarf ellipticalgalaxy, are presented. wray16-423 is a high excitation planetary nebula (pn)with a hot central star. in contrast he2-436 is a high density pn with a coolercentral star and evidence of local dust, the extinction exceeding that forwray16-423 by e(b-v)=0.28. the extinction to wray16-423, (e(b-v)=0.14), isconsistent with the extinction to the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf. both pn showwolf-rayet features in their spectra, although the lines are weak inwray16-423. images in [o iii] and h-alpha+[n ii], although affected by poorseeing, yield a diameter of 1.2'' for wray16-423 after deconvolution; he~2-436was unresolved. he2-436 has a luminosity about twice that of wray16-423 and itssize and high density suggest a younger pn. in order to reconcile the differingluminosity and nebular properties of the two pn with similar age progenitorstars, it is suggested that they are on he burning tracks  the abundance pattern is very similar in both nebulae and shows an oxygendepletion of -0.4 dex with respect to the mean o abundance of galactic pn and[o/h] = -0.6. the sgr pn progenitor stars are representative of the highermetallicity tail of the sgr population. the pattern of abundance depletion issimilar to that in the only other pn in a dwarf galaxy companion of the milkyway, that in fornax, for which new spectra are presented. however theabundances are larger than for galactic halo pn suggesting a later formationage. the o abundance of the sgr galaxy deduced from its pn, shows similaritieswith that of dwarf ellipticals around m31, suggesting that this galaxy was adwarf elliptical before its interaction with the milky way.

astro-ph;9808322	mode switching in the nearby mira-like variable r doradus	we discuss visual observations spanning nearly 70 years of the nearbysemiregular variable r doradus. using wavelet analysis, we show that the starswitches back and forth between two pulsation modes having periods of 332 daysand about 175 days, the latter with much smaller amplitude. comparison withmodel calculations suggests that the two modes are the first and third radialovertone, with the physical diameter of the star making fundamental modepulsation unlikely. the mode changes occur on a timescale of about 1000 d,which is too rapid be related to a change in the overall thermal structure ofthe star and may instead be related to weak chaos.  the hipparcos distance to r dor is 62.4 +/- 2.8 pc which, taken with itsdominant 332-day period, places it exactly on the period-luminosity relation ofmiras in the large magellanic cloud. our results imply first overtone pulsationfor all miras which fall on the p-l relation. we argue that semiregularvariables with long periods may largely be a subset of miras and should beincluded in studies of mira behaviour. the semiregulars may contain theimmediate evolutionary mira progenitors, or stars may alternate between periodsof semiregular and mira behaviour.

0810.0401	a planetary nebula around nova v458 vul undergoing flash ionization	nova v458 vul erupted on 2007 august 8th and reached a visual magnitude of8.1 a few days later. h$\alpha$ images obtained six weeks before the outburstas part of the iphas galactic plane survey reveal an 18th magnitude progenitorsurrounded by an extended nebula. subsequent images and spectroscopy of thenebula reveal an inner nebular knot increasing rapidly in brightness due toflash ionization by the nova event. we derive a distance of 13 kpc based onlight travel time considerations, which is supported by two other distanceestimation methods. the nebula has an ionized mass of 0.2 m$_{\odot}$ and a lowexpansion velocity: this rules it out as ejecta from a previous nova eruption,and is consistent with it being a ~14,000 year old planetary nebula, probablythe product of a prior common envelope (ce) phase of evolution of the binarysystem. the large derived distance means that the mass of the erupting wdcomponent of the binary is high. we identify two possible evolutionaryscenarios, in at least one of which the system is massive enough to produce atype ia supernova on merging.

0810.2547	high spatial resolution galactic 3d extinction mapping with iphas	we present an algorithm ({\scshape mead}, for `mapping extinction againstdistance') which will determine intrinsic ($r' - i'$) colour, extinction, anddistance for early-a to k4 stars extracted from the iphas $r'/i'/\halpha$photometric database. these data can be binned up to map extinction in threedimensions across the northern galactic plane. the large size of the iphasdatabase ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digitalphotometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allowextinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the solarcircle. high reddening within the solar circle on occasion brings this rangedown to $\sim 2$ kpc. the resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatlyexceeds that of previous empirical 3d extinction maps, enabling the structureof the galactic plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,unresolved ism substructure, and binarity. the impact of metallicityvariations, within the range typical of the galactic disc is small. theaccuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use ofsimulated photometry created with monte-carlo sampling techniques. the successof this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results arecompared to the literature.

0811.3295	a dense disk of dust around the born-again sakurai's object	in 1996, sakurai's object (v4334 sgr) suddenly brightened in the centre of afaint planetary nebula (pn). this very rare event was interpreted as thereignition of a hot white dwarf that caused a rapid evolution back to the coolgiant phase. from 1998 on, a copious amount of dust has formed continuously,screening out the star which has remained embedded in this expanding highoptical depth envelope. the new observations, reported here, are used to studythe morphology of the circumstellar dust in order to investigate the hypothesisthat sakurai's object is surrounded by a thick spherical envelope of dust. wehave obtained unprecedented, high-angular resolution spectro-interferometricobservations, taken with the mid-ir interferometer midi/vlti, which resolve thedust envelope of sakurai's object. we report the discovery of a unexpectedlycompact (30 x 40 milliarcsec, 105 x 140 au assuming a distance of 3.5 kpc),highly inclined, dust disk. we used monte carlo radiative-transfer simulationsof a stratified disk to constrain its geometric and physical parameters,although such a model is only a rough approximation of the rapidly evolvingdust structure. even though the fits are not fully satisfactory, some usefuland robust constraints can be inferred. the disk inclination is estimated to be75+/-3 degree with a large scale height of 47+/-7 au. the dust mass of the diskis estimated to be 6 10^{-5} solar mass. the major axis of the disk (132+/-3degree) is aligned with an asymmetry seen in the old pn that wasre-investigated as part of this study. this implies that the mechanismresponsible for shaping the dust envelope surrounding sakurai's object wasalready at work when the old pn formed.
