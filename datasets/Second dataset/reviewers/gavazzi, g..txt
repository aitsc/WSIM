0903.0602	the hi content of early-type galaxies from the alfalfa survey. ii. the  case of low density environments	we present the analysis of the hi content of a sample of early-type galaxies(etgs) in low-density environments (ldes) using the data set provided by thearecibo legacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. we compare their properties to thesample in the virgo cluster that we studied in a previous paper (di seregoalighieri et al. 2007, paper i). we have selected a sample of 62 nearby etgs(v&lt; 3000 km/s) in an area of the sky where the alfalfa data are alreadyavailable (8h&lt;ra&lt;16h, 4 deg&lt;dec&lt;16deg), avoiding the region of the virgocluster. among these, 39 have absolute b magnitudes fainter than m_b = -17.fifteen out of 62 galaxies have been firmly detected with alfalfa (\sim 25%).five additional galaxies show a weaker hi emission (s/n \sim 4) and they willneed deeper observations to be confirmed. all together, our analysis doublesthe number of known gas-rich etgs in this area. the hi detection rate is 44% inluminous etgs (m_b &lt; -17) and 13% in dwarf etgs (m_b &gt; -17). in both cases itis 10 times higher than that of the virgo cluster. the presence of gas can berelated to a recent star formation activity: 60% of all etgs with hi haveoptical emission line ratios typical of star-forming galaxies and blue colourssuggesting the presence of young stellar populations, especially in the dwarfsubsample. we show that the hi detection rate of etgs depends both on theenvironment and mass. the fraction of early-type systems with neutral hydrogenis higher in more massive objects when compared to early-type dwarfs. the etgsin ldes seem to have more heterogeneous properties than their virgo clustercounterparts, since they are able to retain a cold interstellar gas componentand to support star formation activity even at recent epochs.

0707.0999	the census of nuclear activity of late-type galaxies in the virgo  cluster	the first spectroscopic census of agns associated to late-type galaxies inthe virgo cluster is carried on by observing 213 out of a complete set of 237galaxies more massive than m_dyn&gt;10^{8.5} solar masses. among them, 77 areclassified as agns (including 21 transition objects, 47 liners and 9 seyferts),and comprize 32% of the late-type galaxies in virgo. due to spectroscopicincompleteness at most 21 agns are missed in the survey, so that the fractionwould increase up to 41%. using corollary near-ir observations, that enable usto estimate galaxies dynamical masses, it is found that agns are hostedexclusively in massive galaxies, i.e. m_dyn\gsim 10^{10} solar masses. theirfrequency increases steeply with the dynamical mass from zero atm_dyn\approx10^{9.5} solar masses to virtually 1 at m_dyn&gt;10^{11.5} solarmasses. these frequencies are consistent with the ones of low luminosity agnsfound in the general field by the sdss. massive galaxies that harbor agnscommonly show conspicuous r-band star-like nuclear enhancements. converselythey often, but not necessarily contain massive bulges. few well known agns(e.g. m61, m100, ngc4535) are found in massive sc galaxies with little or nobulge. the agn fraction seems to be only marginally sensitive to galaxyenvironment. we infer the black hole masses using the known scaling relationsof quiescent black holes. no black holes lighter than $\sim 10^6$ \msol arefound active in our sample.

0910.3521	high mass star formation in normal late-type galaxies: observational  constraints to the imf	we use halpha and fuv galex data for a large sample of nearby objects tostudy the high mass star formation activity of normal late-type galaxies. thedata are corrected for dust attenuation using the most accurate techniques atpresent available, namely the balmer decrement and the total far-infrared tofuv flux ratio. the sample shows a highly dispersed distribution in the halphato fuv flux ratio indicating that two of the most commonly used star formationtracers give star formation rates with uncertainties up to a factor of 2-3. thehigh dispersion is due to the presence of agn, where the uv and the halphaemission can be contaminated by nuclear activity, highly inclined galaxies, forwhich the applied extinction corrections are probably inaccurate, or starburstgalaxies, where the stationarity in the star formation history required fortransforming halpha and uv luminosities into star formation rates is notsatisfied. excluding these objects we reach an uncertainty of ~50% on the sfr.the halpha to fuv flux ratio increases with their total stellar mass. iflimited to normal star forming galaxies, however, this relationship reduces toa weak trend that might be totally removed using different extinctioncorrection recipes. in these objects the halpha to fuv flux ratio seems alsobarely related with the fuv-h colour, the h band effective surface brightness,the total star formation activity and the gas fraction. the data are consistentwith a kroupa and salpeter initial mass function in the high mass stellar rangeand imply, for a salpeter imf, that the variations of the slope cannot exceed0.25, from g=2.35 for massive galaxies to g=2.60 in low luminosity systems. weshow however that these observed trends, if real, can be due to the differentmicro history of star formation in massive galaxies with respect to dwarf.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1207.4191	the role of cold gas and environment on the stellar mass - metallicity  relation of nearby galaxies	we investigate the relationship between stellar mass, metallicity and gascontent for a magnitude- and volume-limited sample of 260 nearby late-typegalaxies in different environments, from isolated galaxies to virgo clustermembers. we derive oxygen abundance estimates using new integrated, drift-scanoptical spectroscopy and the base metallicity calibrations of kewley &amp; ellison(2008). combining these measurements with ultraviolet to near-infraredphotometry and hi 21 cm line observations, we examine the relations betweenstellar mass, metallicity, gas mass fraction and star formation rate. we findthat, at fixed stellar mass, galaxies with lower gas fractions typically alsopossess higher oxygen abundances. we also observe a relationship between gasfraction and metal content, whereby gas-poor galaxies are typically moremetal-rich, and demonstrate that the removal of gas from the outskirts ofspirals increases the observed average metallicity by approximately 0.1 dex.although some cluster galaxies are gas-deficient objects, statistically thestellar-mass metallicity relation is nearly invariant to the environment, inagreement with recent studies. these results indicate that internalevolutionary processes, rather than environmental effects, play a key role inshaping the stellar mass-metallicity relation. in addition, we presentmetallicity estimates based on observations of 478 nearby galaxies.

0801.2113	the origin of dwarf ellipticals in the virgo cluster	we study the evolution of dwarf (l_h &lt; 10^{9.6} l_ho) star forming andquiescent galaxies in the virgo cluster by comparing their uv to radiocentimetric properties to the predictions of multizone chemo-spectrophotometricmodels of galaxy evolution especially tuned to take into account theperturbations induced by the interaction with the cluster intergalactic medium.our models simulate one or multiple ram pressure stripping events and galaxystarvation. models predict that all star forming dwarf galaxies entering thecluster for the first time loose most, if not all, of their atomic gas content,quenching on short time scales (&lt; 150 myr) their activity of star formation.these dwarf galaxies soon become red and quiescent, gas metal-rich objects withspectrophotometric and structural properties similar to those of dwarfellipticals. young, low luminosity, high surface brightness star forminggalaxies such as late-type spirals and bcds are probably the progenitors ofrelatively massive dwarf ellipticals, while it is likely that low surfacebrightness magellanic irregulars evolve into very low surface brightnessquiescent objects hardly detectable in ground based imaging surveys. the smallnumber of dwarf galaxies with physical properties intermediate between those ofstar forming and quiescent systems is consistent with a rapid (&lt; 1 gyr)transitional phase between the two dwarf galaxies populations. these results,combined with statistical considerations, are consistent with the idea thatmost of the dwarf ellipticals dominating the faint end of the virgo luminosityfunction were initially star forming systems, accreted by the cluster andstripped of their gas by one or subsequent ram pressure stripping events.

0802.3020	uv dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies: ii calibrating the a(uv)  vs. l_tir/l_uv relation	we investigate the dependence of the total-infrared (tir) to uv luminosityratio method for calculating the uv dust attenuation a(uv) from the age of theunderlying stellar populations by using a library of spectral energydistributions for galaxies with different star formation histories. ouranalysis confirms that the tir/uv vs. a(uv) relation varies significantly withthe age of the underlying stellar population: i.e. for the same tir/uv ratio,systems with low specific star formation rate (ssfr) suffer a lower uvattenuation than starbursts. using a sample of nearby field and cluster spiralgalaxies we show that the use of a standard (i.e. age independent) tir/uv vs.a(uv) relation leads to a systematic overestimate up to 2 magnitudes of theamount of uv dust attenuation suffered by objects with low ssfr and inparticular hi-deficient star forming cluster galaxies. this result points outthat the age independent $tir/uv$ vs. $a(uv)$ relation cannot be used to studythe uv properties of large samples of galaxies including low star-formingsystems and passive spirals. therefore we give some simple empirical relationsfrom which the uv attenuation can be estimated taking into account itsdependence on the age of the stellar populations, providing a less biased viewof uv properties of galaxies.

1504.01876	halpha imaging of the herschel reference survey. the star formation  properties of a volume-limited, k-band-selected sample of nearby late-type  galaxies	we present new halpha+[nii] imaging data of late-type galaxies in theherschel reference survey aimed at studying the star formation properties of ak-band-selected, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. the halpha+[nii]data are corrected for [nii] contamination and dust attenuation using differentrecipes based on the balmer decrement and the 24mic luminosities. we show thatthe l(halpha) derived with different corrections give consistent results onlywhenever the uncertainty on the estimate of the balmer decrement is &lt;=0.1. weuse these data to derive the sfr of the late-type galaxies of the sample, andcompare these estimates to those determined using independent monochromatictracers (fuv, radio) or the output of sed fitting codes. this comparisonsuggests that the 24mic based dust extinction correction for halpha might benon universal, and that it should be used with caution in all objects with asfa, where dust heating can be dominated by the old stellar population.furthermore, because of the sudden truncation of the sfa of cluster galaxiesoccurring after their interaction with the surrounding environment, thestationarity conditions required to transform monochromatic fluxes into sfrmight not always be satisfied in tracers other than l(halpha). in a similarway, the parametrisation of the sfh generally used in sed fitting codes mightnot be adequate for these recently interacting systems. we then study the sfrluminosity distribution and the typical scaling relations of late-typegalaxies. we observe a systematic decrease of the ssfr with increasing stellarmass, stellar mass surface density, and metallicity. we also observe anincrease of the asymmetry and smoothness parameters measured in the halpha-bandwith increasing ssfr, probably induced by an increase of the contribution ofgiant hii regions to the halpha luminosity function in sf low-luminositygalaxies.

1505.07836	the role of bars in quenching star formation from z = 3 to the present  epoch. halpha3: an halpha imaging survey of hi selected galaxies from  alfalfa, vi	a growing body of evidence indicates that the star formation rate per unitstellar mass (ssfr) decreases with increasing mass in normal "main-sequence"star forming galaxies. many processes have been advocated as responsible forsuch a trend (also known as mass quenching), e.g., feedback from activegalactic nuclei (agns), and the formation of classical bulges. we determine arefined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local universe. tothis aim we use the halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey (halpha3) offield galaxies selected from the hi arecibo legacy fast alfa survey (alfalfa)in the coma and local superclusters. by complementing this local determinationwith high-redshift measurements from the literature, we reconstruct the starformation history of main-sequence galaxies as a function of stellar mass fromthe present epoch up to z=3. in agreement with previous studies, our analysisshows that quenching mechanisms occur above a threshold stellar mass m_kneethat evolves with redshift as propto (1+z)^{2}. moreover, visual morphologicalclassification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharpincrease in the fraction of visually-classified strong bars with mass, hintingthat strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the ssfr abovem_knee. we test this hypothesis using a simple but physically-motivatednumerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quenchstar formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. we conclude thatstrong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the innerparts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely requiredto quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies.intriguingly, when we extrapolate our model to higher redshifts, wesuccessfully recover the observed redshift evolution for m_knee.

0807.3282	the origin of the mu_e - m_b and kormendy relations in dwarf elliptical  galaxies	the present work is aimed at studying the distribution of galaxies ofdifferent types and luminosities along different structural scaling relationsto see whether massive and dwarf ellipticals have been shaped by the sameformation process. this exercise is here done by comparing the distribution ofvirgo cluster massive and dwarf ellipticals and star forming galaxies along theb band effective surface brightness and effective radius vs. absolute magnituderelations and the kormendy relation to the predictions of models tracing theeffects of ram-pressure stripping on disc galaxies entering the clusterenvironment and galaxy harassment. dwarf ellipticals might have been formedfrom low luminosity, late-type spirals that recently entered into the clusterand lost their gas because of a ram-pressure stripping event, stopping theiractivity of star formation. the perturbations induced by the abrupt decrease ofthe star formation activity are sufficient to modify the structural propertiesof disc galaxies into those of dwarf ellipticals. galaxy harassment induce atruncation of the disc and generally an increase of the effective surfacebrightness of the perturbed galaxies. the lack of dynamical simulations ofperturbed galaxies spanning a wide range in luminosity prevents us to drive anyfirm conclusion on a possible harassment-induced origin of the low surfacebrightness dwarf elliptical galaxy population inhabiting the virgo cluster.although the observed scaling relations are consistent with the idea that thedistribution of elliptical galaxies along the mentioned scaling relation isjust due to a gradual variation with luminosity of the sersic index n, thecomparison with models indicates that dwarf ellipticals might have been formedby a totally different process than giant ellipticals

0808.0093	the relationship between gas content and star formation rate in spiral  galaxies. comparing the local field with the virgo cluster	despite many studies of the star formation in spiral galaxies, a complete andcoherent understanding of the physical processes that regulate the birth ofstars has not yet been achieved, nor a unanimous consent was reached, despitethe many attempts, on the effects of the environment on the star formation ingalaxies member of rich clusters. we focus on the local and global schmidt lawand we investigate how cluster galaxies have their star formation activityperturbed. we collect multifrequency imaging for a sample of spiral galaxies,member of the virgo cluster and of the local field; we compute the surfacedensity profiles for the young and for the bulk of the stellar components, forthe molecular and for the atomic gas. our analysis shows that the bulk of thestar formation correlates with the molecular gas, but the atomic gas isimportant or even crucial in supporting the star formation activity in theouter part of the disks. moreover, we show that cluster members which sufferfrom a moderate hi removal have their molecular component and their sfrquenched, while highly perturbed galaxies show an additional truncation intheir star forming disks. our results are consistent with a model in which theatomic hydrogen is the fundamental fuel for the star formation, either directlyor indirectly through the molecular phase; therefore galaxies whose hireservoirs have been depleted suffer from starvation or even from truncation oftheir star formation activity.

astro-ph;0510165	uv dust attenuation in normal star forming galaxies: i. estimating the  l_tir/l_fuv ratio	we analyze the dust attenuation properties of a volume-limited,optically-selected sample of normal star forming galaxies in nearby clusters asobserved by galex. the internal attenuation is estimated using threeindependent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared tofar-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the balmerdecrement. we confirm that normal galaxies follow a l_tir/l_fuv-beta relationoffset from the one observed for starburst galaxies. this offset is found toweakly correlate with the birthrate parameter, thus with the galaxy starformation history. we study the correlations of dust attenuation with otherglobal properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gasattenuation, halpha emission and mass surface density. metal-rich, massivegalaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the uv than are smallsystems. for the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower l_tir/l_fuvratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in thel_tir/l_fuv-beta relation. unexpectedly we find however that normal starforming galaxies follow exactly the same relationship between metallicity andultraviolet spectral slope beta determined for starbursts, complicating ourunderstanding of dust properties. this result might indicate a different dustgeometry between normal galaxies and starbursts, but it could also be due toaperture effects eventually present in the iue starbursts dataset. the presentmultiwavelength study allows us to provide some empirical relations from whichthe total infrared to far ultraviolet ratio (l_tir/l_fuv) can be estimated whenfar infrared data are absent.

0809.0972	the uv luminosity function and star formation rate of the coma cluster	we present estimates of the galex nuv and fuv luminosity functions (lfs) ofthe coma cluster, over a total area of ~9 deg^2 (~25 mpc^2), i.e. from thecluster center to the virial radius. our analysis represents the widest anddeepest uv investigation of a nearby cluster of galaxies made to date. the comauv lfs show a faint-end slope steeper than the one observed in the local field.this difference, more evident in nuv, is entirely due to the contribution ofmassive quiescent systems (e.g. ellipticals, lenticulars and passive spirals),more frequent in high density environments. on the contrary, the shape of theuv lfs for coma star-forming galaxies does not appear to be significantlydifferent from that of the field, consistently with previous studies of localand high redshift clusters. we demonstrate that such similarity is only aselection effect, not providing any information on the role of the environmenton the star formation history of cluster galaxies. by integrating the uv lfsfor star-forming galaxies (corrected for the first time for internal dustattenuation), we show that the specific star formation rate of coma issignificantly lower than the integrated ssfr of the field and that coma-likeclusters contribute only &lt;7% of the total sfr density of the local universe.approximately 2/3 of the whole star-formation in coma is occurring in galaxieswith m_star &lt; 10^10 m_sol. the vast majority of star-forming galaxies haslikely just started its first dive into the cluster core and has not yet beenaffected by the cluster environment. the total stellar mass accretion rate ofcoma is ~(0.6-1.8) x 10^12 m_sol gyr^-1, suggesting that a significant fractionof the population of lenticular and passive spirals observed today in comacould originate from infalling galaxies accreted between z~1 and z~0.

astro-ph;0601108	environmental effects on late-type galaxies in nearby clusters	the transformations taking place in late-type galaxies in the environment ofrich clusters of galaxies at z=0 are reviewed. from the handful of late-typegalaxies that inhabit local clusters, whether they were formed in-situ andsurvived as such, avoiding transformation or even destruction or if they arenewcomers that recently infall from outside, we can learn an important lessonon the latest stages of galaxy evolution. we start by reviewing theobservational scenario, covering the broadest possible stretch of theelectromagnetic spectrum, from the gas tracers, the star formation tracers, theold star tracers and the dust. strong emphasis is given to the three nearby,well studied clusters virgo, a1367 and coma, representative of differentevolutionary stages, from unrelaxed, spiral rich (virgo) to relaxed, spiralpoor clusters (coma). we continue by providing a review of models of galaxyinteractions relevant to clusters of galaxies. prototypes of various mechanismsand processes are discussed and their typical time-scales are given in anappendix. observations indicate the presence of healthy late-type galaxiesfalling into nearby clusters individually or belonging to massive groups. morerare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups where significantpre-processing might take place. once entered the cluster, they loose their gasand quench their star formation activity, becoming anemics. observations andtheory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic mediumis responsible for the gas depletion. this process, however, cannot be at theorigin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population. physical and statisticalproperties of s0 in nearby clusters and at higher redshift, indicate that theyoriginate from spiral galaxies transformed by gravitational interactions.

astro-ph;0603826	witnessing galaxy preprocessing in the local universe: the case of a  star-bursting group falling into abell 1367	we present a multiwavelength analysis of a compact group of galaxiesinfalling at high speed into the dynamically young cluster abell 1367. peculiarmorphologies and unusually high halpha emission are associated with two giantgalaxies and at least ten dwarfs/extragalactic hii regions, making this groupthe region with the highest density of star formation activity ever observed inthe local clusters. moreover halpha imaging observations reveal extraordinarycomplex trails of ionized gas behind the galaxies, with projected lengthsexceeding 150 kpc. these unique cometary trails mark the gaseous trajectory ofgalaxies, witnessing their dive into the hot cluster intergalactic medium.under the combined action of tidal forces among group members and theram-pressure by the cluster ambient medium, the group galaxies were fragmentedand the ionized gas was blown out. the properties of this group suggest thatenvironmental effects within infalling groups may have represented apreprocessing step of the galaxy evolution during the high redshift clusterassembly phase.

astro-ph;9801279	the star formation properties of disk galaxies: halpha imaging of  galaxies in the coma supercluster	we present integrated h alpha measurements obtained from imaging observationsof 98 late-type galaxies, primarily selected in the coma supercluster. thesedata, combined with h alpha photometry from the literature, include a magnitudeselected sample of spiral (sa to irr) galaxies belonging to the "great wall"complete up to mp=15.4, thus composed of galaxies brighter than mp=-18.8(h0=100 km mpc^-1 s^-1). the frequency distribution of the h alpha e.w.,determined for the first time from an optically complete sample, isapproximately gaussian peaking at e.w. ~25 a. we find that, at the presentlimiting luminosity, the star formation properties of spiral+irr galaxiesmembers of the coma and a1367 clusters do not differ significantly from thoseof the isolated ones belonging to the great wall. the present analysis confirmsthe well known increase of the current massive star formation rate (sfr) withhubble type. moreover perhaps a more fundamental anticorrelation exists betweenthe sfr and the mass of disk galaxies: low-mass spirals and dwarf systems havepresent sfrs ~50 times higher than giant spirals. this result is consistentwith the idea that disk galaxies are coeval, evolve as "closed systems" withexponentially declining sfr and that the mass of their progenitor protogalaxiesis the principal parameter governing their evolution. massive systems havinghigh initial efficiency of collapse, or a short collapse time-scale, haveretained little gas to feed the present epoch of star formation. these findingssupport the conclusions of gavazzi &amp; scodeggio (1996) who studyed thecolor-mass relation of a local galaxy sample and agree with the analysis bycowie et al. (1996) who traced the star formation history of galaxies up toz&gt;1.

astro-ph;9809191	the tilt of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies: wavelength  dependence	the photometric parameters r_e and mu_e of 74 early-type (e+s0+s0a) galaxiesin the coma cluster are derived for the first time in the near ir h band. theseare used, coupled with measurements of the central velocity dispersion found inthe literature, to determine the h band fundamental plane (fp) relation of thiscluster. the same procedure is applied to previously available photometric datain the b, v, r, i, and k bands, to perform a multi-wavelength study of the fp.because systematic uncertainties in the value of the fp parameters areintroduced both by the choice of the fitting algorithm, and by the presence ofstatistical biases connected with the sample selection procedure, we emphasizethe importance of deriving the fp parameters in the six photometric bands usingan identical fitting algorithm, and appropriate corrections to eliminate theeffects of sample incompleteness. we find that the fp mu_e coefficient isstable with wavelength, while the sigma coefficient increases significantlywith increasing wavelength, in agreement with an earlier result presented bypahre &amp; djorgovski. the slope of the fp relation, although changing withwavelength, never approaches the virial theorem expectation. we also find thatthe magnitude of the slope change can be entirely explained by the presence ofthe well known relation between color and magnitude among early-type galaxies.we conclude that the tilt of the fundamental plane is significant, and must bedue to some form of broken homology among early-type galaxies, while itswavelength dependence derives from whatever mechanism (currently the preferredone is the existence of a mass-metal content sequence) produces thecolor-magnitude relation in those galaxies.

astro-ph;9811104	on the local radio luminosity function of galaxies. i: the virgo cluster	we cross-correlate the galaxies brighter than mb=18 in the virgo cluster withthe radio sources in the nvss survey (1.4 ghz), resulting in 180 radio-opticalidentifications. we determine the radio luminosity function of the virgogalaxies, separately for the early- and late-types. late-type galaxies developradio sources with a probability proportional to their optical luminosity. infact their radio/optical (rb) distribution is gaussian, centered at logrb=-0.5, i.e. the radio luminosity is 0.3 of the optical one. the probabilityof late-type galaxies to develop radio sources is almost independent of theirdetailed hubble type, except for sa (and s0+s0a) which are a factor of 5 lessfrequent than later types at any rb. giant elliptical galaxies feed "monster"radio sources with a probability strongly increasing with mass. however thefrequency of fainter radio sources is progressively less sensitive on thesystem mass. the faintest giant e galaxies (mb=-17) have a probability offeeding low power radio sources similar to that of dwarf e galaxies as faint asmb=-13.

astro-ph;9811105	on the local radio luminosity function of galaxies. ii: environmental  dependences among late-type galaxies	using new extensive radio continuum surveys at 1.4 ghz (first and nvss), wederive the distribution of the radio/optical and radio/nir luminosity (rlf) oflate-type (sa-irr) galaxies (mp&lt;15.7) in 5 nearby clusters of galaxies: a262,cancer, a1367, coma and virgo. with the aim of discussing possibleenvironmental dependences of the radio properties, we compare these resultswith those obtained for relatively isolated objects in the coma supercluster.we find that the rlf of cancer, a262 and virgo are consistent with that ofisolated galaxies. conversely we confirm earlier claims that galaxies in a1367and coma have their radio emissivity enhanced by a factor of 5 with respect toisolated objects. we discuss this result in the framework of the dynamicalpressure suffered by galaxies in motion through the intra-cluster gas(ram-pressure). we find that the radio excess is statistically larger forgalaxies in fast transit motion. this is coherent with the idea that enhancedradio continuum activity is associated with magnetic field compression. thex-ray luminosities and temperatures of coma and a1367 imply that these twoclusters have significantly larger intracluster gas density than the remainingthree studied ones, providing a clue for explaining the higher radio continuumluminosities of their galaxies. multiple systems in the coma superclusterbridge (with projected separations smaller than 300 kpc) have radioluminosities significantly larger than isolated galaxies.

astro-ph;9812275	the 3-d structure of the virgo cluster from h band fundamental plane and  tully-fisher distance determinations	we undertook a surface photometry survey of 200 galaxies in the virgo cluster(complete to b&lt;14.0 mag) carried out in the near-infrared (nir) h band.combining velocity dispersion measurements from the literature with newspectroscopic data for 11 galaxies we derive distances of 59 early typegalaxies using the fundamental plane (fp) method. the distance of another 75late-type galaxies is determined using the tully-fisher (tf) method. for thispurpose we use the maximum rotational velocity, as derived from hi spectra fromthe literature, complemented with new h_alpha rotation curves of 8 highly hideficient galaxies. the zero-point of the fp and tf template relations arecalibrated assuming the distance modulus of virgo mu_o=31.0, as determined withthe cepheids method. using these 134 distance determinations (with individualuncertainties of 0.35 (tf), 0.45 (fp) mag) we find that the distance of clustera, associated with m87, is mu_o=30.84+-0.06. cluster b, off-set to the south,is found at mu_o=31.84+-0.10$. this subcluster is falling onto a at about 750km/sec. clouds w and m are at twice the distance of a. galaxies on thenorth-west and south-east of the main cluster a belong to two clouds composedalmost exclusively of spiral galaxies with distances consistent with a, butwith significantly different velocity distributions, suggesting that they arefalling onto cluster a at approximately 770 km/sec from the far-side and at 200km/sec from the near-side respectively. the mass of virgo inferred from thepeculiar motions induced on its vicinity is consistent with the virialexpectation.
