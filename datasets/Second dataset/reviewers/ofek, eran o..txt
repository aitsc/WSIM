0906.5355	exploring the optical transient sky with the palomar transient factory	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a wide-field experiment designed toinvestigate the optical transient and variable sky on time scales from minutesto years. ptf uses the cfh12k mosaic camera, with a field of view of 7.9 deg^2and a plate scale of 1 asec/pixel, mounted on the the palomar observatory48-inch samuel oschin telescope. the ptf operation strategy is devised to probethe existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for theoreticallypredicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such as fallback supernovae,macronovae, .ia supernovae and the orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. ptfwill also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmicvariables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei,and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics(through rr lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-earthobjects). the lessons that can be learned from ptf will be essential for thepreparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the large synoptic surveytelescope. in this paper we present the scientific motivation for ptf anddescribe in detail the goals and expectations for this experiment.

0912.0948	detectability of oort cloud objects using kepler	the size distribution and total mass of objects in the oort cloud haveimportant implications to the theory of planets formation, including theproperties of, and the processes taking place in the early solar system. wediscuss the potential of space missions like kepler and corot, designed todiscover transiting exo-planets, to detect oort cloud, kuiper belt and mainbelt objects by occultations of background stars. relying on publisheddynamical estimates of the content of the oort cloud, we find that kepler'smain program is expected to detect between 0 and ~100 occultation events bydeca-kilometer-sized oort cloud objects. the occultations rate depends on themass of the oort cloud, the distance to its "inner edge", and the sizedistribution of its objects. in contrast, kepler is unlikely to findoccultations by kuiper belt or main belt asteroids, mainly due to the fact thatit is observing a high ecliptic latitude field. occultations by solar systemobjects will appear as a photometric deviation in a single measurement,implying that the information regarding the time scale and light-curve shape ofeach event is lost. we present statistical methods that have the potential toverify the authenticity of occultation events by solar system objects, toestimate the distance to the occulting population, and to constrain their sizedistribution. our results are useful for planning of future space-basedexo-planet searches in a way that will maximize the probability of detectingsolar system objects, without hampering the main science goals.

1004.0615	core-collapse supernovae from the palomar transient factory: indications  for a different population in dwarf galaxies	we use the first compilation of 72 core-collapse supernovae (sne) from thepalomar transient factory (ptf) to study their observed subtype distribution indwarf galaxies compared to giant galaxies. our sample is the largestsingle-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collectionof core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosityrange (down to m_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (&gt;20%) ofdwarf (m_r &gt;= -18 mag) hosts. we find more core-collapse sne in dwarf galaxiesthan expected and several interesting trends emerge. we use detailedsubclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse sne and find that alltype i core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either sne ib orbroad-lined sne ic (sne ic-bl), while "normal" sne ic dominate in giantgalaxies. we also see a significant excess of sne iib in dwarf hosts. wehypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss isreduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as "normal" sne ic inmetal-rich galaxies to retain some he and h, exploding as ib/iib events. at thesame time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo extensive strippingand explode as sne ic-bl (and presumably also as long-duration gamma-raybursts). our results are still limited by small-number statistics, and ourmeasurements of the observed n(ib/c)/n(ii) number ratio in dwarf and gianthosts (0.25_{-0.15}^{+0.3} and 0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}, respectively; 1 sigmauncertainties) are consistent with previous studies and theoreticalpredictions. as additional ptf data accumulate, more robust statisticalanalyses will be possible, allowing the evolution of massive stars to be probedvia the dwarf-galaxy sn population.

1005.1455	ptf10fqs: a luminous red nova in the spiral galaxy messier 99	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is systematically charting the opticaltransient and variable sky. a primary science driver of ptf is building acomplete inventory of transients in the local universe (distance less than 200mpc). here, we report the discovery of ptf10fqs, a transient in the luminosity"gap" between novae and supernovae. located on a spiral arm of messier 99, ptf10fqs has a peak luminosity of mr = -12.3, red color (g-r = 1.0) and is slowlyevolving (decayed by 1 mag in 68 days). it has a spectrum dominated byintermediate-width h (930 km/s) and narrow calcium emission lines. theexplosion signature (the light curve and spectra) is overall similar to thatofm85ot2006-1, sn2008s, and ngc300ot. the origin of these events is shrouded inmystery and controversy (and in some cases, in dust). ptf10fqs shows someevidence of a broad feature (around 8600a) that may suggest very largevelocities (10,000 km/s) in this explosion. ongoing surveys can be expected tofind a few such events per year. sensitive spectroscopy, infrared monitoringand statistics (e.g. disk versus bulge) will eventually make it possible forastronomers to unravel the nature of these mysterious explosions.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1009.0960	rapidly decaying supernova 2010x: a candidate ".ia" explosion	we present the discovery, photometric and spectroscopic follow-upobservations of sn 2010x (ptf 10bhp). this supernova decays exponentially withtau_d=5 days, and rivals the current recordholder in speed, sn 2002bj. sn 2010xpeaks at m_r=-17mag and has mean velocities of 10,000 km/s. our light curvemodeling suggests a radioactivity powered event and an ejecta mass of 0.16msun. if powered by nickel, we show that the nickel mass must be very small(0.02 msun) and that the supernova quickly becomes optically thin togamma-rays. our spectral modeling suggests that sn 2010x and sn 2002bj havesimilar chemical compositions and that one of aluminum or helium is present. ifaluminum is present, we speculate that this may be an accretion inducedcollapse of an o-ne-mg white dwarf. if helium is present, all observables of sn2010x are consistent with being a thermonuclear helium shell detonation on awhite dwarf, a ".ia" explosion. with the 1-day dynamic-cadence experiment onthe palomar transient factory, we expect to annually discover a few suchevents.

1010.2211	hubble space telescope studies of nearby type ia supernovae: the mean  maximum light ultraviolet spectrum and its dispersion	we present the first results of an ongoing campaign using the stisspectrograph on-board the hubble space telescope (hst) whose primary goal isthe study of near ultraviolet (uv) spectra of local type ia supernovae (sneia). using events identified by the palomar transient factory and subsequentlyverified by ground-based spectroscopy, we demonstrate the ability to locate andclassify sne ia as early as 16 days prior to maximum light. this enables us totrigger hst in a non-disruptive mode to obtain near uv spectra within a fewdays of maximum light for comparison with earlier equivalent ground-basedspectroscopic campaigns conducted at intermediate redshifts, z ~ 0.5. weanalyze the spectra of 12 type ia supernovae located in the hubble flow with0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.08. although a fraction of our eventual sample, these data,together with archival data, already provide a substantial advance over thatpreviously available. restricting samples to those of similar phase andstretch, the mean uv spectrum agrees reasonably closely with that atintermediate redshift, although some differences are found in the metallicabsorption features. a larger sample will determine whether these differencesreflect possible sample biases or are a genuine evolutionary effect.significantly, the wavelength-dependent dispersion, which is larger in the uv,follows similar trends to that observed at intermediate redshift and is driven,in part, by differences in the various metallic features. while the origin ofthe uv dispersion remains uncertain, our comparison suggests that it mayreflect compositional variations amongst our sample rather than beingpredominantly an evolutionary effect.

1011.2063	evidence for an fu orionis-like outburst from a classical t tauri star	we present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new fu orionis-likeyoung stellar object ptf 10qpf (also known as lkha 188-g4 and hbc 722). priorto this outburst, lkha 188-g4 was classified as a classical t tauri star on thebasis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a k8-typephotosphere, and its photometric variability. the mid-infrared spectral indexof lkha 188-g4 indicates a class ii-type object. lkha 188-g4 exhibited a steadyrise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in aug. 2009, before a subsequent moreabrupt rise of &gt; 3 mag on a time scale of ~2 months. observations taken duringthe eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of fu orionis variables: (i)an increase in brightness by &gt; 4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infraredreflection nebula appeared, (iii) optical spectra are consistent with a gsupergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being halphawhich is characterized by a p cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectraresemble those of late k--m giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen inthe molecular bands of co and h_2o, and (v) outflow signatures in h and he areseen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. lkha 188-g4 is the firstmember of the fu orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infraredspectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. the association of theptf 10qpf outburst with the previously identified classical t tauri star lkha188-g4 (hbc 722) provides strong evidence that fu orionis-like eruptionsrepresent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered byinstabilities in the disk. the early identification of ptf 10qpf as an fuorionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopicobservations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other knownoutbursting objects.

1103.0006	sgr 1806-20 distance and dust properties in molecular clouds by analysis  of a flare x-ray echoes	the soft gamma repeater sgr 1806-20 is most famous for its giant flare from2004, which yielded the highest gamma-ray flux ever observed on earth. theflare emphasized the importance of determining the distance to the sgr, thusrevealing the flare's energy output, with implications on sgrs energy budgetand giant flare rates. we analyze x-ray scattering echoes observed by swift/xrtfollowing the 2006 august 6 intermediate burst of sgr 1806-20. assumingpositions and opacities of the molecular clouds along the line-of-sight fromprevious works, we derive direct constrains on the distance to sgr 1806-20,setting a lower limit of 9.4 kpc and an upper limit of 18.6 kpc (90%confidence), compared with a 6-15 kpc distance range by previous works. thisdistance range matches an energy output of ~10^46 erg/s for the 2004 giantflare. we further use, for the first time, the x-ray echoes in order to studythe dust properties in molecular clouds. analyzing the temporal evolution ofthe observed flux using a dust scattering model, which assumes a power-law sizedistribution of the dust grains, we find a power-law index of-3.3_{-0.7}^{+0.6} (1 sigma) and a lower limit of 0.1 micron (2 sigma) on thedust maximal grain size, both conforming to measured dust properties in thediffused interstellar medium (ism). we advocate future burst follow-upobservations with swift, chandra and the planned nustar telescopes, as means ofobtaining much superior results from such an analysis.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1105.0472	a search for pulsations in helium white dwarfs	the recent plethora of sky surveys, especially the sloan digital sky survey,have discovered many low-mass (m &lt; 0.45 msun) white dwarfs that should havecores made of nearly pure helium. these wds come in two varieties; those withmasses 0.2 &lt; m &lt; 0.45 msun and h envelopes so thin that they rapidly cool, andthose with m &lt; 0.2 msun (often called extremely low mass, elm, wds) that havethick enough h envelopes to sustain 10^9 years of h burning. in both cases,these wds evolve through the zz ceti instability strip, teff = 9,000-12,000 k,where g-mode pulsations always occur in carbon/oxygen wds. this expectation,plus theoretical work on the contrasts between c/o and he core wds, motivatedour search for pulsations in 12 well characterized helium wds. we report hereon our failure to find any pulsators amongst our sample. though we have varyingamplitude limits, it appears likely that the theoretical expectations regardingthe onset of pulsations in these objects requires closer consideration. weclose by encouraging additional observations as new he wd samples becomeavailable, and speculate on where theoretical work may be needed.

1105.3479	the structure function of variable 1.4 ghz radio sources based on nvss  and first observations	we augment the two widest/deepest 1.4 ghz radio surveys: the nrao vla skysurvey (nvss) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimeters(first), with the mean epoch in which each source was observed. we use thesecatalogs to search for unresolved sources which vary between the first and nvssepochs. we find 43 variable sources (0.1% of the sources) which vary by morethan 4 sigma, and we construct the mean structure function of these objects.this enables us to explore radio variability on time scales between severalmonths and about five years. we find that on these time scales, the meanstructure function of the variable sources is consistent with a flat structurefunction. a plausible explanation to these observations is that a largefraction of the variability at 1.4 ghz is induced by scintillations in theinterstellar medium, rather than by intrinsic variability. finally, for a subsample of the variables for which the redshift is available, we do not findstrong evidence for a correlation between the variability amplitude and thesource redshift.

1106.2897	the progenitor of supernova 2011dh/ptf11eon in messier 51	we have identified a luminous star at the position of supernova (sn)2011dh/ptf11eon, in pre-sn archival, multi-band images of the nearby, nearlyface-on galaxy messier 51 (m51) obtained by the hubble space telescope with theadvanced camera for surveys. this identification has been confirmed, to thehighest available astrometric precision, using a keck-ii adaptive-optics image.the available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the sn is astripped-envelope, core-collapse type iib, with a more compact progenitor(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied sn iib 1993j. we inferthat the extinction to sn 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low galacticforeground contribution, and that the sn environment is of roughly solarmetallicity. the detected object has absolute magnitude m_v^0 ~ -7.7 andeffective temperature ~6000 k. the star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extendedthan what has been inferred for the sn progenitor. we speculate that thedetected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actualprogenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transferbinary system. the position of the detected star in a hertzsprung-russelldiagram is consistent with an initial mass of 17--19 msun. the light of thisstar could easily conceal, even in the ultraviolet, the presence of a stripped,compact, very hot (~1e5 k), nitrogen-rich wolf-rayet star progenitor.

1108.2868	sn2010jp (ptf10aaxi): a jet-driven type ii supernova	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar typeii supernova (sn)2010jp, also named ptf10aaxi. the light curve exhibits a linear decline with arelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactivedecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003$m_{\odot}$. spectra of sn2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peakedh$\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component thatsuggests shock interaction with dense csm; (2) high-velocity blue and redemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wingsextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. these features persist during 100 daysafter explosion. we propose that this line profile indicates a bipolarjet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal sn ejectaand csm interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broadline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. two variations of the jetinterpretation seem plausible: (1) a fast jet mixes 56ni to high velocities inpolar zones of the h-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jetproduces blue and red bumps in balmer lines when a jet interacts with densecsm. jet-driven sneii are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide rangeof initial masses above 25 $m_{\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. this seemsconsistent with the sn host environment, which is either an extremelylow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair ofstar-forming galaxies. it also seems consistent with the low 56ni mass that mayaccompany black hole formation. we speculate that the jet survives to produceobservable signatures because the star's h envelope was mostly stripped away byprevious eruptive mass loss.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1109.4325	new lensed quasars from the muscles survey	gravitational lens systems containing lensed quasars are important ascosmological probes, as diagnostics of structural properties of the lensinggalaxies and as tools to study the quasars themselves. the largest lensedquasar sample is the sdss quasar lens search, drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). we are attempting to extend this survey using observations oflens candidates selected from a combination of the quasar sample from the sdssand the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). this adds somewhat higherimage quality together with a wider range of wavelength for the selectionprocess. in previous pilot surveys we observed 5 objects, finding 2 lenses;here we present further observations of 20 objects in which we find 4 lenses,of which 2 are independently discovered in sqls (in preparation). followingearlier work on the combination of these two surveys, we have refined ourmethod and find that use of a colour-separation diagnostic, where we select forseparations between components which appear to decrease in wavelength, is anefficient method to find lensed quasars and may be useful in ongoing and futurelarge-scale strong lensing surveys with instruments such as pan-starrs andlsst. the new lenses have mostly high flux ratios, with faint secondariesburied in the lensing galaxy and typically 6-10 times less bright than theprimary. our survey brings the total number of lenses discovered in the sdssquasar sample to 46, plus 13 lenses already known. this is likely to be up to60-70% of the total number of lensed quasars; we briefly discuss strategies bywhich the rest might be found.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1202.1645	the chandra view of the largest quasar lens sdss j1029+2623	we present results from chandra observations of the cluster lens sdssj1029+2623 at z_l=0.58, which is a gravitationally lensed quasar with thelargest known image separation. we clearly detect x-ray emission both from thelensing cluster and the three lensed quasar images. the cluster has an x-raytemperature of kt = 8.1 (+2.0, -1.2) kev and bolometric luminosity of l_x =9.6e44 erg s^-1. its surface brightness is centered near one of the brightestcluster galaxies, and it is elongated east-west. we identify a subpeaknorth-west of the main peak, which is suggestive of an ongoing merger. even so,the x-ray mass inferred from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption appears tobe consistent with the lensing mass from the einstein radius of the system. wefind significant absorption in the soft x-ray spectrum of the faintest quasarimage, which can be caused by an intervening material at either the lens orsource redshift. the x-ray flux ratios between the quasar images (aftercorrecting for absorption) are in reasonable agreement with those at opticaland radio wavelengths, and all the flux ratios are inconsistent with thosepredicted by simple mass models. this implies that microlensing effect is notsignificant for this system and dark matter substructure is mainly responsiblefor the anomalous flux ratios.

1206.1510	the ptf orion project: a possible planet transiting a t-tauri star	we report observations of a possible young transiting planet orbiting apreviously known weak-lined t-tauri star in the 7-10 myr old orion-ob1a/25-oriregion. the candidate was found as part of the palomar transient factory (ptf)orion project. it has a photometric transit period of 0.448413 +- 0.000040days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 ptf data. follow-up low-precisionradial velocity (rv) observations and adaptive optics imaging suggest that thestar is not an eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a backgroundsource is blended with the target and mimicking the observed transit. rvobservations with the hobby-eberly and keck telescopes yield an rv that has thesame period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transitcenter by approximately -0.22 periods. the amplitude (half range) of the rvvariations is 2.4 km/s and is comparable with the expected rv amplitude thatstellar spots could induce. the rv curve is likely dominated by stellar spotmodulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of m_psin i_orb &lt; 4.8 +- 1.2 m_jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, iorb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we findan upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of m_p &lt; 5.5 +- 1.4m_jup. this limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,its roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active massloss and evaporation.

1208.5900	discovery and early multi-wavelength measurements of the energetic type  ic supernova ptf12gzk: a massive-star explosion in a dwarf host galaxy	we present the discovery and extensive early-time observations of the type icsupernova (sn) ptf12gzk. our finely sampled light curves show a rise of 0.8magwithin 2.5hr. power-law fits [f(t)\sim(t-t_0)^n] to these data constrain theexplosion date to within one day. we cannot rule out the expected quadraticfireball model, but higher values of n are possible as well for larger areas inthe fit parameter space. our bolometric light curve and a dense spectralsequence are used to estimate the physical parameters of the exploding star andof the explosion. we show that the photometric evolution of ptf12gzk is slowerthan that of most sne ic, and its high ejecta velocities (~30,000km/s four daysafter explosion) are closer to the observed velocities of broad-lined sne icassociated with gamma-ray bursts (grbs) than to the observed velocities innormal type ic sne. the high velocities are sustained through the sn earlyevolution, and are similar to those of grb-sne when the sn reach peakmagnitude. by comparison with the spectroscopically similar sn 2004aw, wesuggest that the observed properties of ptf12gzk indicate an initial progenitormass of 25-35 solar mass and a large (5-10e51 erg) kinetic energy, close to theregime of grb-sn properties. the host-galaxy characteristics are consistentwith grb-sn hosts, and not with normal sn ic hosts as well, yet this sn doesnot show the broad lines over extended periods of time that are typical ofbroad-line type ic sne.

1210.4550	millions of multiples: detecting and characterizing close-separation  binary systems in synoptic sky surveys	the direct detection of binary systems in wide-field surveys is limited bythe size of the stars' point-spread-functions (psfs). a search for elongatedobjects can find closer companions, but is limited by the precision to whichthe psf shape can be calibrated for individual stars. we have developed thebinaryfinder algorithm to search for close binaries by using precisionmeasurements of psf ellipticity across wide-field survey images. we show thatthe algorithm is capable of reliably detecting binary systems down toapproximately 1/5 of the seeing limit, and can directly measure the systems'position angles, separations and contrast ratios. to verify the algorithm'sperformance we evaluated 100,000 objects in palomar transient factory (ptf)wide-field-survey data for signs of binarity, and then used the robo-ao roboticlaser adaptive optics system to verify the parameters of 44 high-confidencetargets. we show that binaryfinder correctly predicts the presence of closecompanions with a &lt;5% false-positive rate, measures the detected binaries'position angles within 2 degrees and separations within 25%, and weaklyconstrains their contrast ratios. when applied to the full ptf dataset, weestimate that binaryfinder will discover and characterize ~450,000physically-associated binary systems with separations &lt;2 arcseconds andmagnitudes brighter than r=18. new wide-field synoptic surveys with highsensitivity and sub-arcsecond angular resolution, such as lsst, will allowbinaryfinder to reliably detect millions of very faint binary systems withseparations as small as 0.1 arcseconds.

1304.4236	discovery of a cosmological, relativistic outburst via its rapidly  fading optical emission	we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory (ptf) of thetransient source ptf11agg, which is distinguished by three primarycharacteristics: (1) bright, rapidly fading optical transient emission; (2) afaint, blue quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long,scintillating radio transient. we argue that these observed properties areinconsistent with any known class of galactic transients, and instead suggest acosmological origin. the detection of incoherent radio emission at suchdistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence ofrelativistic ejecta. the observed properties are all consistent with thepopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), marking the first timesuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of ahigh-energy trigger. we searched for possible high-energy counterparts toptf11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. we thereforeconsider three possible scenarios to account for a grb-like afterglow without ahigh-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" grb (lack of satellite coverage), an"orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressedhigh-energy emission). the observed optical and radio light curves appearinconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglowmodels. the simplest explanation, then, is that ptf11agg is a normal, on-axislong-duration grb for which the associated high-energy emission was simplymissed. however, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitousdiscovery by ptf and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). while notdefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that ptf11agg may represent a new, morecommon (&gt; 4 times the on-axis grb rate at 90% confidence) class of relativisticoutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

1307.1470	discovery, progenitor &amp; early evolution of a stripped envelope supernova  iptf13bvn	the intermediate palomar transient factory reports our discovery of a youngsupernova, iptf13bvn, in the nearby galaxy, ngc5806 (22.5mpc). our spectralsequence in the optical and infrared suggests a likely type ib classification.we identify a single, blue progenitor candidate in deep pre-explosion imagingwithin a 2{\sigma} error circle of 80 mas (8.7 pc). the candidate has a mbluminosity of -5.2 +/- 0.4 mag and a b-i color of 0.1+/-0.3 mag. if confirmedby future observations, this would be the first direct detection for aprogenitor of a type ib. fitting a power law to the early light curve, we findan extrapolated explosion date around 1.1 days before our first detection. wesee no evidence of shock cooling. the pre-explosion detection limits constrainthe radius of the progenitor to be smaller than a few solar radii. iptf13bvn isalso detected in cm and mm-wavelengths. fitting a synchrotron self-absorptionmodel to our radio data, we find a mass loading parameter of 1.3*10^12 g/cm.assuming a wind velocity of 10^3km/s, we derive a progenitor mass loss rate of3*10^-5msun/yr. our observations, taken as a whole, are consistent with a wolfrayet progenitor of the supernova iptf13bvn.

1307.5851	discovery and redshift of an optical afterglow in 71 square degrees:  iptf13bxl and grb 130702a	we report the discovery of the optical afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (grb)130702a, identified upon searching 71 square degrees surrounding the fermigamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) localization. discovered and characterized by theintermediate palomar transient factory (iptf), iptf13bxl is the first afterglowdiscovered solely based on a gbm localization. real-time image subtraction,machine learning, human vetting, and rapid response multi-wavelength follow-upenabled us to quickly narrow a list of 27,004 optical transient candidates to asingle afterglow-like source. detection of a new, fading x-ray source by swiftand a radio counterpart by carma and the vla confirmed the association betweeniptf13bxl and grb 130702a. spectroscopy with the magellan and palomar 200-inchtelescopes showed the afterglow to be at a redshift of z=0.145, placing grb130702a among the lowest redshift grbs detected to date. the prompt gamma-rayenergy release and afterglow luminosity are intermediate between typicalcosmological grbs and nearby sub-luminous events such as grb 980425 and grb060218. the bright afterglow and emerging supernova offer an opportunity forextensive panchromatic follow-up. our discovery of iptf13bxl demonstrates thefirst observational proof-of-principle for ~10 fermi-iptf localizationsannually. furthermore, it represents an important step towards overcoming thechallenges inherent in uncovering faint optical counterparts to comparablylocalized gravitational wave events in the advanced ligo and virgo era.

1308.0857	tracing the orphan stream to 55 kpc with rr lyrae stars	we report positions, velocities and metallicities of 50 ab-type rr lyrae(rrab) stars observed in the vicinity of the orphan stellar stream. using about30 rrab stars classified as being likely members of the orphan stream, we studythe metallicity and the spatial extent of the stream. we find that rrab starsin the orphan stream have a wide range of metallicities, from -1.5 dex to -2.7dex. the average metallicity of the stream is -2.1 dex, identical to the valueobtained by newberg et al. (2010) using blue horizontal branch stars. we findthat the most distant parts of the stream (40-50 kpc from the sun) are about0.3 dex more metal-poor than the closer parts (within ~30 kpc), suggesting apossible metallicity gradient along the stream's length. we have extended theprevious studies and have mapped the stream up to 55 kpc from the sun. evenafter a careful search, we did not identify any more distant rrab stars thatcould plausibly be members of the orphan stream. if confirmed with othertracers, this result would indicate a detection of the end of the leading armof the stream. we have compared the distances of orphan stream rrab stars withthe best-fit orbits obtained by newberg et al. (2010). we find that model 6 ofnewberg et al. (2010) cannot explain the distances of the most remote orphanstream rrab stars, and conclude that the best fit to distances of orphan streamrrab stars and to the local circular velocity is provided by potentials wherethe total mass of the galaxy within 60 kpc is m_{60}~2.7x10^{11} msun, or about60% of the mass found by previous studies. more extensive modelling that wouldconsider non-spherical potentials and the possibility of misalignment betweenthe stream and the orbit, is highly encouraged.

1308.3899	a statistical analysis of circumstellar material in type ia supernovae	a key tracer of the elusive progenitor systems of type ia supernovae (sne ia)is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying na i d absorption lines,interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material (csm) surrounding theprogenitor system. the origin of this material is controversial, but thesimplest explanation is that it results from previous mass loss in a systemcontaining a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. we present newsingle-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift sne ia takenwith xshooter on the eso very large telescope. combining this sample withevents from the literature, we confirm an excess (~20 per cent) of sne iadisplaying blueshifted narrow na i d absorption features compared tonon-blueshifted na i d features. the host galaxies of sne ia displayingblueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies,compared to sne ia that show no na i d absorption, and sne ia displayingblueshifted narrow na i d absorption features have broader light curves. thestrength of the na i d absorption is stronger in sne ia displaying blueshiftedna i d absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and thestrength of the blueshifted na i d is correlated with the b-v colour of the snat maximum light. this strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to thesn. in the context of the progenitor systems of sne ia, we discuss thesignificance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on thenature of sn ia progenitors. we present a summary that suggests there are atleast two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful sne ia.

1311.3683	statistical searches for microlensing events in large, non-uniformly  sampled time-domain surveys: a test using palomar transient factory data	many photometric time-domain surveys are driven by specific goals, such assearches for supernovae or transiting exoplanets, which set the cadence withwhich fields are re-imaged. in the case of the palomar transient factory (ptf),several sub-surveys are conducted in parallel, leading to non-uniform samplingover its $\sim$$20,000 \mathrm{deg}^2$ footprint. while the median $7.26\mathrm{deg}^2$ ptf field has been imaged $\sim$40 times in \textit{r}-band,$\sim$$2300 \mathrm{deg}^2$ have been observed $&gt;$100 times. we use ptf data tostudy the trade-off between searching for microlensing events in a survey whosefootprint is much larger than that of typical microlensing searches, but withfar-from-optimal time sampling. to examine the probability that microlensingevents can be recovered in these data, we test statistics used on uniformlysampled data to identify variables and transients. we find that the von neumannratio performs best for identifying simulated microlensing events in our data.we develop a selection method using this statistic and apply it to data fromfields with $&gt;$10 $r$-band observations, $1.1\times10^9$ light curves,uncovering three candidate microlensing events. we lack simultaneous,multi-color photometry to confirm these as microlensing events. however, theirnumber is consistent with predictions for the event rate in the ptf footprintover the survey's three years of operations, as estimated from near-fieldmicrolensing models. this work can help constrain all-sky event ratepredictions and tests microlensing signal recovery in large data sets, whichwill be useful to future time-domain surveys, such as that planned with thelarge synoptic survey telescope.

1311.6778	probing cosmic-ray ion acceleration with radio-submm and gamma-ray  emission from interaction-powered supernovae	the optical and near-ir emission from some classes of supernovae (sne),including type iin and possibly some super-luminous sne, is likely powered by acollision between the sn ejecta and dense circumstellar material (csm). weargue that for a range of csm masses and their radii, a collisionless shock canform, allowing for efficient cosmic-ray (cr) acceleration. we show that ppcollisions between these newly accelerated crs and the csm leads to not onlygamma rays but also secondary electrons and positrons that radiate synchrotronphotons in the high-frequency radio bands. our estimates imply that variousfacilities including the jansky very large array (vla) and the atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) may observe such sne at gpc distances byfollowup observations in months-to-years, although the detectability stronglydepends on the csm density as well as observed frequency. detecting this signalwould give us a unique probe of cr acceleration at early times, and evennon-detections can put interesting limits on the possibility of cr ionacceleration. following our previous work, we also show that gev gamma rays canescape from the system without severe attenuation, encouraging point-source andstacking analyses with fermi. we provide recipes for diagnosinginteraction-powered sn scenario with multi-messenger (neutrino and gamma-ray)observations.

1404.1953	ipac image processing and data archiving for the palomar transient  factory	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a multi-epochal robotic survey of thenorthern sky that acquires data for the scientific study of transient andvariable astrophysical phenomena. the camera and telescope provide forwide-field imaging in optical bands. in the five years of operation since firstlight on december 13, 2008, images taken with mould-r and sdss-g' camerafilters have been routinely acquired on a nightly basis (weather permitting),and two different h-alpha filters were installed in may 2011 (656 nm and 663nm). the ptf image-processing and data-archival program at the infraredprocessing and analysis center (ipac) is tailored to receive and reduce thedata, and, from it, generate and preserve astrometrically and photometricallycalibrated images, extracted source catalogs, and coadded reference images.relational databases have been deployed to track these products in operationsand the data archive. the fully automated system has benefited by lessonslearned from past ipac projects and comprises advantageous features that arepotentially incorporable into other ground-based observatories. bothoff-the-shelf and in-house software have been utilized for economy and rapiddevelopment. the ptf data archive is curated by the nasa/ipac infrared sciencearchive (irsa). a state-of-the-art custom web interface has been deployed fordownloading the raw images, processed images, and source catalogs from irsa.access to ptf data products is currently limited to an initial public datarelease (m81, m44, m42, sdss stripe 82, and the kepler survey field). it is theintent of the ptf collaboration to release the full ptf data archive whensufficient funding becomes available.

1405.1415	a continuum of h- to he-rich tidal disruption candidates with a  preference for e+a galaxies	we present the results of a palomar transient factory (ptf) archival searchfor blue transients which lie in the magnitude range between "normal"core-collapse and superluminous supernovae (i.e. with$-21\,{\leq}m_{r\,(peak)}\,{\leq}-19$). of the six events found after excludingall interacting type~iin and ia-csm supernovae, three (ptf09ge, 09axc and09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offsetfrom the center, and for two (10nuj and 11glr) a precise offset can not bedetermined. all the central events have similar rise times to the he-rich tidaldisruption candidate ps1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curvealso has similar colors and power-law decay. spectroscopically, ptf09ge ishe-rich, while ptf09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peakmagnitude. all three central events are in low star-formation hosts, two ofwhich are e+a galaxies. our spectrum of the host of ps1-10jh displays similarproperties. ptf10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically andspectroscopically from the central events and its host displays a higher starformation rate. finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nucleiactivity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three centraltransients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a super-massiveblack hole. we compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruptioncandidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can beunified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. the accumulated evidenceof this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for thisclass of nuclear transients.

1411.5373	an accurate and efficient algorithm for detection of radio bursts with  an unknown dispersion measure, for single dish telescopes and interferometers	astronomical radio bursts disperse while traveling through the interstellarmedium. to optimally detect a short-duration signal within a frequency band, wehave to precisely compensate for the pulse dispersion, which is acomputationally demanding task. we present the fast dispersion measuretransform (fdmt) algorithm for optimal detection of such signals. our algorithmhas a low theoretical complexity of 2n_f n_t+ n_t n_d log_2(n_f) where n_f, n_tand n_d are the numbers of frequency bins, time bins, and dispersion measurebins, respectively. unlike previously suggested fast algorithms our algorithmconserves the sensitivity of brute force dedispersion. our tests indicate thatthis algorithm, running on a standard desktop computer, and implemented in ahigh-level programming language, is already faster than the state of the artdedispersion codes running on graphical processing units (gpus). we alsopresent a variant of the algorithm that can be efficiently implemented on gpus.the latter algorithm's computation and data transport requirements are similarto those of two-dimensional fft, indicating that incoherent dedispersion cannow be considered a non-issue while planning future surveys. we further presenta fast algorithm for sensitive dedispersion of pulses shorter than normallyallowed by incoherent dedispersion. in typical cases this algorithm is ordersof magnitude faster than coherent dedispersion by convolution. we analyze thecomputational complexity of pulsed signal searches by radio interferometers. weconclude that, using our suggested algorithms, maximally sensitive blindsearches for such pulses is feasible using existing facilities. we provide animplementation of these algorithms in python and matlab.

1508.04775	search for precursor eruptions among type iib supernovae	the progenitor stars of several type iib supernovae (sne) show indicationsfor extended hydrogen envelopes. these envelopes might be the outcome ofluminous energetic pre-explosion events, so-called precursor eruptions. we usethe palomar transient factory (ptf) pre-explosion observations of a sample of27 nearby type iib sne to look for such precursors during the final years priorto the sn explosion. no precursors are found when combining the observations in15-day bins, and we calculate the absolute-magnitude-dependent upper limit onthe precursor rate. at the 90% confidence level, type iib sne have on average$&lt;0.86$ precursors as bright as absolute $r$-band magnitude $-14$ in the final3.5 years before the explosion and $&lt;0.56$ events over the final year. incontrast, precursors among sne iin have a $\gtrsim 5$ times higher rate. thekinetic energy required to unbind a low-mass stellar envelope is comparable tothe radiated energy of a few-weeks-long precursor which would be detectable forthe closest sne in our sample. therefore, mass ejections, if they are common insuch sne, are radiatively inefficient or have durations longer than months.indeed, when using 60-day bins a faint precursor candidate is detected prior tosn 2012cs ($\sim2$% false-alarm probability). we also report the detection ofthe progenitor of sn 2011dh which does not show detectable variability over thefinal two years before the explosion. the suggested progenitor of sn 2012p isstill present, and hence is likely a compact star cluster, or an unrelatedobject.

1510.00721	properties and evolution of the redback millisecond pulsar binary psr  j2129-0429	psr j2129-0429 is a "redback" eclipsing millisecond pulsar binary with anunusually long 15.2 hour orbit. it was discovered by the green bank telescopein a targeted search of unidentified fermi gamma-ray sources. the pulsarcompanion is optically bright (mean $m_r = 16.6$ mag), allowing us to constructthe longest baseline photometric dataset available for such a system. wepresent ten years of archival and new photometry of the companion from linear,crts, ptf, the palomar 60-inch, and lcogt. radial velocity spectroscopy usingthe double-beam spectrograph on the palomar 200-inch indicates that the pulsaris massive: $1.74\pm0.18 m_\odot$. the g-type pulsar companion has mass$0.44\pm0.04 m_\odot$, one of the heaviest known redback companions. it iscurrently 95\% roche-lobe filling and only mildly irradiated by the pulsar. weidentify a clear 13.1 mmag yr$^{-1}$ secular decline in the mean magnitude ofthe companion as well as smaller-scale variations in the optical lightcurveshape. this behavior may indicate that the companion is cooling. binaryevolution calculations indicate that psr j2129-0429 has an orbital periodalmost exactly at the bifurcation period between systems that converge intotighter orbits as black widows and redbacks and those that diverge into widerpulsar--white dwarf binaries. its eventual fate may depend on whether itundergoes future episodes of mass transfer and increased irradiation.

1512.00733	type ii supernova energetics and comparison of light curves to  shock-cooling models	during the first few days after explosion, type ii supernovae (sne) aredominated by relatively simple physics. theoretical predictions regardingearly-time sn light curves in the ultraviolet (uv) and optical bands are thusquite robust. we present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $r$-band type iisn light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $&gt;5$detections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrainedtime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. we show that the energy per unit mass($e/m$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-timeoptical data to the model of rabinak &amp; waxman (2011), while the progenitorradius cannot be determined based on $r$-band data alone. we find that type iisn explosion energies span a range of $e/m=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;\rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langlee/m \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), corrected formalmquist bias. assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates alarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. moreover, $e/m$ is positivelycorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{ni}$ produced in the explosion, aspredicted by some recent models of core-collapse sne. we further presentseveral empirical correlations. the peak magnitude is correlated with thedecline rate ($\delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with therise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peakmagnitude. faster declining sne are more luminous and have longer rise times.this limits the possible power sources for such events.

1512.06872	how to coadd images? i. optimal source detection and photometry using  ensembles of images	stacks of digital astronomical images are combined in order to increase imagedepth. the variable seeing conditions, sky background and transparency ofground-based observations make the coaddition process non-trivial. we presentimage coaddition methods optimized for source detection and flux measurement,that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (s/n). we show that for these purposesthe best way to combine images is to apply a matched filter to each image usingits own point spread function (psf) and only then to sum the images with theappropriate weights. methods that either match filter after coaddition, orperform psf homogenization prior to coaddition will result in loss ofsensitivity. we argue that our method provides an increase of between a few and25 percent in the survey speed of deep ground-based imaging surveys comparedwith weighted coaddition techniques. we demonstrate this claim using simulateddata as well as data from the palomar transient factory data release 2. wepresent a variant of this coaddition method which is optimal for psf oraperture photometry. we also provide an analytic formula for calculating thes/n for psf photometry on single or multiple observations. in the next paper inthis series we present a method for image coaddition in the limit ofbackground-dominated noise which is optimal for any statistical test ormeasurement on the constant-in-time image (e.g., source detection, shape orflux measurement or star-galaxy separation), making the original dataredundant. we provide an implementation of this algorithm in matlab.

1512.06879	how to coadd images? ii. a coaddition image that is optimal for any  purpose in the background dominated noise limit	image coaddition is one of the most basic operations that astronomersperform. in paper~i, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order todetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption thatthe noise is approximately gaussian. here, we build on these results and derivefrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for anyhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shapemeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominatedcase. this method has several important properties. the pixels of the resultingcoadd image are uncorrelated. this image preserves all the information (fromthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. any hypothesistesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual imagessimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss ofinformation. the psf of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than thepsf of the best image in the ensemble. moreover, this image is practicallyindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code thatmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to itunchanged. in particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived inpaper~i is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own psf. thiscoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a themaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the fourier transform of theimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire fourier domain is ofequal variance. this method has important implications for multi-epochseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, anddiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations. the last topic will becovered in depth in future papers. we provide an implementation of thisalgorithm in matlab.

astro-ph;0102451	studies of multiple stellar systems - iv. the triple-lined spectroscopic  system gliese 644	we present a radial-velocity study of the triple-lined system gliese 644 andderive spectroscopic elements for the inner and outer orbits with periods of2.9655 and 627 days. we also utilize old visual data, as well as modern speckleand adaptive optics observations, to derive a new astrometric solution for theouter orbit. these two orbits together allow us to derive masses for each ofthe three components in the system: m_a = 0.410 +/- 0.028 (6.9%), m_ba = 0.336+/- 0.016 (4.7%), and $m_bb = 0.304 +/- 0.014 (4.7%) m_solar. we suggest thatthe relative inclination of the two orbits is very small. our individual massesand spectroscopic light ratios for the three m stars in the gliese 644 systemprovide three points for the mass-luminosity relation near the bottom of themain sequence, where the relation is poorly determined. these three pointsagree well with theoretical models for solar metallicity and an age of 5 gyr.our radial velocities for gliese 643 and vb 8, two common-proper-motioncompanions of gliese 644, support the interpretation that all five m stars aremoving together in a physically bound group. we discuss possible scenarios forthe formation and evolution of this configuration, such as the formation of allfive stars in a sequence of fragmentation events leading directly to thehierarchical configuration now observed, versus formation in a small n clusterwith subsequent dynamical evolution into the present hierarchicalconfiguration.

astro-ph;0107318	the unique type ia supernova 2000cx in ngc 524	we present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the typeia supernova (sn ia) 2000cx in the s0 galaxy ngc 524, which reveal it to bepeculiar. photometrically, sn 2000cx is different from all known sne ia, andits light curves cannot be fit well by the fitting techniques currentlyavailable. there is an apparent asymmetry in the $b$-band peak, in which thepremaximum brightening is relatively fast (similar to that of the normal sn1994d), but the postmaximum decline is relatively slow (similar to that of theoverluminous sn 1991t). the color evolution of sn 2000cx is also peculiar: the$(b - v)_0$ color has a unique plateau phase and the $(v - r)_0$ and $(v -i)_0$ colors are very blue.  although the premaximum spectra of sn 2000cx are similar to those of sn1991t-like objects (with weak si ii lines), its overall spectral evolution isquite different. the si ii lines that emerged near maximum $b$-band brightnessstay strong in sn 2000cx until about three weeks past maximum. the change inthe excitation stages of iron-peak elements is slow. both the iron-peak and theintermediate-mass elements are found to be moving at very high expansionvelocities in the ejecta of sn 2000cx.  we discuss theoretical models for sn 2000cx. sn 2000cx may be an overluminousobject like sn 1991t, but with a larger yield of $^{56}$ni and a higher kineticenergy in the ejecta. we also briefly discuss the implications of ourobservations for the luminosity vs. light-curve width relation.

astro-ph;0305201	the redshift distribution of gravitational lenses revisited: constraints  on galaxy mass evolution	the redshifts of lens galaxies in known gravitational lens systems probe thevolume distribution of lensing mass. following earlier work by kochanek, were-derive the lens redshift probability distribution, allowing for mass andnumber density evolution of the lensing galaxies, and apply this test to a muchenlarged sample of lens systems. from a literature survey of all known lenses,we have selected an unbiased sample of 15 lenses with complete redshiftinformation. for a flat universe and no lens evolution, we can only put anupper limit on the cosmological constant of omega_lambda&lt;0.89 at the 95% cl.omega_lambda~0.7 and no evolution is consistent with the data. allowing forevolution in an omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7 cosmology, we find that thebest-fit evolution in sigma* (i.e., the characteristic velocity dispersion in aschechter-like function) of early-type galaxies, in the redshift range z~0 to1, is d[log sigma*(z)]/dz=-0.10+/-0.06. this is consistent with no evolutionand implies that, at 95% cl, sigma* of early-type galaxies at z~1 was at least63% of its current value. alternatively, if there is no mass evolution, apresent-day value of sigma*&gt;175 km/s for elliptical galaxies is required (95%cl).

astro-ph;0507360	discovery of multiply imaged galaxies behind the cluster and lensed  quasar sdss j1004+4112	we have identified three multiply imaged galaxies in hubble space telescopeimages of the redshift z=0.68 cluster responsible for the large-separationquadruply lensed quasar, sdss j1004+4112. spectroscopic redshifts have beensecured for two of these systems using the keck i 10m telescope. the mostdistant lensed galaxy, at z=3.332, forms at least four images, and an einsteinring encompassing 3.1 times more area than the einstein ring of the lensed qsoimages at z=1.74, due to the greater source distance. for a second multiplyimaged galaxy, we identify ly_alpha emission at a redshift of z=2.74. thecluster mass profile can be constrained from near the center of the brightestcluster galaxy, where we observe both a radial arc and the fifth image of thelensed quasar, to the einstein radius of the highest redshift galaxy, ~110 kpc.our preliminary modeling indicates that the mass approximates an ellipticalbody, with an average projected logarithmic gradient of ~-0.5. the system ispotentially useful for a direct measurement of world models in a previouslyuntested redshift range.

astro-ph;0507454	the lensed arc production efficiency of galaxy clusters: a comparison of  matched observed and simulated samples	we compare the statistical properties of giant gravitationally lensed arcsproduced in matched simulated and observed cluster samples. the observed sampleconsists of 10 x-ray selected clusters at redshifts z ~ 0.2 imaged with hst bysmith et al. the simulated dataset is produced by lensing the hubble deepfield, which serves as a background source image, with 150 realizations(different projections and shifts) of five simulated z = 0.2 clusters from alambdacdm n-body simulation. the real and simulated clusters have similarmasses, the real photometric redshift is used for each background source, andall the observational effects influencing arc detection in the real dataset,including light from cluster galaxies, are simulated in the artificial dataset.we develop, and apply to both datasets, an objective automatic arc-findingalgorithm. we find consistent arc statistics in the real and in the simulatedsample, with an average of ~ 1 detected giant (length to width ratio &gt;= 10) arcper cluster and ~ 0.2 giant luminous (r&lt;22.3 mag) arc per cluster. thus, takinginto account a realistic source population and observational effects, theclusters predicted by lambdacdm have the same arc-production efficiency as theobserved clusters. if, as suggested by other studies, there is a discrepancybetween the predicted and the observed total number of arcs on the sky, it mustbe the result of differences between the redshift dependent cluster massfunctions, and not due to differences in the lensing efficiency of the mostmassive clusters.

astro-ph;0508629	a complete survey of the transient radio sky and implications for  gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and other relativistic explosions	we had previously reported on a survey for radio transients, used to set anupper limit on the number of orphan gamma-ray burst (grb) radio afterglows, andthus a lower limit on the typical grb beaming factor. here we report radio andoptical follow-up observations of these possible transients, achieving thefirst full characterization of the transient radio sky. we find that only twosource are likely to be real radio transients, an optically obscured radiosupernova (sn) in the nearby galaxy ngc 4216, and a source not associated witha bright host galaxy, which is too radio luminous to be a grb afterglow. wespeculate that this may be a flare from a peculiar active galactic nucleus, ora burst from an unusual galactic compact object. we place an upper limit of 65radio transients above 6 mjy over the entire sky at the 95% confidence level.the implications are as follows. first, we derive a limit on the typicalbeaming of grbs; we find f_b^{-1} &gt;~ 60, ~5 times higher than our earlierresults. second, we impose an upper limit on the rate of events that eject &gt;~10^{51} erg in unconfined relativistic ejecta, whether or not accompanied bydetectable emission in wavebands other than the radio. our estimated rate,&lt;=1000/y/gpc, is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the rate ofcore-collapse sne (and type ib/c events in particular), indicating that only aminority of such events eject significant amounts of relativistic material,which are required by fireball models of long-soft grbs. finally, we show thatfuture wider and/or deeper radio variability surveys are expected to detectnumerous orphan radio grb afterglows. our survey also illustrates the greatpotential of sensitive surveys with new instruments to revolutionize the studyof nearby sne (abridged).
