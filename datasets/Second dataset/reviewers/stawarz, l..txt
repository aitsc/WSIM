0909.1997	sources of the radio background considered	we investigate different scenarios for the origin of the extragalactic radiobackground. the surface brightness of the background, as reported by the arcade2 collaboration, is several times higher than that which would result fromcurrently observed radio sources. we consider contributions to the backgroundfrom diffuse synchrotron emission from clusters and the intergalactic medium,previously unrecognized flux from low surface brightness regions of radiosources, and faint point sources below the flux limit of existing surveys. byexamining radio source counts available in the literature, we conclude thatmost of the radio background is produced by radio point sources that dominateat sub microjy fluxes. we show that a truly diffuse background produced byelectrons far from galaxes is ruled out because such energetic electrons wouldoverproduce the obserevd x-ray/gamma-ray background through inverse comptonscattering of the other photon fields. unrecognized flux from low surfacebrightness regions of extended radio sources, or moderate flux sources missedentirely by radio source count surveys, cannot explain the bulk of the observedbackground, but may contribute as much as 10 per cent. we consider both radiosupernovae and radio quiet quasars as candidate sources for the background, andshow that both fail to produce it at the observed level because of insufficientnumber of objects and total flux, although radio quiet quasars contribute atthe level of at least a few percent. we conclude that if the radio backgroundis at the level reported, a majority of the total surface brightness would haveto be produced by ordinary starforming galaxies above redshift 1 characterizedby an evolving radio far-infrared correlation, which changes toward the radioloud with redshift.

0910.3565	fermi large area telescope gamma-ray detection of the radio galaxy m87	we report the fermi-lat discovery of high-energy (mev/gev) gamma-ray emissionpositionally consistent with the center of the radio galaxy m87, at a sourcesignificance of over 10 sigma in ten-months of all-sky survey data. followingthe detections of cen a and per a, this makes m87 the third radio galaxy seenwith the lat. the faint point-like gamma-ray source has a &gt;100 mev flux of 2.45(+/- 0.63) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index = 2.26 +/- 0.13) with nosignificant variability detected within the lat observation. this flux iscomparable with the previous egret upper limit (&lt; 2.18 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1, 2sigma), thus there is no evidence for a significant mev/gev flare on decadetimescales. contemporaneous chandra and vlba data indicate low activity in theunresolved x-ray and radio core relative to previous observations, suggestingm87 is in a quiescent overall level over the first year of fermi-latobservations. the lat gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as synchrotron self-compton(ssc) emission from the electron population producing the radio-to-x-rayemission in the core. the resultant ssc spectrum extrapolates smoothly from thelat band to the historical-minimum tev emission. alternative models for thecore and possible contributions from the kiloparsec-scale jet in m87 areconsidered, and can not be excluded.

0910.3611	x-ray emitting ghz-peaked spectrum galaxies: testing a  dynamical-radiative model with broad-band spectra	in a dynamical-radiative model we recently developed to describe the physicsof compact, ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) sources, the relativistic jets propagateacross the inner, kpc-sized region of the host galaxy, while the electronpopulation of the expanding lobes evolves and emits synchrotron andinverse-compton (ic) radiation. interstellar-medium gas clouds engulfed by theexpanding lobes, and photoionized by the active nucleus, are responsible forthe radio spectral turnover through free-free absorption (ffa) of thesynchrotron photons. the model provides a description of the evolution of thespectral energy distribution (sed) of gps sources with their expansion,predicting significant and complex high-energy emission, from the x-ray to thegamma-ray frequency domain. here, we test this model with the broad-band sedsof a sample of eleven x-ray emitting gps galaxies with compact-symmetric-object(cso) morphology, and show that: (i) the shape of the radio continuum atfrequencies lower than the spectral turnover is indeed well accounted for bythe ffa mechanism; (ii) the observed x-ray spectra can be interpreted asnon-thermal radiation produced via ic scattering of the local radiation fieldsoff the lobe particles, providing a viable alternative to the thermal,accretion-disk dominated scenario. we also show that the relation between thehydrogen column densities derived from the x-ray (n_h) and radio (n_hi) data ofthe sources is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, if confirmed byfuture observations, would provide further support to our scenario ofhigh-energy emitting lobes.

0707.2369	radio loudness of agns: host galaxy morphology and the spin paradigm	we investigate how the total radio luminosity of agn-powered radio sourcesdepends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. we findthat agns form two distinct and well separated sequences on the radio-loudness- eddington-ratio plane. we argue that these sequences mark the real upperbounds of radio-loudness of two distinct populations of agns: those hostedrespectively by elliptical and disk galaxies. both sequences show the samedependence of the radio-loudness on the eddington ratio (an increase withdecreasing eddington ratio), which suggests that another parameter in additionto the accretion rate must play a role in determining the jet productionefficiency in active galactic nuclei, and that this parameter is related toproperties of the host galaxy. the revealed host-related radio dichotomy breaksdown at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasarshosted by elliptical galaxies is radio quiet. we argue that the huge differencebetween the radio-loudness reachable by agns in disc and elliptical galaxiescan be explained by the scenario according to which the spin of a black holedetermines the outflow's power, and central black holes can reach large spinsonly in early type galaxies (following major mergers), and not (in astatistical sense) in spiral galaxies.

1009.2666	a novel approach in constraining electron spectra in blazar jets: the  case of markarian 421	we report results from the observations of the well studied tev blazar mrk421 with the swift and the suzaku satellites in december 2008. during theobservation, mrk 421 was found in a relatively low activity state, with thecorresponding 2-10 kev flux of $3 \times 10^{-10}$ erg/s/cm^2. for the purposeof robust constraining the uv-to-x-ray emission continuum we selected only thedata corresponding to truly simultaneous time intervals between swift andsuzaku, allowing us to obtain a good-quality, broad-band spectrum despite amodest length (0.6 ksec) exposure. we analyzed the spectrum with the parametricforward-fitting synchrotron model implemented in xspec assuming two differentrepresentations of the underlying electron energy distribution, both wellmotivated by the current particle acceleration models: a power-law distributionabove the minimum energy $\gamma_{\rm min}$ with an exponential cutoff at themaximum energy $\gamma_{\rm max}$, and a modified ultra-relativistic maxwellianwith an equilibrium energy $\gamma_{\rm eq}$. we found that the latter impliesunlikely physical conditions within the blazar zone of mrk 421. on the otherhand, the exponentially moderated power-law electron distribution gives twopossible sets of the model parameters: (i) flat spectrum $dn'_e/d\gamma \propto\gamma^{-1.91}$ with low minimum electron energy $\gamma_{\rm min}&lt;10^3$, and(ii) steep spectrum $\propto \gamma^{-2.77}$ with high minimum electron energy$\gamma_{\rm min}\simeq 2\times10^4$. we discuss different interpretations ofboth possibilities in the context of a diffusive acceleration of electrons atrelativistic, sub- or superluminal shocks. we also comment on how exactly thegamma-ray data can be used to discriminate between the proposed differentscenarios.

0709.1528	multiwavelength observations of the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks  1510-089: clues on the jet composition	we present the results from a multiwavelength campaign of the powerfulgamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089. this campaign commenced with a deep suzakuobservation lasting three days for a total exposure time of 120 ks, andcontinued with swift monitoring over 18 days. besides swift observations, thecampaign included ground-based optical and radio data, and yielded aquasi-simultaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution from 10^9 hz to10^{19} hz. the suzaku observation provided a high s/n x-ray spectrum, which iswell represented by an extremely hard power-law with photon index gamma ~ 1.2,augmented by a soft component apparent below 1 kev, which is well described bya black-body model with temperature kt ~ 0.2 kev. monitoring by suzaku revealedtemporal variability which is different between the low and high energy bands,again suggesting the presence of a second, variable component in addition tothe primary power-law emission.we model the broadband spectrum of pks 1510-089assuming that the high energy spectral component results from comptonization ofinfrared radiation produced by hot dust located in the surrounding moleculartorus. in the adopted internal shock scenario, the derived model parametersimply that the power of the jet is dominated by protons but with a number ofelectrons/positrons exceeding a number of protons by a factor ~10. we also findthat inhomogeneities responsible for the shock formation, prior to thecollision may produce bulk-compton radiation which can explain the observedsoft x-ray excess and possible excess at ~18 kev. we note, however, that thebulk-compton interpretation is not unique, and the observed soft excess couldarise as well via some other processes discussed briefly in the text.

1101.2930	on the radio and optical luminosity evolution of quasars	we calculate simultaneously the radio and optical luminosity evolutions ofquasars, and the distribution in radio loudness r defined as the ratio of radioand optical luminosities, using a flux limited data set containing 636 quasarswith radio and optical fluxes from white et al. we first note that when dealingwith multivariate data it is imperative to first determine the truecorrelations among the variables, not those introduced by the observationalselection effects, before obtaining the individual distributions of thevariables. we use the methods developed by efron and petrosian which aredesigned to obtain unbiased correlations, distributions, and evolution withredshift from a data set truncated due to observational biases. it is foundthat the population of quasars exhibits strong positive correlation between theradio and optical luminosities. with this correlation, whether intrinsic orobservationally induced accounted for, we find that there is a strongluminosity evolution with redshift in both wavebands, with significantly higherradio than optical evolution. we also construct the local radio and opticalluminosity functions and the density evolution. finally, we consider thedistribution of the radio loudness parameter r obtained from careful treatmentof the selection effects and luminosity evolutions with that obtained from theraw data without such considerations. we find a significant difference betweenthe two distributions and no clear sign of bi-modality in the true distributionfor the range of r values considered. our results indicate therefore, somewhatsurprisingly, that there is no critical switch in the efficiency of theproduction of disk outflows/jets between very radio quiet and very radio loudquasars, but rather a smooth transition. also, this efficiency seems higher forthe high-redshift and more luminous sources in the considered sample.

1111.5343	an experiment to locate the site of tev flaring in m87	we describe a chandra x-ray too project designed to isolate the site of tevflaring in the radio galaxy m87. to date, we have triggered the chandraobservations only once (2010 april) and by the time of the first of our 9observations, the tev flare had ended. however, we found that the x-rayintensity of the unresolved nucleus was at an elevated level for our firstobservation. of the more than 60 chandra observations we have made of the m87jet covering 9 years, the nucleus was measured at a comparably high level only3 times. two of these occasions can be associated with tev flaring, and at thetime of the third event, there were no tev monitoring activities. from therapidity of the intensity drop of the nucleus, we infer that the size of theemitting region is of order a few light days times the unknown beaming factor;comparable to the same sort of estimate for the tev emitting region. we alsofind evidence of spectral evolution in the x-ray band which seems consistentwith radiative losses affecting the non-thermal population of the emittingelectrons within the unresolved nucleus.

1202.0868	suzaku x-ray imaging of the extended lobe in the giant radio galaxy  ngc6251 associated with the fermi-lat source 2fglj1629.4+8236	we report the results of a suzaku x-ray imaging study of ngc6251, a nearbygiant radio galaxy with intermediate fr i/ii radio properties. our pointingdirection was centered on the gamma -ray emission peak recently discovered withfermi-lat around the position of the north-west radio lobe 15 arcmin offsetfrom the nucleus. after subtracting two "off-source" pointings adjacent to theradio lobe, and removing possible contaminants in the xis field of view, wefound significant residual x-ray emission most likely diffuse in nature. thespectrum of the excess x-ray emission is well fit by a power law with photonindex \gamma = 1.90 +- 0.15 and a 0.5 - 8 kev flux of 4 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}. we interpret this diffuse x-ray emission component as being due toinverse-compton up-scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons byultrarelativistic electrons within the lobe, with only a minor contributionfrom the beamed emission of the large-scale jet. utilizing archival radio datafor the source, we demonstrate by means of broad-band spectral modeling thatthe -ray flux of the fermi-lat source 2fgl j1629.4+8236 may well be accountedfor by the high-energy tail of the inverse-compton continuum of the lobe. thus,this claimed association of gamma-rays from the north-west lobe of ngc6251,together with the recent fermi-lat imaging of the extended lobes of centaurusa, indicates that particles may be efficiently (re-)accelerated up toultrarelativistic energies within extended radio lobes of nearby radio galaxiesin general.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1208.1370	constraints on the gamma-ray emission from the cluster-scale agn  outburst in the hydra a galaxy cluster	in some galaxy clusters powerful agn have blown bubbles with cluster scaleextent into the ambient medium. the main pressure support of these bubbles isnot known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. for such ascenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays fromthese systems. hydra a, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale agnoutburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being agamma-ray emitter with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) array andthe fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat). data obtained in 20.2 hours ofdedicated h.e.s.s. observations and 38 months of fermi-lat data, gathered byits usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-raysignal. no signal has been found in either data set. upper limits on thegamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. these are the firstlimits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting clusterscale agn outbursts. the non-detection of hydra a in gamma-rays has importantimplications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside thebubbles in this system. for the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadroniccosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing betweencosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. however, hadronic cosmicrays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubblesagainst the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. the largest population ofhighly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-compton gamma-rayproduction is found in the youngest inner lobes of hydra a. the limit on theinverse-compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of theequipartition value of 16 mug in the inner lobes.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1210.4237	giant lobes of centaurus a radio galaxy observed with the suzaku x-ray  satellite	[abridged] we report on suzaku observations of selected regions within thesouthern giant lobe of the radio galaxy centaurus a. we focus on distinct x-rayfeatures likely associated with fine radio structure of the lobe. we find thatthe spectral properties of the detected x-ray features are equally consistentwith thermal emission from hot gas, or with a power-law radiation continuum.however, the plasma parameters implied by these different models favor asynchrotron origin for the analyzed x-ray spots, indicating that a veryefficient acceleration of electrons is taking place within the giant structureof centaurus a, albeit only in isolated and compact regions. we also present adetailed analysis of the diffuse x-ray emission, resulting in a tentativedetection of a soft excess component best fitted by a thermal model with atemperature of 0.5 kev. the exact origin of the observed excess remainsuncertain, although energetic considerations point to thermal gas filling thebulk of the volume of the lobe and mixed with the non-thermal plasma. thecorresponding pressure of the thermal gas in such a case appears to be inalmost exact equipartition with the pressure provided by the radio-emittingelectrons and the magnetic field. although tentative, our findings potentiallyimply that the structure of the extended lobes in active galaxies is likely tobe highly inhomogeneous, with magnetic reconnection processes continuouslyconverting magnetic energy to internal energy of the plasma particles, leadingto spatial and temporal variations in the plasma parameters around theequilibrium condition.

1211.6782	fermi-lat and suzaku observations of the radio galaxy centaurus b	centaurus b is a nearby radio galaxy positioned in the southern hemisphereclose to the galactic plane. here we present a detailed analysis of about 43months of accumulated fermi-lat data of the gamma-ray counterpart of the sourceinitially reported in the 2nd fermi-lat catalog, and of newly acquired suzakux-ray data. we confirm its detection at gev photon energies, and analyze theextension and variability of the gamma-ray source in the lat dataset, in whichit appears as a steady gamma-ray emitter. the x-ray core of centaurus b isdetected as a bright source of a continuum radiation. we do not detect howeverany diffuse x-ray emission from the known radio lobes, with the provided upperlimit only marginally consistent with the previously claimed asca flux. twoscenarios that connect the x-ray and gamma-ray properties are considered. inthe first one, we assume that the diffuse non-thermal x-ray emission componentis not significantly below the derived suzaku upper limit. in this case,modeling the inverse-compton emission shows that the observed gamma-ray flux ofthe source may in principle be produced within the lobes. this associationwould imply that efficient in-situ acceleration of the radiating electrons isoccurring and that the lobes are dominated by the pressure from therelativistic particles. in the second scenario, with the diffuse x-ray emissionwell below the suzaku upper limits, the lobes in the system are insteaddominated by the magnetic pressure. in this case, the observed gamma-ray fluxis not likely to be produced within the lobes, but instead within the nuclearparts of the jet. by means of synchrotron self-compton modeling we show thatthis possibility could be consistent with the broad-band data collected for theunresolved core of centaurus b, including the newly derived suzaku spectrum.

0712.1220	on the evolution of and high-energy emission from ghz-peaked-spectrum  sources	here we discuss evolution and broad-band emission of compact (&lt; kpc) lobes inyoung radio sources. we propose a simple dynamical description for theseobjects, consisting of a relativistic jet propagating into a uniform gaseousmedium in the central parts of an elliptical host. in the framework of theproposed model, we follow the evolution of ultrarelativistic electrons injectedfrom a terminal hotspot of a jet to expanding lobes, taking into account theiradiabatic energy losses as well as radiative cooling. this allows us to discussthe broad-band lobe emission of young radio sources. in particular, we arguethat the observed spectral turnover in the radio synchrotron spectra of theseobjects cannot originate from the synchrotron self-absorption process but ismost likely due to free-free absorption effects connected with neutral cloudsof interstellar medium engulfed by the expanding lobes and photoionized byactive centers. we also find a relatively strong and complex high-energyemission component produced by inverse-compton up-scattering of varioussurrounding photon fields by the lobes' electrons. we argue that such highenergy radiation is strong enough to account for several observed properties ofghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) radio galaxies at uv and x-ray frequencies. inaddition, this emission is expected to extend up to gev (or possibly even tev)photon energies and can thus be probed by several modern gamma-ray instruments.in particular, we suggest that gps radio galaxies should constitute arelatively numerous class of extragalactic sources detected by glast.

1301.1400	thermal plasma in the giant lobes of the radio galaxy centaurus a	we present a faraday rotation measure (rm) study of the diffuse, polarized,radio emission from the giant lobes of the nearest radio galaxy, centaurus a.after removal of the smooth galactic foreground rm component, using an ensembleof background source rms located outside the giant lobes, we are left with aresidual rm signal associated with the giant lobes. we find the most likelyorigin of this residual rm is from thermal material mixed throughout therelativistic lobe plasma. the alternative possibility of a thin-skin/boundarylayer of magnetoionic material swept up by the expansion of the lobes is highlyunlikely since it requires, at least, an order of magnitude enhancement of theswept up gas over the expected intragroup density on these scales. strongdepolarisation observed from 2.3 to 0.96 ghz also supports the presence of asignificant amount of thermal gas within the lobes; although depolarisationsolely due to rm fluctuations in a foreground faraday screen on scales smallerthan the beam cannot be ruled out. considering the internal faraday rotationscenario, we find a thermal gas number density of ~10^{-4} cm^{-3} implying atotal gas mass of ~10^{10} m_solar within the lobes. the thermal pressureassociated with this gas (with temperature kt ~ 0.5 kev, obtained from recentx-ray results) is approximately equal to the non-thermal pressure, indicatingthat over the volume of the lobes, there is approximate equipartition betweenthe thermal gas, radio-emitting electrons and magnetic field (and potentiallyany relativistic protons present).

1301.1438	electron acceleration to relativistic energies at a strong  quasi-parallel shock wave	electrons can be accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies at strong(high-mach number) collisionless shock waves that form when stellar debrisrapidly expands after a supernova. collisionless shock waves also form in theflow of particles from the sun (the solar wind), and extensive spacecraftobservations have established that electron acceleration at these shocks iseffectively absent whenever the upstream magnetic field is roughly parallel tothe shock surface normal (quasi-parallel conditions). however, it is unclearwhether this magnetic dependence of electron acceleration also applies to thefar stronger shocks around young supernova remnants, where local magneticconditions are poorly understood. here we present cassini spacecraftobservations of an unusually strong solar system shock wave (saturn's bowshock) where significant local electron acceleration has been confirmed underquasi-parallel magnetic conditions for the first time, contradicting theestablished magnetic dependence of electron acceleration at solar systemshocks. furthermore, the acceleration led to electrons at relativistic energies(~mev), comparable to the highest energies ever attributed toshock-acceleration in the solar wind. these observations demonstrate that athigh-mach numbers, like those of young supernova remnant shocks, quasi-parallelshocks become considerably more effective electron accelerators.

1310.6956	hess j1818-154, a new composite supernova remnant discovered in tev  gamma rays and x-rays	composite supernova remnants (snrs) constitute a small subclass of theremnants of massive stellar explosions where non-thermal radiation is observedfrom both the expanding shell-like shock front and from a pulsar wind nebula(pwn) located inside of the snr. these systems represent a unique evolutionaryphase of snrs where observations in the radio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray regimesallow the study of the co-evolution of both these energetic phenomena. in thisarticle, we report results from observations of the shell-type snr g15.4+0.1performed with the high energy stereoscopic system (h.e.s.s.) and xmm-newton. acompact tev $\gamma$-ray source, hessj1818-154, located in the center andcontained within the shell of g15.4+0.1 is detected by h.e.s.s. and featurs aspectrum best represented by a power-law model with a spectral index of $-2.3\pm 0.3_{stat} \pm 0.2_{sys}$ and an integral flux off$(&gt;$0.42$\,\mathrm{tev}$)=($0.9 \pm 0.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm0.2_{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-12}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. furthermore, a recentobservation with xmm-newton reveals extended x-ray emission strongly peaked inthe center of g15.4+0.1. the x-ray source shows indications of anenergy-dependent morphology featuring a compact core at energies above 4 kevand more extended emission that fills the entire region within the snr at lowerenergies. together, the x-ray and vhe $\gamma$-ray emission provide strongevidence of a pwn located inside the shell of g15.4+0.1, and this snr cantherefore be classified as a \emph{composite} based on these observations. theradio, x-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn is compatible with aone-zone leptonic model that requires a low average magnetic field inside theemission region. an unambiguous counterpart to the putative pulsar, which isthought to power the pwn, has been detected neither in radio nor in x-rayobservations of g15.4+0.1.

0802.2302	radio-loudness of active galaxies and the black hole evolution	active galactic nuclei (agns) form two distinct sequences on theradio-loudness -- eddington-ratio plane. the `upper' sequence contains radioselected agns, the `lower' sequence is composed mainly of optically selectedagns. the sequences mark the upper bounds for the radio-loudness of twodistinct populations of agns, hosted respectively by elliptical and diskgalaxies. both sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on theeddington ratio (an increase with decreasing eddington ratio), which suggeststhat another parameter in addition to the accretion rate must play a role indetermining the efficiency of jet production in agns. we speculate that thisadditional parameter is the spin of the black hole, assuming that black holesin giant elliptical galaxies have (on average) much larger spins than blackholes in disc galaxies. possible evolutionary scenarios leading to such a spindichotomy are discussed. the galaxy-morphology related radio-dichotomy breaksdown at high accretion rates where the dominant fraction of luminous quasarsbeing hosted by giant ellipticals is radio quiet. this indicates that theproduction of powerful jets at high accretion rates is in most cases suppressedand, in analogy to x-ray binary systems (xrb) during high and very high states,may be intermittent. such intermittency can be caused by switches between twodifferent accretion modes, assuming that only during one of them an outflowfrom the central engine is sufficiently collimated to form a relativistic jet.

1404.3727	extreme blazars studied with fermi-lat and suzaku: 1es 0347-121 and  blazar candidate hess j1943+213	we report on our study of high-energy properties of two peculiar tevemitters: the "extreme blazar" 1es 0347-121 and the "extreme blazar candidate"hess j1943+213 located near the galactic plane. both objects are characterizedby quiescent synchrotron emission with flat spectra extending up to the hardx-ray range, and both were reported to be missing gev counterparts in thefermi-lat 2-year source catalog. we analyze a 4.5 year accumulation of thefermi-lat data, resulting in the detection of 1es 0347-121 in the gev band, aswell as in improved upper limits for hess j1943+213. we also present theanalysis results of newly acquired suzaku data for hess j1943+213. the x-rayspectrum is well represented by a single power law extending up to 25 kev withphoton index 2.00+/-0.02 and a moderate absorption in excess of the galacticvalue, in agreement with previous x-ray observations. no short-term x-rayvariability was found over the 80 ks duration of the suzaku exposure. under theblazar hypothesis, we modeled the spectral energy distributions of 1es 0347-121and hess j1943+213, and derived constraints on the intergalactic magnetic fieldstrength and source energetics. we conclude that although the classification ofhess j1943+213 has not yet been determined, the blazar hypothesis remains themost plausible option, since in particular the broad-band spectra of the twoanalyzed sources along with the source model parameters closely resemble eachother, and the newly available wise and ukidss data for hess j1943+213 areconsistent with the presence of an elliptical host at the distance ofapproximately ~600 mpc.

1404.5703	on the interaction of the pks b1358-113 radio galaxy with the abell 1836  cluster	[abridged] here we present the analysis of multifrequency data gathered forthe frii radio galaxy pks b1358-113, hosted in the brightest cluster galaxy ofabell 1836. the galaxy harbors one of the most massive black holes known todate and our analysis of the optical data reveals that this black hole is onlyweakly active. based on new chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations andarchival radio data we derive the preferred range for the jet kineticluminosity $\sim (0.5-3) \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. this is above the valuesimplied by various scaling relations proposed for radio sources in galaxyclusters, being instead very close to the maximum jet power allowed for thegiven accretion rate. we constrain the radio source lifetime as $\sim 40-70$myrs, and the total amount of deposited jet energy $\sim (2-8) \times10^{60}$\,ergs. the detailed analysis of the x-ray data provides indication forthe presence of a bow-shock driven by the expanding radio lobes into the abell1836 cluster environment, with the corresponding mach number $\sim 2-4$. this,together with the recently growing evidence that powerful frii radio galaxiesmay not be uncommon in the centers of clusters at higher redshifts, supportsthe idea that jet-induced shock heating may indeed play an important role inshaping the properties of clusters, galaxy groups, and galaxies in formation.we speculate on a possible bias against detecting jet-driven shocks in poorerenvironments, resulting from an inefficient electron heating at the shockfront, combined with a relatively long electron-ion equilibration timescale.

0803.0989	on the momentum diffusion of radiating ultrarelativistic electrons in a  turbulent magnetic field	here we investigate some aspects of stochastic acceleration ofultrarelativistic electrons by magnetic turbulence. in particular, we discussthe steady-state energy spectra of particles undergoing momentum diffusion dueto resonant interactions with turbulent mhd modes, taking rigorously intoaccount direct energy losses connected with different radiative coolingprocesses. for the magnetic turbulence we assume a given power spectrum of thetype $w(k) \propto k^{-q}$. in contrast to the previous approaches, however, weassume a finite range of turbulent wavevectors $k$, consider a variety ofturbulence spectral indexes $1 =&lt; q =&lt; 2$, and concentrate on the case of avery inefficient particle escape from the acceleration site. we find that fordifferent cooling and injection conditions, stochastic acceleration processestend to establish a modified ultrarelativistic maxwellian distribution ofradiating particles, with the high-energy exponential cut-off shaped by theinterplay between cooling and acceleration rates. for example, if the timescalefor the dominant radiative process scales with the electron momentum as$\propto p^r$, the resulting electron energy distribution is of the form$n_e(p) \propto p^2 exp[ - (1 / a) (p / p_eq)^a]$, where $a = 2-q-r$, and$p_eq$ is the equilibrium momentum defined by the balance between stochasticacceleration and energy losses timescales. we also discuss in more detail thesynchrotron and inverse-compton emission spectra produced by such an electronenergy distribution, taking into account klein-nishina effects. we point outthat the curvature of the high frequency segments of these spectra, even thoughbeing produced by the same population of electrons, may be substantiallydifferent between the synchrotron and inverse-compton components.

1412.1170	astro-h white paper - plasma diagnostic and dynamics of the galactic  center region	the most characteristic high-energy phenomena in the galactic center (gc)region is the presence of strong k-shell emission lines from highly ionized si,s, ar, ca, fe and ni, which form the galactic center x-ray emission (gcxe).these multiple lines suggest that the gcxe is composed of at least two plasmaswith temperatures of ~1 and ~7 kev. the gcxe also exhibits the k-shell linesfrom neutral si, s, ar, ca, fe and ni atoms. a debatable issue is the origin ofthe gcxe plasma; whether it is a diffuse plasma or integrated emission of manyunresolved point sources such as cataclysmic variables and active binaries.detailed spectroscopy for these lines may provide a reliable picture of thegcxe plasma. the origin of the k-shell lines from neutral atoms is most likelythe fluorescence by x-rays from a putative past flare of sgr a*. thereforeastro-h may provide unprecedented data for the past light curve of sgr a*. allthese lines may provide key information for the dynamics of the gcxe, usingpossible doppler shift and/or line broadening. this paper overviews these linefeatures and the previous interpretation of their origin. we propose extendedor revised science with the astro-h observations of some select objects in thegc region.

1412.3903	six years of fermi-lat and multi-wavelength monitoring of the broad-line  radio galaxy 3c 120: jet dissipation at sub-parsec scales from the central  engine	we present multi-wavelength monitoring results for the broad-line radiogalaxy 3c 120 in the mev/gev, sub-millimeter, and 43 ghz bands over six years.over the past two years, fermi-lat sporadically detected 3c 120 with highsignificance and the 230 ghz data also suggest an enhanced activity of thesource. after the mev/gev detection from 3c 120 in mjd 56240-56300, 43 ghz vlbamonitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejectionof a superluminal knot. since we observed the gamma-ray and vlba phenomena intemporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they arephysically connected. this assumption was further supported by the subsequentobservation that the 43 ghz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flareoccurred around mjd 56560. we can then infer that the mev/gev emission tookplace inside an unresolved 43 ghz core of 3c 120 and that the jet dissipationoccurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole, if we take thedistance of the 43 ghz core from the central black hole as ~ 0.5 pc, aspreviously estimated from the time lag between x-ray dips and knot ejections(marscher et al. 2002; chatterjee et al. 2009). based on our constraints on therelative locations of the emission regions and energetic arguments, we concludethat the gamma rays are more favorably produced via the synchrotronself-compton process, rather than inverse compton scattering of externalphotons coming from the broad line region or hot dusty torus. we also derivedthe electron distribution and magnetic field by modeling the simultaneousbroadband spectrum.

astro-ph;0203040	radiation from the relativistic jet: a role of the shear boundary layer	recent radio and optical large scale jets' observations suggest atwo-component jet morphology, consisting of a fast central spine surroundedwith a boundary layer with a velocity shear. we study radiation of electronsaccelerated at such boundary layers as an option for standard approachesinvolving internal shocks in jets. the acceleration process in the boundarylayer yields in a natural way a two component electron distribution: apower-law continuum with a bump at the energy, where energy gains equalradiation losses, followed by a cut-off. for such distributions we derive theobserved spectra of synchrotron and inverse-compton radiation, includingcomptonization of synchrotron and cmb photons. under simple assumptions ofenergy equipartition between the relativistic particles and the magnetic field,the relativistic jet velocity at large scales and a turbulent character of theshear layer, the considered radiation can substantially contribute to the jetradiative output. in the considered conditions the synchrotron emission ischaracterized by a spectral index of the radio-to-optical continuum beingapproximately constant along the jet. a characteristic feature of the obtainedbroad-band synchrotron spectrum is an excess at x-ray frequencies, similar tothe one observed in some objects by chandra. as compared to the uniform jetmodels, the velocity shear across the radiating boundary region leads todecrease and frequency dependence of the observed jet-counterjet radiobrightness asymmetry. we conclude that a careful investigation of theobservational data looking for the derived effects can allow to evaluate therole of the boundary layer acceleration processes and/or impose constraints forthe physical parameters of such layers in large scale jets.

astro-ph;0306251	high energy gamma-rays from fr i jets	thanks to hubble and chandra telescopes, some of the large scale jets inextragalactic radio sources are now being observed at optical and x-rayfrequencies. for the fr i objects the synchrotron nature of this emission issurely established, although a lot of uncertainties - connected for examplewith the particle acceleration processes involved - remain. in this paper westudy production of high energy gamma-rays in fr i kiloparsec-scale jets byinverse-compton emission of the synchrotron-emitting electrons. we considerdifferent origin of seed photons contributing to the inverse-comptonscattering, including nuclear jet radiation as well as ambient, stellar andcircumstellar emission of the host galaxies. we discuss how future detectionsor non-detections of the evaluated gamma-ray fluxes can provide constraints onthe unknown large scale jet parameters, i.e. the magnetic field intensity andthe jet doppler factor. for the nearby sources centaurus a and m 87, we findmeasurable fluxes of tev photons resulting from synchrotron self-comptonprocess and from comptonisation of the galactic photon fields, respectively. inthe case of centaurus a, we also find a relatively strong emission componentdue to comptonisation of the nuclear blazar photons, which could be easilyobserved by glast at energy ~10 gev, providing important test for theunification of fr i sources with bl lac objects.

astro-ph;0310795	multifrequency radiation of extragalactic large-scale jets	large-scale extragalactic jets, observed to extend from a few to a fewhundred kiloparsecs from active galactic nuclei, are now studied over manydecades in frequency of electromagnetic spectrum, from radio until (possibly)tev gamma rays. for hundreds of known radio jets, only about 25 are observed atoptical frequencies. most of them are relatively short and faint, with only afew exceptions, like 3c 273 or m 87, allowing for detailed spectroscopic andmorphological studies. somewhat surprisingly, the large-scale jets can be veryprominent in x-rays. up to now, about 25 jets were detected within the 1 - 10kev energy range, although the nature of this emission is still under debate.in general, both optical and x-ray jet observations present serious problemsfor standard radiation models for the considered objects. recent tevobservations of m 87 suggest the possibility of generating large photon fluxesat these high energies by its extended jet.  in this paper we summarize information about multiwavelength emission of thelarge-scale jets, and we point out several modifications of the standard jetradiation models (connected with relativistic bulk velocities, jet radialstratification and particle energization all the way along the jet), which canpossibly explain some of the mentioned puzzling observations. we also commenton gamma-ray emission of the discussed objects.

astro-ph;0401356	on multiwavelength emission of large-scale quasar jets	we discuss morphological properties of the large-scale jets in powerful radiosources, which are now observed at radio, optical and x-ray frequencies, inorder to determine the origin of their x-ray radiation and the nature of theparticle acceleration responsible for their multiwavelength emission. we showthat modeling knots of the these objects as stationary regions of energydissipation within the uniform and continuous jet flow leads to severalproblems. such problems are especially pronounced if the observed x-rayemission is due to inverse-compton scattering of the cmb radiation. we exploreanother possibility, namely that the knots represent moving and separateportions of the jet matter, with excess kinetic power. we suggest a possibleconnection between this scenario and the idea of intermittent/highly modulatedjet activity. the proposed model can explain some morphological properties ofquasar jets -- like high knot-to-interknot brightness contrasts,frequency-independent knot profiles and almost universal extents of the knotregions -- independently of the exact emission mechanism responsible forproducing the x-rays. in this context, we consider different possibilities forthe production of such x-ray radiation, and discuss the related issue ofparticle acceleration. we conclude that the appropriate process cannot bedesignated for certain yet. we suggest, however, that x-ray observations of thejet in 3c 120 (in which intermittent jet activity is quite distinct) alreadyseem to support the synchrotron origin of the x-ray emission, at least in thisobject.

astro-ph;0403179	on the jet activity in 3c 273	in this paper we comment on the possibility for intermittent jet activity inquasar 3c 273 on different time-scales. we propose, that striking morphology ofthe large-scale radio jet in this source, as well as the apparent lack of itscounterpart on the opposite side of the active center, may be explained in aframework of a restarting jet model. in particular, we propose that 3c 273radio source is intrinsically two-sided, and represents an analogue ofdouble-double radio galaxies, but only inclined at a small angle to the line ofsight. in this case, the apparent one-sideness of the kiloparsec-scale radiostructure may be due to combined doppler and time-travel effects alone, if the3c 273 large-scale jet itself is relativistic and matter-dominated. we alsopropose, that knotty morphology of the discussed jet, which is observed nowadditionally at optical and x-ray frequencies, indicates modulation in the jetkinetic power. this, together with the variability of the jet at small (parsec)scales, indicates that the jet activity in 3c 273, and possibly in othersimilar sources, is variable/modulated/intermittent over many differenttime-scales.

astro-ph;0411502	discovery of hard x-ray features around hotspots of cygnus a	we present results of analysis of a chandra observation of cygnus a in whichthe x-ray hotspots at the ends of the jets are mapped in detail. a hardness mapreveals previously unknown structure in the form of outer and inner hard arcsaround the hotspots, with hardness significantly enhanced compared with thehotspot central regions. the outer hard arcs may constitute the first detectionof the bow shock; the inner hard arcs may reveal where the jets impact on thehotspots. we argue that these features cannot result from electrons radiatingby the synchrotron self-compton process. instead we consider two possiblesources of the hard emission: the outer arcs may be due to thermal radiation ofhot intracluster gas compressed at the bow shock. alternatively, both outer andinner arcs may be due to synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated inturbulent regions highly perturbed by shocks and shear flows. comparison ofmeasured hardness ratios with simulations of the hardness ratios resulting fromthese processes show that it is more diffcult to explain the observations witha thermal model. although we cannot rule out a thermal model, we argue infavour of the non-thermal explanation. the hard regions in the secondaryhotspots suggest that jet activity is still powering these hotspots.

astro-ph;0501597	on the magnetic field in the kiloparsec-scale jet of radio galaxy m 87	several low-power kiloparsec-scale jets in nearby radio galaxies are knownfor their synchrotron radiation extending up to optical and x-ray photonenergies. here we comment on high-energy gamma-ray emission of one particularobject of this kind, i.e. the kiloparsec-scale jet of m 87 radio galaxy,resulting from comptonization of the starlight photon field of the host galaxyby the synchrotron-emitting jet electrons. in the analysis, we includerelativistic bulk velocity of the jet, as well as the klein-nishina effects. weshow, that upper limits to the kiloparsec-scale jet inverse-compton radiationimposed by hess and hegra cherenkov telescopes - which detected a variablesource of vhe gamma-ray emission within 0.1 deg (~30 kpc) of the m 87 centralregion - give us an important constraint on the magnetic field strength in thisobject, namely that the magnetic field cannot be smaller than the equipartitionvalue (referring solely to the radiating electrons) in the brightest knot ofthe jet, and most likely, is even stronger. in this context, we point out aneed for the amplification of the magnetic energy flux along the m 87 jet fromthe sub-parsec to kiloparsec scales, suggesting the turbulent dynamo as aplausible process responsible for the aforementioned amplification.

astro-ph;0501612	on the magnetic field in kpc-scale jets of fr i radio galaxies	the energy content of large-scale jets in fr i radio galaxies is still anopen issue. here we show that upper limits on the high-energy and veryhigh-energy gamma-ray emission of the kpc-scale jet in m 87 radio galaxyimposed by egret, whipple, and - most importantly - hegra and hessobservations, provide important constraints on the magnetic field strength inthis object. in particular, a non-detection of gamma-ray radiation from thebrightest part of this jet (knot a), expected from the inverse-comptonscattering of the starlight photons by the synchrotron-emitting jet electrons,implies that the magnetic field cannot be smaller than the equipartition value(referring solely to the radiating ultrarelativistic electrons), and mostlikely, is even stronger. in this context, we point out several consequences ofthe obtained result for the large-scale jet structures in fr i radio galaxiesand the m 87 jet in particular. for example, we discuss a potential need foramplification of the magnetic field energy flux along these jets (from sub-pcto kpc scales), suggesting a turbulent dynamo as a plausible processresponsible for the aforementioned amplification.

astro-ph;0602220	dynamics and high energy emission of the flaring hst-1 knot in the m 87  jet	stimulated by recent observations of a radio-to-x-ray synchrotron flare fromhst-1, the innermost knot of the m 87 jet, as well as by a detection of a veryhigh energy gamma-ray emission from m 87, we investigated the dynamics andmultiwavelength emission of the hst-1 region. we study thermal pressure of thehot interstellar medium in m 87 and argue for a presence of a gaseouscondensation in its central parts. interaction of the jet with such a featureis likely to result in formation of a converging reconfinement shock in theinnermost parts of the m 87 jet. we show that for a realistic set of theoutflow parameters, a stationary and a flaring part of the hst-1 knot located\~100 pc away from the active center can be associated with the deceleratedportion of the jet matter placed immediately downstream of the point where thereconfinement shock reaches the jet axis. we discuss a possible scenarioexplaining a broad-band brightening of the hst-1 region related to the variableactivity of the central core. we show that assuming a previous epoch of thehigh central black hole activity resulting in ejection of excess particles andphotons down along the jet, one may first expect a high-energy flare of hst-1due to inverse-comptonisation of the nuclear radiation, followed after a fewyears by an increase in the synchrotron continuum of this region. if this isthe case, then the recently observed increase in the knot luminosity in allspectral bands could be regarded as an unusual echo of the outburst that hadhappened previously in the active core of the m 87 radio galaxy.

astro-ph;0604095	radio-loudness of active galactic nuclei: observational facts and  theoretical implications	we investigate how the total radio luminosity of agn-powered radio sourcesdepends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. ourstudies cover about seven orders of magnitude in accretion luminosity and thefull range of agn black hole masses. we find that agns form two distinct andwell separated sequences on the radio-loudness -- eddington-ratio plane. the`upper' sequence is formed by radio selected agns, the `lower' sequencecontains mainly optically selected objects. whereas an apparent `gap' betweenthe two sequences may be an artifact of selection effects, the sequencesthemselves mark the real upper bounds of radio-loudness of two distinctpopulations of agns: those hosted respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies.both sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on the eddingtonratio (an increase with decreasing eddington ratio), which suggests that thenormalization of this dependence is determined by the black hole spin. thisimplies that central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average)much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disc galaxies. thisgalaxy-morphology related radio-dichotomy breaks down at high accretion rateswhere the dominant fraction of luminous quasars hosted by elliptical galaxiesis radio quiet. this led to speculations in the literature that formation ofpowerful jets at high accretion rates is intermittent and related to switchesbetween two disk accretion modes, as directly observed in some bh x-raybinaries. we argue that such intermittency can be reconciled with the spinparadigm, provided that successful formation of relativistic jets by rotatingblack holes requires collimation by mhd outflows from accretion disks.

astro-ph;0605721	absorption of nuclear gamma-rays on the starlight radiation in fr i  sources: the case of centaurus a	several bl lac objects are confirmed sources of variable and stronglydoppler-boosted tev emission produced in the nuclear portions of theirrelativistic jets. it is more than probable, that also many of the fr i radiogalaxies, believed to be the parent population of bl lacs, are tev sources, forwhich doppler-hidden nuclear gamma-ray radiation may be only too weak to bedirectly observed. here we show, however, that about one percent of the totaltime-averaged tev radiation produced by the active nuclei of low-power fr iradio sources is inevitably absorbed and re-processed by photon-photonannihilation on the starlight photon field, and the following emission of thecreated and quickly isotropized electron-positron pairs. in the case of theradio galaxy centaurus a, we found that the discussed mechanism can give adistinctive observable feature in the form of an isotropic gamma-ray halo. itresults from the electron-positron pairs injected to the interstellar medium ofthe inner parts of the elliptical host by the absorption process, andupscattering starlight radiation via the inverse-compton process mainly to thegev-tev photon energy range. such a galactic gamma-ray halo is expected topossess a characteristic spectrum peaking at ~0.1 tev photon energies, and thephoton flux strong enough to be detected by modern cherenkov telescopes and, inthe future, by glast. these findings should apply as well to the other nearbyfr i sources.

astro-ph;0606255	confronting x-ray emission models with the highest-redshift  kiloparsec-scale jets: the z=3.89 jet in quasar 1745+624	a newly identified kiloparsec-scale x-ray jet in the high-redshift z=3.89quasar 1745+624 is studied with multi-frequency very large array, hubble spacetelescope, and chandra x-ray imaging data. this is only the third large-scalex-ray jet beyond z&gt;3 known and is further distinguished as being the mostluminous relativistic jet observed at any redshift, exceeding 10^45 erg/s inboth the radio and x-ray bands. apart from the jet's extreme redshift,luminosity, and high inferred equipartition magnetic field (in comparison tolocal analogues), its basic properties such as x-ray/radio morphology and radiopolarization are similar to lower-redshift examples. its resolved linearstructure and the convex broad-band spectral energy distributions of threedistinct knots are also a common feature among known powerful x-ray jets atlower-redshift. relativistically beamed inverse compton and `non-standard'synchrotron models have been considered to account for such excess x-rayemission in other jets; both models are applicable to this high-redshiftexample but with differing requirements for the underlying jet physicalproperties, such as velocity, energetics, and electron acceleration processes.one potentially very important distinguishing characteristic between the twomodels is their strongly diverging predictions for the x-ray/radio emissionwith increasing redshift. this is considered, though with the limited sample ofthree z&gt;3 jets it is apparent that future studies targeted at veryhigh-redshift jets are required for further elucidation of this issue. finally,from the broad-band jet emission we estimate the jet kinetic power to be noless than 10^46 erg/s, which is about 10% of the eddington luminositycorresponding to this galaxy's central [abridged]

astro-ph;0609680	a method of estimation of the dynamical age of fr ii-type radio sources  from multifrequency data	we propose a new approach in determining ages of fr ii type radio sources. weapply the assumed dynamical model of kaiser et al. (1997) to a number of fr iitype radio galaxies observed at different radio frequencies, and fit - for eachfrequency separately - the model free parameters to the observed sources'quantities. such a procedure, using enlarged in fact a number of observables,enables us to determine relatively precise ages and other crucialcharacteristics of the analyzed sources. the resulting age estimates agree verywell with those obtained by means of `classical' spectral ageing method forobjects not older than 10 myr, for which good-quality spectral data areavailable. the presented method is however also applicable in the case of thesources older than this, and/or the ones for which the only availablelow-resolution radio data do not allow for detailed spectral ageing studies.our analysis indicates that the main factor precluding precise agedetermination for fr ii type radio galaxies regards the poorly known shape ofthe initial electron energy distribution injected by the jet terminal shocks tothe expanding lobes/cocoons. we briefly consider this issue, and conclude thatthe broad-band single power-law form assumed here may be accurate enough forthe presented estimates, although most likely it does not strictly correspondto some well-defined realistic particle acceleration process. instead, itshould be considered as a simplest model approximation of the initial electroncontinuum, averaged over a very broad energy range and over the age of thesource, with the effective spectral index which may be different for differentsources.

0811.2964	modelling the broad-band spectra of x-ray emitting gps galaxies	the study of the broad-band emission of ghz-peaked-spectrum (gps) radiogalaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the physical processes taking placein the central, kpc-sized region of their active hosts, where the jetspropagate and the lobes expand, interacting with the surrounding interstellarmedium (ism). we recently developed a new dynamical-radiative model to describethe evolution of the gps phenomenon (stawarz et al. 2008): as the relativisticjets propagate through the ism, gradually engulfing narrow-line emitting gasclouds along their way, the electron population of the expanding lobes evolves,emitting synchrotron light, as well as inverse-compton radiation viaup-scattering of the photon fields from the host galaxy and its active nucleus.the model, which successfully reproduces the key features of the gps radiosources as a class, provides a description of the evolution of their spectralenergy distribution (sed) with the lobes' expansion, predicting significant andcomplex x-ray to gamma-ray emission. we apply here the model to the broad-bandsed's of a sample of known, x-ray emitting gps galaxies, and show that: (i) thefree-free absorption mechanism enables us to reproduce the radio continuum atfrequencies below the turnover; (ii) the lobes' non-thermal, inverse-comptonemission can account for the observed x-ray spectra, providing a viablealternative to the thermal, accretion-dominated scenario. we also show that, inour sample, the relationship between the x-ray and radio hydrogen columndensitities, n_h and n_hi, is suggestive of a positive correlation, which, ifconfirmed, would support the scenario of high-energy emitting lobes.
