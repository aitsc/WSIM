physics;0210130	foreshocks explained by cascades of triggered seismicity	the observation of foreshocks preceding large earthquakes and the suggestionthat foreshocks have specific properties that may be used to distinguish themfrom other earthquakes have raised the hope that large earthquakes may bepredictable. among proposed anomalous properties are the larger proportion thannormal of large versus small foreshocks, the power law acceleration ofseismicity rate as a function of time to the mainshock and the spatialmigration of foreshocks toward the mainshock, when averaging over manysequences. using southern california seismicity, we show that these propertiesand others arise naturally from the simple model that any earthquake maytrigger other earthquakes, without arbitrary distinction between foreshocks,aftershocks and mainshocks. we find that foreshocks precursory properties areindependent of the mainshock size. this implies that earthquakes (large orsmall) are predictable to the same degree as seismicity rate is predictablefrom past seismicity by taking into account cascades of triggering. thecascades of triggering give rise naturally to long-range and long-timeinteractions, which can explain the observations of correlations in seismicityover surprisingly large length scales.

physics;0505079	fundamental factors versus herding in the 2000-2005 us stock market and  prediction	we present a general methodology to incorporate fundamental economic factorsto our previous theory of herding to describe bubbles and antibubbles. we startfrom the strong form of rational expectation and derive the general method toincorporate factors in addition to the log-periodic power law (lppl) signatureof herding developed in ours and others' works. these factors include interestrate, interest spread, historical volatility, implied volatility and exchangerates. standard statistical aic and wilks tests allow us to compare theexplanatory power of the different proposed factor models. we find that thehistorical volatility played the key role before august of 2002. around october2002, the interest rate dominated. in the first six months of 2003, the foreignexchange rate became the key factor. since the end of 2003, all factors haveplayed an increasingly large role. however, the most surprising result is thatthe best model is the second-order lppl without any factor. we thus present ascenario for the future evolution of the us stock market based on theextrapolation of the fit of the second-order lppl formula, which suggests thatherding is still the dominating force and that the unraveling of the us stockmarket antibubble since 2000 is still qualitatively similar to (butquantitatively different from) the japanese nikkei case after 1990.

physics;0607197	lead-lag cross-sectional structure and detection of  correlated-anticorrelated regime shifts: application to the volatilities of  inflation and economic growth rates	we have recently introduced the ``thermal optimal path'' (top) method toinvestigate the real-time lead-lag structure between two time series. the topmethod consists in searching for a robust noise-averaged optimal path of thedistance matrix along which the two time series have the greatest similarity.here, we generalize the top method by introducing a more general definition ofdistance which takes into account possible regime shifts between positive andnegative correlations. this generalization to track possible changes ofcorrelation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention(or consensus) to another. numerical simulations on synthetic time seriesverify that the new top method performs as expected even in the presence ofsubstantial noise. we then apply it to investigate changes of convention in thedependence structure between the historical volatilities of the usa inflationrate and economic growth rate. several measures show that the new top methodsignificantly outperforms standard cross-correlation methods.

physics;0701171	a case study of speculative financial bubbles in the south african stock  market 2003-2006	we tested 45 indices and common stocks traded in the south african stockmarket for the possible existence of a bubble over the period from jan. 2003 tomay 2006. a bubble is defined by a faster-than-exponential acceleration withsignificant log-periodic oscillations. the faster-than-exponential accelerationcharacteristics are tested with several different metrics, includingnonlinearity on the logarithm of the price and power law fits. the log-periodicproperties are investigated in detail using the first-order log-periodicpower-law (lppl) formula, the parametric detrending method, the$(h,q)$-analysis, and the second-order weierstrass-type model, resulting in aconsistent and robust estimation of the fundamental angular log-frequency$\omega_1 =7\pm 2$, in reasonable agreement with previous estimations on manyother bubbles in developed and developing markets. sensitivity tests of theestimated critical times and of the angular log-frequency are performed byvarying the first date and the last date of the stock price time series. thesetests show that the estimated parameters are robust. with the insight of 6additional month of data since the analysis was performed, we observe that manyof the stocks on the south africa market experienced an abrupt drop mid-june2006, which is compatible with the predicted $t_c$ for several of the stocks,but not all. this suggests that the mini-crash that occurred around mid-june of2006 was only a partial correction, which has resumed into a renewed bubblyacceleration bound to end some times in 2007, similarly to what happened on thes&amp;p500 us market from oct. 1997 to aug. 1998.

physics;0703084	automatic reconstruction of fault networks from seismicity catalogs: 3d  optimal anisotropic dynamic clustering	we propose a new pattern recognition method that is able to reconstruct the3d structure of the active part of a fault network using the spatial locationof earthquakes. the method is a generalization of the so-called dynamicclustering method, that originally partitions a set of datapoints intoclusters, using a global minimization criterion over the spatial inertia ofthose clusters. the new method improves on it by taking into account the fullspatial inertia tensor of each cluster, in order to partition the dataset intofault-like, anisotropic clusters. given a catalog of seismic events, the outputis the optimal set of plane segments that fits the spatial structure of thedata. each plane segment is fully characterized by its location, size andorientation. the main tunable parameter is the accuracy of the earthquakelocalizations, which fixes the resolution, i.e. the residual variance of thefit. the resolution determines the number of fault segments needed to describethe earthquake catalog, the better the resolution, the finer the structure ofthe reconstructed fault segments. the algorithm reconstructs successfully thefault segments of synthetic earthquake catalogs. applied to the real catalogconstituted of a subset of the aftershocks sequence of the 28th june 1992landers earthquake in southern california, the reconstructed plane segmentsfully agree with faults already known on geological maps, or with blind faultsthat appear quite obvious on longer-term catalogs. future improvements of themethod are discussed, as well as its potential use in the multi-scale study ofthe inner structure of fault zones.

0904.0944	gravity-driven instabilities: interplay between state-and-velocity  dependent frictional sliding and stress corrosion damage cracking	we model the progressive maturation of a heterogeneous mass towards agravity-driven instability, characterized by the competition between frictionalsliding and tension cracking, using array of slider blocks on an inclined basalsurface, which interact via elastic-brittle springs. a realistic state- andrate-dependent friction law describes the block-surface interaction. the innermaterial damage occurs via stress corrosion. three regimes, controlling themass instability and its precursory behavior, are classified as a function ofthe ratio $t_c/t_f$ of two characteristic time scales associated with internaldamage/creep and with frictional sliding. for $t_c/t_f \gg 1$, the whole massundergoes a series of internal stick and slip events, associated with aninitial slow average downward motion of the whole mass, and progressivelyaccelerates until a global coherent runaway is observed. for $t_c/t_f \ll 1$,creep/damage occurs sufficiently fast compared with nucleation of sliding,causing bonds to break, and the bottom part of the mass undergoes afragmentation process with the creation of a heterogeneous population ofsliding blocks. for the intermediate regime $t_c/t_f \sim 1$, a macroscopiccrack nucleates and propagates along the location of the largest curvatureassociated with the change of slope from the stable frictional state in theupper part to the unstable frictional sliding state in the lower part. theother important parameter is the young modulus $y$ which controls thecorrelation length of displacements in the system.

0905.0220	financial bubbles, real estate bubbles, derivative bubbles, and the  financial and economic crisis	the financial crisis of 2008, which started with an initially well-definedepicenter focused on mortgage backed securities (mbs), has been cascading intoa global economic recession, whose increasing severity and uncertain durationhas led and is continuing to lead to massive losses and damage for billions ofpeople. heavy central bank interventions and government spending programs havebeen launched worldwide and especially in the usa and europe, with the hope tounfreeze credit and boltster consumption. here, we present evidence andarticulate a general framework that allows one to diagnose the fundamentalcause of the unfolding financial and economic crisis: the accumulation ofseveral bubbles and their interplay and mutual reinforcement has led to anillusion of a "perpetual money machine" allowing financial institutions toextract wealth from an unsustainable artificial process. taking stock of thisdiagnostic, we conclude that many of the interventions to address the so-calledliquidity crisis and to encourage more consumption are ill-advised and evendangerous, given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the "goodtimes" but that huge liabilities were. the most "interesting" present timesconstitute unique opportunities but also great challenges, for which we offer afew recommendations.

0911.1921	diagnostics of rational expectation financial bubbles with stochastic  mean-reverting termination times	we propose two rational expectation models of transient financial bubbleswith heterogeneous arbitrageurs and positive feedbacks leading toself-reinforcing transient stochastic faster-than-exponential price dynamics.as a result of the nonlinear feedbacks, the termination of a bubble is found tobe characterized by a finite-time singularity in the bubble price formationprocess ending at some potential critical time $\tilde{t}_c$, which follows amean-reversing stationary dynamics. because of the heterogeneity of therational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for theoptimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to thesurvival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. theexplicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlineartransformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence ofbubbles in financial time series. avoiding the difficult problem of parameterestimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the pricedynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles thatare in the making and to forecast their termination time. the tests performedon three financial markets, the us s&amp;p500 index from 1 february 1980 to 31october 2008, the us nasdaq composite index from 1 january 1980 to 31 july 2008and the hong kong hang seng index from 1 december 1986 to 30 november 2008,suggest the feasibility of advance bubble warning.

1003.5926	diagnosis and prediction of market rebounds in financial markets	we introduce the concept of "negative bubbles" as the mirror image ofstandard financial bubbles, in which positive feedback mechanisms may lead totransient accelerating price falls. to model these negative bubbles, we adaptthe johansen-ledoit-sornette (jls) model of rational expectation bubbles with ahazard rate describing the collective buying pressure of noise traders. theprice fall occurring during a transient negative bubble can be interpreted asan effective random downpayment that rational agents accept to pay in the hopeof profiting from the expected occurrence of a possible rally. we validate themodel by showing that it has significant predictive power in identifying thetimes of major market rebounds. this result is obtained by using a generalpattern recognition method which combines the information obtained at multipletimes from a dynamical calibration of the jls model. error diagrams, bayesianinference and trading strategies suggest that one can extract genuineinformation and obtain real skill from the calibration of negative bubbles withthe jls model. we conclude that negative bubbles are in general predictablyassociated with large rebounds or rallies, which are the mirror images of thecrashes terminating standard bubbles.

1006.0885	segmentation of fault networks determined from spatial clustering of  earthquakes	we present a new method of data clustering applied to earthquake catalogs,with the goal of reconstructing the seismically active part of fault networks.we first use an original method to separate clustered events from uncorrelatedseismicity using the distribution of volumes of tetrahedra defined by closestneighbor events in the original and randomized seismic catalogs. the spatialdisorder of the complex geometry of fault networks is then taken into accountby defining faults as probabilistic anisotropic kernels, whose structures aremotivated by properties of discontinuous tectonic deformation and previousempirical observations of the geometry of faults and of earthquake clusters atmany spatial and temporal scales. combining this a priori knowledge withinformation theoretical arguments, we propose the gaussian mixture approachimplemented in an expectation-maximization (em) procedure. a cross-validationscheme is then used and allows the determination of the number of kernels thatshould be used to provide an optimal data clustering of the catalog. thisthree-steps approach is applied to a high quality relocated catalog of theseismicity following the 1986 mount lewis ($m_l=5.7$) event in california andreveals that events cluster along planar patches of about 2 km$^2$, i.e.comparable to the size of the main event. the finite thickness of thoseclusters (about 290 m) suggests that events do not occur on well-definedeuclidean fault core surfaces, but rather that the damage zone surroundingfaults may be seismically active at depth. finally, we propose a connectionbetween our methodology and multi-scale spatial analysis, based on thederivation of spatial fractal dimension of about 1.8 for the set of hypocentersin the mnt lewis area, consistent with recent observations on relocatedcatalogs.

1007.4104	quantification of deviations from rationality with heavy-tails in human  dynamics	the dynamics of technological, economic and social phenomena is controlled byhow humans organize their daily tasks in response to both endogenous andexogenous stimulations. queueing theory is believed to provide a generic answerto account for the often observed power-law distributions of waiting timesbefore a task is fulfilled. however, the general validity of the power law andthe nature of other regimes remain unsettled. using anonymized data collectedby google at the world wide web level, we identify the existence of severaladditional regimes characterizing the time required for a population ofinternet users to execute a given task after receiving a message. depending onthe under- or over-utilization of time by the population of users and thestrength of their response to perturbations, the pure power law is found to becoextensive with an exponential regime (tasks are performed without too muchdelay) and with a crossover to an asymptotic plateau (some tasks are neverperformed). the characterization of the availability and efficiency of humanson their actions revealed by our study have important consequences tounderstand human decision-making, optimal designs of policies such as forinternet security, with spillovers to collective behaviors, crowds dynamics,and social epidemics.

1011.5343	inferring fundamental value and crash nonlinearity from bubble  calibration	identifying unambiguously the presence of a bubble in an asset price remainsan unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches.a large part of the problem is that the fundamental value of an asset is, ingeneral, not directly observable and it is poorly constrained to calculate.further, it is not possible to distinguish between an exponentially growingfundamental price and an exponentially growing bubble price. we present aseries of new models based on the johansen-ledoit-sornette (jls) model, whichis a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in financialmarkets. our new models identify the fundamental value of an asset price andcrash nonlinearity from a bubble calibration. in addition to forecasting thetime of the end of a bubble, the new models can also estimate the fundamentalvalue and the crash nonlinearity. besides, the crash nonlinearity obtained inthe new models presents a new approach to possibly identify the dynamics of acrash after a bubble. we test the models using data from three historicalbubbles ending in crashes from different markets. they are: the hong kong hangseng index 1997 crash, the s&amp;p 500 index 1987 crash and the shanghai compositeindex 2009 crash. all results suggest that the new models perform very well indescribing bubbles, forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamentalvalue and the crash nonlinearity. the performance of the new models is testedunder both the gaussian and non-gaussian residual assumption. under thegaussian residual assumption, nested hypotheses with the wilks statistics areused and the p-values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary.under non-gaussian residual assumption, we use a bootstrap method to get type iand ii errors of the hypotheses. all tests confirm that the generalized jlsmodels provide useful improvements over the standard jls model.

0710.0317	a general strategy for physics-based model validation illustrated with  earthquake phenomenology, atmospheric radiative transfer, and computational  fluid dynamics	validation is often defined as the process of determining the degree to whicha model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective ofits intended uses. validation is crucial as industries and governments dependincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. inthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose toformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics theprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. we thus offer a formalrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and therebyreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given modelby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. this approach is betteradapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. our procedurefactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used forvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.we illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of quantummechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with severalconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: acellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model forsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluiddynamics code for the richtmyer-meshkov instability. this article is anaugmented version of sornette et al.

1107.0838	role of diversification risk in financial bubbles	we present an extension of the johansen-ledoit-sornette (jls) model toinclude an additional pricing factor called the "zipf factor", which describesthe diversification risk of the stock market portfolio. keeping all thedynamical characteristics of a bubble described in the jls model, the new modelprovides additional information about the concentration of stock gains overtime. this allows us to understand better the risk diversification and toexplain the investors' behavior during the bubble generation. we apply this newmodel to two famous chinese stock bubbles, from august 2006 to october 2007(bubble 1) and from october 2008 to august 2009 (bubble 2). the zipf factor isfound highly significant for bubble 1, corresponding to the fact that valuationgains were more concentrated on the large firms of the shanghai index. it islikely that the widespread acknowledgement of the 80-20 rule in the chinesemedia and discussion forums led many investors to discount the risk of a lackof diversification, therefore enhancing the role of the zipf factor. for bubble2, the zipf factor is found marginally relevant, suggesting a larger weight ofmarket gains on small firms. we interpret this result as the consequence of theresponse of the chinese economy to the very large stimulus provided by thechinese government in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

1108.0099	a stable and robust calibration scheme of the log-periodic power law  model	we present a simple transformation of the formulation of the log-periodicpower law formula of the johansen-ledoit-sornette model of financial bubblesthat reduces it to a function of only three nonlinear parameters. thetransformation significantly decreases the complexity of the fitting procedureand improves its stability tremendously because the modified cost function isnow characterized by good smooth properties with in general a single minimum inthe case where the model is appropriate to the empirical data. we complementthe approach with an additional subordination procedure that slaves two of thenonlinear parameters to what can be considered to be the most crucial nonlinearparameter, the critical time $t_c$ defined as the end of the bubble and themost probably time for a crash to occur. this further decreases the complexityof the search and provides an intuitive representation of the results of thecalibration. with our proposed methodology, metaheuristic searches are notlonger necessary and one can resort solely to rigorous controlled local searchalgorithms, leading to dramatic increase in efficiency. empirical tests on theshanghai composite index (sse) from january 2007 to march 2008 illustrate ourfindings.

1201.1189	prediction of alpine glacier sliding instabilities: a new hope	mechanical and sliding instabilities are the two processes which may lead tobreaking off events of large ice masses. mechanical instabilities mainly affectunbalanced cold hanging glaciers. for the latter case, a prediction could beachieved based on data of surface velocities and seismic activity. the case ofsliding instabilities is more problematic. this phenomenon occurs on temperateglacier tongues. such instabilities are strongly affected by the subglacialhydrology: melt water may cause (i) a lubrication of the bed and (ii) adecrease of the effective pressure and consequently a decrease of basalfriction. available data from allalingletscher (valais) indicate that theglacier tongue experienced an active phase during 2-3 weeks with enhanced basalmotion in late summer in most years. in order to scrutinize in more detail theprocesses governing the sliding instabilities, a numerical model developed toinvestigate gravitational instabilities in heterogeneous media was applied toallalingletscher. this model enables to account for various geometricconfigurations, interaction between sliding and tension cracking and water flowat the bedrock. we could show that both a critical geometrical configuration ofthe glacier tongue and the existence of a distributed drainage network were themain causes of this catastrophic break-off. moreover, the analysis of themodeling results diagnose the phenomenon of recoupling of the glacier to itsbed as a potential new precursory sign announcing the final break-off. thismodel casts a gleam of hope for a better understanding of the ultimate ruptureof such glacier sliding instabilities.

1203.6231	strong gender differences in reproductive success variance, and the  times to the most recent common ancestors	the time to the most recent common ancestor (tmrca) based on humanmitochondrial dna (mtdna) is estimated to be twice that based on thenon-recombining part of the y chromosome (nry). these tmrcas have specialdemographic implications because mtdna is transmitted only from mother tochild, and nry from father to son. therefore, mtdna reflects female history,and nry, male history. to investigate what caused the two-to-one female-maletmrca ratio in humans, we develop a forward-looking agent-based model (abm)with overlapping generations and individual life cycles. we implement two mainmating systems: polygynandry and polygyny with different degrees in between. ineach mating system, the male population can be either homogeneous orheterogeneous. in the latter case, some males are `alphas' and others are`betas', which reflects the extent to which they are favored by female mates. aheterogeneous male population implies a competition among males with thepurpose of signaling as alphas. the introduction of a heterogeneous malepopulation is found to reduce by a factor 2 the probability of finding equalfemale and male tmrcas and shifts the distribution of the tmrca ratio to highervalues. we find that high male-male competition is necessary to reproduce atmrca ratio of 2: less than half the males can be alphas and betas can have atmost half the fitness of alphas. in addition, in the modes that maximize theprobability of having a tmrca ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, the present generationhas 1.4 times as many female as male ancestors. we also tested the effect ofsex-biased migration and sex-specific death rates and found that these areunlikely to explain alone the sex-biased tmrca ratio observed in humans. ourresults support the view that we are descended from males who were successfulin a highly competitive context, while females were facing a much smallerfemale-female competition.

1205.2915	universality class of balanced flows with bottlenecks: granular flows,  pedestrian fluxes and financial price dynamics	we propose and document the evidence for an analogy between the dynamics ofgranular counter-flows in the presence of bottlenecks or restrictions andfinancial price formation processes. using extensive simulations, we find thatthe counter-flows of simulated pedestrians through a door display many stylizedfacts observed in financial markets when the density around the door iscompared with the logarithm of the price. the stylized properties are presentalready when the agents in the pedestrian model are assumed to display azero-intelligent behavior. if agents are given decision-making capacity andadapt to partially follow the majority, periods of herding behavior mayadditionally occur. this generates the very slow decay of the autocorrelationof absolute return due to an intermittent dynamics. our finding suggest thatthe stylized facts in the fluctuations of the financial prices result from acompetition of two groups with opposite interests in the presence of aconstraint funneling the flow of transactions to a narrow band of prices.

1210.6321	high quality topic extraction from business news explains abnormal  financial market volatility	understanding the mutual relationships between information flows and socialactivity in society today is one of the cornerstones of the social sciences. infinancial economics, the key issue in this regard is understanding andquantifying how news of all possible types (geopolitical, environmental,social, financial, economic, etc.) affect trading and the pricing of firms inorganized stock markets. in this article, we seek to address this issue byperforming an analysis of more than 24 million news records provided bythompson reuters and of their relationship with trading activity for 206 majorstocks in the s&amp;p us stock index. we show that the whole landscape of news thataffect stock price movements can be automatically summarized via simpleregularized regressions between trading activity and news information piecesdecomposed, with the help of simple topic modeling techniques, into their"thematic" features. using these methods, we are able to estimate and quantifythe impacts of news on trading. we introduce network-based visualizationtechniques to represent the whole landscape of news information associated witha basket of stocks. the examination of the words that are representative of thetopic distributions confirms that our method is able to extract the significantpieces of information influencing the stock market. our results show that oneof the most puzzling stylized fact in financial economies, namely that atcertain times trading volumes appear to be "abnormally large," can be partiallyexplained by the flow of news. in this sense, our results prove that there isno "excess trading," when restricting to times when news are genuinely noveland provide relevant financial information.

1308.6756	apparent criticality and calibration issues in the hawkes self-excited  point process model: application to high-frequency financial data	we present a careful analysis of possible issues on the application of theself-excited hawkes process to high-frequency financial data. we carefullyanalyze a set of effects leading to significant biases in the estimation of the"criticality index" n that quantifies the degree of endogeneity of how muchpast events trigger future events. we report a number of model biases that areintrinsic to the estimation of brnaching ratio (n) when using power law memorykernels. we demonstrate that the calibration of the hawkes process on mixturesof pure poisson process with changes of regime leads to completely spuriousapparent critical values for the branching ratio (n~1) while the true value isactually n=0. more generally, regime shifts on the parameters of the hawkesmodel and/or on the generating process itself are shown to systematically leadto a significant upward bias in the estimation of the branching ratio. we alsodemonstrate the importance of the preparation of the high-frequency financialdata and give special care to the decrease of quality of the timestamps of tickdata due to latency and grouping of messages to packets by the stock exchange.altogether, our careful exploration of the caveats of the calibration of thehawkes process stresses the need for considering all the above issues beforeany conclusion can be sustained. in this respect, because the above effects areplaguing their analyses, the claim by hardiman, bercot and bouchaud (2013) thatfinancial market have been continuously functioning at or close to criticality(n~1) cannot be supported. in contrast, our previous results on e-mini s&amp;p 500futures contracts and on major commodity future contracts are upheld.

1312.4644	a generic model of dyadic social relationships	we introduce a model of dyadic social interactions and establish itscorrespondence with relational models theory (rmt), a theory of human socialrelationships. rmt posits four elementary models of relationships governinghuman interactions, singly or in combination: communal sharing, authorityranking, equality matching, and market pricing. to these are added the limitingcases of asocial and null interactions, whereby people do not coordinate withreference to any shared principle. our model is rooted in the observation thateach individual in a dyadic interaction can do either the same thing as theother individual, a different thing or nothing at all. to represent these threepossibilities, we consider two individuals that can each act in one out ofthree ways toward the other: perform a social action x or y, or alternativelydo nothing. we demonstrate that the relationships generated by this modelaggregate into six exhaustive and disjoint categories. we propose that four ofthese categories match the four relational models, while the remaining twocorrespond to the asocial and null interactions defined in rmt. we generalizeour results to the presence of n social actions. we infer that the fourrelational models form an exhaustive set of all possible dyadic relationshipsbased on social coordination. hence, we contribute to rmt by offering an answerto the question of why there could exist just four relational models. inaddition, we discuss how to use our representation to analyze data sets ofdyadic social interactions, and how social actions may be valued and matched bythe agents.

1403.3228	fractal multi-level organisation of human groups in a virtual world	humans are fundamentally social. they have progressively dominated theirenvironment by the strength and creativity provided by and within theirgrouping. it is well recognised that human groups are highly structured, andthe anthropological literature has loosely classified them according to theirsize and function, such as support cliques, sympathy groups, bands, cognitivegroups, tribes, linguistic groups and so on. recently, combining data on humangrouping patterns in a comprehensive and systematic study, zhou et al.identified a quantitative discrete hierarchy of group sizes with a preferredscaling ratio close to $3$, which was later confirmed for hunter-gatherergroups and for other mammalian societies. using high precision large scaleinternet-based social network data, we extend these early findings on a verylarge data set. we analyse the organisational structure of a complete,multi-relational, large social multiplex network of a human society consistingof about 400,000 odd players of a massive multiplayer online game for which weknow all about the group memberships of every player. remarkably, the onlineplayers exhibit the same type of structured hierarchical layers as thesocieties studied by anthropologists, where each of these layers is three tofour times the size of the lower layer. our findings suggest that thehierarchical organisation of human society is deeply nested in humanpsychology.

1404.2140	financial bubbles: mechanisms and diagnostics	we define a financial bubble as a period of unsustainable growth, when theprice of an asset increases ever more quickly, in a series of acceleratingphases of corrections and rebounds. more technically, during a bubble phase,the price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, oftenaccompanied by log-periodic oscillations. this dynamic ends abruptly in achange of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. because theyleave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is,before they burst. in this paper, we will explain the mechanism behindfinancial bubbles in an intuitive way. we will show how the log-periodic powerlaw emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are,as a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specifictrading dynamics and investment styles. we argue that the risk of a majorcorrection, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towardsmaturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubblesand to follow their development from as early a stage as possible. the toolsthat are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose. they are at thecore of the financial crisis observatory at the eth zurich, where tens ofthousands of assets are monitored on a daily basis. this allow us to have acontinuous overview of emerging bubbles in the global financial markets. thecompanion report available as part of the notenstein white paper series (2014)with the title ``financial bubbles: mechanism, diagnostic and state of theworld (feb. 2014)'' presents a practical application of the methodologyoutlines in this article and describes our view of the status concerningpositive and negative bubbles in the financial markets, as of the end ofjanuary 2014.

1407.5037	power law scaling and "dragon-kings" in distributions of intraday  financial drawdowns	we investigate the distributions of epsilon-drawdowns and epsilon-drawups ofthe most liquid futures financial contracts of the world at time scales of 30seconds. the epsilon-drawdowns (resp. epsilon- drawups) generalise the notionof runs of negative (resp. positive) returns so as to capture the risks towhich investors are arguably the most concerned with. similarly to thedistribution of returns, we find that the distributions of epsilon-drawdownsand epsilon-drawups exhibit power law tails, albeit with exponentssignificantly larger than those for the return distributions. this paradoxicalresult can be attributed to (i) the existence of significant transientdependence between returns and (ii) the presence of large outliers(dragon-kings) characterizing the extreme tail of the drawdown/drawupdistributions deviating from the power law. the study of the tail dependencebetween the sizes, speeds and durations of drawdown/drawup indicates a clearrelationship between size and speed but none between size and duration. thisimplies that the most extreme drawdown/drawup tend to occur fast and aredominated by a few very large returns. we discuss both the endogenous andexogenous origins of these extreme events.

1407.7118	estimation of the hawkes process with renewal immigration using the em  algorithm	we introduce the hawkes process with renewal immigration and make itsstatistical estimation possible with two expectation maximization (em)algorithms. the standard hawkes process introduces immigrant points via apoisson process, and each immigrant has a subsequent cluster of associatedoffspring of multiple generations. we generalize the immigration to come from arenewal process; introducing dependence between neighbouring clusters, andallowing for over/under dispersion in cluster locations. this complicatesevaluation of the likelihood since one needs to know which subset of theobserved points are immigrants. two em algorithms enable estimation here: thefirst is an extension of an existing algorithm that treats the entire branchingstructure - which points are immigrants, and which point is the parent of eachoffspring - as missing data. the second considers only if a point is animmigrant or not as missing data and can be implemented with linear timecomplexity. both algorithms are found to be consistent in simulation studies.further, we show that misspecifying the immigration process introducessignficant bias into model estimation-- especially the branching ratio, whichquantifies the strength of self excitation. thus, this extended model providesa valuable alternative model in practice.

1507.08689	multiple outlier detection in samples with exponential &amp; pareto tails:  redeeming the inward approach &amp; detecting dragon kings	we consider the detection of multiple outliers in exponential and paretosamples -- as well as general samples that have approximately exponential orpareto tails, thanks to extreme value theory. it is shown that a simple"robust" modification of common test statistics makes inward sequential testing-- formerly relegated within the literature since the introduction of outwardtesting -- as powerful as, and potentially less error prone than, outwardtests. moreover, inward testing does not require the complicated type 1 errorcontrol of outward tests. a variety of test statistics, employed in both blockand sequential tests, are compared for their power and errors, in casesincluding no outliers, dispersed outliers (the classical slippage alternative),and clustered outliers (a case seldom considered). we advocate a densitymixture approach for detecting clustered outliers. tests are found to be highlysensitive to the correct specification of the main distribution(exponential/pareto), exposing high potential for errors in inference. further,in five case studies -- financial crashes, nuclear power generation accidents,stock market returns, epidemic fatalities, and cities within countries --significant outliers are detected and related to the concept of "dragon king"events, defined as meaningful outliers of unique origin.

1508.04754	currency target zone modeling: an interplay between physics and  economics	we study the performance of the euro/swiss franc exchange rate in theextraordinary period from september 6, 2011 and january 15, 2015 when the swissnational bank enforced a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 swiss francs per euro.based on the analogy between brownian motion in finance and physics, thefirst-order effect of such a steric constraint would enter a priori in the formof a repulsive entropic force associated with the paths crossing the barrierthat are forbidden. non-parametric empirical estimates of drift and volatilityshow that the predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics areincorrect. the clue is to realise that the random walk nature of financialprices results from the continuous anticipations of traders about futureopportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an approximate efficientmarket with almost no arbitrage opportunities. with the swiss national bankstated commitment to enforce the barrier, traders's anticipation of this actionleads to a vanishing drift together with a volatility of the exchange rate thatdepends on the distance to the barrier. we give direct quantitative empiricalevidence that this effect is well described by krugman's target zone model[p.r. krugman. the quarterly journal of economics, 106(3):669-682, 1991].motivated by the insights from this economical model, we revise the initialeconomics-physics analogy and show that, within the context of hindereddiffusion, the two systems can be described with the same mathematics afterall. using a recently proposed extended analogy in terms of a colloidalbrownian particle embedded in a fluid of molecules associated with theunderlying order book, we derive that, close to the restricting boundary, thedynamics of both systems is described by a stochastic differential equationwith a very small constant drift and a linear diffusion coefficient.

1508.07503	two-state markov-chain poisson nature of individual cellphone call  statistics	humans are heterogenous and the behaviors of individuals could be differentfrom that at the population level. we conduct an in-depth study of the temporalpatterns of cellphone conversation activities of 73'339 anonymous cellphoneusers with the same truncated weibull distribution of inter-call durations. wefind that the individual call events exhibit a pattern of bursts, in which highactivity periods are alternated with low activity periods. surprisingly, thenumber of events in high activity periods are found to conform to a power-lawdistribution at the population level, but follow an exponential distribution atthe individual level, which is a hallmark of absence of memory in individualcall activities. such exponential distribution is also observed for the numberof events in low activity periods. together with the exponential distributionsof inter-call durations within bursts and of the intervals between consecutivebursts, we demonstrate that the individual call activities are driven by twoindependent poisson processes, which can be combined within a minimal model interms of a two-state first-order markov chain giving very good agreement withthe empirical distributions using the parameters estimated from real data forabout half of the individuals in our sample. by measuring directly thedistributions of call rates across the population, which exhibit power-lawtails, we explain the difference with previous population level studies,purporting the existence of power-law distributions, via the "superposition ofdistributions" mechanism: the superposition of many exponential distributionsof activities with a power-law distribution of their characteristic scalesleads to a power-law distribution of the activities at the population level.

1510.08162	"speculative influence network" during financial bubbles: application to  chinese stock markets	we introduce the speculative influence network (sin) to decipher the causalrelationships between sectors (and/or firms) during financial bubbles. the sinis constructed in two steps. first, we develop a hidden markov model (hmm) ofregime-switching between a normal market phase represented by a geometricbrownian motion (gbm) and a bubble regime represented by the stochasticsuper-exponential sornette-andersen (2002) bubble model. the calibration of thehmm provides the probability at each time for a given security to be in thebubble regime. conditional on two assets being qualified in the bubble regime,we then use the transfer entropy to quantify the influence of the returns ofone asset $i$ onto another asset $j$, from which we introduce the adjacencymatrix of the sin among securities. we apply our technology to the chinesestock market during the period 2005-2008, during which a normal phase wasfollowed by a spectacular bubble ending in a massive correction. we introducethe net speculative influence intensity (nsii) variable as the differencebetween the transfer entropies from $i$ to $j$ and from $j$ to $i$, which isused in a series of rank ordered regressions to predict the maximum loss(\%{maxloss}) endured during the crash. the sectors that influenced othersectors the most are found to have the largest losses. there is a clearprediction skill obtained by using the transfer entropy involving industrialsectors to explain the \%{maxloss} of financial institutions but not viceversa. we also show that the bubble state variable calibrated on the chinesemarket data corresponds well to the regimes when the market exhibits a strongprice acceleration followed by clear change of price regimes. our resultssuggest that sin may contribute significant skill to the development of generallinkage-based systemic risks measures and early warning metrics.

1512.03618	macroeconomic dynamics of assets, leverage and trust	a macroeconomic model based on the economic variables (i) assets, (ii)leverage (defined as debt over asset) and (iii) trust (defined as the maximumsustainable leverage) is proposed to investigate the role of credit in thedynamics of economic growth, and how credit may be associated with botheconomic performance and confidence. our first notable finding is the mechanismof reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return onassets. in regular economies where the ebita/assets ratio is larger than thecost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highestlong-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth).our second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a centralbank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth. we findthat late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highestlong-term return on assets and largest asset value. but this comes at the costof suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs. thephenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allowstrust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust ishigh. these results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying ourmodel: (a) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage; (b) economicagents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount ofassets. using a markov switching model for the ebita/assets ratio, we havesuccessfully calibrated our model to the empirical data of the return on equityof the euro stoxx 50 for the time period 2000-2013. we find that dynamics ofleverage and trust can be highly non-monotonous with curved trajectories, as aresult of the nonlinear coupling between the variables.

0806.2989	how to grow a bubble: a model of myopic adapting agents	we present a simple agent-based model to study the development of a bubbleand the consequential crash and investigate how their proximate triggeringfactor might relate to their fundamental mechanism, and vice versa. our agentsinvest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based onthree sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii)information from their "friendship" network and (iii) private information. ourbounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to thecurrent market regime by weighting each of these sources of information intheir trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. we findthat bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, dueto a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into atransient collective herding regime. after this self-amplified exuberance, theprice has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash,which brings the price even below its fundamental value. these ingredientsprovide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financialmarkets. paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the currentmarket regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility.a positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms(adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubblesand crashes. the model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite(herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within asingle framework and justifies the existence of two populations in thedistribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes arequalitatively different from the rest of the price moves.

1607.04136	secular bipolar growth rate of the real us gdp per capita: implications  for understanding past and future economic growth	we present a quantitative characterisation of the fluctuations of theannualized growth rate of the real us gdp per capita growth at many scales,using a wavelet transform analysis of two data sets, quarterly data from 1947to 2015 and annual data from 1800 to 2010. our main finding is that thedistribution of gdp growth rates can be well approximated by a bimodal functionassociated to a series of switches between regimes of strong growth rate$\rho_\text{high}$ and regimes of low growth rate $\rho_\text{low}$. thesuccession of such two regimes compounds to produce a remarkably stable longterm average real annualized growth rate of 1.6\% from 1800 to 2010 and$\approx 2.0\%$ since 1950, which is the result of a subtle compensationbetween the high and low growth regimes that alternate continuously. thus, theoverall growth dynamics of the us economy is punctuated, with phases of stronggrowth that are intrinsically unsustainable, followed by corrections orconsolidation until the next boom starts. we interpret these findings withinthe theory of "social bubbles" and argue as a consequence that estimations ofthe cost of the 2008 crisis may be misleading. we also interpret the absence ofstrong recovery since 2008 as a protracted low growth regime $\rho_\text{low}$associated with the exceptional nature of the preceding large growth regime.

cond-mat;0002075	finite-time singularity in the dynamics of the world population,  economic and financial indices	contrary to common belief, both the earth's human population and its economicoutput have grown faster than exponential, i.e., in a super-malthusian mode,for most of the known history. these growth rates are compatible with aspontaneous singularity occuring at the same critical time 2052 +- 10 signalingan abrupt transition to a new regime. the degree of abruptness can be inferedfrom the fact that the maximum of the world population growth rate was reachedin 1970, i.e., about 80 years before the predicted singular time, correspondingto approximately 4% of the studied time interval over which the acceleration isdocumented. this rounding-off of the finite-time singularity is probably due toa combination of well-known finite-size effects and friction and suggests thatwe have already entered the transition region to a new regime. in theoreticalsupport, a multivariate analysis coupling population, capital, r&amp;d andtechnology shows that a dramatic acceleration in the population during most ofthe timespan can occur even though the isolated dynamics do not exhibit it.possible scenarios for the cross-over and the new regime are discussed.nottale, chaline and grou have recently independently applied a log-periodicanalysis to the main crises of different civilisations. it is striking thatthese two independent analyses based on a different data set gives a criticaltime which is compatible within the error bars.

cond-mat;0003478	critical ruptures	the fracture of materials is a catastrophic phenomenon of considerabletechnological and scientific importance. here, we analysed experiments designedfor industrial applications in order to test the concept that, in heterogeneousmaterials such as fiber composites, rocks, concrete under compression andmaterials with large distributed residual stresses, rupture is a genuinecritical point, i.e. the culmination of a self-organization of damage andcracking characterized by power law signatures. specifically, we analyse theacoustic emissions recorded during the pressurisation of spherical tanks ofkevlar or carbon fibers pre-impregnated in a resin matrix wrapped up around athin metallic liner (steel or titanium) fabricated and instrumented bya\'erospatiale-matra inc. these experiments are performed as part of a routineindustrial procedure which tests the quality of the tanks prior to shipment andvaries in nature. we find that the seven acoustic emission recordings of sevenpressure tanks which was brought to rupture exhibit clear acceleration inagreement with a power law ``divergence'' expected from the critical pointtheory. in addition, we find strong evidence of log-periodic corrections thatquantify the intermittent succession of accelerating bursts and quiescentphases of the acoustic emissions on the approach to rupture. an improved modelaccounting for the cross-over from the non-critical to the critical regionclose to the rupture point exhibits interesting predictive potential.

cond-mat;0010050	large stock market price drawdowns are outliers	drawdowns are essential aspects of risk assessment in investment management.they offer a more natural measure of real market risks than the variance orother cumulants of daily (or some other fixed time scale) distributions ofreturns. here, we extend considerably our previous analysis by analyzing themajor financial indices, the major currencies, gold, the twenty largest u.s.companies in terms of capitalisation as well as nine others chosen randomly. wefind for the major financial markets that approximately 98% of thedistributions of drawdowns is well-represented by a stretched exponential whilethe largest drawdowns are occurring with a significantly larger rate thanpredicted by the stretched exponential: the largest drops thus constitutegenuine outliers. this is confirmed by extensive testing on surrogate data,which unambiguously show that large stock market drops (and crashes) cannot beaccounted for by the distribution of returns characterising the smaller marketmoves. they thus belong to a different class of their own and call for aspecific amplification mechanism. a similar scenario is found for the majorityof the company stocks analysed. drawups exhibit a similar behavior in onlyabout half the markets that we examined. in the spirit of bacon in novumorganum about 400 years ago, ``errors of nature, sports and monsters correctthe understanding in regard to ordinary things, and reveal general forms. forwhoever knows the ways of nature will more easily notice her deviations; and,on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describeher ways,'' we propose that outliers reveal fundamental properties of the stockmarket.

cond-mat;0110445	statistical significance of periodicity and log-periodicity with  heavy-tailed correlated noise	we estimate the probability that random noise, of several plausible standarddistributions, creates a false alarm that a periodicity (or log-periodicity) isfound in a time series. we investigate general situations with non-gaussiancorrelated noises and present synthetic tests on the detectability andstatistical significance of periodic components. increasing heavy-tailness(respectively correlations describing persistence) tends to decrease(respectively increase) the false-alarm probability of finding a large spuriouslomb peak. increasing anti-persistence tends to decrease the false-alarmprobability. we also study the interplay between heavy-tailness and long-rangecorrelations. in order to fully determine if a lomb peak signals a genuinerather than a spurious periodicity, one should in principle characterize thelomb peak height, its width and its relations to other peaks in the completespectrum. as a step towards this full characterization, we construct thejoint-distribution of the frequency position (relative to other peaks) and ofthe height of the highest peak of the power spectrum. we also provide thedistributions of the ratio of the second highest lomb peak to the maximum peak.using the insight obtained by the present statistical study, we re-examinepreviously reported claims of ``log-periodicity'' and find that the credibilityfor log-periodicity in 2d-freely decaying turbulence is weakened while it isstrengthened for fracture, for the ion-signature prior to the kobe earthquakeand for financial markets.

0810.1922	look-ahead benchmark bias in portfolio performance evaluation	performance of investment managers are evaluated in comparison withbenchmarks, such as financial indices. due to the operational constraint thatmost professional databases do not track the change of constitution ofbenchmark portfolios, standard tests of performance suffer from the "look-aheadbenchmark bias," when they use the assets constituting the benchmarks ofreference at the end of the testing period, rather than at the beginning of theperiod. here, we report that the "look-ahead benchmark bias" can exhibit asurprisingly large amplitude for portfolios of common stocks (up to 8% annumfor the s&amp;p500 taken as the benchmark) -- while most studies have emphasizedrelated survival biases in performance of mutual and hedge funds for which thebiases can be expected to be even larger. we use the crsp database from 1926 to2006 and analyze the running top 500 us capitalizations to demonstrate thatthis bias can account for a gross overestimation of performance metrics such asthe sharpe ratio as well as an underestimation of risk, as measured forinstance by peak-to-valley drawdowns. we demonstrate the presence of asignificant bias in the estimation of the survival and look-ahead biasesstudied in the literature. a general methodology to test the properties ofinvestment strategies is advanced in terms of random strategies with similarinvestment constraints.

cond-mat;9802059	large deviations and portfolio optimization	risk control and optimal diversification constitute a major focus in thefinance and insurance industries as well as, more or less consciously, in oureveryday life. we present a discussion of the characterization of risks and ofthe optimization of portfolios that starts from a simple illustrative model andends by a general functional integral formulation. a major theme is that risk,usually thought one-dimensional in the conventional mean-variance approach, hasto be addressed by the full distribution of losses. furthermore, thetime-horizon of the investment is shown to play a major role. we show theimportance of accounting for large fluctuations and use the theory of cram\'erfor large deviations in this context. we first treat a simple model with asingle risky asset that examplifies the distinction between the average returnand the typical return, the role of large deviations in multiplicativeprocesses, and the different optimal strategies for the investors depending ontheir size. we then analyze the case of assets whose price variations aredistributed according to exponential laws, a situation that is found todescribe reasonably well daily price variations. several portfolio optimizationstrategies are presented that aim at controlling large risks. we end byextending the standard mean-variance portfolio optimization theory, firstwithin the quasi-gaussian approximation and then using a general formulationfor non-gaussian correlated assets in terms of the formalism of functionalintegrals developed in the field theory of critical phenomena.

cond-mat;9809366	economic returns of research: the pareto law and its implications	at what level should government or companies support research? this complexmulti-faceted question encompasses such qualitative bonus as satisfying naturalhuman curiosity, the quest for knowledge and the impact on education andculture, but one of its most scrutinized component reduces to the assessment ofeconomic performance and wealth creation derived from research. in certainareas such as biotechnology, semi-conductor physics, optical communications,the impact of basic research is direct while, in other disciplines, the pathfrom discovery to applications is full of surprises. as a consequence, thereare persistent uncertainties in the quantification of the exact economicreturns of public expenditure on basic research. here, we suggest that theseuncertainties have a fundamental origin to be found in the interplay betweenthe intrinsic ``fat tail'' power law nature of the distribution of economicreturns, characterized by a mathematically diverging variance, and thestochastic character of discovery rates. in the regime where the cumulativeeconomic wealth derived from research is expected to exhibit a long-termpositive trend, we show that strong fluctuations blur out significantly theshort-time scales: a few major unpredictable innovations may provide a finitefraction of the total creation of wealth. in such a scenario, any attempt toassess the economic impact of research over a finite time horizon encompassingonly a small number of major discoveries is bound to be highly unreliable. newtools, developed in the theory of self-similar and complex systems to tacklesimilar extreme fluctuations in nature can be adapted to measure the economicbenefits of research, which is intimately associated to this large variability.

cond-mat;9810071	crashes as critical points	we study a rational expectation model of bubbles and crashes. the model hastwo components : (1) our key assumption is that a crash may be caused by localself-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. if the tendency for noisetraders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain pointcalled the ``critical'' point, all noise traders may place the same order(sell) at the same time, thus causing a crash. the interplay between theprogressive strengthening of imitation and the ubiquity of noise ischaracterized by the hazard rate, i.e. the probability per unit time that thecrash will happen in the next instant if it has not happened yet. (2) since thecrash is not a certain deterministic outcome of the bubble, it remains rationalfor traders to remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rateof growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. our model distinguishesbetween the end of the bubble and the time of the crash,: the rationalexpectation constraint has the specific implication that the date of the crashmust be random. the theoretical death of the bubble is not the time of thecrash because the crash could happen at any time before, even though this isnot very likely. the death of the bubble is the most probable time for thecrash. there also exists a finite probability of attaining the end of thebubble without crash. our model has specific predictions about the presence ofcertain critical log-periodic patterns in pre-crash prices, associated with thedeterministic components of the bubble mechanism. we provide empirical evidenceshowing that these patterns were indeed present before the crashes of 1929,1962 and 1987 on wall street and the 1997 crash on the hong kong stockexchange. these results are compared with statistical tests on synthetic data.

cond-mat;9907270	log-periodic power law bubbles in latin-american and asian markets and  correlated anti-bubbles in western stock markets: an empirical study	twenty-two significant bubbles followed by large crashes or by severecorrections in the argentinian, brazilian, chilean, mexican, peruvian,venezuelan, hong-kong, indonesian, korean, malaysian, philippine and thai stockmarkets indices are identified and analysed for log-periodic signaturesdecorating an average power law acceleration. we find that log-periodic powerlaws adequately describe speculative bubbles on these emerging markets withvery few exceptions and thus extend considerably the applicability of theproposed rational expectation model of bubbles and crashes which has previouslybeen developed for the major financial markets in the world. this model isessentially controlled by a crash hazard rate becoming critical due to acollective imitative/herding behavior of traders. furthermore, three of thebubbles are followed by a log-periodic ``anti-bubble'' previously documentedfor the decay of the japanese nikkei starting in jan. 1990 and the price ofgold starting in sept. 1980 thus rendering a qualitative symmetry of bubble andanti-bubble around the date of the peak of the market. a set of secondarywestern stock market indices (london, sydney, auckland, paris, madrid, milan,zurich) as well as the hong-kong stock market are also shown to exhibitwell-correlated log-periodic power law anti-bubbles over a period 6-15 monthstriggered by a rash of crises on emerging markets in the early 1994. as the usmarket declined by no more than 10% during the beginning of that period andquickly recovered, this suggests that these smaller stock western markets can``phase lock'' (in a weak sense) not only because of the over-arching influenceof wall street but also independently of the current trends on wall street dueto other influences.
