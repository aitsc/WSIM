0912.3229	a super-earth transiting a nearby low-mass star	a decade ago, the detection of the first transiting extrasolar planetprovided a direct constraint on its composition and opened the door tospectroscopic investigations of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. as suchcharacterization studies are feasible only for transiting systems that are bothnearby and for which the planet-to-star radius ratio is relatively large,nearby small stars have been surveyed intensively. doppler studies andmicrolensing have uncovered a population of planets with minimum masses of1.9-10 times the earth's mass (m_earth), called super-earths. the firstconstraint on the bulk composition of this novel class of planets was affordedby corot-7b, but the distance and size of its star preclude atmospheric studiesin the foreseeable future. here we report observations of the transiting planetgj 1214b, which has a mass of 6.55 m_earth and a radius 2.68 times earth'sradius (r_earth), indicating that it is intermediate in stature between earthand the ice giants of the solar system. we find that the planetary mass andradius are consistent with a composition of primarily water enshrouded by ahydrogen-helium envelope that is only 0.05% of the mass of the planet. theatmosphere is probably escaping hydrodynamically, indicating that it hasundergone significant evolution during its history. as the star is small andonly 13 parsecs away, the planetary atmosphere is amenable to study withcurrent observatories.

1001.0416	discovery and rossiter-mclaughlin effect of exoplanet kepler-8b	we report the discovery and the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of kepler-8b, atransiting planet identified by the nasa kepler mission. kepler photometry andkeck-hires radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet aroundthis f8iv subgiant host star. the planet has a radius rp = 1.419 rj and a mass,mp = 0.60 mj, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest densityplanets known. the orbital period is p = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axisis 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 au. the star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (v = 13.89 mag), both propertiesdeleterious to precise doppler measurements. the velocities are indeed noisy,with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with theplanet implied by the photometry. we securely detect the rossiter-mclaughlineffect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit asprograde. we measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbitalaxis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. rossiter-mclaughlinmeasurements of a large sample of transiting planets from kepler will provide astatistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbitorientations for hot jupiters in general.

1006.2763	five kepler target stars that show multiple transiting exoplanet  candidates	we present and discuss five candidate exoplanetary systems identified withthe kepler spacecraft. these five systems show transits from multiple exoplanetcandidates. should these objects prove to be planetary in nature, then thesefive systems open new opportunities for the field of exoplanets and provide newinsights into the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems. wediscuss the methods used to identify multiple transiting objects from thekepler photometry as well as the false-positive rejection methods that havebeen applied to these data. one system shows transits from three distinctobjects while the remaining four systems show transits from two objects. threesystems have planet candidates that are near mean motioncommensurabilities---two near 2:1 and one just outside 5:2. we discuss theimplications that multitransiting systems have on the distribution of orbitalinclinations in planetary systems, and hence their dynamical histories; as wellas their likely masses and chemical compositions. a monte carlo study indicatesthat, with additional data, most of these systems should exhibit detectabletransit timing variations (ttv) due to gravitational interactions---though noneare apparent in these data. we also discuss new challenges that arise in ttvanalyses due to the presence of more than two planets in a system.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5415	transit timing observations from kepler: iv. confirmation of 4 multiple  planet systems by simple physical models	eighty planetary systems of two or more planets are known to orbit starsother than the sun. for most, the data can be sufficiently explained bynon-interacting keplerian orbits, so the dynamical interactions of thesesystems have not been observed. here we present 4 sets of lightcurves from thekepler spacecraft, which each show multiple planets transiting the same star.departure of the timing of these transits from strict periodicity indicates theplanets are perturbing each other: the observed timing variations match theforcing frequency of the other planet. this confirms that these objects are inthe same system. next we limit their masses to the planetary regime byrequiring the system remain stable for astronomical timescales. finally, wereport dynamical fits to the transit times, yielding possible values for theplanets' masses and eccentricities. as the timespan of timing data increases,dynamical fits may allow detailed constraints on the systems' architectures,even in cases for which high-precision doppler follow-up is impractical.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1206.1592	kelt-2ab: a hot jupiter transiting the bright (v=8.77) primary star of a  binary system	we report the discovery of kelt-2ab, a hot jupiter transiting the bright(v=8.77) primary star of the hd 42176 binary system. the host is a slightlyevolved late f-star likely in the very short-lived "blue-hook" stage ofevolution, with $\teff=6148\pm48{\rm k}$, $\log{g}=4.030_{-0.026}^{+0.015}$ and$\feh=0.034\pm0.78$. the inferred stellar mass is$m_*=1.314_{-0.060}^{+0.063}$\msun\ and the star has a relatively large radiusof $r_*=1.836_{-0.046}^{+0.066}$\rsun. the planet is a typical hot jupiter withperiod $4.11379\pm0.00001$ days and a mass of $m_p=1.524\pm0.088$\mj\ andradius of $r_p=1.290_{-0.050}^{+0.064}$\rj. this is mildly inflated as comparedto models of irradiated giant planets at the $\sim$4 gyr age of the system.kelt-2a is the third brightest star with a transiting planet identified byground-based transit surveys, and the ninth brightest star overall with atransiting planet. kelt-2ab's mass and radius are unique among the subset ofplanets with $v&lt;9$ host stars, and therefore increases the diversity of brightbenchmark systems. we also measure the relative motion of kelt-2a and -2b overa baseline of 38 years, robustly demonstrating for the first time that thestars are bound. this allows us to infer that kelt-2b is an early k-dwarf. wehypothesize that through the eccentric kozai mechanism kelt-2b may haveemplaced kelt-2ab in its current orbit. this scenario is potentially testablewith rossiter-mclaughlin measurements, which should have an amplitude of$\sim$44 m s$^{-1}$.

1206.1635	kelt-1b: a strongly irradiated, highly inflated, short period, 27  jupiter-mass companion transiting a mid-f star	we present the discovery of kelt-1b, the first transiting low-mass companionfrom the wide-field kilodegree extremely little telescope-north (kelt-north)survey. the v=10.7 primary is a mildly evolved, solar-metallicity, mid-f star.the companion is a low-mass brown dwarf or super-massive planet with mass of27.23+/-0.50 mj and radius of 1.110+0.037-0.024 rj, on a very short period(p=1.21750007) circular orbit. kelt-1b receives a large amount of stellarinsolation, with an equilibrium temperature assuming zero albedo and perfectredistribution of 2422 k. upper limits on the secondary eclipse depth indicatethat either the companion must have a non-zero albedo, or it must experiencesome energy redistribution. comparison with standard evolutionary models forbrown dwarfs suggests that the radius of kelt-1b is significantly inflated.adaptive optics imaging reveals a candidate stellar companion to kelt-1, whichis consistent with an m dwarf if bound. the projected spin-orbit alignmentangle is consistent with zero stellar obliquity, and the vsini of the primaryis consistent with tidal synchronization. given the extreme parameters of thekelt-1 system, we expect it to provide an important testbed for theories of theemplacement and evolution of short-period companions, and theories of tidaldissipation and irradiated brown dwarf atmospheres.

1208.1268	improved spectroscopic parameters for transiting planet hosts	we report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effectivetemperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host starsof 56 transiting planets. our analysis is based primarily on the stellarparameter classification (spc) technique. we investigate systematic errors byexamining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been usedin previous studies (sme and moog). the spc and sme results, both based oncomparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strongcorrelations between temperature, [fe/h], and log g when solving for all threequantities simultaneously. in contrast the moog results, based on a moretraditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. to combat thecorrelations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, werepeat the spc analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellardensity that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves.previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have beensubject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and10%, respectively, which can be larger than other observational uncertainties,and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

1208.3712	the neptune-sized circumbinary planet kepler-38b	we discuss the discovery and characterization of the circumbinary planetkepler-38b. the stellar binary is single-lined, with a period of 18.8 days, andconsists of a moderately evolved main-sequence star (m_a = 0.949 +/- 0.059solar masses and r_a = 1.757 +/- 0.034 solar radii) paired with a low-mass star(m_b = 0.249 +/- 0.010 solar masses and r_b = 0.2724 +/- 0.0053 solar radii) ina mildly eccentric (e=0.103) orbit. a total of eight transits due to acircumbinary planet crossing the primary star were identified in the keplerlight curve (using kepler quarters 1 through 11), from which a planetary periodof 105.595 +/- 0.053 days can be established. a photometric dynamical model fitto the radial velocity curve and kepler light curve yields a planetary radiusof 4.35 +/- 0.11 earth radii, or 1.12 +/- 0.03 neptune radii. since the planetis not sufficiently massive to observably alter the orbit of the binary fromkeplerian motion, we can only place an upper limit on the mass of the planet of122 earth masses (7.11 neptune masses or 0.384 jupiter masses) at 95%confidence. this upper limit should decrease as more kepler data becomeavailable.

1301.1853	the hunt for exomoons with kepler (hek): ii. analysis of seven viable  satellite-hosting planet candidates	from the list of 2321 transiting planet candidates announced by the keplermission, we select seven targets with favorable properties for the capacity todynamically maintain an exomoon and present a detectable signal. these sevencandidates were identified through our automatic target selection (tsa)algorithm and target selection prioritization (tsp) filtering, whereby weexcluded systems exhibiting significant time-correlated noise and focussed onthose with a single transiting planet candidate of radius less than 6 earthradii. we find no compelling evidence for an exomoon around any of the sevenkois but constrain the satellite-to-planet mass ratios for each. for four ofthe seven kois, we estimate a 95% upper quantile of m_s/m_p&lt;0.04, which giventhe radii of the candidates, likely probes down to sub-earth masses. we alsoderive precise transit times and durations for each candidate and find noevidence for dynamical variations in any of the kois. with just a few systemsanalyzed thus far in the in-going hek project, projections on eta-moon would bepremature, but a high frequency of large moons aroundsuper-earths/mini-neptunes would appear to be incommensurable with our resultsso far.

1302.2596	kepler-68: three planets, one with a density between that of earth and  ice giants	nasa's kepler mission has revealed two transiting planets orbiting kepler-68.follow-up doppler measurements have established the mass of the innermostplanet and revealed a third jovian-mass planet orbiting beyond the twotransiting planets. kepler-68b, in a 5.4 day orbit has mass 8.3 +/- 2.3 earth,radius 2.31 +/- 0.07 earth radii, and a density of 3.32 +/- 0.92 (cgs), givingkepler-68b a density intermediate between that of the ice giants and earth.kepler-68c is earth-sized with a radius of 0.953 earth and transits on a 9.6day orbit; validation of kepler-68c posed unique challenges. kepler-68d has anorbital period of 580 +/- 15 days and minimum mass of msin(i) = 0.947 jupiter.power spectra of the kepler photometry at 1-minute cadence exhibit a rich andstrong set of asteroseismic pulsation modes enabling detailed analysis of thestellar interior. spectroscopy of the star coupled with asteroseismic modelingof the multiple pulsation modes yield precise measurements of stellarproperties, notably teff = 5793 +/- 74 k, m = 1.079 +/- 0.051 msun, r = 1.243+/- 0.019 rsun, and density 0.7903 +/- 0.0054 (cgs), all measured withfractional uncertainties of only a few percent. models of kepler-68b suggest itis likely composed of rock and water, or has a h and he envelope to yield itsdensity of about 3 (cgs).

1302.2624	fundamental properties of kepler planet-candidate host stars using  asteroseismology	we have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3% and 7% inradius and mass, respectively. the results include new asteroseismic solutionsfor four host stars with confirmed planets (kepler-4, kepler-14, kepler-23 andkepler-25) and increase the total number of kepler host stars withasteroseismic solutions to 77. a comparison with stellar properties in theplanet-candidate catalog by batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants andgiants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by upto a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in goodagreement. we furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a largemajority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassifiedgiants. using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radiichange from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to asub-jupiter size, or vice versa. a comparison of stellar densities fromasteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in batalha et al.assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half ofthe sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters, or due toplanet candidates which may be in eccentric orbits. finally, we investigatetentative correlations between host-star masses and planet candidate radii,orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may beinfluenced by the small sample size and detection biases.

1304.6841	beer analysis of kepler and corot light curves: i. discovery of  kepler-76b: a hot jupiter with evidence for superrotation	we present the first case in which the beer algorithm identified a hotjupiter in the kepler light curve, and its reality was confirmed by orbitalsolutions based on follow-up spectroscopy. the companion kepler-76b wasidentified by the beer algorithm, which detected the beaming (sometimes calleddoppler boosting) effect together with the ellipsoidal and reflection/emissionmodulations (beer), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetarycompanion orbiting the 13.3 mag f star. further investigation revealed thatthis star appeared in the kepler eclipsing binary catalog with estimatedprimary and secondary eclipse depths of 5e-3 and 1e-4 respectively.spectroscopic radial-velocity follow-up observations with tres and sophieconfirmed kepler-76b as a transiting 2.0+/-0.26 mjup hot jupiter. the mass of atransiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidalamplitude. the ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of kepler-76b is consistent withthe spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate issignificantly inflated. we explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence forthe superrotation phenomenon, which involves eastward displacement of thehottest atmospheric spot of a tidally-locked planet by an equatorialsuper-rotating jet stream. this phenomenon was previously observed only for hd189733b in the infrared. we show that a phase shift of 10.3+/-2.0 degrees ofthe planet reflection/emission modulation, due to superrotation, explains theapparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beamingamplitude discrepancy. kepler-76b is one of very few confirmed planets in thekepler light curves that show beer modulations and the first to showsuperrotation evidence in the kepler band. its discovery illustrates for thefirst time the ability of the beer algorithm to detect short-period planets andbrown dwarfs.

1306.1530	the hunt for exomoons with kepler (hek): iii. the first search for an  exomoon around a habitable-zone planet	kepler-22b is the first transiting planet to have been detected in thehabitable-zone of its host star. at 2.4 earth radii, kepler-22b is too large tobe considered an earth-analog, but should the planet host a moon large enoughto maintain an atmosphere, then the kepler-22 system may yet possess a telluricworld. aside from being within the habitable-zone, the target is attractive dueto the availability of previously measured precise radial velocities and lowintrinsic photometric noise, which has also enabled asteroseismology studies ofthe star. for these reasons, kepler-22b was selected as a target-of-opportunityby the 'hunt for exomoons with kepler' (hek) project. in this work, we conducta photodynamical search for an exomoon around kepler-22b leveraging thetransits, radial velocities and asteroseismology plus several new toolsdeveloped by the hek project to improve exomoon searches. we find no evidencefor an exomoon around the planet and exclude moons of mass &gt;0.5 earth masses to95% confidence. by signal injection and blind retrieval, we demonstrate that anearth-like moon is easily detected for this planet even when thetime-correlated noise of the data set is taken into account. we provide updatedparameters for the planet kepler-22b including a revised mass of &lt;53 earthmasses to 95% confidence and an eccentricity of 0.13(-0.13)(+0.36) byexploiting single-body asterodensity profiling (sap). finally, we show thatkepler-22b has a &gt;95% probability of being within the empirical habitable-zonebut a &lt;5% probability of being within the conservative habitable-zone.

1307.8128	kepler-63b: a giant planet in a polar orbit around a young sun-like star	we present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting theyoung sun-like star kepler-63 (koi-63, $m_{\rm kp} = 11.6$, $t_{\rm eff} =5576$ k, $m_\star = 0.98\, m_\odot$). the planet transits every 9.43 days, withapparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots.the planet's radius is $6.1 \pm 0.2 r_{\earth}$, based on the transit lightcurve and the estimated stellar parameters. the planet's mass could not bemeasured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level ofstellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit we can place a rough upperbound of $120 m_{\earth}$ (3$\sigma$). the host star has a high obliquity($\psi$ = $104^{\circ}$), based on the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and ananalysis of starspot-crossing events. this result is valuable because almostall previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets andshorter-period orbits. in addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined withan analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polarstarspot. such spots have previously been inferred using doppler tomography,and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young sun-like stars.

1308.2296	kelt-6b: a p~7.9 d hot saturn transiting a metal-poor star with a  long-period companion	we report the discovery of kelt-6b, a mildly-inflated saturn-mass planettransiting a metal-poor host. the initial transit signal was identified inkelt-north survey data, and the planetary nature of the occulter wasestablished using a combination of follow-up photometry, high-resolutionimaging, high-resolution spectroscopy, and precise radial velocitymeasurements. the fiducial model from a global analysis including constraintsfrom isochrones indicates that the v=10.38 host star (bd+31 2447) is a mildlyevolved, late-f star with t_eff=6102 \pm 43 k, log(g_*)=4.07_{-0.07}^{+0.04}and [fe/h]=-0.28 \pm 0.04, with an inferred mass m_*=1.09 \pm 0.04 m_sun andradius r_star=1.58_{-0.09}^{+0.16} r_sun. the planetary companion has massm_p=0.43 \pm 0.05 m_j, radius r_p=1.19_{-0.08}^{+0.13} r_j, surface gravitylog(g_p)=2.86_{-0.08}^{+0.06}, and density rho_p=0.31_{-0.08}^{+0.07}g~cm^{-3}. the planet is on an orbit with semimajor axis a=0.079 \pm 0.001 auand eccentricity e=0.22_{-0.10}^{+0.12}, which is roughly consistent withcircular, and has ephemeris of t_c(bjd_tdb)=2456347.79679 \pm 0.00036 andp=7.845631 \pm 0.000046 d. equally plausible fits that employ empiricalconstraints on the host star parameters rather than isochrones yield a largerplanet mass and radius by ~4-7%. kelt-6b has surface gravity and incident fluxsimilar to hd209458b, but orbits a host that is more metal poor than hd209458by ~0.3 dex. thus, the kelt-6 system offers an opportunity to perform acomparative measurement of two similar planets in similar environments aroundstars of very different metallicities. the precise radial velocity data alsoreveal an acceleration indicative of a longer-period third body in the system,although the companion is not detected in keck adaptive optics images.

1401.1210	the hunt for exomoons with kepler (hek): iv. a search for moons around  eight m-dwarfs	with their smaller radii and high cosmic abundance, transiting planets aroundcool stars hold a unique appeal. as part of our on-going project to measure theoccurrence rate of extrasolar moons, we here present results from a surveyfocussing on eight kepler planetary candidates associated with m-dwarfs. usingphotodynamical modeling and bayesian multimodal nested sampling, we find nocompelling evidence for an exomoon in these eight systems. upper limits on thepresence of such bodies probe down to $\sim0.4m_{\oplus}$ in the best case. forkoi-314, we are able to confirm the planetary nature of two out of the threeknown transiting candidates using transit timing variations. of particularinterest is koi-314c, which is found to have a mass of$1.0_{-0.3}^{+0.4}m_{\oplus}$, making it the lowest mass transiting planetdiscovered to date. with a radius of $1.61_{-0.15}^{+0.16}r_{\oplus}$, thisearth-mass world is likely enveloped by a significant gaseous envelopecomprising $\geq17_{-13}^{+12}$% of the planet by radius. we find evidence tosupport the planetary nature of koi-784 too via transit timing, but we advocatefurther observations to verify the signals. in both systems, we infer that theinner planet has a higher density than the outer world, which may be indicativeof photo-evaporation. these results highlight both the ability of kepler tosearch for sub-earth mass moons and the exciting ancillary science which oftenresults from such efforts.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1403.5264	flicker as a tool for characterizing planets through asterodensity  profiling	variability in the time series brightness of a star on a timescale of 8hours, known as 'flicker', has been previously demonstrated to serve as a proxyfor the surface gravity of a star by bastien et al. (2013). although surfacegravity is crucial for stellar classification, it is the mean stellar densitywhich is most useful when studying transiting exoplanets, due to its directimpact on the transit light curve shape. indeed, an accurate and independentmeasure of the stellar density can be leveraged to infer subtle properties of atransiting system, such as the companion's orbital eccentricity viaasterodensity profiling. we here calibrate flicker to the mean stellar densityof 439 kepler targets with asteroseismology, allowing us to derive a newempirical relation given by$\log_{10}(\rho_{\star}\,[\mathrm{kg}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}]) = 5.413 - 1.850\log_{10}(f_8\,[\mathrm{ppm}])$. the calibration is valid for stars with$4500$k$&lt;t_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;6500$k, $k_p&lt;14$ and flicker estimates correspondingto stars with $3.25&lt;\log g_{\star}&lt;4.43$. our relation has a model error in thestellar density of 31.7% and so has $\sim8$ times lower precision than thatfrom asteroseismology but is applicable to a sample $\sim40$ times greater.flicker therefore provides an empirical method to enable asterodensityprofiling on hundreds of planetary candidates from present and future missions.

1404.2960	occurrence and core-envelope structure of 1--4x earth-size planets  around sun-like stars	small planets, 1-4x the size of earth, are extremely common around sun-likestars, and surprisingly so, as they are missing in our solar system. recentdetections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets tobegin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, andinternal structures. the kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be mostcommon, as 26% of sun-like stars have small, 1-2 r_e planets with orbitalperiods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 r_e planets that receive 1-4x theincident stellar flux that warms our earth. these earth-size planets aresprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 au, andprobably beyond. mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 r_e showthat the smallest of them, r &lt; 1.5 r_e, have the density expected for rockyplanets. their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused bygravitational compression. including solar system planets yields a relation:rho = 2.32 + 3.19 r/r_e [g/cc]. larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0r_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasingamounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,befitting the appellation "mini-neptunes." planets of ~1.5 r_e have the highestdensities, averaging near 10 g/cc. the gas giant planets occur preferentiallyaround stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur aroundstars having a range of heavy element abundances. one explanation is that thefast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavyelements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,forming giant planets. but models of the formation of 1-4 r_e planets remainuncertain. defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit ofeither detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemicalorigins.

1405.5229	large eccentricity, low mutual inclination: the three-dimensional  architecture of a hierarchical system of giant planets	we establish the three-dimensional architecture of the kepler-419 (previouslykoi-1474) system to be eccentric yet with a low mutual inclination. kepler-419bis a warm jupiter at semi-major axis a = 0.370 +0.007/-0.006 au with a largeeccentricity e=0.85 +0.08/-0.07 measured via the "photoeccentric effect." itexhibits transit timing variations induced by the non-transiting kepler-419c,which we uniquely constrain to be a moderately eccentric (e=0.184 +/- 0.002),hierarchically-separated (a=1.68 +/- 0.03 au) giant planet (7.3 +/- 0.4 mjup).we combine sixteen quarters of kepler photometry, radial-velocity (rv)measurements from the high resolution echelle spectrometer (hires) on keck, andimproved stellar parameters that we derive from spectroscopy andasteroseismology. from the rvs, we measure the mass of inner planet to be2.5+/-0.3mjup and confirm its photometrically-measured eccentricity, refiningthe value to e=0.83+/-0.01. the rv acceleration is consistent with theproperties of the outer planet derived from ttvs. we find that, despite theirsizable eccentricities, the planets are coplanar to within 9 +8/-6 degrees, andtherefore the inner planet's large eccentricity and close-in orbit are unlikelyto be the result of kozai migration. moreover, even over many secular cycles,the inner planet's periapse is most likely never small enough for tidalcircularization. finally, we present and measure a transit time and impactparameter from four simultaneous ground-based light curves from 1m-classtelescopes, demonstrating the feasibility of ground-based follow-up of keplergiant planets exhibiting large ttvs.

1405.7695	three regimes of extrasolar planets inferred from host star  metallicities	approximately half of the extrasolar planets (exoplanets) with radii lessthan four earth radii are in orbits with short periods. despite their sheerabundance, the compositions of such planets are largely unknown. the availableevidence suggests that they range in composition from small, high-density rockyplanets to low-density planets consisting of rocky cores surrounded by thickhydrogen and helium gas envelopes. understanding the transition from thegaseous planets to earth-like rocky worlds is important to estimate the numberof potentially habitable planets in our galaxy and provide constraints onplanet formation theories. here we report the abundances of heavy elements(that is, the metallicities) of more than 400 stars hosting 600 exoplanetcandidates, and find that the exoplanets can be categorized into threepopulations defined by statistically distinct (~ 4.5{\sigma}) metallicityregions. we interpret these regions as reflecting the formation regimes ofterrestrial-like planets (radii less than 1.7 earth radii), gas dwarf planetswith rocky cores and hydrogen-helium envelopes (radii between 1.7 and 3.9 earthradii) and ice or gas giant planets (radii greater than 3.9 earth radii). thesetransitions correspond well with those inferred from dynamical mass estimates,implying that host star metallicity, which is a proxy for the initial solidinventory of the protoplanetary disk, is a key ingredient regulating thestructure of planetary systems.

1405.7881	the kepler-10 planetary system revisited by harps-n: a hot rocky world  and a solid neptune-mass planet	kepler-10b was the first rocky planet detected by the kepler satellite andcon- firmed with radial velocity follow-up observations from keck-hires. themass of the planet was measured with a precision of around 30%, which wasinsufficient to constrain models of its internal structure and composition indetail. in addition to kepler-10b, a second planet transiting the same starwith a period of 45 days was sta- tistically validated, but the radialvelocities were only good enough to set an upper limit of 20 mearth for themass of kepler-10c. to improve the precision on the mass for planet b, theharps-n collaboration decided to observe kepler-10 intensively with the harps-nspectrograph on the telescopio nazionale galileo on la palma. in to- tal, 148high-quality radial-velocity measurements were obtained over two observingseasons. these new data allow us to improve the precision of the massdetermina- tion for kepler-10b to 15%. with a mass of 3.33 +/- 0.49 mearth andan updated radius of 1.47 +0.03 -0.02 rearth, kepler-10b has a density of 5.8+/- 0.8 g cm-3, very close to the value -0.02 predicted by models with the sameinternal structure and composition as the earth. we were also able to determinea mass for the 45-day period planet kepler-10c, with an even better precisionof 11%. with a mass of 17.2 +/- 1.9 mearth and radius of 2.35 +0.09 -0.04rearth, -0.04 kepler-10c has a density of 7.1 +/- 1.0 g cm-3. kepler-10cappears to be the first strong evidence of a class of more massive solidplanets with longer orbital periods.

1409.1605	kic 9632895 - the 10th kepler transiting circumbinary planet	we present the discovery of kic 9632895b, a 6.2 earth-radius planet in alow-eccentricity, 240.5-day orbit about an eclipsing binary. the binary itselfconsists of a 0.93 and 0.194 solar mass pair of stars with an orbital period of27.3 days. the plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and itsinclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in thelatter portion of the kepler data. thus three transits are present in thelatter half of the light curve, but none of the three conjunctions thatoccurred during the first half of the light curve produced transits. theprecession period is ~103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visibleonly ~8% of the time. this has the important implication that for every systemlike kic 9632895 that we detect, there are ~12 circumbinary systems that existbut are not currently exhibiting transits. the planet's mass is too small tonoticeably perturb the binary, consequently its mass is not measurable withthese data; but our photodynamical model places a 1-sigma upper limit of 16earth masses. with a period 8.8 times that of the binary, the planet is welloutside the dynamical instability zone. it does, however, lie within thehabitable zone of the binary, and making it the third of ten keplercircumbinary planets to do so.

1409.8156	kepler-424 b: a "lonely" hot jupiter that found a companion	hot jupiter systems provide unique observational constraints for migrationmodels in multiple systems and binaries. we report on the discovery of thekepler-424 (koi-214) two-planet system, which consists of a transiting hotjupiter (kepler-424b) in a 3.31-d orbit accompanied by a more massive outercompanion in an eccentric (e=0.3) 223-d orbit. the outer giant planet,kepler-424c, is not detected to transit the host star. the masses of bothplanets and the orbital parameters for the second planet were determined usingprecise radial velocity (rv) measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het)and its high resolution spectrograph (hrs). in stark contrast to smallerplanets, hot jupiters are predominantly found to be lacking any nearbyadditional planets, the appear to be "lonely" (e.g. steffen et al.~2012). thismight be a consequence of a highly dynamical past of these systems. thekepler-424 planetary system is a system with a hot jupiter in a multiplesystem, similar to upsilon andromedae. we also present our results forkepler-422 (koi-22), kepler-77 (koi-127; gandolfi et al.~2013), kepler-43(koi-135; bonomo et al.~2012), and kepler-423 (koi-183). these results arebased on spectroscopic data collected with the nordic optical telescope (not),the keck 1 telescope and het. for all systems we rule out false positives basedon various follow-up observations, confirming the planetary nature of thesecompanions. we performed a comparison with planetary evolutionary models whichindicate that these five hot jupiters have a heavy elements content between 20and 120 m_earth.

1411.4666	kepler-432: a red giant interacting with one of its two long period  giant planets	we report the discovery of kepler-432b, a giant planet ($m_b =5.41^{+0.32}_{-0.18} m_{\rm jup}, r_b = 1.145^{+0.036}_{-0.039} r_{\rm jup}$)transiting an evolved star $(m_\star = 1.32^{+0.10}_{-0.07} m_\odot, r_\star =4.06^{+0.12}_{-0.08} r_\odot)$ with an orbital period of $p_b =52.501129^{+0.000067}_{-0.000053}$ days. radial velocities (rvs) reveal thatkepler-432b orbits its parent star with an eccentricity of $e =0.5134^{+0.0098}_{-0.0089}$, which we also measure independently withasterodensity profiling (ap; $e=0.507^{+0.039}_{-0.114}$), thereby confirmingthe validity of ap on this particular evolved star. the well-determinedplanetary properties and unusually large mass also make this planet animportant benchmark for theoretical models of super-jupiter formation.long-term rv monitoring detected the presence of a non-transiting outer planet(kepler-432c; $m_c \sin{i_c} = 2.43^{+0.22}_{-0.24} m_{\rm jup}, p_c =406.2^{+3.9}_{-2.5}$ days), and adaptive optics imaging revealed a nearby(0\farcs87), faint companion (kepler-432b) that is a physically bound m dwarf.the host star exhibits high signal-to-noise asteroseismic oscillations, whichenable precise measurements of the stellar mass, radius and age. analysis ofthe rotational splitting of the oscillation modes additionally reveals thestellar spin axis to be nearly edge-on, which suggests that the stellar spin islikely well-aligned with the orbit of the transiting planet. despite its longperiod, the obliquity of the 52.5-day orbit may have been shaped by star-planetinteraction in a manner similar to hot jupiter systems, and we presentobservational and theoretical evidence to support this scenario. finally, as ashort-period outlier among giant planets orbiting giant stars, study ofkepler-432b may help explain the distribution of massive planets orbiting giantstars interior to 1 au.

1411.7028	the possible moon of kepler-90g is a false positive	the discovery of an exomoon would provide deep insights into planet formationand the habitability of planetary systems, with transiting examples beingparticularly sought after. of the hundreds of kepler planets now discovered,the seven-planet system kepler-90 is unusual for exhibiting an unidentifiedtransit-like signal in close proximity to one of the transits of thelong-period gas-giant kepler-90g, as noted by cabrera et. al. (2014). as partof the 'hunt for exomoons with kepler' (hek) project, we investigate thispossible exomoon signal and find it passes all conventional photometric,dynamical and centroid diagnostic tests. however, pixel-level light curvesindicate that the moon-like signal occurs on nearly all of the target's pixels,which we confirm using a novel way of examining pixel-level data which we dubthe 'transit centroid'. this test reveals that the possible exomoon tokepler-90g is likely a false positive, perhaps due to a cosmic ray inducedsudden pixel sensitivity dropout (spsd). this work highlights the extreme carerequired for seeking non-periodic low-amplitude transit signals, such asexomoons.
