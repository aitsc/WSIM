0907.4722	the spitzer local volume legacy: survey description and infrared  photometry	the survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux propertiesare presented for the 258 galaxies in the local volume legacy (lvl). lvl is aspitzer space telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to11 mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, h-alpha, and hst imaging from11hugs (11 mpc h-alpha and ultraviolet galaxy survey) and angst (acs nearbygalaxy survey treasury). lvl covers an unbiased, representative, andstatistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting thehighest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with spitzer. as a resultof its approximately volume-limited nature, lvl augments previous spitzerobservations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of thelow-luminosity galaxy population. the collection of lvl galaxies shows a largespread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8umpah emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. conversely, thefar-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with adispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. in terms of the relationbetween infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the lvlsample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios thanstarburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important inthe lower mass systems that dominate the lvl sample. comparisons withtheoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relationfound for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populationsthat dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

0909.2648	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. i. surface  photometry and morphology	we present ultraviolet through far-infrared surface brightness profiles forthe 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). theimagery used to measure the profiles includes galex uv data, optical imagesfrom kpno, ctio and sdss, near-ir data from 2mass, and mid- and far-infraredimages from spitzer. along with the radial profiles, we also providemulti-wavelength asymptotic magnitudes and several non-parametric indicators ofgalaxy morphology: the concentration index (c_42), the asymmetry (a), the ginicoefficient (g) and the normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20% ofthe galaxy's flux (m_20). our radial profiles show a wide range of morphologiesand multiple components (bulges, exponential disks, inner and outer disktruncations, etc.) that vary not only from galaxy to galaxy but also withwavelength for a given object. in the optical and near-ir, the sings galaxiesoccupy the same regions in the c_42-a-g-m_20 parameter space as other normalgalaxies in previous studies. however, they appear much less centrallyconcentrated, more asymmetric and with larger values of g when viewed in the uv(due to star-forming clumps scattered across the disk) and in the mid-ir (dueto the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8.0 microns and very hotdust at 24 microns).

0909.2658	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. ii.  derived dust properties	we present a detailed analysis of the radial distribution of dust propertiesin the sings sample, performed on a set of uv, ir and hi surface brightnessprofiles, combined with published molecular gas profiles and metallicitygradients. the internal extinction, derived from the tir-to-fuv luminosityratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in sb-sbc galaxies. the tir-to-fuvratio correlates with the uv spectral slope beta, following a sequence shiftedto redder uv colors with respect to that of starbursts. the star formationhistory (sfh) is identified as the main driver of this departure. we have alsoderived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction ofthe dust mass contributed by pahs, the fraction of the dust mass heated by veryintense starlight and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains.the dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale-length being constantfrom sb to sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale-length). manys0/a-sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions.the pah abundance increases with metallicity for 12+\log(o/h)&lt;9, and at largermetallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the sfh being aplausible underlying driver for this behavior. the dust-to-gas ratio is alsowell correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentricradius.

0910.4968	kinematic properties as probes of the evolution of dwarf galaxies in the  virgo cluster	we present new observational results on the kinematical, morphological, andstellar population properties of a sample of 21 des located both in the virgocluster and in the field, which show that 52% of the des i) are rotationallysupported, ii) exhibit structural signs of typical rotating systems such asdiscs, bars or spiral arms, iii) are younger (~3 gyr) than non-rotating des,and iv) are preferentially located either in the outskirts of virgo or in thefield. this evidence is consistent with the idea that rotationally supporteddwarfs are late type spirals or irregulars that recently entered the clusterand lost their gas through a ram pressure stripping event, quenching their starformation and becoming des through passive evolution. we also find that all,but one, galaxies without photometric hints for hosting discs are pressuresupported and are all situated in the inner regions of the cluster. thissuggests a different evolution from the rotationally supported systems. threedifferent scenarios for these non-rotating galaxies are discussed (in situformation, harassment and ram pressure stripping).

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1004.1610	a multi-wavelength analysis of m81: insight on the nature of arp's loop	context: the optical ring like structure detected by arp (1965) around m81(commonly referenced as "arp's loop") represents one of the most spectacularfeature observed in nearby galaxies. arp's loop is commonly interpreted as atail resulting from the tidal interaction between m81 and m82. however, sinceits discovery the nature of this feature has remained controversial. aims: ourprimary purpose was to identify the sources of optical and infrared emissionobserved in arp's loop. methods: the morphology of the arp's loop has beeninvestigated with deep wide-field optical images. we also measured its colorsusing iras and spitzer-mips infrared images and compared them with those of thedisk of m81 and galactic dust cirrus that fills the area where m81 is located.results: optical images reveal that this peculiar object has a filamentarystructure characterized by many dust features overlapping m81's field. theratios of far-infrared fluxes and the estimated dust-to-gas ratios indicate theinfrared emission of arp's loop is dominated by the contribution of cold dustthat is most likely from galactic cirrus. conclusions: the above resultssuggest that the light observed at optical wavelengths is a combination ofemission from i) a few recent star forming regions located close to m81, whereboth bright uv complexes and peaks in the hi distribution are found, ii) theextended disk of m81 and iii) scattered light from the same galactic cirrusthat is responsible for the bulk of the far infrared emission.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1008.0805	mid-infrared galaxy morphology from the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s^4g): the imprint of the de vaucouleurs revised  hubble-sandage classification system at 3.6 microns	spitzer space telescope infrared array camera (irac) imaging provides anopportunity to study all known morphological types of galaxies in the mid-ir ata depth significantly better than ground-based near-infrared and opticalimages. the goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de vaucouleursclassification volume in the 3.6 micron band, which is the best spitzerwaveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and itsreddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. for this purpose, we haveprepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the spitzer archive, mostof which are formally part of the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s^4g), a spitzer post-cryogenic ("warm") mission exploration sciencelegacy program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 mpc. for the purposes ofmorphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are {\it blue light},the historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. we findthat 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-lightclassifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxieslook very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. drasticdifferences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. consistent with aprevious study by eskridge et al. (2002), the main difference between bluelight and mid-ir types is an approximately 1 stage interval difference for s0/ato sbc or sc galaxies, which tend to appear "earlier" in type at 3.6 micronsdue to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects ofextinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of theextreme population i stellar component. we present an atlas of all of the 207galaxies analyzed here, and bring attention to special features or galaxy typesthat are particularly distinctive in the mid-ir.

1304.6083	the impact of bars on disk breaks as probed by s4g imaging	we have analyzed the radial distribution of old stars in a sample of 218nearby face-on disks, using deep 3.6um images from the spitzer survey ofstellar structure in galaxies (s4g). in particular, we have studied thestructural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. wefind that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have ascale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to thoseof the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same totalstellar mass. in the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break andthe bar radii (rbr/rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of thegalaxy. for galaxies more massive than 10^10 msun, the distribution is bimodal,peaking at rbr/rbar~2 and ~3.5. the first peak, which is the most populatedone, is linked to the outer lindblad resonance of the bar, whereas the secondone is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiralpattern. for galaxies below 10^10 msun, breaks are found up to ~10 rbar, but weshow that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature ofrotation curves in these low-mass disks. while not ruling out star formationthresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced bynon-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2rbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.

1307.5316	the o3n2 and n2 abundance indicators revisited: improved calibrations  based on califa and te-based literature data	the use of ifs is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxesof an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and athigh redshift. the main goal of this study is to review the most widely usedempirical oxygen calibrations, o3n2 and n2, by using new direct abundancemeasurements. we pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of thesecalibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and thepresence of possible systematic offsets. this is possible thanks to theanalysis of the most ambitious compilation of te-based hii regions to date.this new dataset compiles the te-based abundances of 603 hii regions extractedfrom the literature but also includes new measurements from the califa survey.besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gasabundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrationswith a total of 3423 additional califa hii complexes with abundances derivedusing the ons calibration by pilyugin et al. (2010). the combined analysis ofte-based and ons abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibrationto date for both the o3n2 and n2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of allstatistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. inparticular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundancedependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of pettiniand pagel (2004), nagao et al. (2006) and p\'erez-montero and contini (2009).the o3n2 and n2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygenabundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with randomerrors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on alarge amount of data) reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex(random) and 0.02 and 0.08 dex (systematic; compared to the directestimations),respectively.

1311.7052	a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient in galaxy disks unveiled with  califa	we present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of hii regions andassociations compiled so far. the catalog comprises more than 7000 ionizedregions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the califa survey. we describethe procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic propertiesof these ionized regions. in the current study we focus on the characterizationof the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on thestudy of the deprojected distribution of hii regions. we found that allgalaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient inthe oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/rebetween 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with randomfluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the diskeffective radius. the slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,absolute magnitude or mass. only those galaxies with evidence of interactionsand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,consistent with previous results. the majority of the 94 galaxies with h iiregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in theoxygen abundance. the flattening is statistically significant. we cannotprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.however, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to thesecular evolution of galaxies. finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygenabundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. all of them arenon-interacting, mostly unbarred, sb/sbc galaxies. this feature is associatedwith a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features areproduced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

1312.0866	arrakis: atlas of resonance rings as known in the s4g	resonance rings are the consequence of secular evolution processes thatredistribute material and angular momentum in discs. we produced a catalogueand an atlas of the rings detected in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g) and to conduct a statistical study of the data in thecatalogue.  we traced the contours of rings previously identified by buta et al. (inpreparation) and fitted them with ellipses. we found the orientation of bars bystudying the galaxy ellipse fits from s4g's pipeline 4. we used the galaxyorientation data obtained by s4g's pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticitiesand orientations of rings and the bars.  arrakis contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the s4g. the frequency ofresonance rings in the s4g is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and innerfeatures, respectively. outer rings are mostly found in hubble stages -1&lt;=t&lt;=4.inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1&lt;=t&lt;=7. weconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel andperpendicular to the bar. we confirm a tendency for inner rings to be orientedparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of themhave random orientations with respect to the bar. these misaligned inner ringsare mostly found in late-type galaxies (t&gt;=4). this may be due to spiral modesdecoupled from the bar dominating the fourier amplitude spectrum at the radiusof the inner ring.  we find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. the fact that rings are onlymildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formeddue to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or thatthey are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ringformation.

1402.6315	the baryonic tully-fisher relationship for s$^4$g galaxies and the  "condensed" baryon fraction of galaxies	we combine data from the spitzer survey for stellar structure in galaxies(s$^4$g), a recently calibrated empirical stellar mass estimator from eskew etal., and an extensive database of hi spectral line profiles to examine thebaryonic tully-fisher (btf) relation. we find 1) that the btf has lower scatterthan the classic tully-fisher (tf) relation and is better described as a linearrelationship, confirming similar previous results, 2) that the inclusion of aradial scale in the btf decreases the scatter but only modestly, as seenpreviously for the tf relation, and 3) that the slope of the btf, which we findto be $3.5\pm 0.2$ ($\delta$ log $m_{baryon}/\delta$ log $v_c$), implies thaton average a nearly constant fraction ($\sim 0.4$) of all baryons expected tobe in a halo are "condensed" onto the central region of rotationally supportedgalaxies. the condensed baryon fraction, $m_{baryon}/m_{total}$, is, to ourmeasurement precision, nearly independent of galaxy circular velocity (oursample spans circular velocities, $v_c$, between 60 and 250 km s$^{-1}$, but isextended to $v_c\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ using data from the literature). theobserved galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in this fraction is generally $\le$ a factorof 2 despite fairly liberal selection criteria. these results imply thatcooling and heating processes, such as cold vs. hot accretion, mass loss due tostellar winds, and agn driven feedback, to the degree that they affect theglobal galactic properties involved in the btf, are independent of halo massfor galaxies with $10 &lt; v_c &lt; 250$ km/s and typically introduce no more than afactor of two range in the resulting $m_{baryon}/m_{total}$. recent simulationsby aumer et al. of a small sample of disk galaxies are in excellent agreementwith our data, suggesting that current simulations are capable of reproducingthe global properties of individual disk galaxies.

1404.0559	morphology and environment of galaxies with disc breaks in the s4g and  nirs0s	we study the surface brightness profiles of disc galaxies in the 3.6 micronimages from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) andk_s-band images from the near infrared s0-sa galaxy survey (nirs0s). weparticularly connect properties of single exponential (type i), downbendingdouble exponential (type ii), and upbending double exponential (type iii) discprofile types, to structural components of galaxies by using detailedmorphological classifications, and size measurements of rings and lenses. wealso study how the local environment of the galaxies affects the profile typesby calculating parameters describing the environmental density and the tidalinteraction strength. we find that in majority of type ii profiles the breakradius is connected with structural components such as rings, lenses, andspirals. the exponential disc sections of all three profile types, whenconsidered separately, follow the disc scaling relations. however, the outerdiscs of type ii, and the inner discs of type iii, are similar in scalelengthto the single exponential discs. although the different profile types havesimilar mean environmental parameters, the scalelengths of the type iiiprofiles show a positive correlation with the tidal interaction strength.

1407.0002	stellar population gradients in galaxy discs from the califa survey	while studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common,very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients inthe same regions. we present here a comparative study of the stellarmetallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiralgalaxies with and without bars, using data from the califa survey. we measurethe slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties ofthe galaxies. we find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients inthe disc are shallow and negative. furthermore, when normalized to theeffective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradientsdoes not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of thegalaxies. contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\sim$2.5scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similarmanner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average,older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. one of the goals of thepresent paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear couplingbetween the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producingradial migrations across significant distances within discs. the process ofradial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and,therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barredgalaxies. however, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or agegradients in galaxies with without bars. we discuss possible scenarios that canlead to this absence of difference.

1407.2939	califa: a diameter-selected sample for an integral field spectroscopy  galaxy survey	we describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties ofthe galaxy sample used by the calar alto legacy integral field area survey(califa), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral fieldspectroscopy. the califa "mother sample" was selected from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) dr7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with anr-band isophotal major axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 &lt; z&lt; 0.03. the mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observedin the course of the califa survey. the selection of targets for observationsis based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of themother sample. by comparison with a large set of sdss galaxies, we find thatthe califa sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19&gt; mr &gt; -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4msun. inparticular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to anysignificant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or smallgalaxies. only below luminosities of mr = -19 (or stellar masses &lt; 10^9.7msun)is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially ofnearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form &lt; 10% of the fullsample. we estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities andsizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimatesfrom the full sdss when accounting for large-scale structure. we also present anumber of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the califasample. we explore different ways of characterizing the environments of califagalaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from thefield to genuine clusters. we finally consider the expected incidence of activegalactic nuclei among califa galaxies.

0803.3877	galex observations of low surface brightness galaxies: uv color and star  formation efficiency	we present galex uv observations of a sample of low surface brightness (lsb)galaxies for which hi data are available, allowing us to estimate their starformation efficiency. we find that the uv light extends to larger radii thanthe optical light (some galaxies, but not all, look similar to the recentlydiscovered xuv-disk galaxies). using a standard calibration to convert the uvlight into star formation rates, we obtain lower star formation efficiencies inlsb galaxies than in high surface brightness galaxies by about one order ofmagnitude.  we show however that standard calibrations may not apply to these galaxies,as the fuv-nuv color obtained from the two galex bands (fuv and nuv;lambda_eff= 1516 and 2267 a, respectively) is redder than expected for starforming galaxies. this color can be interpreted as a result of internalextinction, modified initial mass function or by star formation historiescharacterized by bursts followed by quiescent phases. our analysis favors thislatter hypothesis.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1410.0009	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): precise  stellar mass distributions from automated dust correction at 3.6 microns	the mid-infrared is an optimal window to trace stellar mass in nearbygalaxies and the 3.6$\mu m$ irac band has been exploited to this effect, butsuch mass estimates can be biased by dust emission. we present our pipeline toreveal the old stellar flux at 3.6$\mu m$ and obtain stellar mass maps for morethan 1600 galaxies available from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s$^{4}$g). this survey consists of images in two infrared bands (3.6and 4.5$\mu m$), and we use the independent component analysis (ica) methodpresented in meidt et al. (2012) to separate the dominant light from old starsand the dust emission that can significantly contribute to the observed 3.6$\mum$ flux. we exclude from our ica analysis galaxies with low signal-to-noiseratio (s/n &lt; 10) and those with original [3.6]-[4.5] colors compatible with anold stellar population, indicative of little dust emission (mostly early hubbletypes, which can directly provide good mass maps). for the remaining 1251galaxies to which ica was successfully applied, we find that as much as 10-30%of the total light at 3.6$\mu m$ typically originates from dust, and locally itcan reach even higher values. this contamination fraction shows a correlationwith specific star formation rates, confirming that the dust emission that wedetect is related to star formation. additionally, we have used our largesample of mass estimates to calibrate a relationship of effective mass-to-lightratio ($m/l$) as a function of observed [3.6]-[4.5] color: $\log(m/l)=-0.339(\pm 0.057) \times ([3.6]-[4.5]) -0.336 (\pm 0.002)$. our final pipelineproducts have been made public through irsa, providing the astronomicalcommunity with an unprecedentedly large set of stellar mass maps ready to usefor scientific applications.

1501.00454	a classical morphological analysis of galaxies in the spitzer survey of  stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g) is the largestavailable database of deep, homogeneous middle-infrared (mid-ir) images ofgalaxies of all types. the survey, which includes 2352 nearby galaxies, revealsgalaxy morphology only minimally affected by interstellar extinction. thispaper presents an atlas and classifications of s4g galaxies in thecomprehensive de vaucouleurs revised hubble-sandage (cvrhs) system. the cvrhssystem follows the precepts of classical de vaucouleurs (1959) morphology,modified to include recognition of other features such as inner, outer, andnuclear lenses, nuclear rings, bars, and disks, spheroidal galaxies, x patternsand box/peanut structures, olr subclass outer rings and pseudorings, bar ansaeand barlenses, parallel sequence late-types, thick disks, and embedded disks in3d early-type systems. we show that our cvrhs classifications are internallyconsistent, and that nearly half of the s4g sample consists of extremelate-type systems (mostly bulgeless, pure disk galaxies) in the range scd-im.the most common family classification for mid-ir types s0/a to sc is sa whilethat for types scd to sm is sb. the bars in these two type domains are verydifferent in mid-ir structure and morphology. this paper examines the bar,ring, and type classification fractions in the sample, and also includesseveral montages of images highlighting the various kinds of "stellarstructures" seen in mid-ir galaxy morphology.

1507.03801	star formation in the local universe from the califa sample. i.  calibrating the sfr using ifs data	the star formation rate (sfr) is one of the main parameters used to analyzethe evolution of galaxies through time. the need for recovering the lightreprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolutionfar-infrared data. recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative,although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging orlong-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability.integral field spectroscopy (ifs) is clearly the way to overcome suchlimitation. we obtain integrated h{\alpha}, ultraviolet (uv) and infrared(ir)-based sfr measurements for 272 galaxies from the califa survey at 0.005 &lt;z &lt; 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. we provide updated calibrations,both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphologicaltype), referred to h{\alpha}. the extinction-corrected h{\alpha} luminosityagrees with the updated hybrid sfr estimators based on either uv or h{\alpha}plus ir luminosity over the full range of sfrs (0.03-20 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).the coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born starsthat is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a$_{ir}$, shows a largedispersion. however, it does not became increasingly small at highattenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured h$\alpha$ emissionwould be missed. lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 agn host galaxiesshow smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and agn todust heating. in the local universe the h{\alpha} luminosity derived from ifsobservations can be used to measure sfr, at least in statistically-significant,optically-selected galaxy samples. the analysis of the sfr calibrations bygalaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study theimpact of different selection criteria in the sfr values derived.

1509.07878	outer-disk reddening and gas-phase metallicities: the califa connection	we study, for the first time in a statistically significant and well-definedsample, the relation between the outer-disk ionized-gas metallicity gradientsand the presence of breaks in the surface brightness profiles of disk galaxies.sdss g'- and r'-band surface brightness, (g'- r') color, and ionized-gas oxygenabundance profiles for 324 galaxies within the califa survey are used for thispurpose. we perform a detailed light-profile classification finding that 84% ofour disks show down- or up-bending profiles (type ii and type iii,respectively) while the remaining 16% are well fitted by one single exponential(type i). the analysis of the color gradients at both sides of this break showsa u-shaped profile for most type ii galaxies with an average minimum (g'- r')color of ~0.5 mag and a ionized-gas metallicity flattening associated to itonly in the case of low-mass galaxies. more massive systems show a ratheruniform negative metallicity gradient. the correlation between metallicityflattening and stellar mass results in p-values as low as 0.01. independentlyof the mechanism having shaped the outer light profiles of these galaxies,stellar migration or a previous episode of star formation in a shrinkingstar-forming disk, it is clear that the imprint in their ionized-gasmetallicity was different for low- and high-mass type ii galaxies. in the caseof type iii disks, a positive correlation between the change in color andabundance gradient is found (the null hypothesis is ruled out with a p-value of0.02), with the outer disks of type iii galaxies with masses $\leq$10$^{10}$m$_{\odot}$ showing a weak color reddening or even a bluing. this isinterpreted as primarily due to a mass down-sizing effect on the population oftype iii galaxies having recently experienced an enhanced inside-out growth.

astro-ph;0201013	on the optimization of broad-band photometry for galaxy evolution  studies	we have derived the uncertainties to be expected in the derivation of galaxyphysical properties (star formation history, age, metallicity, reddening) whencomparing broad-band photometry to the predictions of evolutionary synthesismodels. we have obtained synthetic colors for a large sample (9000) ofartificial galaxies assuming different star formation histories, ages,metallicities, reddening values, and redshifts. the colors derived have beenperturbed by adopting different observing errors, and compared back to theevolutionary synthesis models grouped in different sets. the comparison hasbeen performed using a combination of monte carlo simulations, a maximumlikelihood estimator and principal component analysis. after comparing theinput and derived output values we have been able to compute the uncertaintiesand covariant degeneracies between the galaxy physical properties as functionof (1) the set of observables available, (2) the observing errors, and (3) thegalaxy properties themselves. in this work we have considered different sets ofobservables, some of them including the standard johnson/cousins (ubvri) andsloan digital sky survey (sdss) bands in the optical, the 2 micron all skysurvey (2mass) bands in the near-infrared, and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) bands in the uv, at three different redshifts, z=0.0, 0.7, and 1.4.this study is intended to represent a basic tool for the design of futureprojects on galaxy evolution, allowing an estimate of the optimal band-passcombinations and signal-to-noise ratios required for a given scientificobjective.

astro-ph;0206200	physical structure of the protoplanetary nebula crl618. i. optical  long-slit spectroscopy and imaging	in this paper (paper i) we present optical long-slit spectroscopy and imagingof the protoplanetary nebula crl618. the optical lobes of crl618 consist ofshock-excited gas, which emits many recombination and forbidden lines, anddust, which scatters light from the innermost regions. from the analysis of thescattered halpha emission, we derive a nebular inclination of i=24+-6 deg. thespectrum of the innermost part of the east lobe (visible as a bright, compactnebulosity close to the star in the halpha hst image) is remarkably differentfrom that of the shocked lobes but similar to that of the inner hii region,suggesting that this region represents the outermost parts of the latter. wefind a non-linear radial variation of the gas velocity along the lobes.  the largest projected lsr velocities (~80 km/s) are measured at the tips ofthe lobes, where the direct images show the presence of compact bow-shapedstructures. the velocity of the shocks in crl618 is in the range ~75-200 km/s,as derived from diagnostic line ratios and line profiles. we report abrightening (weakening) of [oiii]5007aa ([oi]6300aa) over the last ~10 yearsthat may indicate a recent increase in the speed of the exciting shocks. fromthe analysis of the spatial variation of the nebular extinction, we find alarge density contrast between the material inside the lobes and beyond them:the optical lobes seem to be `cavities' excavated in the agb envelope byinteraction with a more tenuous post-agb wind. the electron density, with amean value n_e~5e3-1e4 cm-3, shows significant fluctuations but no systematicdecrease along the lobes, in agreement with most line emission arising in athin shell of shocked material (the lobe walls) rather than in the post-agbwind filling the interior of the lobes.

astro-ph;0303088	luminosity and stellar mass functions of local star-forming galaxies	we present the optical and near-infrared luminosity and mass functions of thelocal star-forming galaxies in the universidad complutense de madrid survey. abivariate method which explicitly deals with the halpha selection of the surveyis used when estimating these functions. total stellar masses have beencalculated on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis taking into account differences in starformation histories. the main difference between the luminosity distributionsof the ucm sample and the luminosity functions of the local galaxy populationis a lower normalization (phi^*), indicating a lower global volume density ofucm galaxies. the typical near-infrared luminosity (l^*) of local star-forminggalaxies is fainter than that of normal galaxies. this is a direct consequenceof the lower stellar masses of our objects. however, at optical wavelengths (band r) the luminosity enhancement arising from the young stars leads to m^*values that are similar to those of normal galaxies. the fraction of the totaloptical and near infrared luminosity density in the local universe associatedwith star-forming galaxies is 10-20%. fitting the total stellar mass functionusing a schechter parametrization we obtain alpha=-1.15+/-0.15,log({m}^*)=10.82+/-0.17 msun and log(phi^*)=-3.04+/-0.20 mpc^{-3}. this givesan integrated total stellar mass density of 10^{7.83+/-0.07} msun mpc^{-3} inlocal star-forming galaxies (h_0=70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}, omega_m=0.3,lambda=0.7). the volume-averaged burst strength of the ucm galaxies isb=0.04+/-0.01, defined as the ratio of the mass density of stars formed inrecent bursts (age&lt;10 myr) to the total stellar mass density in ucm galaxies.finally, we derive that, in the local universe, (13+/-3)% of the total baryonmass density in the form of stars is associated with star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0303323	spatial analysis of the halpha emission in the local star-forming ucm  galaxies	we present a photometric study of the halpha emission in the universidadcomplutense de madrid (ucm) survey galaxies. this work complements ourpreviously-published spectroscopic data. we study the location of thestar-forming knots, their intensity, concentration, and the relationship ofthese properties with those of the host galaxy. we also estimate that theamount of halpha emission that arises from the diffuse ionized gas is about15-30% of the total halpha flux for a typical ucm galaxy. this percentage seemsto be independent of the hubble type. conversely, we found that an `average'ucm galaxy harbours a star formation event with 30% of its halpha luminosityarising from a nuclear component. the implications of these results forhigher-redshift studies are discussed, including the effects of galaxy size andthe depth of the observations. a correlation between the sfr and the balmerdecrement is observed, but such correlation breaks down for large values of theextinction. finally, we recalculate the halpha luminosity function and starformation rate density of the local universe using the new imaging data. ourresults point out that, on average, spectroscopic observations detected aboutone third of the total emission-line flux of a typical ucm galaxy. the newvalues obtained for the halpha luminosity density and the star formation ratedensity of the local universe are 10^(39.3+/-0.2) erg s-1 mpc-3, andrho_sfr=0.016^(+0.007)_(-0.004) mass_sun yr-1 mpc-3 (h_0=50 km s-1 mpc-1,omega_m=1.0, lambda=0). the corresponding values for the `concordancecosmology' (h_0=70 km s-1 mpc-1, omega_m=0.3, lambda=0.7) are 10^(39.5+/-0.2)erg s-1 mpc-3 rho_sfr=0.029^(+0.008)_(-0.005) mass_sun yr-1 mpc-3.

astro-ph;0411309	galex observations of the ultraviolet halos of ngc 253 and m82	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images of the prototypicaledge-on starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253. our initial analysis is restrictedto the complex of ultraviolet (uv) filaments in the starburst-driven outflowsin the galaxy halos. the uv luminosities in the halo are too high to beprovided by shock-heated or photoionized gas except perhaps in the brightestfilaments in m82, suggesting that most of the uv light is the stellar continuumof the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust in the outflow. thisinterpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging polarimetry inm82. the morphology of the uv filaments in both galaxies shows a high degree ofspatial correlation with h-alpha and x-ray emission. this indicates that theseoutflows contain cold gas and dust, some of which may be vented into theintergalactic medium (igm). uv light is seen in the ``h-alpha cap'' 11 kpcnorth of m82. if this cap is a result of the wind fluid running into apre-existing gas cloud, the gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial innature but was probably stripped from m82 or m81. if starburst windsefficiently expel dust into the igm, this could have significant consequencesfor the observation of cosmologically distant objects.

astro-ph;0411336	a comparative study of the spatial distribution of ultraviolet and  far-infrared fluxes from m 101	the total ultraviolet (uv) flux (from 1412 to 2718 aa) of m 101 is comparedon a pixel-to-pixel basis with the total far-infrared (fir) flux (from 60 to170 micron), using the maps of the galaxy taken by galex in the near-uv andfar-uv and by isophot at 60, 100 and 170 micron. the main result of thisinvestigation is the discovery of a tight dependence of the fir/uv ratio onradius, with values monotonically decreasing from around 4 in the nuclearregion to nearly zero towards the edge of the optical disk.  although the tightness of this dependence is in part attributable toresolution effects, the result is consistent with the presence of a large-scaledistribution of diffuse dust having a face-on optical depth which decreaseswith radius and which dominates over the more localized variations in opacitybetween the arm and interarm regions. we also find a trend for the fir/uv ratioto take on higher values in the regions of diffuse interarm emission than inthe spiral-arm regions, at a given radius. this is interpreted quantitativelyin terms of the escape probability of uv photons from spiral arms and theirsubsequent scattering in the interarm regions, and in terms of the largerrelative contribution of optical photons to the heating of the dust in theinterarm regions.

astro-ph;0411372	uv emission from stellar populations within tidal tails: catching the  youngest galaxies in formation?	new galex observations have detected significant fuv (1530 angstroms) and nuv(2310 angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails offour ongoing galaxy mergers. the uv-bright regions are optically faint and arecoincident with hi density enhancements. fuv emission is detected at anylocation where the hi surface density exceeds ~2 m_sun pc^{-2}, and is oftendetected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. uv luminosities of thebrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 m_sun to ~10^9 m_sunin young stars in the tails, and hi luminosities imply similar hi masses.uv-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as afew myr, and in all cases ages &lt; 400myr. most of the young stars in the tailsformed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. star formation appears to beolder near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from theparent galaxy. this could be because the star formation occurs progressivelyalong the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near thegalaxy/tail interface. the youngest stellar concentrations, usually near theends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarfgalaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of starformation.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0610891	adaptive optics imaging of iras 18276-1431: a bipolar pre-planetary  nebula with circumstellar "searchlight beams" and "arcs"	we present high-angular resolution images of the post-agb nebulairas18276-1431 (also known as oh17.7-2.0) obtained with the keck ii adaptiveoptics (ao) system in its natural guide star (ngs) mode in the kp, lp, and msnear-infrared bands. we also present supporting optical f606w and f814w hstimages as well as interferometric observations of the 12co(j=1-0), 13co(j=1-0),and 2.6mm continuum emission with ovro. the envelope of iras18276-1431 displaysa clear bipolar morphology in our optical and nir images with two lobesseparated by a dark waist and surrounded by a faint 4.5"x3.4" halo. our kp-bandimage reveals two pairs of radial ``searchlight beams'' emerging from thenebula center and several intersecting, arc-like features. from our co data wederive a mass of m&gt;0.38[d/3kpc]^2 msun and an expansion velocity v_exp=17km/sfor the molecular envelope. the density in the halo follows a radial power-lawproportional to r^-3, which is consistent with a mass-loss rate increasing withtime. analysis of the nir colors indicates the presence of a compact centralsource of ~300-500k dust illuminating the nebula in addition to the centralstar. modeling of the thermal ir suggests a two-shell structure in the dustenvelope: 1) an outer shell with inner and outer radius r_in~1.6e16cm andr_out&gt;~1.25e17cm, dust temperature t_d~105-50k, and a mean mass-loss rate ofmdot~1e-3msun/yr; and 2) an inner shell with r_in~6.3e14cm, t_dust~500-105k,and mdot~3e-5msun/yr. an additional population of big dust grains (radiusa&gt;~0.4mm) with t_dust=150-20k and mass m_dust=(0.16-1.6)e-3 [d/3kpc]^2 msun canaccount for the observed sub-mm and mm flux excess. the mass of the envelopeenclosed within r_out=1.25e17cm derived from sed modeling is ~1[d/3kpc]^2 msun.

astro-ph;0612017	specific sfr profiles in nearby spiral galaxies: quantifying the  inside-out formation of disks	we present specific star formation rate (ssfr) radial profiles for a sampleof 161 relatively face-on spiral galaxies from the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies. the ssfr profiles are derived from galex &amp; 2mass (fuv-k) colorprofiles after a proper sfr calibration of the uv luminosity and k-bandmass-to-light ratio are adopted. the (fuv-k) profiles were first corrected forforeground galactic extinction and later for internal extinction using theratio of the total-infrared (tir) to fuv emission. for those objects wheretir-to-fuv-ratio radial profiles were not available, the (fuv-nuv) colorprofiles as a measure of the uv slope. the ssfr radial gradients derived fromthese profiles allow us to quantify the inside-out scenario for the growth ofspiral disks for the first time in the local universe.  we find a large dispersion in the slope of the ssfr profiles with a slightlypositive mean value, which implies a moderate inside-out disk formation. thereis also a strong dependency of the value of this slope on the luminosity andsize of the disks, with large systems showing a uniform, slightly positiveslope in almost all cases and low-luminosity small disks showing a largedispersion with both positive and negative large values. while a majority ofthe galaxies can be interpreted as forming stars gradually either from insideout or from outside in, a few disks require episodes of enhanced recent growthwith scale lengths of the sfr (or gas infall) being significantly larger atpresent than in the past. we do not find any clear dependence of the ssfrgradient on the environment (local galaxy density or presence of closeneighbors).

astro-ph;0702302	chemical and photometric evolution of extended ultraviolet disks:  optical spectroscopy of m83 (ngc5236) and ngc4625	we present the results from the analysis of optical spectra of 31halpha-selected regions in the extended uv (xuv) disks of m83 (ngc5236) andngc4625 recently discovered by galex. the spectra were obtained using imacs atlas campanas observatory 6.5m magellan i telescope and cosmic at the palomar200-inch telescope, respectively for m83 and ngc4625. the line ratios measuredindicate nebular oxygen abundances (derived from the r23 parameter) of theorder of zsun/5-zsun/10. for most emission-line regions analyzed the linefluxes and ratios measured are best reproduced by models of photoionization bysingle stars with masses in the range 20-40 msun and oxygen abundancescomparable to those derived from the r23 parameter. we find indications for arelatively high n/o abundance ratio in the xuv disk of m83. although themetallicities derived imply that these are not the first stars formed in thexuv disks, such a level of enrichment could be reached in young spiral disksonly 1 gyr after these first stars would have formed. the amount of gas in thexuv disks allow maintaining the current level of star formation for at least afew gyr.

astro-ph;9903060	global velocity field and bubbles in the bcd mrk86	we have studied the velocity field of the blue compact dwarf galaxy mrk86(ngc2537) using data provided by 14 long-slit optical spectra. this kinematicalinformation is complemented with narrow-band ([oiii]5007a and halpha) andbroad-band (b, v, gunn-r and k) imaging. the analysis of the galaxy globalvelocity field suggests that the ionized gas could be distributed in a rotatinginclined disk, with projected central angular velocity of omega=34 km/s/kpc.the comparison between the stellar, hi and modeled dark matter density profile,indicates that the total mass within its optical radius is dominated by thestellar component. peculiarities observed in its velocity field can beexplained by irregularities in the ionized gas distribution or local motionsinduced by star formation. kinematical evidences for two expanding bubbles,mrk86-b and mrk86-c, are given. they show expanding velocities of 34 km/s and17 km/s, halpha luminosities of 3x10^38 erg/s and 1.7x10^39 erg/s, and physicalradii of 374 and 120 pc, respectively. the change in the [sii]/halpha,[nii]/halpha, [oii]/[oiii] and [oiii]/hbeta line ratios with the distance tothe bubble precursor suggests a diminution in the ionization parameter and, inthe case of mrk86-b, an enhancement of the shock-excited gas emission. theoptical-near-infrared colours of the bubble precursors are characteristic oflow metallicity star forming regions (0.2 zsun) with burst strengths of about 1per cent in mass.

0811.3104	on the nature of the extragalactic number counts in the k-band	we investigate the causes of the different shape of the $k$-band numbercounts when compared to other bands, analyzing in detail the presence of achange in the slope around $k\sim17.5$. we present a near-infrared imagingsurvey, conducted at the 3.5m telescope of the calar alto spanish-germanastronomical center (caha), covering two separated fields centered on the hfdnand the groth field, with a total combined area of $\sim0.27$deg$^{2}$ to adepth of $k\sim19$ ($3\sigma$,vega). we derive luminosity functions from theobserved $k$-band in the redshift range [0.25-1.25], that are combined withdata from the references in multiple bands and redshifts, to build up the$k$-band number count distribution. we find that the overall shape of thenumber counts can be grouped into three regimes: the classic euclidean sloperegime ($d\log n/dm\sim0.6$) at bright magnitudes; a transition regime atintermediate magnitudes, dominated by $m^{\ast}$ galaxies at the redshift thatmaximizes the product $\phi^{\ast}\frac{dv_{c}}{d\omega}$; and an $\alpha$dominated regime at faint magnitudes, where the slope asymptotically approaches-0.4($\alpha$+1) controlled by post-$m^{\ast}$ galaxies. the slope of the$k$-band number counts presents an averaged decrement of $\sim50%$ in the range$15.5&lt;k&lt;18.5$ ($d\log n/dm\sim0.6-0.30$). the rate of change in the slope ishighly sensitive to cosmic variance effects. the decreasing trend is theconsequence of a prominent decrease of the characteristic density$\phi^{\ast}_{k,obs}$ ($\sim60%$ from $z=0.5$ to $z=1.5$) and an almost flatevolution of $m^{\ast}_{k,obs}$ (1$\sigma$ compatible with$m^{\ast}_{k,obs}=-22.89\pm0.25$ in the same redshift range).
