0901.4095	serendipitous xmm-newton detection of x-ray emission from the bipolar  planetary nebula hb 5	we report the serendipitous detection by the xmm-newton x-ray observatory ofan x-ray source at the position of the type i (he- and n-rich) bipolarplanetary nebula hb 5. the hb 5 x-ray source appears marginally resolved. whilethe small number of total counts (~170) and significant off-axis angle of thex-ray source (~7.8') precludes a definitive spatial analysis, the morphology ofthe x-ray emission appears to trace the brightest features seen in opticalimages of hb 5. the x-ray spectrum is indicative of a thermal plasma at atemperature between 2.4 and 3.7 mk and appears to display strong neon emission.the inferred x-ray luminosity is l_x = 1.5 x 10^32 ergs/s. these resultssuggest that the detected x-ray emission is dominated by shock-heated gas inthe bipolar nebula, although we cannot rule out the presence of a point-likecomponent at the position of the central star. the implications for andcorrespondence with current models of shock-heated gas in planetary nebulae isdiscussed.

0909.1100	magnetic nested-wind scenarios for bipolar outflows: pre-planetary and  yso nebular shaping	we present results of a series of magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) and hydro-dynamic (hd) 2.5d simulations of the morphology of outflows driven by nestedwide-angle winds - i.e. winds which eminate from a central star as well as froman orbiting accretion disk. while our results are broadly relevent to nestedwind systems we have tuned the parameters of the simulations to touch on issuesin both young stellar objects and planetary nebula studies. in particular ourstudies connect to open issues in the early evolution of planetary nebulae. wefind that nested mhd winds exhibit marked morphological differences from thesingle mhd wind case along both dimensions of the flow. nested hd winds on theother hand give rise mainly to geometric distortions of an outflow that istopologically similar to the flow arising from a single stellar hd wind. ourmhd results are insensitive to changes in ambient temperature between ionizedand un-ionized circumstellar environments. the results are sensitive to therelative mass-loss rates, and to the relative speeds of the stellar and diskwinds. we also present synthetic emission maps of both nested mhd and hdsimulations. we find that nested mhd winds show knots of emission appearingon-axis that do not appear in the hd case.

0912.4777	self-convergence of radiatively cooling clumps	numeric convergence studies demonstrate that the evolution of an adiabaticclump is well-captured by roughly 100 cells per clump radius. the presence ofradiative cooling, however, imposes limits on the problem due to the removal ofthermal energy. numerical studies which include radiative cooling typicallyadopt the 100--200 cells per clump radius resolution. in this paper we presentthe results of a convergence study for radiatively cooling clumps undertakenover a broad range of resolutions, from 12 to 1,536 cells per clump radius,employing adaptive mesh refinement (amr) in a 2d axisymmetric geometry("2.5d"). we also provide a fully 3d simulation, at 192 cells per clump radius,which supports our 2.5d results. we find no appreciable self-convergence at~100 cells per clump radius as small-scale differences owing to increasinglyresolving the "cooling length" have global effects. we therefore conclude thatself-convergence is an insufficient criterion to apply on its own whenaddressing the question of sufficient resolution for radiatively cooled shockedclump simulations. we suggest the adoption of alternate criteria to support astatement of sufficient resolution, such as the demonstration of adequateresolution of the cooling layers behind shocks. we discuss an associatedrefinement criteria for amr codes.

1005.1098	isotropically driven versus outflow driven turbulence: observational  consequences for molecular clouds	feedback from protostellar outflows can influence the nature of turbulence instar forming regions even if they are not the primary source of velocitydispersion for all scales of molecular clouds. for the rate and power expectedin star forming regions, we previously (carroll et al. 2009) demonstrated thatoutflows could drive supersonic turbulence at levels consistent with thescaling relations from matzner 2007 although with a steeper velocity powerspectrum than expected for an isotropically driven supersonic turbulentcascade. here we perform higher resolution simulations and combine simulationsof outflow driven turbulence with those of isotropically forced turbulence. wefind that the presence of outflows within an ambient isotropically driventurbulent environment produces a knee in the velocity power spectrum at theoutflow scale and a steeper slope at sub-outflow scales than for a purelyisotropically forced case. we also find that the presence of outflows flattensthe density spectrum at large scales effectively reducing the formation oflarge scale turbulent density structures. these effects are qualitativelyindependent of resolution. we have also carried out principal componentanalysis (pca) for synthetic data from our simulations. we find that pca as atool for identifying the driving scale of turbulence has a misleading biastoward low amplitude large scale velocity structures even when they are notnecessarily the dominant energy containing scales. this bias is absent forisotropically forced turbulence but manifests strongly for collimated outflowdriven turbulence.

1011.5512	explosive outflows powered by the decay of non-hierarchical multiple  systems of massive stars: orion bn/kl	the explosive bn/kl outflow emerging from omc1 behind the orion nebula mayhave been powered by the dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical multiple system$\sim$500 years ago that ejected the massive stars i, bn, and source n, withvelocities of about 10 to 30 km s$^{-1}$. new proper motion measurements ofh$_2$ features show that within the errors of measurement, the outfloworiginated from the site of stellar ejection. combined with published data,these measurements indicate an outflow age of $\sim$500 years, similar to thetime since stellar ejection. the total kinetic energy of the ejected stars andthe outflow is about 2 to $6 \times 10^{47}$ ergs. it is proposed that thegravitational potential energy released by the formation of a short-periodbinary, most likely source i, resulted in stellar ejection and powered theoutflow. a scenario is presented for the formation of a compact,non-hierarchical multiple star system, its decay into an ejected binary and twohigh-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. three mechanisms may havecontributed to the explosion in the gas: (i) unbinding of the circum-clusterenvelope following stellar ejection, (ii) disruption of circumstellar disks andhigh-speed expulsion of the resulting debris during the final stellarencounter, and (iii) the release of stored magnetic energy. plausibleproto-stellar disk end envelope properties can produce the observed outflowmass, velocity, and kinetic energy distributions. the ejected stars may haveacquired new disks by fall-back or bondi-hoyle accretion with axes roughlyorthogonal to their velocities. the expulsion of gas and stars from omc1 mayhave been driven by stellar interactions.

1107.0415	from bipolar to elliptical: simulating the morphological evolution of  planetary nebulae	the majority of proto-planetary nebulae (ppn) are observed to have bipolarmorphologies. the majority of mature pn are observed to have elliptical shapes.in this paper we address the evolution of ppn/pn morphologies attempting tounderstand if a transition from strongly bipolar to elliptical shape can bedriven by changes in the parameters of the mass loss process. to this end wepresent 2.5d hydrodynamical simulations of mass loss at the end stages ofstellar evolution for intermediate mass stars. we track changes in windvelocity, mass loss rate and mass loss geometry. in particular we focus on thetransition from mass loss dominated by a short duration jet flow (driven duringthe ppn phase) to mass loss driven by a spherical fast wind (produced by thecentral star of the pn). we address how such changes in outflow characteristicscan change the nebula from a bipolar to an elliptical morphology. our resultsshow that including a period of jet formation in the temporal sequence of ppnto pn produces realistic nebular synthetic emission geometries. moreimportantly such a sequence provides insight, in principle, into the apparentdifference in morphology statistics characterizing ppn and pn systems. inparticular we find that while jet driven ppn can be expected to be dominated bybipolar morphologies, systems that begin with a jet but are followed by aspherical fast wind will evolve into elliptical nebulae. furthermore, we findthat spherical nebulae are highly unlikely to ever derive from either bipolarppn or elliptical pn.

1204.0800	on the structure and stability of magnetic tower jets	modern theoretical models of astrophysical jets combine accretion, rotation,and magnetic fields to launch and collimate supersonic flows from a centralsource. near the source, magnetic field strengths must be large enough tocollimate the jet requiring that the poynting flux exceeds the kinetic-energyflux. the extent to which the poynting flux dominates kinetic energy flux atlarge distances from the engine distinguishes two classes of models. inmagneto-centrifugal launch (mcl) models, magnetic fields dominate only atscales $\lesssim 100$ engine radii, after which the jets becomehydrodynamically dominated (hd). by contrast, in poynting flux dominated (pfd)magnetic tower models, the field dominates even out to much larger scales. tocompare the large distance propagation differences of these two paradigms, weperform 3-d ideal mhd amr simulations of both hd and pfd stellar jets formedvia the same energy flux. we also compare how thermal energy losses androtation of the jet base affects the stability in these jets. for theconditions described, we show that pfd and hd exhibit observationallydistinguishable features: pfd jets are lighter, slower, and less stable than hdjets. unlike hd jets, pfd jets develop current-driven instabilities that areexacerbated as cooling and rotation increase, resulting in jets that areclumpier than those in the hd limit. our pfd jet simulations also resemble themagnetic towers that have been recently created in laboratory astrophysical jetexperiments.

1209.1565	comparing poynting flux dominated magnetic tower jets with  kinetic-energy dominated jets	magnetic towers represent one of two fundamental forms of mhd outflows.driven by magnetic pressure gradients, these flows have been less well studiedthan magneto-centrifugally launched jets even though magnetic towers may wellbe as common. here we present new results exploring the behavior and evolutionof magnetic tower outflows and demonstrate their connection with pulsed powerexperimental studies and purely hydrodynamic jets which might represent theasymptotic propagation regimes of magneto-centrifugally launched jets.high-resolution amr mhd simulations (using the astrobear code) provide insightsinto the underlying physics of magnetic towers and help us constrain models oftheir propagation. our simulations have been designed to explore the effects ofthermal energy losses and rotation on both tower flows and their hydrocounterparts. we find these parameters have significant effects on thestability of magnetic towers, but mild effects on the stability of hydro jets.current-driven perturbations in the poynting flux dominated (pdf) towers areshown to be amplified in both the cooling and rotating cases. our studies ofthe long term evolution of the towers show that the formation of weaklymagnetized central jets within the tower are broken up by these instabilitiesbecoming a series of collimated clumps which magnetization properties vary overtime. in addition to discussing these results in light of laboratoryexperiments, we address their relevance to astrophysical observations of youngstar jets and outflow from highly evolved solar type stars.

1211.1672	the formation and evolution of wind-capture disks in binary systems	we study the formation, evolution and physical properties of accretion disksformed via wind capture in binary systems. using the amr code astrobear, wehave carried out high resolution 3d simulations that follow a stellar masssecondary in the co-rotating frame as it orbits a wind producing agb primary.we first derive a resolution criteria, based on considerations of bondi-hoyleflows, that must be met in order to properly resolve the formation of accretiondisks around the secondary. we then compare simulations of binaries with threedifferent orbital radii (10, 15, 20 au). disks are formed in all three cases,however the size of the disk and, most importantly, its accretion ratedecreases with orbital radii. in addition, the shape of the orbital motions ofmaterial within the disk becomes increasingly elliptical with increasing binaryseparation. the flow is mildly unsteady with "fluttering" around the bow shockobserved. the disks are generally well aligned with the orbital plane after afew binary orbits. we do not observe the presence of any large scale, violentinstabilities (such as the flip-flop mode). for the first time, moreover, it isobserved that the wind component that is accreted towards the secondary has avortex tube-like structure, rather than a column-like one as it was previouslythought. in the context of agb binary systems that might be precursors topre-planetary and planetary nebula, we find that the wind accretion rates atthe chosen orbital separations are generally too small to produce the mostpowerful outflows observed in these systems if the companions are main sequencestars but marginally capable if the companions are white dwarfs. it is likelythat many of the more powerful ppn and pn involve closer binaries than the onesconsidered here. the results also demonstrate principles of broad relevance toall wind-capture binary systems.

0712.2004	a grand challenge for planetary nebulae	the study of pn has been confronting a growing list of dilemmas which haveyet to find coherent resolution. these issues are both observational andtheoretical and can be stated as a series of "facts" which can not, as of yet,be accounted for via a single framework. we review these facts and propose askeleton framework for developing a new understanding post-agb stars, ppn andpn. our framework represents an attempt to articulate a a global perspective onthe late stages of stellar evolution that can embrace both the nature of thecentral engine and the outflows they produce. our framework focuses oninteracting binary central stars which drive collimated outflows through mhdprocesses. we propose that the field of agb/pn studies now faces a "grandchallenge" in articulating the observational systematics of these objects in away that can address issues related to binarity and magnetic shaping. atheoretical grand challenge is also faced in the form of integrated studieswhich can explicate the highly non-linear processes associated with mhdoutflows driven by interacting binaries. these issues include the generation ofmagnetic fields via dynamo processes, the creation of accretion disks, thedynamics of common envelope ejection and the creation of magnetized jets.

1304.1367	the effects of inhomogeneities within colliding flows on the formation  and evolution of molecular clouds	observational evidence from local star-forming regions mandates that starformation occurs shortly after, or even during, molecular cloud formation.models of the formation of molecular clouds in large-scale converging flowshave identified the physical mechanisms driving the necessary rapidfragmentation. they also point to global gravitational collapse drivingsupersonic turbulence in molecular clouds. previous cloud formation models havefocused on turbulence generation, gravitational collapse, magnetic fields, andfeedback. here, we explore the effect of structure in the flow on the resultingclouds and the ensuing gravitational collapse. we compare two extreme cases,one with a collision between two smooth streams, and one with streamscontaining small clumps. we find that structured converging flows lead to adelay of local gravitational collapse ("star formation"). thus, more gas hastime to accumulate, eventually leading to a strong global collapse, and thus toa high star formation rate. uniform converging flows fragment hydrodynamicallyearly on, leading to the rapid onset of local gravitational collapse and anoverall low sink formation rate.

1305.5304	outflows from evolved stars: the rapidly changing fingers of crl618	our ultimate goal is to probe the nature of the collimator of the outflows inthe pre pn crl618. crl618 is uniquely suited for this purpose owing to itsmultiple, bright, and carefully studied finger-shaped outflows east and west ofits nucleus. we compare new hst images to images in the same filters observedas much as 11 y previously to uncover large proper motions and surfacebrightness changes in its multiple finger-shaped outflows. the expansion age ofthe ensemble of fingers is close to 100y. we find strong brightness variationsat the fingertips during the past decade. deep ir images reveal a multiplering- like structure of the surrounding medium into which the outflowspropagate and interact. tightly constrained three-dimensional ("3d")hydrodynamic models link the properties of the fingers to their possibleformation histories. we incorporate previously published complementaryinformation to discern whether each of the fingers of crl618 are the results ofsteady, collimated outflows or a brief ejection event that launched a set ofbullets about a century ago. finally, we argue on various physical grounds thatfingers of crl618 are likely to be the result of a spray of clumps ejected atthe nucleus of crl618 since any mechanism that form a sustained set ofunaligned jets is unprecedented.

1307.3316	mhd shock-clump evolution with self-contained magnetic fields	we study the interaction of strong shock waves with magnetized clumps.previous numerical work focused on the simplified scenario in which shockedclumps are immersed in a globally uniform magnetic field that extends throughboth the clump and the ambient medium. here we consider the complementarycircumstance in which the field is completely self-contained within the clumps.this could arise naturally during clump formation via dynamical or thermalinstabilities for example as magnetic field pinches off from the ambientmedium. using our amr mhd code astrobear, we carry out a series of simulationswith magnetized clumps that have different self-contained magnetic fieldconfigurations. we find that the clump and magnetic evolution are sensitive tothe fraction of magnetic field aligned with versus perpendicular to the shocknormal. the relative strength of magnetic pressure and tension in the differentfield configurations allows us to analytically understand the different casesof post-shock evolution. we also show how turbulence and the mixing it impliesdepends of the initial field configuration and suggest ways in which observedshock-clump morphology may be used as a proxy for identifying internal fieldtopologies a posteriori.

1308.4198	size of discs formed by wind accretion in binaries can be underestimated  if the role of wind-driving force is ignored	binary systems consisting of a secondary accreting form a wind-emittingprimary are ubiquitous in astrophysics. the phenomenology of suchbondi-hoyle-lyttleton (bhl) accretors is particularly rich when an accretiondisc forms around the secondary. the outer radius of such discs is commonlyestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation ofmaterial across the bhl or bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tiltedwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. but thisapproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward drivingforce that the secondary does not. in actuality, the accretion stream fallstoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulledtoward the primary relative to the stream. the result is a finite separation or"accretion stream impact parameter" (asip) separating the secondary and stream.when the orbital radius a_o exceeds the bhl radius r_b, the ratio of outer discradius estimated as the asip to the conventional estimatea_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}&gt;1. we therefore predict that discs will form at largerradii from the secondary than traditional estimates. this agrees with theimportance of the asip emphasized by huarte-espinosa et al.

1310.3851	sustainability and the astrobiological perspective: framing human  futures in a planetary context	we explore how questions related to developing a sustainable humancivilization can be cast in terms of astrobiology. in particular we show howongoing astrobiological studies of the coupled relationship between life,planets and their co-evolution can inform new perspectives and direct newstudies in sustainability science. using the drake equation as a vehicle toexplore the gamut of astrobiology, we focus on its most import factor forsustainability: the mean lifetime &lt;l&gt; of an ensemble of species withenergy-intensive technology (sweit). we then cast the problem into the languageof dynamical system theory and introduce the concept of a trajectory bundle forsweit evolution and discuss how astrobiological results usefully inform thecreation of dynamical equations, their constraints and initial conditions.three specific examples of how astrobiological considerations can be foldedinto discussions of sustainability are discussed: (1) concepts of planetaryhabitability, (2) mass extinctions and their possible relation to the current,so-called anthropocene epoch, and (3) today's changes in atmospheric chemisty(and the climate change it entails) in the context of pervious epochs ofbiosphere-driven atmospheric and climate alteration (i.e. the great oxidationevent).

1401.5064	on the role of ambient environments in the collapse of bonnor-ebert  spheres	we consider the interaction between a marginally stable bonnor-ebert (be)sphere and the surrounding ambient medium. in particular, we explore how theinfall from an evolving ambient medium can trigger collapse of the sphere using3-d adaptive mesh refinement simulations. we find the resulting collapsedynamics to vary considerably with ambient density. in the highest ambientdensity cases, infalling material drives a strong compression wave into thecloud. it is the propagation of this wave through the cloud interior thattriggers the subsequent collapse. for lower ambient densities, we find the maintrigger of collapse to be a quasistatic adjustment of the be sphere togravitational settling of the ambient gas. in all cases, we find that theclassic "outside-in" collapse mode for super-critical be spheres is recoveredbefore a protostar (i.e. sink particle) forms. our work supports scenarios inwhich be dynamics naturally begins with either a compression-wave or infalldominated phase, and only later assumes the usual outside-in collapse behavior.

1404.5924	triggered star formation and its consequences	star formation can be triggered by compression from wind or supernova drivenshock waves that sweep over molecular clouds. because these shocks will likelycontain processed elements, triggered star formation has been proposed as anexplanation for short lived radioactive isotopes (slri) in the solar system.previous studies have tracked the triggering event to the earliest phases ofcollapse and have focused on the shock properties required for both successfulstar formation and mixing of slri's. in this paper, we use adaptive meshrefinement (amr) simulation methods, including sink particles, to simulate thefull collapse and subsequent evolution of a stable bonnor-ebert spheresubjected to a shock and post-shock wind. we track the flow of the cloudmaterial after a star (a sink particle) has formed. for non-rotating clouds wefind robust triggered collapse and little bound circumstellar materialremaining around the post-shock collapsed core. when we add initial cloudrotation we observe the formation of disks around the collapsed core which theninteract with the post-shock flow. our results indicate that thesecircumstellar disks are massive enough to form planets and are long-lived, inspite of the ablation driven by post-shock flow ram pressure. as a function ofthe initial conditions, we also track the time evolution of the accretion ratesand particle mixing between between the ambient wind and cloud material. thelatter is maximized for cases of highest mach number.

1412.6489	mhd effects on pulsed yso jets. i. 2.5-d simulations	in this paper we explore the dynamics of radiative axisymmetric mhd jets athigh resolution using amr methods. the goal of the study is to determine boththe dynamics and emission properties of such jets. to that end we haveimplemented microphysics enabling us to produce synthetic maps of h$\alpha$ and[s ii]. the jets are pulsed either sinusoidally or randomly via atime-dependent ejection velocity which leads to a complicated structure ofinternal shocks and rarefactions as has been seen in previous simulations. thehigh resolution of our simulations allows us to explore in great detail theeffect of pinch forces (due to the jet's toroidal magnetic field) within the"working surfaces" where pulses interact. we map the strong h$\alpha$ emissionmarking shock fronts and the strong [s ii] emission inside cooling regionsbehind shocks as observed with high-resolution images of jets. we find thatpinch forces in the stronger field cases produce additional emission regionsalong the axis as compared with purely hydrodynamic runs. these simulations area first step to understanding the full 3-d emission properties of radiative mhdjets.

1412.6495	numerical simulations of mach stem formation via intersecting bow shocks	hubble space telescope observations show bright knots of h$\alpha$ emissionwithin outflowing young stellar jets. velocity variations in the flow createsecondary bow shocks that may intersect and lead to enhanced emission. when thebow shocks intersect at or above a certain critical angle, a planar shockcalled a mach stem is formed. these shocks could produce brighter h$\alpha$emission since the incoming flow to the mach stem is parallel to the shocknormal. in this paper we report first results of a study using 2-d numericalsimulations designed to explore mach stem formation at the intersection of bowshocks formed by hypersonic "bullets" or "clumps". our 2-d simulations show howthe bow shock shapes and intersection angles change as the adiabatic index$\gamma$ changes. we show that the formation or lack of a mach stem in oursimulations is consistent with the steady-state mach stem formation theory. ourultimate goal, which is part of an ongoing research effort, is to characterizethe physical and observational consequences of bow shock intersectionsincluding the formation of mach stems.

0804.4197	protostellar outflow evolution in turbulent environments	the link between turbulence in star formatting environments and protostellarjets remains controversial. to explore issues of turbulence and fossil cavitiesdriven by young stellar outflows we present a series of numerical simulationstracking the evolution of transient protostellar jets driven into a turbulentmedium. our simulations show both the effect of turbulence on outflowstructures and, conversely, the effect of outflows on the ambient turbulence.we demonstrate how turbulence will lead to strong modifications in jetmorphology. more importantly, we demonstrate that individual transient outflowshave the capacity to re-energize decaying turbulence. our simulations support ascenario in which the directed energy/momentum associated with cavities israndomized as the cavities are disrupted by dynamical instabilities seeded bythe ambient turbulence. consideration of the energy power spectra of thesimulations reveals that the disruption of the cavities powers an energycascade consistent with burgers'-type turbulence and produces a drivingscale-length associated with the cavity propagation length. we conclude thatfossil cavities interacting either with a turbulent medium or with othercavities have the capacity to sustain or create turbulent flows in star formingenvironments. in the last section we contrast our work and its conclusions withprevious studies which claim that jets can not be the source of turbulence.

0806.0038	hypersonic buckshot: astrophysical jets as heterogeneous collimated  plasmoids	herbig-haro (hh) jets are commonly thought of as homogeneous beams of plasmatraveling at hypersonic velocities. structure within jet beams is oftenattributed to periodic or ``pulsed'' variations of conditions at the jetsource. simulations based on this scenario result in knots extending across thejet diameter. observations and recent high energy density laboratoryexperiments shed new light on structures below this scale and indicate they maybe important for understanding the fundamentals of jet dynamics. in this paperwe offer an alternative to ``pulsed'' models of protostellar jets. using directnumerical simulations we explore the possibility that jets are chains ofsub-radial clumps propagating through a moving inter-clump medium. our modelsexplore an idealization of this scenario by injecting small ($r&lt;r_{jet}$),dense ($\rho&gt;\rho_{jet}$) spheres embedded in an otherwise smooth inter-clumpjet flow. the spheres are initialized with velocities differing from the jetvelocity by $\sim15$%. we find the consequences of shifting from homogeneous toheterogeneous flows are significant as clumps interact with each other and withthe inter-clump medium in a variety of ways. structures which mimic what isexpected from pulsed-jet models can form, as can previously unseen``sub-radial'' behaviors including backward facing bow shocks and off-axisworking surfaces. while these small-scale structures have not been seen beforein simulation studies, they are found in high resolution jet observations. wediscuss implications of our simulations for the interpretation of protostellarjets with regard to characterization of knots by a ``lifetime'' or ``velocityhistory'' approach as well as linking observed structures with central engineswhich produce the jets.

astro-ph;0004388	the magnetic geometry of pulsed astrophysical jets	hypersonic, highly collimated, mass outflows ({\it jets}) are a ubiquitousphenomena in astrophysics. while the character of the jets differ, many exhibitsome form of quasi-periodic clumping indicating the jet source is episodic or{\it pulsed}. the presence of pulsed jets in so many astrophysical contextssuggests a common formation mechanism. such a process seems to have been foundin {\it magneto-centrifugal launching}, the combination of magnetic andcentrifugal forces that occurs when a magnetized gaseous accretion disk orbitsa central gravitating source. observations of strong magnetic fields in jetsare, however, rare or indirect. thus the presence and effects of magneticfields in yso jets remains an unresolved issue of the highest importance. inthis letter we focus on what should be expected of the structure of the fieldsin pulsed yso jets. we show that combining velocity variability with an initialfield configuration consistent with collimated, magneto-centrifugally launchedjets leads to a clear set of predictions concerning the geometry and relativestrength of the magnetic field components in evolving yso (and perhaps other)jets.

astro-ph;0005288	mhd stellar and disk winds: application to planetary nebulae	mhd winds can emanate from both stars and surrounding accretion disks. it isof interest to know how much wind power is available and which (if either) ofthe two rotators dominates that power. we investigate this in the context ofmulti-polar planetary nebulae (pne) and proto-planetary nebulae (ppne), forwhich recent observations have revealed the need for a wind power source inexcess of that available from radiation driving, and a possible need formagnetic shaping. we calculate the mhd wind power from a coupled disk and star,where the former results from binary disruption. the resulting wind powersdepend only on the accretion rate and stellar properties. we find that if thestellar envelope were initially slowly rotating, the disk wind would dominatethroughout the evolution. if the envelope of the star were rapidly rotating,the stellar wind could initially be of comparable power to the disk wind untilthe stellar wind carries away the star's angular momentum. since an initiallyrapidly rotating star can have its spin and magnetic axes misaligned to thedisk, multi-polar outflows can result from this disk wind system. for timesgreater than a spin-down time, the post-agb stellar wind is slaved to the diskfor both slow and rapid initial spin cases and the disk wind luminositydominates. we find a reasonably large parameter space where a hybrid star+diskmhd driven wind is plausible and where both or either can account for ppne andpne powers. we also speculate on the morphologies which may emerge from thecoupled system. the coupled winds might help explain the shapes of a number ofremarkable multi-shell or multi-polar nebulae. magnetic activity such as x-rayflares may be associated with the both central star and the disk and would be avaluable diagnostic for the dynamical role of mhd processes in pne.

astro-ph;0008084	the magnetohydrodynamic kelvin-helmholtz instability: a  three-dimensional study of nonlinear evolution	we investigate through high resolution 3d simulations the nonlinear evolutionof compressible magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to the kelvin-helmholtzinstability. we confirm in 3d flows the conclusion from our 2d work that evenapparently weak magnetic fields embedded in kelvin-helmholtz unstable plasmaflows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability.in fact, that statement is strengthened in 3d by this work, because it showshow field line bundles can be stretched and twisted in 3d as the quasi-2d cat'seye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. in our simulations twistingof the field may increase the maximum field strength by more than a factor oftwo over the 2d effect. if, by these developments, the alfv\'en mach number offlows around the cat's eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggestmagnetic stresses will eventually destroy the cat's eye and cause the plasmaflow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable flow thatretains memory of the original shear. for our flow configurations the regime in3d for such reorganization is $4\lesssim m_{ax} \lesssim 50$, expressed interms of the alfv\'en mach number of the original velocity transition and theinitial alfv\'en speed projected to the flow plan. for weaker fields theinstability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early stages, and the cat's eyeis destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a 3d nature. then,the flows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropicturbulence. in this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magneticenergy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent amplification, which isretained long afterwards. the magnetic energy eventually catches up to thekinetic energy, and the nature of flows become magnetohydrodynamic.

astro-ph;0101492	dynamos in asymptotic-giant-branch stars as the origin of magnetic  fields shaping planetary nebulale	planetary nebulae are thought to be formed when a slow wind from theprogenitor giant star is overtaken by a subsequent fast wind generated as thestar enters its white dwarf stage$^{1}$. a shock forms near the boundarybetween the winds, which creates a relatively dense shell that provides thecharacteristic appearance of a planetary nebula. a spherically symmetric windwill produce a spherically symmetric shell, yet over half of known planetarynebulae are not spherical; rather, they are elliptical or bipolar inshape$^{2}$. while a magnetic field could launch and collimate a bipolaroutflow, the origin of such a field has hitherto been unclear, as previous worksuggested that a field could not be generated${^3}$. here we show that anasymptotic-giant-branch (agb) star can indeed generate a strong magnetic field,in a dynamo at the interface between a rapidly rotating core and the moreslowly rotating envelope of the star. the field is strong enough to shape thebipolar outflows that produce the observed bipolar planetary nebulae. magneticbraking of the stellar core during this process may also explain thepuzzlingly$^{4}$ slow rotation of most white dwarf stars.

astro-ph;0306422	the evolution of protoplanetary disk edges	we investigate gap formation in gaseous protostellar disks by a planet in acircular orbit in the limit of low disk viscosity. this regime may beappropriate to an aging disk after the epoch of planet formation. we find thatthe distance of planet to the gap outer boundary can be between the location ofthe $m=2$ and $m=1$ outer lindblad resonances. this distance is weaklydependent upon both the planet's mass and disk viscosity. we find that theevolution of the disk edge takes place on two timescales. the first timescaleis set by the spiral density waves driven by the planet. the second timescaledepends on the viscosity of the disk. the disk approaches a state where theoutward angular momentum flux caused by the disk viscosity is balanced by thedissipation of spiral density waves which are driven at the lindbladresonances. this occurs inefficiently however because of the extremely low gasdensity near the planet. we find that the distance between the planet and thepeak density at the disk outer edge is only weakly dependent on the viscosityand planet mass, however the ratio of the gas density near the planet to thatin the disk (or the slope of density along the disk edge) is strongly dependentupon both quantities. we find that the disk density profile along the edgescales approximately with disk viscosity divided by the square of the planetmass. we account for this behavior with a simple scenario in which thedissipation of angular momentum from the spiral density waves is balancedagainst diffusion in the steep edge of the disk.

astro-ph;0503167	turbulence driven by outflow-blown cavities in the molecular cloud of  ngc 1333	outflows from young stellar objects have been identified as a possible sourceof turbulence in molecular clouds. to investigate the relationship betweenoutflows, cloud dynamics and turbulence, we compare the kinematics of themolecular gas associated with ngc 1333, traced in 13co(1-0), with thedistribution of young stellar objects (ysos) within. we find a velocitydispersion of ~ 1-1.6 km/s in 13co that does not significantly vary across thecloud, and is uncorrelated with the number of nearby young stellar outflowsidentified from optical and submillimeter observations. however, from velocitychannel maps we identify about 20 cavities or depressions in the 13co intensityof scales &gt; 0.1-0.2 pc and velocity widths 1-3 km/s. the cavities exhibit limbbrightened rims in both individual velocity channel maps and position velocitydiagrams, suggesting that they are slowly expanding. we interpret thesecavities to be remnants of past yso outflow activity: if these cavities arepresently empty, they would fill in on time scales of a million years. this canexceed the lifetime of a yso outflow phase, or the transit time of the centralstar through the cavity, explaining the the absence of any clear correlationbetween the cavities and yso outflows. we find that the momentum and energydeposition associated with the expansion of the cavities is sufficient to powerthe turbulence in the cloud. in this way we conclude that the cavities are animportant intermediary step between the conversion of yso outflow energy andmomentum into cloud turbulent motions.

astro-ph;9510115	the mhd kelvin-helmholtz instability: a two-dimensional numerical study	using a new numerical code we have carried out two-dimensional simulations ofthe nonlinear evolution of unstable sheared magnetohydrodynamic flows. weconsidered two cases: a strong magnetic field (alfven mach number, m_a = 2.5)and a weak field (m_a =5). each flow rapidly evolves until it reaches a nearlysteady condition, which is fundamentally different from the analogousgasdynamic state. both mhd flows relax to a stable, laminar flow on timescalesless than or of the order of 15 linear growth times, measured from saturationof the instability. that timescale is several orders of magnitude less than thenominal dissipation time for these simulated flows, so this conditionrepresents an quasi-steady relaxed state. the strong magnetic field casereaches saturation as magnetic tension in the displaced flow boundary becomessufficient to stabilize it. that flow then relaxes in a straightforward way tothe steady, laminar flow condition. the weak magnetic field case, on the otherhand, begins development of the vortex expected for gasdynamics, but thatvortex is destroyed by magnetic stresses that locally become strong. magnetictopologies lead to reconnection and dynamical alignment between magnetic andvelocity fields. together these processes produce a sequence of intermittentvortices and subsequent relaxation to a nearly laminar flow condition in whichthe magnetic cross helicity is nearly maximized. remaining irregularitiesconsist of a pair of flux tubes straddling the shear layer. fluctuations withinthose features are closely aligned, representing alfv\'en waves propagatinglocally downstream.

astro-ph;9606142	hydrodynamical models of outflow collimation in ysos	we explore the physics of time-dependent hydrodynamic collimation of jetsfrom young stellar objects (ysos). using parameters appropriate to ysos we havecarried out high resolution hydrodynamic simulations modeling the interactionof a central wind with an environment characterized by a moderate opening angletoroidal density distribution. the results show that the the wind/environmentinteraction produces strongly collimated supersonic jets. the jet is composedof shocked wind gas. using analytical models of wind blown bubble evolution weshow that the scenario studied here should be applicable to ysos and can, inprinciple, initiate collimation on the correct scales (r ~ 100 au). thesimulations reveal a number of time-dependent non-linear features notanticipated in previous analytical studies including: a prolate wind shock; achimney of cold swept-up ambient material dragged into the bubble cavity; aplug of dense material between the jet and bow shocks. we find that thecollimation of the jet occurs through both de laval nozzles and focusing of thewind via the prolate wind shock. using an analytical model for shock focusingwe demonstrate that a prolate wind shock can, by itself, produce highlycollimated supersonic jets.

astro-ph;9606152	precessing jets and molecular outflows: a 3-d numerical study	we present 3-d numerical hydrodynamical simulations of precessing supersonicheavy jets to explore how well they serve as a model for generating molecularoutflows from young stellar objects. the dynamics are studied with a number ofhigh resolution simulations on a cartesian grid (128x128x128 zones) using ahigh order finite difference method. a range of cone angles and precessionrates were included in the study. two higher resolution runs (256x256x256zones) were made for comparison in order to confirm numerical convergence ofglobal flow characteristics. morphological, kinematical and dynamicalcharacteristics of precessing jets are described and compared to importantproperties of straight jets and also to observations of ysos. in order toexamine the robustness of precessing jets as a mean to produce molecularoutflows around young stellar objects, ``synthetic observations'' of themomentum distributions of the simulated precessing jets are compared toobservations of molecular outflows. it is found that precessing jets matchbetter the morphology, highly forward driven momentum and momentumdistributions along the long axis of molecular outflows than do wind-driven orstraight jet-driven flow models.

astro-ph;9701044	the mhd kelvin-helmholtz instability ii: the roles of weak and oblique  fields in planar flows	we have carried out high resolution mhd simulations of the nonlinearevolution of kelvin-helmholtz unstable flows in 2 1/2 dimensions. the modeledflows and fields were initially uniform except for a thin shear layer with ahyperbolic tangent velocity profile and a small, normal mode perturbation. thecalculations consider periodic sections of flows containing magnetic fieldsparallel to the shear layer, but projecting over a full range of angles withrespect to the flow vectors. they are intended as preparation for fully 3dcalculations and to address two specific questions raised in earlier work: 1)what role, if any, does the orientation of the field play in nonlinearevolution of the mhd kelvin-helmholtz instability in 2 1/2 d. 2) given that thefield is too weak to stabilize against a linear perturbation of the flow, howdoes the nonlinear evolution of the instability depend on strength of thefield. the magnetic field component in the third direction contributes onlythrough minor pressure contributions, so the flows are essentially 2d. even avery weak field can significantly enhance the rate of energy dissipation. inall of the cases we studied magnetic field amplification by stretching in thevortex is limited by tearing mode, ``fast'' reconnection events that isolateand then destroy magnetic flux islands within the vortex and relax the fieldsoutside the vortex. if the magnetic tension developed prior to reconnection iscomparable to reynolds stresses in the flow, that flow is reorganized duringreconnection. otherwise, the primary influence on the plasma is generation ofentropy. the effective expulsion of flux from the vortex is very similar tothat shown by weiss for passive fields in idealized vortices with largemagnetic reynolds numbers. we demonstrated that this

astro-ph;9710255	outflow collimation in young stellar objects	in this paper we explore the effect of radiative losses on purelyhydrodynamic jet collimation models applicable to young stellar objects (ysos).in our models aspherical bubbles form from the interaction of a central ysowind with an aspherical circum-protostellar density distribution. building on aprevious non-radiative study (frank &amp; mellema 1996) we demonstrate thatsupersonic jets are a natural and robust consequence of aspherical wind-blownbubble evolution. the simulations show that the addition of radiative coolingmakes the hydrodynamic collimation mechanisms studied by frank &amp; mellema (1996)more effective. an unexpected result is the production of cool, dense jetsforming through conical converging flows at the poles of the bubbles. forsteady winds the formation of these jets occurs early in the bubble evolution.at later times we find that the dynamical and cooling time scales for the jetmaterial become similar. since observations of yso jets show considerablevariability in the jet beam we present a simple one-dimensional (1-d) model forthe evolution of a variable wind interacting with an accreting environment.these models indicate that, in the presence of a varying protostellar wind, thehydrodynamic collimation processes studied in our simulations can produce cooljets with sizes and time scales consistent with observations.

astro-ph;9805275	bipolar outflows and the evolution of stars	hypersonic bipolar outflows are a ubiquitous phenomena associated with bothyoung and highly evolved stars. observations of planetary nebulae, the nebulaesurrounding luminous blue variables such as $\eta$ carinae, wolf rayet bubbles,the circumstellar environment of sn 1987a and young stellar objects allrevealed high velocity outflows with a wide range of shapes. in this paper ireview the current state of our theoretical understanding of these outflows.  beginning with planetary nebulae considerable progress has been made inunderstanding bipolar outflows as the result of stellar winds interacting withthe circumstellar environment. in what has been called the "generalized windblown bubble" (gwbb) scenario, a fast tenuous wind from the central starexpands into a ambient medium with an aspherical (toroidal) densitydistribution. inertial gradients due to the gaseous torus quickly lead to anexpanding prolate or bipolar shell of swept-up gas bounded by strong shockwaves. numerical simulations of the gwbb scenario show a surprisingly richvariety of gasdynamical behavior, allowing models to recover many of theobserved properties of stellar bipolar outflows including the development ofcollimated supersonic jets.  in this paper we review the physics behind the gwbb scenario in detail andconsider its strengths and weakness. alternative models involving mhd processesare also examined. applications of these models to each of the principleclasses of stellar bipolar outflow (yso, pne, lbv, sn87a) are then reviewed.outstanding issues in the study of bipolar outflows are considered as are thosequestions which arise when the outflows are viewed as a single class ofphenomena occuring across the hr diagram.

astro-ph;9807228	a divergence-free upwind code for multidimensional magnetohydrodynamic  flows	a description is given for preserving ${\bmsy\nabla}\cdot{\vec b}=0$ in amagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) code that employs the upwind, total variationdiminishing (tvd) scheme and the strang-type operator splitting formulti-dimensionality. the method is based on the staggered mesh technique toconstrain the transport of magnetic field: the magnetic field components aredefined at grid interfaces with their advective fluxes on grid edges, whileother quantities are defined at grid centers. the magnetic field at gridcenters for the upwind step is calculated by interpolating the values from gridinterfaces. the advective fluxes on grid edges for the magnetic field evolutionare calculated from the upwind fluxes at grid interfaces. then, the magneticfield can be maintained with ${\bmsy\nabla}\cdot{\vec b}=0$ exactly, if this isso initially, while the upwind scheme is used for the update of fluidquantities. the correctness of the code is demonstrated through tests comparingnumerical solutions either with analytic solutions or with numerical solutionsfrom the code using an explicit divergence-cleaning method. also the robustnessis shown through tests involving realistic astrophysical problems.

astro-ph;9809154	supernova 1987a: rotation and a binary companion	in this paper we provide a possible link between the structure of the bipolarnebula surrounding sn1987a and the properties of its progenitor star. a windblwon bubble (wbb) scenario is emplyed, in which a fast, tenuous wind from ablue supergiant expands into a slow, dense wind, expelled during an earlier redsupergiant phase. the bipolar shapre develops due to a pole-to-equator densitycontrast in the slow wind (ie, the slow wind forms a slow torus). we use thewind compressed disk (wcd) model of bjorkman &amp; cassinelli (1992) to determinethe shape of the slow torus. in the wcd scenario, the shape of the torus isdetermined by the rotation of the progenitor star. we then use a self-similarsemi-analytical method for wind blown bubble evolution to determine the shapeof the resulting bipolar nebula.  we find that the union of the wind-compressed-disk and bipolar-wind-blown-bubble models allows us to recover the salient properties of sn1987a'scircumstellar nebula. in particular, the size, speed and density of sn1987a'sinner ring are easily reproduced in our calculations. an exploration ofparameter space shows the the red supergiant progenitor must be been rotatingat &gt; 0.3 of its breakup speed. we conclude that the progenitor was most likelyspun up by a merger with a binary companion. using a simple model for thebinary merger we find that the companion is likely to have had a mass &gt; 0.5m_sun.

astro-ph;9909033	the mhd kelvin-helmholtz instability iii: the role of sheared magnetic  field in planar flows	we have carried out simulations of the nonlinear evolution of themagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) kelvin-helmholtz (kh) instability for compressiblefluids in $2\frac{1}{2}$-dimensions, extending our previous work by frank et al(1996) and jones \etal (1997). in the present work we have simulated flows inthe x-y plane in which a ``sheared'' magnetic field of uniform strength``smoothly'' rotates across a thin velocity shear layer from the z direction tothe x direction, aligned with the flow field. we focus on dynamical evolutionof fluid features, kinetic energy dissipation, and mixing of the fluid betweenthe two layers, considering their dependence on magnetic field strength forthis geometry. the introduction of magnetic shear can allow a cat's eye-likevortex to form, even when the field is stronger than the nominal linearinstability limit given above. for strong fields that vortex is asymmetric withrespect to the preliminary shear layer, however, so the subsequent dissipationis enhanced over the uniform field cases of comparable field strength. in fact,so long as the magnetic field achieves some level of dynamical importanceduring an eddy turnover time, the asymmetries introduced through the magneticshear will increase flow complexity, and, with that, dissipation and mixing.the degree of the fluid mixing between the two layers is strongly influenced bythe magnetic field strength. mixing of the fluid is most effective when thevortex is disrupted by magnetic tension during transient reconnection, throughlocal chaotic behavior that follows.
