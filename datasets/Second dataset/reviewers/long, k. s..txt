0901.1309	blue hook stars in globular clusters	blue hook (bhk) stars are a rare class of horizontal branch stars that so farhave been found in only very few galactic globular clusters (gcs). the dominantmechanism for producing these objects is currently still unclear. in order totest if the presence of bhk populations in a given gc is linked to specificphysical or structural cluster properties, we have constructed a parent sampleof gcs for which existing data is sufficient to establish the presence orabsence of bhk populations with confidence. we then compare the properties ofthose clusters in our parent sample that do contain a bhk population to thosethat do not. we find that there is only one compelling difference between bhkand non-bhk clusters: all known bhk clusters are unusually massive. however, wealso find that the bhk clusters are consistent with being uniformly distributedwithin the cumulative mass distribution of the parent sample. thus, while it isattractive to suggest there is is a lower mass cut-off for clusters capable offorming bhk stars, the data do not require this. instead, the apparentpreference for massive clusters could still be a purely statistical effect:intrinsically rare objects can only be found by searching a sufficiently largenumber of stars.

0905.0145	an ultracompact x-ray binary in the globular cluster ngc 1851	we present far-ultraviolet photometry obtained with the hubble spacetelescope of the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 0513-40 in the globular cluster ngc1851. our observations reveal a clear, roughly sinusoidal periodic signal with$p \simeq 17$ min and amplitude 3%-10%. the signal appears fully coherent andcan be modelled as a simple reprocessing effect associated with the changingprojected area presented by the irradiated face of a white dwarf donor star inthe system. all of these properties suggest that the signal we have detected isorbital in nature, thus confirming 4u 0513-40 as an ultracompact x-ray binary(ucxb). all four confirmed ucxbs in globular clusters have orbital periodsbelow 30 minutes, whereas almost all ucxbs in the galactic field have orbitalperiods longer than this. this suggests that the dynamical formation processesdominate ucxb production in clusters, producing a different orbital perioddistribution than observed among field ucxbs. based on the likely systemparameters, we show that 4u 0513-40 should be a strong gravitational wavesource and may be detectable by lisa over the course of a multi-year mission.

0910.5666	chandra acis survey of m33 (chasem33): the enigmatic x-ray emission from  ic131	we present the first x-ray analysis of the diffuse hot ionized gas and thepoint sources in ic131, after ngc604 the second most x-ray luminous giant hiiregion in m33. the x-ray emission is detected only in the south eastern part ofic131 (named ic131-se) and is limited to an elliptical region of ~200pc inextent. this region appears to be confined towards the west by a hemisphericalshell of warm ionized gas and only fills about half that volume. although thecorresponding x-ray spectrum has 1215 counts, it cannot conclusively be toldwhether the extended x-ray emission is thermal, non-thermal, or a combinationof both. a thermal plasma model of kt_e=4.3kev or a single power law ofgamma=2.1 fit the spectrum equally well. if the spectrum is purely thermal(non-thermal), the total unabsorbed x-ray luminosity in the 0.35-8kev energyband amounts to l_x = 6.8(8.7)x10^35erg/s. among other known hii regionsic131-se seems to be extreme regarding the combination of its large extent ofthe x-ray plasma, the lack of massive o stars, its unusually high electrontemperature (if thermal), and the large fraction of l_x emitted above 2kev(~40-53%). a thermal plasma of ~4kev poses serious challenges to theoreticalmodels, as it is not clear how high electron temperatures can be produced inhii regions in view of mass-proportional and collisionless heating. if the gasis non-thermal or has non-thermal contributions, synchrotron emission wouldclearly dominate over inverse compton emission. it is not clear if the samemechanisms which create non-thermal x-rays or accelerate crs in snrs can beapplied to much larger scales of 200pc. in both cases the existing theoreticalmodels for giant hii regions and superbubbles do not explain the hardness andextent of the x-ray emission in ic131-se.

1002.0544	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows ii	highly-ionized fast accretion-disk winds have been suggested as anexplanation for a variety of observed absorption and emission features in thex-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei. simple estimates have suggested thatthese flows may be massive enough to carry away a significant fraction of theaccretion energy and could be involved in creating the link betweensupermassive black holes and their host galaxies. however, testing thesehypotheses, and quantifying the outflow signatures, requires high-qualitytheoretical spectra for comparison with observations. here we describeextensions of our monte carlo radiative transfer code that allow us to generaterealistic theoretical spectra for a much wider variety of disk wind models thanpossible in our previous work. in particular, we have expanded the range ofatomic physics simulated by the code so that l- and m-shell ions can now beincluded. we have also substantially improved our treatment of both ionizationand radiative heating such that we are now able to compute spectra for outflowscontaining far more diverse plasma conditions. we present example calculationsthat illustrate the variety of spectral features predicted by parametrizedoutflow models and demonstrate their applicability to the interpretation ofdata by comparison with observations of the bright quasar pg1211+143. we findthat the major features in the observed 2 - 10 kev spectrum of this object canbe well-reproduced by our spectra, confirming that it likely hosts a massiveoutflow.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

1006.3449	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows iii: application to a hydrodynamical simulation	we perform multi-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to computespectra for a hydrodynamical simulation of a line-driven accretion disk windfrom an active galactic nucleus. the synthetic spectra confirm expectationsfrom parameterized models that a disk wind can imprint a wide variety ofspectroscopic signatures including narrow absorption lines, broad emissionlines and a compton hump. the formation of these features is complex withcontributions originating from many of the different structures present in thehydrodynamical simulation. in particular, spectral features are shaped both bygas in a successfully launched outflow and in complex flows where material islifted out of the disk plane but ultimately falls back. we also confirm thatthe strong fe kalpha line can develop a weak, red-skewed line wing as a resultof compton scattering in the outflow. in addition, we demonstrate that x-rayradiation scattered and reprocessed in the flow has a pivotal part in both thespectrum formation and determining the ionization conditions in the wind. wefind that scattered radiation is rather effective in ionizing gas which isshielded from direct irradiation from the central source. this effect likelymakes the successful launching of a massive disk wind somewhat more challengingand should be considered in future wind simulations.

1112.0902	the low states of cvs at the upper edge of the period gap	we review our knowledge of the origin and phenomenology of low states (alsoknown as vy scl states) in cataclysmic variables, making special emphasis onthe cataclysmic variable population found just above the period gap. thisorbital period range between approximately 3 and 4 hours is the preferred landfor the elusive sw sextantis stars, which are believed to be about to enter thegap when their donor stars become fully convective. despite their main role inour understanding of the whole picture of cataclysmic variable evolution, thestudy of their component stars is almost impossible due to the extreme veilingbrightness of the accretion disc during the high state. here we present thefirst steps toward the characterisation of the white dwarfs and the donor starsin these vy scl systems in the low state, and the discovery of sporadicaccretion events and satellite emission lines like those observed in the am hersystems in the low state, which are likely related to magnetic activity of thefast rotating secondary stars.

1202.4921	the fight for accretion: discovery of intermittent mass transfer in bb  doradus in the low state	our long-term photometric monitoring of southern nova-like cataclysmicvariables with the 1.3-m smarts telescope found bb doradus fading from v ~ 14.3towards a deep low state at v ~ 19.3 in april 2008. here we presenttime-resolved optical spectroscopy of bb dor in this faint state in 2009. theoptical spectrum in quiescence is a composite of a hot white dwarf with teff =30000 +- 5000 k and a m3-4 secondary star with narrow emission lines (mainly ofthe balmer series and hei) superposed. we associate these narrow profiles withan origin on the donor star. analysis of the radial velocity curve of theh-alpha emission from the donor star allowed the measurement of an orbitalperiod of 0.154095 +- 0.000003 d (3.69828 +- 0.00007 h), different from allprevious estimates. we detected episodic accretion events which veiled thespectra of both stars and radically changed the line profiles within atimescale of tens of minutes. this shows that accretion is not completelyquenched in the low state. during these accretion episodes the line wings arestronger and their radial velocity curve is delayed by ~ 0.2 cycle, similar tothat observed in sw sex and am her stars in the high state, with respect to themotion of the white dwarf. two scenarios are proposed to explain the extraemission: impact of the material on the outer edge of a cold, remnant accretiondisc, or the combined action of a moderately magnetic white dwarf (b1 &lt;~ 5 mg)and the magnetic activity of the donor star.

1204.2535	modeling the fe k line profiles in type i agn with a compton-thick disk  wind	we have modeled a small sample of seyfert galaxies that were previouslyidentified as having simple x-ray spectra with little intrinsic absorption. thesources in this sample all contain moderately broad components of fe k-shellemission and are ideal candidates for testing the applicability of acompton-thick accretion-disk wind model to agn emission components. viewingangles through the wind allow the observer to see the absorption signature ofthe gas, whereas face-on viewing angles allow the observer to see the scatteredlight from the wind. we find that the fe k emission line profiles are welldescribed with a model of a compton-thick accretion-disk wind of solarabundances, arising tens to hundred of gravitational radii from the centralblack hole. further, the fits require a neutral component of fe k alphaemission that is too narrow to arise from the inner part of the wind, andlikely comes from a more distant reprocessing region. our study demonstratesthat a compton-thick wind can have a profound effect on the observed x-rayspectrum of an agn, even when the system is not viewed through the flow.

1207.7194	synthetic x-ray spectra for simulations of the dynamics of an accretion  flow irradiated by a quasar	ultraviolet and x-ray observations show evidence of outflowing gas aroundmany active galactic nuclei. some of these outflows may be driven off gasinfalling towards the central black hole. we perform radiative transfercalculations to compute the gas ionization state and x-ray spectra for two- andthree-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamical simulations of this outflow-from-inflowscenario. by comparison with observations, our results can be used to test thetheoretical models and guide future numerical simulations. we predict bothabsorption and emission features, most of which are formed in a polar funnel ofoutflowing gas. this outflow causes strong absorption for observer orientationangles of &lt; 35 degrees. particularly in 3d, the strength of this absorptionvaries significantly for different lines-of-sight owing to the fragmentarystructure of the gas flow. although infalling material occupies a largefraction of the simulation volume, we do not find that it imprints strongabsorption features since the ionization state is very high. thus, an absenceof observed inflow absorption features does not exclude the models. the mainspectroscopic consequence of the infalling gas is a scattered continuumcomponent that partially re-fills the absorption features caused by theoutflowing polar funnel. fluorescence and scattering in the outflow ispredicted to give rise to several emission features for all observerorientations. for the hydrodynamical simulations considered we find bothionization states and column densities for the outflowing gas that are too highto be quantitatively consistent with well-observed x-ray absorption systems.nevertheless, our results are qualitatively encouraging and further explorationof the model parameter space is warranted.

1308.5973	a simple disk wind model for broad absorption line quasars	approximately 20% of quasi-stellar objects (qsos) exhibit broad, blue-shiftedabsorption lines in their ultraviolet spectra. such features provide clearevidence for significant outflows from these systems, most likely in the formof accretion disk winds. these winds may represent the "quasar" mode offeedback that is often invoked in galaxy formation/evolution models, and theyare also key to unification scenarios for active galactic nuclei (agn) andqsos. to test these ideas, we construct a simple benchmark model of anequatorial, biconical accretion disk wind in a qso and use a monte carloionization/radiative transfer code to calculate the ultraviolet spectra as afunction of viewing angle. we find that for plausible outflow parameters,sightlines looking directly into the wind cone do produce broad, blue-shiftedabsorption features in the transitions typically seen in broad absorption lineqsos. however, our benchmark model is intrinsically x-ray weak in order toprevent overionization of the outflow, and the wind does not yet producecollisionally excited line emission at the level observed in non-bal qsos. as afirst step towards addressing these shortcomings, we discuss the sensitivity ofour results to changes in the assumed x-ray luminosity and mass-loss rate,mdot(wind). in the context of our adopted geometry, mdot(wind) ~ mdot(acc) isrequired in order to produce significant bal features. the kinetic luminosityand momentum carried by such outflows would be sufficient to providesignificant feedback.

1412.1166	astro-h white paper - older supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae	most supernova remnants (snrs) are old, in the sense that their structure hasbeen profoundly modified by their interaction with the surrounding interstellarmedium (ism). old snrs are very heterogenous in terms of their appearance,reflecting differences in their evolutionary state, the environments in whichsne explode and in the explosion products. some old snrs are seen primarily asa result of a strong shock wave interacting with the ism. others, the so-calledmixed-morphology snrs, show central concentrations of emission, which may stillshow evidence of emission from the ejecta. yet others, the pulsar wind nebulae(pwne), are seen primarily as a result of emission powered by a pulsar; thesesnrs often lack the detectable thermal emission from the primary shock. theunderlying goal in all studies of old snrs is to understand these differences,in terms of the sne that created them, the nature of the ism into which theyare expanding, and the fundamental physical processes that govern theirevolution. here we identify three areas of study where astro-h can makeimportant contributions. these are constraining abundances and physicalprocesses in mature limb-brightened snrs, understanding the puzzling nature ofmixed-morphology snrs, and exploring the nature of pwne. the soft x-rayspectrometer (sxs) on-board astro-h will, as a result of its high spectralresolution, be the primary tool for addressing problems associated with oldsnrs, supported by hard x-ray observations with the hard x-ray imager (hxi) toobtain broad band x-ray coverage.

1412.1171	astro-h white paper - agn winds	in this white paper we describe the prospects for astro-h for the study ofoutflows from active galactic nuclei. the most important breakthroughs in thisfield are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivityin the fe-k band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full x-ray bandand spectral capabilities also at lower energies. the sensitivity in the fe-kregion allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow outto the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with currentx-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. due tothe high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitiveproof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise theirphysical properties in great detail. these ultra-fast outflows carry very largeamounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedbackstudies. we show how the astro-h observations in general can help to constrainnumerical models for outflows. the link to reflection and emission processes isalso discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows andrelativistic emission lines. finally, we discuss the prospects for otherrelated categories of objects like bal quasars, partially covered sources andcompton thick outflows.

astro-ph;0004329	a self-occulting accretion disk in the sw sex star dw uma	we present the ultraviolet spectrum of the sw sex star and nova-like variabledw uma in an optical low state, as observed with the space telescope imagingspectrograph on board the hubble space telescope (hst). the data are welldescribed by a synthetic white dwarf (wd) spectrum with t_eff = 46,000 +/- 1000k, log g = 7.60 +/- 0.15, v*sin(i) = 370 +/- 100 km/s and z/z_solar = 0.47 +/-0.15. for this combination of t_eff and log g, wd models predict m_wd = 0.48+/- 0.06 m_solar and r_wd = (1.27 +/- 0.18) * 10^9 cm. combining the radiusestimate with the normalization of the spectral fit, we obtain a distanceestimate of d = 830 +/-150 pc.  during our observations, dw uma was approximately 3 magnitudes fainter in vthan in the high state. a comparison of our low-state hst spectrum to ahigh-state spectrum obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer showsthat the former is much bluer and has a higher continuum level shortward of1450 a. since dw uma is an eclipsing system, this suggests that an opticallythick accretion disk rim blocks our view of the wd primary in the high state.if self-occulting accretion disks are common among the sw sex stars, we canaccount for (i) the preference for high-inclination systems within the classand (ii) their v-shaped continuum eclipses. moreover, even though the emissionlines produced by a self-obscured disk are generally still double-peaked, theyare weaker and narrower than those produced by an unobscured disk. this mayallow a secondary line emission mechanism to dominate and produce thesingle-peaked, optical lines that are a distinguishing characteristic of the swsex stars.

astro-ph;0006181	hst-stis observations of the cygnus loop: spatial structure of a  non-radiative shock	we present a spatially-resolved ultraviolet spectrum of a non-radiative shockfront in the cygnus loop, obtained with the space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis) on board the hubble space telescope (hst). the spectrumcovers the wavelength range 1118 - 1716 angstroms, with an effective spectralresolution of ~12 angstroms. the 0.1" spatial resolution of these data providesa huge improvement over earlier ultraviolet spectra, allowing us to study thespatial distribution of high ionization line emission directly behind the shockfront. we are able to isolate individual shock features in our spectrum bycomparing the stis spectrum with a wfpc2 h-alpha image of the region. isolatingthe brightest shock tangency, we identify lines of nv, civ, heii, ov, oiv] andsiiv, and niv] as well as the hydrogen 2-photon continuum. the nv line peaksabout 0.3" behind the civ and heii emission and is spatially broader. also, theobserved line ratios of civ and heii to nv are higher in our bright shockspectrum than in previous observations of the same filament obtained throughmuch larger apertures, indicating that there must be a more widely distributedcomponent of the nv emission. we calculate shock models and show that theobserved separation between the civ and nv emission zones and observed lineintensities constrain the combinations of shock velocity and pre-shock densitythat are allowed.

astro-ph;0107463	fuse observations of u geminorum during outburst and decline	we have obtained fuv (904 -- 1187 \aa) spectra of u gem in outburst withfuse. three of the observations were acquired during the plateau phase of theoutburst, while the fourth was obtained during late outburst decline. theplateau spectra have continuum shapes and fluxes that are approximated bysteady-state accretion disk model spectra with $\dot{m} \simeq$ 7e-09 m_sun/yr.the spectra also show numerous absorption lines of h i, he ii, and two- tofive-times ionized transitions of c, n, o, p, s and si. there are no emissionfeatures in the spectra, with the possible exception of a weak feature on thered wing of the o vi doublet. the absorption lines are narrow (fwhm ~ 500km/s), too narrow to arise from the disk photosphere, and at low velocities (&lt;=700 km/s). the s vi and o vi doublets are optically thick. the absorption linesin the plateau spectra show orbital variability: in spectra obtained at orbitalphases 0.53 -- 0.79, low-ionization absorption lines appear and the centraldepths of the pre-existing lines increase. the increase in line absorptionoccurs at the same orbital phases as previously observed euv and x-ray lightcurve dips. if the absorbing material is in (near-) keplerian rotation aroundthe disk, it must be located at large disk radii. the final observationoccurred when u gem was about two magnitudes from optical quiescence. thespectra are dominated by emission from an $\simeq$43,000 k, metal-enrichedwhite dwarf (wd). the inferred radius of the wd is 4.95e+08 cm, close to thatobserved in quiescence. allowing for a hot heated region on the surface of thewd improves the fit to the spectrum at short (&lt; 960 \aa) wavelengths.

astro-ph;0109486	the evolution of disks and winds in dwarf novae outbursts	far ultraviolet (fuv) observations are excellent probes of the inneraccretion disk, disk outflows, and the mass-accumulating white dwarf incataclysmic variables. here we study the contrasting behavior of two canonicaldwarf novae in outburst by presenting fuse fuv (904 -- 1187 a) spectroscopy ofu gem and ss cyg. we observed each system four times during a single outburst.the outburst peak and early decline spectra of ss cyg are well fit by models ofa steady-state accretion disk and a biconical wind. a broad, blueshifted oviwind-formed absorption line is the only strong spectral feature. in lateoutburst decline, ovi and ciii lines are seen as broad emission features andthe continuum has flattened. in u gem, the continua of the optical outburstplateau spectra are plausibly fit by accretion disk model spectra. the spectraalso show numerous narrow, low-velocity absorption lines that do not originatein the inner accretion disk. we discuss the line spectra in the context ofpartial absorption of the fuv continuum by low-velocity, vertically-extendedmaterial located at large disk radii. the late outburst decline spectrum of ugem is dominated by the white dwarf. wd model fits confirm the sub-solar c andsuper-solar n abundances found in earlier studies.

astro-ph;0207030	time-resolved ultraviolet spectroscopy of the compact interacting binary  qu car	we present hst/stis (1160--1700a) echelle spectra of the cataclysmic variable(cv) star, qu car, observed in time-tag mode at three epochs. in cataloguesthis binary is classified as a nova-like variable. we find evidence of ahigh-state non-magnetic cv at low inclination, with unusually high ionisation.we observed narrow absorption lines (few hundred km/s wide) in n v1240, o v1371and si iv1398, as well as broader (hwzi ~1000km/s) emission in c iii1176, civ1549 and he ii1640, all with a superposed absorption component. highionisation is indicated by the unusually string he ii emission and the relativestrength of the o v absorption line. the dereddened uv sed of, on average, -2.3suggests that disc accretion dominates the spectral energy distribution. in twoobservations velocity shifting is noted in the absorption lines on a timescalelong enough not to repeat within the ~2600-sec exposures. the absorptionsuperposed on the c iv emission line moves coherently with the n v and si ivabsorption, suggesting the same origin for all absorption lines -- most likelyto be in the accretion disc atmosphere. weak blueshifted absorption in nv andc\iv provides evidence of an outflow component and we estimate a maximumoutflow velocity of ~2000km/s. this may be linked to a wind launched fromfurther out in the disc than is typically seen in those high-state non-magneticcv whose wind speeds are observed to reach to &gt;4000km/s. unusually, threeionisation stages of carbon -- c ii, c iii and c iv -- are present in emission,with line width increasing with higher ionisation. the presence of c ii inemission and the positive line-width/ionisation correlation is most easilyreconciled with an origin in a disc chromosphere, beyond the influence of theeuv-emitting inner disc.

astro-ph;0209296	qu car: a very high luminosity nova-like binary with a carbon-enriched  companion	qu car is listed in cataclysmic variable star catalogues as a nova-likevariable. this little-studied, yet bright interacting binary is re-appraisedhere in the light of new high-quality ultraviolet (uv) interstellar line dataobtained with stis on board the hubble space telescope. the detection of acomponent of interstellar absorption at a mean lsr velocity of $-$14 kms$^{-1}$ indicates that the distance to qu car may be $\sim$2 kpc or more -- aconsiderable increase on the previous lower-limiting distance of 500 pc. if so,the bolometric luminosity of qu car could exceed $10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. thiswould place this binary in the luminosity domain occupied by knowncompact-binary supersoft x-ray sources. even at a 500 pc, qu car appears to bethe most luminous nova-like variable known.  new intermediate dispersion optical spectroscopy of qu car spanning3800--7000 \aa is presented. these data yield the discovery that c{\sc iv}$\lambda\lambda$5801,12 is present as an unusually prominent emission line inan otherwise low-contrast line spectrum. using measurements of this and otherlines in a recombination line analysis, it is shown that the c/he abundance asproxied by the n(c$^{4+}$)/n(he$^{2+}$) ratio may be as high as 0.06 (an orderof magnitude higher than the solar ratio). furthermore, the c/o abundance ratiois estimated to be greater than 1. these findings suggest that the companion inqu car is a carbon star. if so, it would be the first example of a carbon starin such a binary. an early-type r star best matches the required abundancepattern and could escape detection at optical wavelengths provided the distanceto qu car is $\sim$2 kpc or more.

astro-ph;0209542	the system parameters of dw ursae majoris	we present new constraints on the system parameters of the sw sextantis stardw ursae majoris, based on ultraviolet (uv) eclipse observations with thehubble space telescope. our data were obtained during a low state of thesystem, in which the uv light was dominated by the hot white dwarf (wd)primary. eclipse analysis, using the full roche lobe geometry, allows us to setfirm limits on the masses and radii of the system components and the distancebetween them: 0.67 \leq m_1/m_sun \leq 1.06, 0.008 \leq r_1/r_sun \leq 0.014,m_2/m_sun &gt; 0.16, r_2/r_sun &gt; 0.28 and a/r_sun &gt; 1.05. for q = m_2/m_1 &lt; 1.5the inclination must satisfy i &gt; 71 degrees. using smith &amp; dhillon'smass-period relation for cv secondaries, our estimates for the systemparameters become m_1/m_sun = 0.77 \pm 0.07, r_1/r_sun = 0.012 \pm 0.001,m_2/m_sun = 0.30 \pm 0.10, r_2/r_sun = 0.34 \pm 0.04, q =0.39 \pm 0.12, i = 82\pm 4 degrees and a/r_sun = 1.14 \pm 0.06. we have also estimated the spectraltype of the secondary, m3.5 \pm 1.0, and distance to the system, d =930 \pm 160pc, from time-resolved i- and k-band photometry. finally, we have repeatedknigge et al.'s wd model atmosphere fit to the low-state uv spectrum of dw umain order to account for the higher surface gravity indicated by our eclipseanalysis. in this way we obtained a second estimate for the distance, d = 590\pm 100 pc, which allows us to obtain a second estimate for the spectral typeof the secondary, m7 \pm 2.0. we conclude that the true value for the distanceand spectral type will probably be in between the values obtained by the twomethods.

astro-ph;0511645	a blue straggler binary system with at least three progenitors in the  core of a globular cluster?	we show that the x-ray source w31 in the core of the globular cluster 47tucanae is physically associated with the bright blue straggler bss-7. the twosources are astrometrically matched to 0.061\arcsec, with a chance coincidenceprobability of less than 1%. we then analyse optical time-series photometryobtained with the {\em hubble space telescope} (hst) and find that bss-7displays a 1.56 day periodic signal in the i band. we also construct abroad-band (far-ultraviolet through far-red) spectral energy distribution forbss-7 and fit this with single and binary models. the binary model is a betterfit to the data, and we derive the corresponding stellar parameters.  all of our findings are consistent with bss-7 being a detached binaryconsisting of a blue straggler primary with an x-ray-active,upper-main-sequence companion. the formation of such a system would necessarilyinvolve at least three stars, which is consistent with recent n-body models inwhich blue stragglers often form via multiple encounters that can involve bothsingle and binary stars. however, we cannot yet entirely rule out thepossibility that bss-7 descended directly from a binary system via masstransfer. the system parameters needed to distinguish definitively betweenthese scenarios may be obtainable from time-resolved spectroscopy.

astro-ph;0602167	hst/stis spectroscopy and modeling of the long term cooling of wz  sagittae following the july 2001 outburst	we present the last hst/stis e140m fuv spectrum (1150-1725a) of the dwarfnova (dn) wz sge, obtained in july 2004, 3 years following the earlysuperoutburst of july 2001. single white dwarf (wd) synthetic spectral fits(log{g}=8.5) to the data indicate that the wd has a temperature t~15,000k,about ~1500k above its quiescent temperature and it is still showing the effectof the outburst. taking into account temperature estimates of the earlier phaseof the cooling, we model the cooling curve of wz sge, over a period of 3 years,using a stellar evolution code including accretion and the effects ofcompressional heating. assuming that compressional heating alone is the sourceof the energy released during the cooling phase, we find that (1) the mass ofthe white dwarf must be quite large (~1.0 msun); and (2) the mass accretionrate must have a time-averaged (over 52 days of outburst) value of the order of1.e-8 msun/yr or larger. the outburst mass accretion rate derived from thesecompressional heating models is larger than the rates estimated from opticalobservations and from a fuv spectral fit by up to one order of magnitude. thisimplies that during the cooling phase the energy released by the wd is not dueto compressional heating alone.

astro-ph;0603698	m 33 x-7: chasem33 reveals the first eclipsing black hole x-ray binary	the first observations conducted as part of the chandra acis survey of m 33(chasem33) sampled the eclipsing x-ray binary m 33 x-7 over a large part of the3.45 d orbital period and have resolved eclipse ingress and egress for thefirst time. the occurrence of the x-ray eclipse allows us to determine animproved ephemeris of mid-eclipse and binary period as hjd (2453639.119+-0.005)+- n x (3.453014+-0.000020) and constrain the eclipse half angle to (26.5+-1.1)degree. there are indications for a shortening of the orbital period. the x-rayspectrum is best described by a disk blackbody spectrum typical for black holex-ray binaries in the galaxy. we find a flat power density spectrum and nosignificant regular pulsations were found in the frequency range of 10^{-4} to0.15 hz. hst wfpc2 images resolve the optical counterpart, which can beidentified as an o6iii star with the help of extinction and colour correctionsderived from the x-ray absorption. based on the optical light curve, the massof the compact object in the system most likely exceeds 9 m_sun. this mass, theshape of the x-ray spectrum and the short term x-ray time variability identifym 33 x-7 as the first eclipsing black hole high mass x-ray binary.

astro-ph;0610166	dust destruction in fast shocks of core-collapse supernova remnants in  the large magellanic cloud	we report observations with the mips instrument aboard the {\it spitzer spacetelescope} (sst) of four supernova remnants (snrs) believed to be the result ofcore-collapse sne: n132d (0525-69.6), n49b (0525-66.0), n23 (0506-68.0), and0453-68.5. all four of these snrs were detected in whole at 24 $\mu$m and inpart at 70 $\mu$m. comparisons with {\it chandra} broadband x-ray images showan association of infrared (ir) emission with the blast wave. we attribute theobserved ir emission to dust that has been collisionally heated by electronsand ions in the hot, x-ray emitting plasma, with grain size distributionsappropriate for the lmc and the destruction of small grains via sputtering byions. as with our earlier analysis of type ia snrs, models can reproduceobserved 70/24 $\mu$m ratios only if effects from sputtering are included,destroying small grains. we calculate the mass of dust swept up by the blastwave in these remnants, and we derive a dust-to-gas mass ratio of several timesless than the often assumed value of 0.25% for the lmc. we believe that oneexplanation for this discrepancy could be porous (fluffy) dust grains.

astro-ph;9707250	hopkins ultraviolet telescope observations of her x-1	we have obtained a far-ultraviolet spectrum of the x-ray binary herculesx-1/hz herculis using the hopkins ultraviolet telescope aboard the astro-1space shuttle mission in 1990 december. this is the first spectrum of her x-1that extends down to the lyman limit at 912 a. we observed emission lines of ovi, n v, and c iv, and the far uv continuum extending to the lyman limit. weexamine the conditions of the emitting gas through line strengths, line ratios,and doublet ratios. the uv flux is lower by about a factor of 2 than expectedat the orbital phase of the observation. we model the uv continuum with asimple power-law and with a detailed model of an x-ray-illuminated accretiondisk and companion star. the power-law provides a superior fit, as the detailedmodel predicts too little flux below 1200 a. we note, however, that there areuncertainties in the interstellar reddening, in the background airglowspectrum, and in the long-term phase of the accretion disk. we have searchedthe data for uv line and continuum pulsations near the neutron star spin periodbut found none at a detectable level.

astro-ph;9801206	hst/fos eclipse observations of the nova-like cataclysmic variable ux  ursae majoris	[abridged abstract]  we present and analyze hubble space telescope observations of the eclipsingnova-like cataclysmic variable ux uma obtained with the faint objectspectrograph. two eclipses each were observed with the g160l grating (coveringthe ultraviolet waveband) in august of 1994 and with the prism (covering thenear-ultraviolet to near-infrared) in november of the same year. the system was50% brighter in november than in august, which, if due to a change in theaccretion rate, indicates a fairly substantial increase in mdot_acc by &gt;~ 50%.  model disk spectra constructed as ensembles of stellar atmospheres providepoor descriptions of the observed post-eclipse spectra, despite the fact thatux uma's light should be dominated by the disk at this time. suitably scaledsingle temperature model stellar atmospheres with t_eff = 12,500-14,500 kactually provide a better match to both the ultraviolet and opticalpost-eclipse spectra. evidently, great care must be taken in attempts to deriveaccretion rates from comparisons of disk models to observations.  one way to reconcile disk models with the observed post-eclipse spectra is topostulate the presence of a significant amount of optically thin material inthe system. such an optically thin component might be associated with thetransition region (``chromosphere'') between the disk photosphere and the fastwind from the system, whose presence has been suggested by knigge &amp; drew(1997).

astro-ph;9801207	recovery of 29-s oscillations in hst/fos eclipse observations of the  cataclysmic variable ux ursae majoris	[abridged abstract]  low amplitude (~=0.5%) 29-s oscillations have been detected in hst/foseclipse observations of the nova-like cataclysmic variable ux uma. these arethe same dwarf nova-type oscillations that were originally discovered in thissystem by warner &amp; nather in 1972. the oscillations are sinusoidal to withinthe small observational errors and undergo an approximately -360 degree phaseshift during eclipses. their amplitudes are highest at pre-eclipse orbitalphases and exhibit a rather gradual eclipse whose shape is roughly similar toux~uma's overall light curve. oscillation spectra derived from pre-eclipse datasegments are extremely blue, whereas mid-eclipse oscillation spectra are muchredder.  we suggest that the ultimate source of the oscillations is a hot, compactregion near disk center, but that a significant fraction of the observed,modulated flux is due to reprocessing of the light emitted by this source inthe accretion disk atmosphere. the compact source is occulted at orbital phasesnear mid-eclipse, leaving only part of the more extended reprocessing region(s)to produce the weak oscillations that persist even at conjunction.  the highly sinusoidal oscillation pulse shape does not permit theidentification of the compact component in this model with emission produced bya rotating disturbance in the inner disk or in an equatorial boundary layer,and a standard intermediate polar model can also be ruled out. a model invokingmagnetically controlled accretion onto differentially rotating wd surfacelayers may be viable, but needs more theoretical work.

astro-ph;9804002	hst spatially-resolved spectra of the accretion disc and gas stream of  the nova-like variable ux ursae majoris	time-resolved eclipse spectroscopy of the nova-like variable ux uma obtainedwith the hst/fos on 1994 august and november is analyzed with eclipse mappingtechniques to produce spatially resolved spectra of its accretion disc and gasstream as a function of distance from disc centre.  the inner accretion disc is characterized by a blue continuum filled withabsorption bands and lines which cross over to emission with increasing discradius, similar to that reported by rutten et al (1994) at optical wavelengths.the comparison of spatially resolved spectra at different azimuths reveals asignificant asymmetry in the disc emission at uv wavelengths, with the discside closest to the secondary star showing pronounced absorption by an `ironcurtain' and a balmer jump in absorption. these results suggest the existenceof an absorbing ring of cold gas whose density and/or vertical scale increasewith disc radius. the spectrum of the infalling gas stream is noticeablydifferent from the disc spectrum at the same radius suggesting that gasoverflows through the impact point at disc rim and continues along the streamtrajectory, producing distinct emission down to 0.1 rl1.  the radial temperature profiles of the continuum maps are well described by asteady-state disc model in the inner and intermediate disc regions. there isevidence of an increase in the mass accretion rate from august to november(from mdot= 10^{-8.3 +/- 0.1} to 10^{-8.1 +/- 0.1} msun/yr), in accordance withthe observed increase in brightness. since the ux uma disc seems to be in ahigh mass accretion, high-viscosity regime in both epochs, this result suggeststhat the mass transfer rate of ux uma varies substantially (~ 50 per cent) ontime scales of a few months.
