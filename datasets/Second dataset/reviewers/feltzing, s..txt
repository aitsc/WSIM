0903.3044	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. detailed abundance analysis of ogle-2008-blg-209s	aims. our aims are twofold. first we aim to evaluate the robustness andaccuracy of stellar parameters and detailed elemental abundances that can bederived from high-resolution spectroscopic observations of microlensed dwarfand subgiant stars. we then aim to use microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars toinvestigate the abundance structure and chemical evolution of the milky waybulge. [abridged] methods. we present a detailed elemental abundance analysisof ogle-2008-blg-209s, the source star of a new microlensing event towards thebulge, for which we obtained a high-resolution spectrum with the mikespectrograph on the magellan clay telescope. we have performed four differentanalyses of ogle-2008-blg-209s. [abridged] we have also re-analysed threeprevious microlensed dwarf stars ogle-2006-blg-265s, moa-2006-blg-099s, andogle-2007-blg-349s with the same method. this homogeneous data set, althoughsmall, enables a direct comparison between the different stellar populations.results. we find that ogle-2008-blg-209s is a subgiant star that has ametallicity of [fe/h] ~-0.33. it possesses [alpha/fe] enhancements similar towhat is found for bulge giant stars at the same metallicity, and what also isfound for nearby thick disc stars at the same metallicity. in contrast, theprevious three microlensing dwarf stars have very high metallicities,[fe/h]&gt;+0.4, and more solar-like abundance ratios, i.e. [alpha/fe]~0. thedecrease in the [alpha/fe] ratio with [fe/h] is the typical signature ofenrichment from low and intermediate mass stars. we furthermore find that theresults for the four bulge stars, in combination with results from studies ofgiant stars in the bulge, seem to favour a secular formation scenario for thebulge.

0906.2235	ogle-2009-blg-076s - the most metal-poor dwarf star in the galactic  bulge	measurements based on a large number of red giant stars suggest a broadmetallicity distribution function (mdf) for the galactic bulge, centered on[fe/h]=-0.1. however, recently, a new opportunity emerged to utilize temporaryflux amplification (by factors of ~100 or more) of faint dwarf stars in thebulge that are gravitationally lensed, making them observable withhigh-resolution spectrographs during a short observational window.surprisingly, of the first 6 stars measured, 5 have [fe/h]&gt;+0.30, suggesting ahighly skewed mdf, inconsistent with observations of giant stars. here wepresent a detailed elemental abundance analysis of ogle-2009-blg-076s, based ona high-resolution spectrum obtained with the uves spectrograph at the eso verylarge telescope. our results indicate it is the most metal-poor dwarf star inthe bulge yet observed, with [fe/h]=-0.76. our results argue against a strongselection effect disfavoring metal-poor microlensed stars. it is possible thatsmall number statistics is responsible for the giant/dwarf bulge mdfdiscrepancy. should this discrepancy survive when larger numbers of bulge dwarfstars (soon to be available) are analyzed, it may require modification of ourunderstanding of either bulge formation models, or the behavior of metal-richgiant stars.

0908.3489	a photometric and spectroscopic study of the new dwarf spheroidal galaxy  in hercules	our aim is to provide as clean and as complete a sample as possible of redgiant branch stars that are members of the hercules dsph galaxy. with thissample we explore the velocity dispersion and the metallicity of the system.stromgren photometry and multi-fibre spectroscopy are combined to provideinformation about the evolutionary state of the stars (via the stromgren c_1index) and their radial velocities. based on this information we have selecteda clean sample of red giant branch stars, and show that foregroundcontamination by milky way dwarf stars can greatly distort the results. ourfinal sample consists of 28 red giant branch stars in the hercules dsph galaxy.based on these stars we find a mean photometric metallicity of -2.35 dex whichis consistent with previous studies. we find evidence for an abundance spread.using those stars for which we have determined radial velocities we find asystemic velocity of 45.2 km/s with a dispersion of 3.72 km/s, this is lowerthan values found in the literature. furthermore we identify the horizontalbranch and estimate the mean magnitude of the horizontal branch of the herculesdsph galaxy to be v_0=21.17, which corresponds to a distance of 147 kpc. wehave shown that a proper cleaning of the sample results in a smaller value forthe velocity dispersion of the system. this has implications for galaxyproperties derived from such velocity dispersions.

0910.1348	a new low mass for the hercules dsph: the end of a common mass scale for  the dwarfs?	we present a new mass estimate for the hercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy(dsph), based on the revised velocity dispersion obtained by aden et al. (2009,arxiv:0908.3489).  the removal of a significant foreground contamination using newly acquiredstromgren photometry has resulted in a reduced velocity dispersion. using thisnew velocity dispersion of 3.72 +/- 0.91 km/s, we find a mass ofm_300=1.9^{+1.1}_{-0.8} 10^6 m_sun within the central 300 pc, which is also thehalf-light radius, and a mass of m_433=3.7_{-1.6}^{+2.2} 10^6 m_sun within thereach of our data to 433 pc, significantly lower than previous estimates. wederive an overall mass-to-light ratio of m_433/l=103^{+83}_{-48} m_sun/l_sun.our mass estimate calls into question recent claims of a common mass scale fordsph galaxies.  additionally, we find tentative evidence for a velocity gradient in ourkinematic data of 16 +/- 3 km/s/kpc, and evidence of an asymmetric extension inthe light distribution at about 0.5 kpc. we explore the possibility that thesefeatures are due to tidal interactions with the milky way. we show that thereis a self-consistent model in which hercules has an assumed tidal radius of r_t= 485 pc, an orbital pericentre of r_p = 18.5 +/- 5 kpc, and a mass within r_tof m_{tid,r_t}=5.2 +/- 2.7 10^6 m_sun. proper motions are required to test thismodel. although we cannot exclude models in which hercules contains no darkmatter, we argue that hercules is more likely to be a dark matter dominatedsystem which is currently experiencing some tidal disturbance of its outerparts.

0910.1557	evidence of enrichment by individual supernova from elemental abundance  ratios in the very metal-poor dsph galaxy bootes i	aim: we establish the mean metallicity from high-resolution spectroscopy forthe recently found dwarf spheroidal galaxy bootes i and test whether it is acommon feature for ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies to show signs ofinhomogeneous chemical evolution (e.g. as found in the hercules dwarfspheroidal galaxy). methods: we analyse high-resolution, moderatesignal-to-noise spectra for seven red giant stars in the bootes i dsph galaxyusing standard abundance analysis techniques. in particular, we assume localthermodynamic equilibrium and employ spherical model atmospheres and codes thattake the sphericity of the star into account when calculating the elementalabundances. results: we confirm previous determinations of the mean metallicityof the bootes i dwarf spheroidal galaxy to be -2.3 dex. whilst five stars areclustered around this metallicity, one is significantly more metal-poor, at-2.9 dex, and one is more metal-rich at, -1.9 dex. additionally, we find thatone of the stars, boo-127, shows an atypically high [mg/ca] ratio, indicativeof stochastic enrichment processes within the dsph galaxy. similar results havepreviously only been found in the hercules and draco dsph galaxies and appear,so far, to be unique to this type of galaxy.

0911.5076	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. ii. ages, metallicities, detailed elemental abundances,  and connections to the galactic thick disc	the bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the milky way.most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the bulge comes frombright giant stars. the underlying assumption that giants represent all thestars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, isunder debate. in particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarfstars give a very different picture of the evolution of the bulge from thatgiven by the giant stars. [abridged] we perform a detailed elemental abundanceanalysis of dwarf stars in the galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectrathat were obtained while the stars were optically magnified duringgravitational microlensing events. [abridged] we present detailed elementalabundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the galactic bulge.combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sampleto date of microlensed dwarf stars in the galactic bulge. we find that thestars span the full range of metallicities from [fe/h]=-0.72 to +0.54, and anaverage metallicity of &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicitybased on giant stars in the bulge. furthermore, the stars follow well-definedabundance trends, that for [fe/h]&lt;0 are very similar to those of the localgalactic thick disc. this suggests that the bulge and the thick disc have had,at least partially, comparable chemical histories. at sub-solar metallicitieswe find the bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while atsuper-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. using the new age andabundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possibleformation scenarios for the bulge.

1010.5683	an abundance study of red-giant-branch stars in the hercules dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	using high-resolution spectroscopy, we provide a determination of [fe/h] and[ca/h] for confirmed red-giant branch member stars of the hercules dwarfspheroidal galaxy. based on this we explore the ages of the prevailing stellarpopulations in hercules, and the enrichment history from supernovae.additionally, we provide a new simple metallicity calibration for stromgrenphotometry for metal-poor, red giant branch stars. we find that the red-giantbranch stars of the hercules dsph galaxy are more metal-poor than estimated inour previous study that was based on photometry alone. additionally, we find anabundance trend such that [ca/fe] is higher for more metal-poor stars, andlower for more metal-rich stars, with a spread of about 0.8 dex. the [ca/fe]trend suggests an early rapid chemical enrichment through supernovae of typeii, followed by a phase of slow star formation dominated by enrichment throughsupernovae of type ia. a comparison with isochrones indicates that the redgiants in hercules are older than 10 gyr.

1110.0905	chemical constraints on the formation of the galactic thick disk	we highlight some results from our detailed abundance analysis study of 703kinematically selected f and g dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. theanalysis is based on spectra of high-resolution (r=45000 to 110000) and highsignal-to-noise (s/n=150 to 300). the main findings include: (1) at a givenmetallicity, the thick disk abundance trends are more $\alpha$-enhanced thanthose of the thin disk; (2) the metal-rich limit of the thick disk reaches atleast solar metallicities; (3) the metal-poor limit of the thin disk is around[fe/h]=-0.8; (4) the thick disk shows an age-metallicity gradient; (5) the thindisk does {\it not} show an age-metallicity gradient; (6) the most metal-richthick disk stars at [fe/h]=0 are significantly older than the most metal-poorthin disk stars at [fe/h]=-0.7; (7) based on our elemental abundances we findthat kinematical criteria produce thin and thick disk stellar samples that arebiased in the sense that stars from the low-velocity tail of the thick disk areclassified as thin disk stars, and stars from the high-velocity tail of thethin disk are classified as thick disk stars; (8) age criteria appears toproduce thin and thick disk stellar samples with less contamination.

1208.5780	moons: a multi-object optical and near-infrared spectrograph for the vlt	moons is a new conceptual design for a multi-object optical and near-infraredspectrograph for the very large telescope (vlt), selected by eso for a phase astudy. the baseline design consists of 1000 fibers deployable over a field ofview of 500 square arcmin, the largest patrol field offered by the nasmythfocus at the vlt. the total wavelength coverage is 0.8um-1.8um and tworesolution modes: medium resolution and high resolution. in the mediumresolution mode (r=4,000-6,000) the entire wavelength range 0.8um-1.8um isobserved simultaneously, while the high resolution mode covers simultaneouslythree selected spectral regions: one around the caii triplet (at r=8,000) tomeasure radial velocities, and two regions at r=20,000 one in the j-band andone in the h-band, for detailed measurements of chemical abundances. the graspof the 8.2m very large telescope (vlt) combined with the large multiplex andwavelength coverage of moons - extending into the near-ir - will provide theobservational power necessary to study galaxy formation and evolution over theentire history of the universe, from our milky way, through the redshift desertand up to the epoch of re-ionization at z&gt;8-9. at the same time, the highspectral resolution mode will allow astronomers to study chemical abundances ofstars in our galaxy, in particular in the highly obscured regions of the bulge,and provide the necessary follow-up of the gaia mission. such characteristicsand versatility make moons the long-awaited workhorse near-ir mos for the vlt,which will perfectly complement optical spectroscopy performed by flames andvimos.

1211.1406	velocity and abundance precisions for future high-resolution  spectroscopic surveys: a study for 4most	in preparation for future, large-scale, multi-object, high-resolutionspectroscopic surveys of the galaxy, we present a series of tests of theprecision in radial velocity and chemical abundances that any such project canachieve at a 4m class telescope. we briefly discuss a number of science casesthat aim at studying the chemo-dynamical history of the major galacticcomponents (bulge, thin and thick disks, and halo) - either as a follow-up tothe gaia mission or on their own merits. based on a large grid of syntheticspectra that cover the full range in stellar parameters of typical surveytargets, we devise an optimal wavelength range and argue for a moderatelyhigh-resolution spectrograph. as a result, the kinematic precision is notlimited by any of these factors, but will practically only suffer fromsystematic effects, easily reaching uncertainties &lt;1 km/s. under realisticsurvey conditions (namely, considering stars brighter than r=16 mag withreasonable exposure times) we prefer an ideal resolving power of r~20000 onaverage, for an overall wavelength range (with a common two-arm spectrographdesign) of [395;456.5] nm and [587;673] nm. we show for the first time on ageneral basis that it is possible to measure chemical abundance ratios tobetter than 0.1 dex for many species (fe, mg, si, ca, ti, na, al, v, cr, mn,co, ni, y, ba, nd, eu) and to an accuracy of about 0.2 dex for other speciessuch as zr, la, and sr. while our feasibility study was explicitly carried outfor the 4most facility, the results can be readily applied to and used for anyother conceptual design study for high-resolution spectrographs.

1211.6848	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. v. evidence for a wide age distribution and a complex mdf	based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensingevents we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 32 dwarf andsubgiant stars in the galactic bulge. [abridged], we now have 58 microlensedbulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously analysed. the maincharacteristics of the sample and the findings that can be drawn are: (i) themetallicity distribution (mdf) is wide and spans all metallicities between[fe/h]=-1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in the mdf around solar metallicity that wasapparent in our previous analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) isno longer evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications ofmultiple components are starting to emerge. [abridged]; (iii) the stars with[fe/h]&lt;-0.1 are old with ages between 10 and 12 gyr; (iv) the metal-rich starswith [fe/h]&gt;-0.1 show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 gyr with adistribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 gyr and a tail towards higherages; (v) there are indications in the [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] that the "knee"occurs around [fe/h] = -0.3 to -0.2, which is a slightly higher metallicity ascompared to the "knee" for the local thick disk. this suggests that thechemical enrichment of the metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than whatis observed for the local thick disk. the results from the microlensed bulgedwarf stars in combination with other findings in the literature, in particularthe evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the milkyway could be an almost pure disk galaxy. the bulge would then just be aconglomerate of the other galactic stellar populations (thin disk, thick disk,halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of the galaxy,influenced by the galactic bar.

1312.1759	quantitative chemical tagging, stellar ages and the chemo-dynamical  evolution of the galactic disc	the early science results from the new generation of high-resolution stellarspectroscopic surveys, such as galah and the gaia-eso survey, will representmajor milestones in the quest to chemically tag the galaxy. yet this techniqueto reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar groups has remained largely untesteduntil recently. we build on previous work that developed an empirical chemicaltagging probability function, which describes the likelihood that two fieldstars are conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment.in this work we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment, i.e.,tagging stars with no known or otherwise discernable associations, on a sampleof 714 disc field stars with a number of high quality high resolutionhomogeneous metal abundance measurements. we present evidence that chemicaltagging of field stars does identify coeval groups of stars, yet these groupsmay not represent distinct formation sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters,as previously thought. our results point to several important conclusions,among them that group finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundancespace, e.g. stellar ages, kinematics, colors, temperature and surface gravitydo not enhance the detectability of groups. we also demonstrate that inaddition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic historyof the galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new stellar agedetermination technique.

1401.0541	young stars in an old bulge: a natural outcome of internal evolution in  the milky way	the center of our disk galaxy, the milky way, is dominated by aboxy/peanut-shaped bulge. numerous studies of the bulge based on stellarphotometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. theperceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likelyformation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique populationthat formed early and separately from the disk. however, recent studies ofindividual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that theyspan a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithicstructure. in this letter we demonstrate that the presence of young stars thatare located predominantly near the plane is expected for a bulge that hasformed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. using an n-body+sphsimulation of a disk galaxy forming out of gas cooling inside a dark matterhalo and forming stars, we find a qualitative agreement between our model andthe observations of young metal-rich stars in the bulge. we are also able topartially resolve the apparent contradiction in the literature between resultsthat argue for a purely old bulge population and those which show a populationcomprised of a range in ages; the key is where to look.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1401.4979	the gaia-eso survey: kinematic structure in the gamma velorum cluster	context: a key science goal of the gaia-eso survey (ges) is to use thekinematics of low-mass stars in young clusters to probe their dynamicalhistories and how they populate the field as they become unbound. theclustering of low-mass stars around the massive w-r binary gamma^2 velorum wasone of the first ges targets. aims: to empirically determine the radialvelocity (rv) precision of ges data, construct a kinematically unbiased sampleof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. methods: targetswere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolutionspectroscopy used to derive rvs and assess membership from the strength of theli6708a line. the rv distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihoodtechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. results: the ges rv precisionis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-masspopulation around gamma^2 vel. the structure is well fitted by two kinematiccomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsicdispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. the secondhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by~2km/s. the first population is older by 1-2myr based on a greater level of lidepletion seen among its m-stars and is probably more centrally concentratedaround gamma^2 vel. conclusions: we consider several formation scenarios,concluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of theoriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 vel, and a dispersed populationfrom the wider vela ob2 association, of which gamma^2 vel is the most massivemember. the apparent youth of gamma^2 vel compared to the older (&gt;=10myr)low-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binaryformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of thelow-mass stars.[abridged]

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7568	the gaia-eso survey: the galactic thick to thin disc transition	(abridged) we have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/fe] abundances andradial velocities, determined from the gaia-eso survey giraffe spectra offgk-type stars (idr1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of thedisc stellar populations. we focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with highquality parameters, covering the volume |z|&lt;4.5kpc and r in the range 2-13kpc.we have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/fe] vs [m/h]plane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number densitydistribution. the thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layersabove the galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/fe] decreases.the thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to theplane at all metallicities. our data confirm the already known correlationsbetween v_phi and [m/h] for the two discs. for the thick disc sequence, a studyof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to64km/s/dex. the distributions of v_phi, v_z, and orbital parameters areanalysed for the chemically separated samples. concerning the gradients withgalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of v_phi, a[m/h] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/fe] gradient. forthe thick disc, flat gradients in [m/h] and [alpha/fe] are derived. ourchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems tohave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increasedprogressively, and, possibly, the v_phi dispersion decreased. at [m/h]-0.25dexand [alpha/fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance tothe galactic plane, v_phi, v_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with thoseof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between thesepopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

1408.4558	the gaia-eso survey: metallicity and kinematic trends in the milky way  bulge	(abridged) we analyzed the stellar parameters and radial velocities of ~1200stars in five bulge fields as determined from the gaia-eso survey data (idr1).we use vista variables in the via lactea (vvv) photometry to obtain reddeningvalues by using a semi-empirical t_eff-color calibration. from a gaussiandecomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clearbimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of thespecific position on the sky. in agreement with some previous studies, we finda mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b=-6 and b=-10)that arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poorcomponents. the number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poorstars with increasing b. the k-magnitude distribution of the metal-richpopulation splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersectsthe near and far branches of the x-shaped bulge structure. in addition, twolateral fields at (l,b)=(7,-9) and (l,b)=(-10,-8) present contrastingcharacteristics. in the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated bymetal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poorpopulation and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes. finally, wefind systematic differences in the velocity dispersion between the metal-richand the metal-poor components of each field. our chemo-kinematical analysis isconsistent with a varying field-to-field proportion of stars belonging to (i) ametal-rich boxy/peanut x-shaped component, with bar-like kinematics, and (ii) ametal-poor more extended rotating structure with a higher velocity dispersionthat dominates far from the galactic plane. these first ges data allow studyingthe detailed spatial dependence of the galactic bulge populations, thanks tothe analysis of individual fields with relatively high statistics.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1411.5938	quest for finding the lost siblings of the sun	the aim of this paper is to find lost siblings of the sun by analyzing highresolution spectra. finding solar siblings will enable us to constrain theparameters of the parental cluster and the birth place of the sun in thegalaxy. the solar siblings can be identified by accurate measurements ofmetallicity, stellar age and elemental abundances for solar neighbourhoodstars. the solar siblings candidates were kinematically selected based on theirproper motions, parallaxes and colours. stellar parameters were determinedthrough a purely spectroscopic approach and partly physical method,respectively. comparing synthetic with observed spectra, elemental abundanceswere computed based on the stellar parameters obtained using a partly physicalmethod. a chemical tagging technique was used to identify the solar siblings.we present stellar parameters, stellar ages, and detailed elemental abundancesfor na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, cr, fe, and ni for 32 solar sibling candidates. ourabundances analysis shows that four stars are chemically homogenous togetherwith the sun. technique of chemical tagging gives us a high probability thatthey might be from the same open cluster. only one candidate hip 40317 whichhas solar metallicity and age could be a solar sibling. we performedsimulations of the sun's birth cluster in analytical galactic model and foundthat most of the radial velocities of the solar siblings lie in the range $-10\leq \mathrm{v_r}\leq 10$ $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, which is smaller than theradial velocity of hip 40317 $(\mathrm{v_r} = 34.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}})$, underdifferent galactic parameters and different initial conditions of the sun'sbirth cluster. the sibling status for hip 40317 is not directly supported byour dynamical analysis.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

1506.08081	the nature of the kfr08 stellar stream	the origin of a new kinematically identified metal-poor stellar stream, thekfr08 stream, has not been established. we present stellar parameters, stellarages, and detailed elemental abundances for na, mg, al, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, ni,zn, sr, y, zr, ba, la, and eu for 16 kfr08 stream members based on analysis ofhigh resolution spectra. based on the abundance ratios of 14 elements, we usethe chemical tagging method to identify the stars which have the same chemicalcomposition, and thus, might have a common birthplace, such as a cluster.although three stars were tagged with similar elemental abundances ratios, wefind that, statistically, it is not certain that they originate from adissolved star cluster. this conclusion is consistent with the large dispersionof [fe/h] ($\sigma_{\rm{[fe/h]}} = 0.29$) among the 16 stream members. we findthat our stars are $\alpha$ enhanced and that the abundance patterns of thestream members are well matched to the thick disk. in addition, most of thestream stars have estimated stellar ages larger than 11 gyr. these results,together with the hot kinematics of the stream stars, suggest that the kfr08stream is originated from the thick disk population which was perturbed by amassive merger in the early universe.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

1510.01376	measuring the vertical age structure of the galactic disc using  asteroseismology and saga	the existence of a vertical age gradient in the milky way disc has beenindirectly known for long. here, we measure it directly for the first time withseismic ages, using red giants observed by kepler. we use stroemgren photometryto gauge the selection function of asteroseismic targets, and derive colour andmagnitude limits where giants with measured oscillations are representative ofthe underlying population in the field. limits in the 2mass system are alsoderived. we lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effectsindependent of galaxy models. we find that low mass, i.e. old red giantsdominate at increasing galactic heights, whereas closer to the galactic planethey exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. parametrizing this as avertical gradient returns approximately 4 gyr/kpc for the disc we probe,although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. the ages of stars showa smooth distribution over the last 10 gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescentevolution for the milky way disc since a redshift of about 2. we also find aflat age-metallicity relation for disc stars. finally, we show how to usesecondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread,and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing the ageing ofthe disc. this work highlights the power of asteroseismology for galacticstudies; however, we also emphasize the need for better constraints on stellarmass-loss, which is a major source of systematic age uncertainties in red giantstars.

astro-ph;0304182	a differential study of the oxygen abundances in the galactic thin and  thick disks	first results from a study into the abundance trends of oxygen in thegalactic thin and thick disks are presented. oxygen abundances for 63 nearby fand g dwarf stars, based on very high resolution spectra ($r\sim215 000$) andhigh signal-to-noise ($s/n&gt;400$) of the faint forbidden oxygen line at 6300{\aa}, have been determined. our findings can be summarized as follows: {\bf1)} at $\rm [fe/h]&lt;0$ the oxygen trends in the thin and thick disk are smoothand distinct, indicating their different origins, {\bf 2)} $\rm [o/fe]$ for thethick disk stars show a turn-over at [fe/h]$\sim -0.35$, indicating the peak ofthe enrichment from sne type ia to the interstellar medium, {\bf 3)} the thindisk stars show a shallow decrease going from $\rm [fe/h] \sim -0.7$ to thehighest metallicities with no apparent turn-over present indicating a morequiet star formation history, and {\bf 4)} $\rm [o/fe]$ continues to decreaseat $\rm [fe/h]&gt;0$ without showing the leveling out that previously has beenseen.

astro-ph;0310741	oxygen trends in the galactic thin and thick disks	we present oxygen abundances for 72 f and g dwarf stars in the solarneighbourhood. using the kinematics of the stars we divide them into twosub-samples with space velocities that are typical for the thick and thindisks, respectively. the metallicities of the stars range from [fe/h] = -0.9 to+0.4 and we use the derived oxygen abundances of the stars to: (1) perform adifferential study of the oxygen trends in the thin and the thick disk; (2) tofollow the trend of oxygen in the thin disk to the highest metallicities. weanalyze the forbidden oxygen lines at 6300 {\aa} and 6363 {\aa} as well as the(nlte afflicted) triplet lines around 7774 {\aa}. for the forbidden line at6300 a we have spectra of very high s/n (&gt;400) and resolution (r=215 000). thishas enabled a very accurate modeling of the oxygen line and the blending nilines. the high internal accuracy in our determination of the oxygen abundancesfrom this line is reflected in the very tight trends we find for oxygenrelative to iron........

astro-ph;0403591	a possible age-metallicity relation in the galactic thick disk?	a sample of 229 nearby thick disk stars has been used to investigate theexistence of an age-metallicity relation (amr) in the galactic thick disk. theresults indicate that that there is indeed an age-metallicity relation presentin the thick disk. by dividing the stellar sample into sub-groups, separated by0.1 dex in metallicity, we show that the median age decreases by about 5-7 gyrwhen going from [fe/h]=-0.8 to [fe/h]=-0.1. combining our results with ournewly published alpha-element trends for a local sample of thick disk stars,that show signatures from supernovae type ia (snia), we can here draw theconclusion that the time-scale for the peak of the snia rate is of the order3-4 gyr in the thick disk. the tentative evidence for a thick disk amr that wepresent here also has implications for the thick disk formation scenario;star-formation must have been an ongoing process for several billion years.this is further discussed here and appear to strengthen the hypothesis that thethick disk originates from a merger event with a companion galaxy that puffedup a pre-existing thin disk.

astro-ph;0412132	alpha-, r-, and s-process element trends in the galactic thin and thick  disks	from a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 f and g dwarf stars wepresent abundance trends in the galactic thin and thick disks for 14 elements(o, na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, cr, fe, ni, zn, y, ba, and eu). stellar parametersand elemental abundances (except for y, ba and eu) for 66 of the 102 stars werepresented in our previous studies (bensby et al. 2003, 2004a). the 36 starsthat are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results and allow usto draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. the s-process elementsy and ba, and the r-element eu have also been considered here for the wholesample for the first time. with this new larger sample we now have thefollowing results: 1) smooth and distinct trends that for the thin and thickdisks are clearly separated; 2) the alpha-element trends for the thick diskshow typical signatures from the enrichment of snia; 3) the thick disk stellarsample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the thickdisk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii (r_m); 5) thethick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical distance(z_max) from the galactic plane. adding further evidence from the literaure weargue that a merger/interacting scenario with a companion galaxy to produce akinematical heating of the stars (that make up today's thick disk) in apre-existing old thin disk is the most likely formation scenario for thegalactic thick disk.

astro-ph;0506145	carbon abundances in the galactic thin and thick disks	although carbon is, together with oxygen and nitrogen, one of the mostimportant elements in the study of galactic chemical evolution its productionsites are still poorly known and have been much debated (see e.g. gustafsson etal. 1999; chiappini et al. 2003). to trace the origin and evolution of carbonwe have determined carbon abundances from the forbidden [c i] line at 8727 aand made comparisons to oxygen abundances from the forbidden [o i] line at 6300a in a sample of 51 nearby f and g dwarf stars. these data and the fact thatthe forbidden [c i] and [o i] lines are very robust abundance indicators (theyare essentially insensitive to deviations from lte and uncertainties in thestellar parameters, see, e.g., gustafsson et al. 1999; asplund et al. 2005)enable us to very accurately measure the c/o ratio as well as individual c ando abundances. our first results indicate that the time-scale for the mainsource that contribute to the carbon enrichment of the interstellar mediumoperate on the same time-scale as those that contribute to the iron enrichment(and can possibly be agb stars...)

astro-ph;0601130	the origin and chemical evolution of carbon in the galactic thin and  thick disks	[abridged] in order to trace the origin and evolution of carbon in thegalactic disk we have determined carbon abundances in 51 nearby f and g dwarfstars. the sample is divided into two kinematically distinct subsamples with 35and 16 stars that are representative of the galactic thin and thick disks,respectively. the analysis is based on spectral synthesis of the forbidden [ci] line at 872.7 nm using spectra of very high resolution (r~220000)and highsignal-to-noise (s/n&gt;300) that were obtained with the ces spectrograph on theeso 3.6-m telescope on la silla in chile. we find that [c/fe] versus [fe/h]trends for the thin and thick disks are totally merged and flat for sub-solarmetallicities. the thin disk that extends to higher metallicities than thethick disk,shows a shallow decline in [c/fe] from [fe/h]=0 and up to[fe/h]=+0.4. the [c/o] versus [o/h] trends are well separated between the twodisks (due to differences in the oxygen abundances)and bear a great resemblanceto the [fe/o] versus [o/h] trends. our interpretation of our abundance trendsis that the sources that are responsible for the carbon enrichment in thegalactic thin and thick disks have operated on a time-scale very similar tothose that are responsible for the fe and y enrichment (i.e., snia and agbstars, respectively)...... for the galaxy we hence conclude that the carbonenrichment at metallicities typical of the disk is mainly due to low andintermediate mass stars, while massive stars are still the main carboncontributor at low metallicities (halo and metal-poor thick disk).

astro-ph;0610754	hercules stream stars and the metal-rich thick disk	using the mike spectrograph, mounted on the 6.5 m magellan/clay telescope atthe las campanas observatory in chile, we have obtained high-resolution spectrafor 60 f and g dwarf stars, all likely members of a density enhancement in thelocal velocity distribution, referred to as the hercules stream. comparing withan existing sample of 102 thin and thick disk stars we have used spacevelocities, detailed elemental abundances, and stellar ages to trace the originof the hercules stream. we find that the hercules stream stars show a widespread in stellar ages, metallicities, and element abundances. however, thespreads are not random but separate the hercules stream into the abundance andage trends as outlined by either the thin disk or the thick disk. we henceclaim that the major part of the hercules stream actually are thin and thickdisk stars. these diverse properties of the hercules stream point toward adynamical origin, probably caused by the galactic bar. however, we can at themoment not entirely rule out that the hercules stream could be the remnants ofa relatively recent merger event.

astro-ph;0611883	the usage of stromgren photometry in studies of local group dwarf  spheroidal galaxies - application to draco: a new catalogue of draco members  and a study of the metallicity distribution function and radial gradients	in this paper we demonstrate how stromgren uvby photometry can be efficientlyused to: 1. identify red giant branch stars that are members in a dwarfspheroidal galaxy. 2. derive age-independent metallicities for the same starsand quantify the associated errors. stromgren uvby photometry in a 11 x 22arcmin field centered on the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy was obtained usingthe isaac newton telescope on la palma. members of the draco dsph galaxy wereidentified using the surface gravity sensitive c_1 index which discriminatesbetween red giant and dwarf stars. thus enabling us to distinguish the (redgiant branch) members of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy from the foreground dwarfstars in our galaxy. the method is evaluated through a comparison of ourmembership list with membership classifications in the literature based onradial velocities and proper motions. the metallicity sensitive m_1 index wasused to derive individual and age-independent metallicities for the members ofthe draco dsph galaxy. the derived metallicities are compared to studies basedon high resolution spectroscopy and the agreement is found to be very good. wepresent metallicities for 169 members of the red giant branch in the dracodwarf spheroidal galaxy (the largest sample to date). the metallicitydistribution function for the draco dsph galaxy shows a mean [fe/h] = -1.74 dexwith a spread of 0.24 dex. the correlation between metallicity and colour forthe stars on the red giant branch is consistent with a dominant old, and coevalpopulation. there is a possible spatial population gradient over the field withthe most metal-rich stars being more centrally concentrated than the metal-poorstars.

astro-ph;0703488	manganese trends in a sample of thin and thick disk stars. the origin of  mn	context: manganese is an iron-peak element and although the nucleosynthesispath that leads to its formation is fairly well understood, it remains unclearwhich objects, sn ii and/or sn ia, that contribute the majority of mn to theinterstellar medium. it also remains unclear to which extent the supernovae mnyields depend on the metallicity of the progenitor star or not. aims: by usinga well studied and well defined sample of 95 dwarf stars we aim at furtherconstraining the formation site(s) of mn. methods: we derive mn abundancesthrough spectral synthesis of four mn i lines at 539.4, 549.2, 601.3, and 601.6nm. stellar parameters and data for oxygen are taken from bensby et al. (2003,2004, 2005). results: when comparing our mn abundances with o abundances forthe same stars we find that the abundance trends in the stars with kinematicsof the thick disk can be explained by metallicity dependent yields from sn ii.we go on and combine our data for dwarf stars in the disks with data for dwarfand giant stars in the metal-poor thick disk and halo from the literature. wefind that dwarf and giant stars show the same trends, which indicates thatneither non-lte nor evolutionary effects are a major concern for mn.furthermore, the [mn/o] vs [o/h] trend in the halo is flat. conclusions: weconclude that the simplest interpretation of our data is that mn is most likelyproduced in sn ii and that the mn yields for such snae must be metallicitydependent. contribution from sn ia in the metal-rich thin disk can not,however, be excluded.

0810.4832	stellar abundances and ages for metal-rich milky way globular clusters -  stellar parameters and elemental abundances for 9 hb stars in ngc6352	[abridged] metal-rich globular clusters provide important tracers of theformation of our galaxy. moreover, and not less important, they are veryimportant calibrators for the derivation of properties of extra-galacticmetal-rich stellar populations. nonetheless, only a few of the metal-richglobular clusters in the milky way have been studied using high-resolutionstellar spectra to derive elemental abundances. in this paper we presentelemental abundances for nine hb stars in the metal-rich globular clusterngc6352. the elemental abundances are based on high-resolution, highsignal-to-noise spectra obtained with vlt/uves. the elemental abundances havebeen derived using standard lte calculations. we find that ngc6352 has [fe/h]=-0.55, is enhanced in the alpha-elements to about +0.2 dex for ca, si, and tirelative to fe. for the iron-peak elements we find solar values. based on thespectroscopically derived stellar parameters we find that an e(b-v)=0.24 and(m-m) roughly equal to 14.05 better fits the data than the nominal values. aninvestigation of log(gf)-values for suitable fei lines lead us to theconclusion that the commonly used correction to the may et al.(1974) datashould not be employed. note: only the postscript reproduces the finding chartcorrectly.

0811.1777	the galactic stellar disc	the study of the milky way stellar discs in the context of galaxy formationis discussed. in particular we explore the properties of the milky way discusing a new sample of about 550 dwarf stars for which we have recently obtainedelemental abundances and ages based on high resolution spectroscopy. for allthe stars we also have full kinematic information as well as information abouttheir stellar orbits. we confirm results from previous studies that the thinand the thick disc have distinct abundance patterns. but we also explore alarger range of orbital parameters than what has been possible in our previousstudies. several new results are presented. we find that stars that reacheshigh above the galactic plane and have eccentric orbits show remarkably tightabundance trends. this implies that these stars formed out of well mixed gasthat had been homogenized over large volumes. we find some evidence that pointto that the event that most likely caused the heating of this stellarpopulation happened a few billion years ago. through a simple, kinematicexploration of stars with super-solar [fe/h] we show that the solarneighbourhood contains metal-rich, high velocity stars that very likely areassociated with the thick disc. additionally, the hr1614 moving group and thehercules and arcturus stellar streams are discussed and it is concluded that,probably, a large fraction of the so far identified groups and streams in thedisc are the result of evolution and interactions within the stellar discrather than being dissolved stellar clusters or engulfed dwarf galaxies.
