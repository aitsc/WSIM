0902.1983	cold dark matter substructure and galactic disks ii: dynamical effects  of hierarchical satellite accretion	(abridged) we perform dissipationless n-body simulations to elucidate thedynamical response of thin disks to bombardment by cold dark matter (cdm)substructure. our method combines (1) cosmological simulations of the formationof milky way (mw)-sized cdm halos to derive the properties of substructure and(2) controlled numerical experiments of consecutive subhalo impacts onto aninitially-thin, fully-formed mw type disk galaxy. the present study is thefirst to account for the evolution of satellite populations over cosmic time insuch an investigation of disk structure. we find that accretions of massivesubhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disksreside, since z~1 should be common. one host halo accretion history is used toinitialize the controlled simulations of satellite-disk encounters. we showthat these accretion events severely perturb the thin galactic disk and producea wealth of distinctive dynamical signatures on its structure and kinematics.these include (1) considerable thickening and heating at all radii, with thedisk thickness and velocity ellipsoid nearly doubling at the solar radius; (2)prominent flaring associated with an increase in disk thickness greater than afactor of 4 in the disk outskirts; (3) surface density excesses at large radii,beyond ~5 disk scale lengths, resembling those of observed antitruncated disks;(4) lopsidedness at levels similar to those measured in observational samplesof disk galaxies; and (5) substantial tilting. the interaction with the mostmassive subhalo drives the disk response while subsequent bombardment is muchless efficient at disturbing the disk. we conclude that substructure-diskencounters of the kind expected in the lcdm paradigm play a significant role insetting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution.

0903.4895	residual gas motions in the intracluster medium and bias in hydrostatic  measurements of mass profiles of clusters	we present analysis of bulk and random gas motions in the intracluster mediumusing high-resolution eulerian cosmological simulations of sixteen simulatedclusters, including both very relaxed and unrelaxed systems and spanning avirial mass range of 5*10^13 - 2*10^15 msun/h. we investigate effects of theresidual subsonic gas motions on the hydrostatic estimates of mass profiles andconcentrations of galaxy clusters. in agreement with previous studies we findthat the gas motions contribute up to ~ 5%-15% of the total pressure support inrelaxed clusters with contribution increasing with cluster-centric radius. thefractional pressure support is higher in unrelaxed systems. this contributionwould not be accounted for in hydrostatic estimates of the total mass profileand would lead to systematic underestimate of mass. we demonstrate that totalmass can be recovered accurately if pressure due to gas motions measured insimulations is explicitly taken into account in the equation of hydrostaticequilibrium. given that the underestimate of mass is increasing at largerradii, where gas is less relaxed and contribution of gas motions to pressure islarger, the total density profile derived from hydrostatic analysis is moreconcentrated than the true profile. this may at least partially explain somehigh values of concentrations of clusters estimated from hydrostatic analysisof x-ray data.

0905.2920	cosmological radiative transfer comparison project ii: the  radiation-hydrodynamic tests	the development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to followgas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution ofmany problems in numerical astrophysics. such fluid flows are highly complex,rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against whichnumerical codes can be tested. an alternative validation procedure is tocompare different methods against each other on common problems, in order toassess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for themethods. previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiativetransfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). this is thesecond paper of the cosmological radiative transfer (rt) comparison project, inwhich we compare 9 independent rt codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of anh ii region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (i-front) in a 1/r^2density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniformdense clump. results show a broad agreement between the different methods andno big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certainlevel of maturity and reliability. however, many details still do differ, andvirtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in onerespect or another, with the majority of the results. this underscores the factthat no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particularfeatures which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

0906.3295	dark matter substructure and dwarf galactic satellites	a decade ago cosmological simulations of increasingly higher resolution wereused to demonstrate that virialized regions of cold dark matter (cdm) halos arefilled with a multitude of dense, gravitationally-bound clumps. these darkmatter subhalos are central regions of halos that survived strong gravitationaltidal forces and dynamical friction during the hierarchical sequence of mergingand accretion via which the cdm halos form. comparisons with observationsrevealed that there is a glaring discrepancy between abundance of subhalos andluminous satellites of the milky way and andromeda as a function of theircircular velocity or bound mass within a fixed aperture. this largediscrepancy, which became known as the ``substructure'' or the ``missingsatellites'' problem, begs for an explanation. in this paper i review theprogress made during the last several years both in quantifying the problem andin exploring possible scenarios in which it could be accommodated and explainedin the context of galaxy formation in the framework of the cdm paradigm ofstructure formation. in particular, i show that the observed luminosityfunction, radial distribution, and the remarkable similarity of the innerdensity profiles of luminous satellites can be understood within hierarchicalcdm framework using a simple model in which efficiency of star formationmonotonically decreases with decreasing virial mass satellites had before theiraccretion without any actual sharp galaxy formation threshold.

0908.2133	effects of baryon dissipation on the dark matter virial scaling relation	we investigate effects of baryon dissipation on the dark matter virialscaling relation between total mass and velocity dispersion and the velocitybias of galaxies in groups and clusters using self-consistent cosmologicalsimulations. we show that the baryon dissipation increases the velocitydispersion of dark matter within the virial radius by 5% - 10%. the effect ismainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in innerregions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas coolingand star formation are more efficient. we also show that the galaxy velocitybias depends on how galaxies are selected. galaxies selected based on theirstellar mass exhibit no velocity bias, while galaxies selected based on theirtotal mass show positive bias of ~10%, consistent with previous results basedon collisionless dark matter- only simulations. we further find thatobservational estimates of galaxy velocity dispersion are unbiased with respectto the velocity dispersion of dark matter, provided galaxies are selected usingtheir stellar masses and and their velocity dispersions are computed with morethan twenty most massive galaxies. velocity dispersions estimated with fewergalaxies, on the other hand, can lead to significant underestimate of dynamicalmasses. results presented in this paper should be useful in interpretatinghigh-redshift groups and clusters as well as cosmological constraints derivedfrom upcoming optical cluster surveys.

0707.0879	escape of ionizing radiation from high redshift galaxies	we model the escape of ionizing radiation from high-redshift galaxies usinghigh-resolution adaptive mesh refinement n-body + hydrodynamics simulations.our simulations include time-dependent and spatially-resolved transfer ofionizing radiation in three dimensions, including effects of dust absorption.for galaxies of total mass m &gt; 10^11 msun and star formation rates sfr ~ 1-5msun/yr, we find angular averaged escape fractions of 0.01-0.03 over the entireredshift interval studied (3&lt;z&lt;9). in addition, we find that the escapefraction varies by more than an order of magnitude along differentlines-of-sight within individual galaxies, from the largest values neargalactic poles to the smallest along the galactic disk. the escape fractiondeclines steeply at lower masses and sfr. we show that the low values of escapefractions are due to a small fraction of young stars located just outside theedge of hi disk. we compare our predicted escape fraction of ionizing photonswith previous results, and find a general agreement with both other simulationresults and available direct detection measurements at z ~ 3. we also compareour simulations with a novel method to estimate the escape fraction in galaxiesfrom the observed distribution of neutral hydrogen column densities along thelines of sights to long duration gamma-ray bursts. using this method we findescape fractions of the grb host galaxies of 2-3%, consistent with ourtheoretical predictions.

0909.0513	computational eulerian hydrodynamics and galilean invariance	eulerian hydrodynamical simulations are a powerful and popular tool formodeling fluids in astrophysical systems. in this work, we critically examinerecent claims that these methods violate galilean invariance of the eulerequations. we demonstrate that eulerian hydrodynamics methods do converge to agalilean-invariant solution, provided a well-defined convergent solutionexists. specifically, we show that numerical diffusion, resulting fromdiffusion-like terms in the discretized hydrodynamical equations solved byeulerian methods, accounts for the effects previously identified as evidencefor the galilean non-invariance of these methods. these velocity-dependentdiffusive terms lead to different results for different bulk velocities whenthe spatial resolution of the simulation is kept fixed, but their effectbecomes negligible as the resolution of the simulation is increased to obtain aconverged solution. in particular, we find that kelvin-helmholtz instabilitiesdevelop properly in realistic eulerian calculations regardless of the bulkvelocity provided the problem is simulated with sufficient resolution (a factorof 2-4 increase compared to the case without bulk flows for realisticvelocities). our results reiterate that high-resolution eulerian methods canperform well and obtain a convergent solution, even in the presence of highlysupersonic bulk flows.

0912.3005	on the kennicutt-schmidt relation of low-metallicity high-redshift  galaxies	we present results of self-consistent, high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations of galaxy formation at z~3. the simulations employ recentlydeveloped recipe for star formation based on the local abundance of molecularhydrogen, which is tracked self-consistently during the course of simulation.the phenomenological h2 formation model accounts for the effects ofdissociating uv radiation of stars in each galaxy, as well as self-shieldingand shielding of h2 by dust, and therefore allows us to explore effects oflower metallicities and higher uv fluxes prevalent in high redshift galaxies ontheir star formation. we compare stellar masses, metallicities, and starformation rates of the simulated galaxies to available observations of thelyman break galaxies (lbgs) and find a reasonable agreement. we find that thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation exhibited by our simulated galaxies at z~3 issubstantially steeper and has a lower amplitude than the z=0 relation atsigma_gas &lt; 100 msun/pc^2. the predicted relation, however, is consistent withexisting observational constraints for the z~3 damped lyman $\alpha$ (dla) andlbgs. our tests show that the main reason for the difference from the local ksrelation is lower metallicity of the ism in high redshift galaxies. we discussseveral implications of the metallicity-dependence of the ks relation forgalaxy evolution and interpretation of observations.

1001.3162	the large scale bias of dark matter halos: numerical calibration and  model tests	we measure the clustering of dark matter halos in a large set ofcollisionless cosmological simulations of the flat lcdm cosmology. halos areidentified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the massaround isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is deltatimes the background. we calibrate fitting functions for the large scale biasthat are adaptable to any value of delta we examine. we find a ~6% scatterabout our best fit bias relation. our fitting functions couple to the halo massfunctions of tinker et. al. (2008) such that bias of all dark matter isnormalized to unity. we demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos ishigher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of sheth,mo, &amp; tormen (2001), and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapsemodel for the rarest halos. halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halosidentified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos withthe canonical delta=200 overdensity by ~10%. in contrast to our previousresults on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolvesvery weakly with redshift, if at all. we use our numerical results, both forthe mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background splitmodel for halo bias. we find that the peak-background split achieves areasonable agreement with the numerical results, but ~20% residuals remain,both at high and low masses.

1003.2270	shapes of gas, gravitational potential and dark matter in lambda-cdm  clusters	we present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas inclusters formed in cosmological simulations of the lambda-cdm cosmology andcompare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of theoverall isopotential surfaces. we find that in simulations with radiativecooling, star formation and stellar feedback (csf), intracluster gas outsidethe cluster core is more spherical compared to non-radiative (nr) simulations,while in the core the gas in the csf runs is more triaxial and has a distinctlyoblate shape. the latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settlesinto a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. the shape of the gasin the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gascooling. we find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential ratherwell outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. at smallerradii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. in the csfruns, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationallysupported. interestingly, we find that in nr simulations the difference betweengas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which makethe gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. finally,we use mock chandra x-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observedin three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity ofx-ray isophotes. contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clustersagainst observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling of theintracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.

1004.0003	environmental dependence of the kennicutt-schmidt relation in galaxies	we present a detailed description of a phenomenological h2 formation modeland local star formation prescription based on the density of molecular (ratherthan total) gas. such approach allows us to avoid the arbitrary density andtemperature thresholds typically used in star formation recipes. we presentresults of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-zgalaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratiosand interstellar far uv (fuv) fluxes. our results show that both theatomic-to-molecular transition on small, ~10 pc scales and thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on ~kpc scales are sensititive to thedust-to-gas ratio and the fuv flux. the atomic-to-molecular transition as afunction of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rathersharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/orincreasing fuv flux. consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gassurface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of theks relation at a given gas surface density, in less dusty and/or higher fuvflux environments. these trends should have a particularly strong effect on theevolution of low-mass, low surface brightness galaxies which typically have lowdust content and anemic star formation, but are also likely to be important forevolution of the milky way-sized systems. we parameterize the dependenciesobserved in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be usedto model the dependence of the ks relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and fuvflux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do notinclude radiative transfer and h2 formation.

1004.1342	the metal-enriched outer disk of ngc 2915	we present optical emission-line spectra for outlying hii regions in theextended neutral gas disk surrounding the blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc 2915.using a combination of strong-line r23 and direct oxygen abundancemeasurements, we report a flat, possibly increasing, metallicity gradient outto 1.2 times the holmberg radius. we find the outer-disk of ngc 2915 to beenriched to a metallicity of 0.4 z_solar. an analysis of the metal yields showsthat the outer disk of ngc 2915 is overabundant for its gas fraction, while thecentral star-foming core is similarly under-abundant for its gas fraction. starformation rates derived from very deep ~14 ks galex fuv exposures indicate thatthe low-level of star formation observed at large radii is not sufficient tohave produced the measured oxygen abundances at these galactocentric distances.we consider 3 plausible mechanisms that may explain the metal-enriched outergaseous disk of ngc 2915: radial redistribution of centrally generated metals,strong galactic winds with subsequent fallback, and galaxy accretion. ourresults have implications for the physical origin of the mass-metallicityrelation for gas-rich dwarf galaxies.

0708.1949	cold dark matter substructure and galactic disks i: morphological  signatures of hierarchical satellite accretion	(abridged) we conduct a series of high-resolution, dissipationless n-bodysimulations to investigate the cumulative effect of substructure mergers ontothin disk galaxies in the context of the lcdm paradigm of structure formation.our simulation campaign is based on a hybrid approach. substructure propertiesare culled directly from cosmological simulations of galaxy-sized cold darkmatter (cdm) halos. in contrast to what can be inferred from statistics of thepresent-day substructure populations, accretions of massive subhalos onto thecentral regions of host halos, where the galactic disk resides, since z~1should be common occurrences. one host halo merger history is subsequently usedto seed controlled numerical experiments of repeated satellite impacts on aninitially-thin milky way-type disk galaxy. we show that these accretion eventsproduce several distinctive observational signatures in the stellar diskincluding: a ring-like feature in the outskirts; a significant flare; a centralbar; and faint filamentary structures that (spuriously) resemble tidal streams.the final distribution of disk stars exhibits a complex vertical structure thatis well-described by a standard ``thin-thick'' disk decomposition. we concludethat satellite-disk encounters of the kind expected in lcdm models can inducemorphological features in galactic disks that are similar to those beingdiscovered in the milky way, m31, and in other disk galaxies. these resultshighlight the significant role of cdm substructure in setting the structure ofdisk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution. upcoming galactic structure surveysand astrometric satellites may be able to distinguish between competingcosmological models by testing whether the detailed structure of galactic disksis as excited as predicted by the cdm paradigm.

1011.1252	fuel efficient galaxies: sustaining star formation with stellar mass  loss	we examine the importance of secular stellar mass loss for fueling ongoingstar formation in disk galaxies during the late stages of their evolution. fora galaxy of a given stellar mass, we calculate the total mass loss rate of itsentire stellar population using star formation histories derived from theobserved evolution of the m*-star formation rate relation, along with thepredictions of standard stellar evolution models for stellar mass loss for avariety of initial stellar mass functions. our model shows that recycled gasfrom stellar mass loss can provide most or all of the fuel required to sustainthe current level of star formation in late type galaxies. stellar mass losscan therefore remove the tension between the low gas infall rates that arederived from observations and the relatively rapid star formation occurring indisk galaxies. for galaxies where cold gas infall rates have been estimated, wedemonstrate explicitly that stellar mass loss can account for most of thedeficit between their star formation and infall rates.

1011.1681	on the accuracy of weak lensing cluster mass reconstructions	we study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clustersresulting from fitting a spherically-symmetric navarro, frenk &amp; white model tothe reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak lensing observations. thereduced shear profiles are generated for ~10^4 cluster-sized halos formed in alcdm cosmological n-body simulation of a 1 gpc/h box. in agreement withprevious studies, we find that the scatter in the weak lensing masses derivedusing this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxialshapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projectionsalong the line-of-sight. additionally, we find that correlated large-scalestructure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, butnevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. the intrinsic scatter due tothese physical sources is ~20% for massive clusters, and can be as high as ~30%for group-sized systems. for current, ground-based observations, however, thetotal scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxiesused to measure the shear. importantly, we find that weak lensing massmeasurements can have a small, ~5%-10%, but non-negligible amount of bias.given that weak lensing measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way tocalibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmologicalconstraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the biasrequires detailed simulations which include more observational effects than weconsider here. such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for eachspecific weak lensing mass estimation method, as the details of the methoddetermine in part the expected scatter and bias. we present an iterative methodfor estimating mass m500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses ofground-based data.

1108.5384	the impact of baryon physics on the structure of high-redshift galaxies	we study the detailed structure of galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 2 usingcosmological simulations with improved modeling of the interstellar medium andstar formation. the simulations follow the formation and dissociation ofmolecular hydrogen, and include star formation only in cold molecular gas. themolecular gas is more concentrated towards the center of galaxies than theatomic gas, and as a consequence, the resulting stellar distribution is verycompact. for halos with total mass above 10^{11} mo, the median half-massradius of the stellar disks is 0.8 kpc at z = 3. the vertical structure of themolecular disk is much thinner than that of the atomic neutral gas. relative tothe non-radiative run, the inner regions of the dark matter halo change shapefrom prolate to mildly oblate and align with the stellar disk. however, we donot find evidence for a significant dark disk of dark matter around the stellardisk. the outer halo regions retain the orientation acquired during accretionand mergers, and are significantly misaligned with the inner regions. theradial profile of the dark matter halo contracts in response to baryondissipation, establishing an approximately isothermal profile throughout mostof the halo. this effect can be accurately described by a modified model ofhalo contraction. the angular momentum of a fixed amount of inner dark matteris approximately conserved over time, while in the dissipationless case most ofit is transferred outward during mergers. the conservation of the dark matterangular momentum provides supporting evidence for the validity of the halocontraction model in a hierarchical galaxy formation process.

1108.5731	ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as a test of early enrichment and  metallicity-dependent star formation	the tight relation of star formation with molecular gas indicated byobservations and assumed in recent models implies that the efficiency withwhich galaxies convert their gas into stars depends on gas metallicity. this isbecause the abundance of molecular hydrogen is sensitive to the abundance ofdust, which catalyzes the formation of h_2 and helps to shield it fromdissociating radiation. in this study we point out that in the absence ofsignificant pre-enrichment by population iii stars forming out of zerometallicity gas, such h_2-based star formation is expected to leave an imprintin the form of bi-modality in the metallicity distribution among dwarf galaxiesand in the metallicity distribution of stars within individual galaxies. thebi-modality arises because when gas metallicity (and dust abundance) is low,formation of molecular gas is inefficient, the gas consumption time scale islong, and star formation and metal enrichment proceed slowly. when metallicityreaches a critical threshold value star formation and enrichment accelerate,which leads to rapid increase in both stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies.we demonstrate this process both using a simple analytical model and fullcosmological simulations. in contrast, observed metallicity distributions ofdwarf galaxies or stars within them are not bi-modal. we argue that thisdiscrepancy points to substantial early stochastic pre-enrichment by populationiii stars to levels z ~ 0.01 z_sun in dense, star forming regions of earlygalaxies.

1108.5736	halo contraction effect in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation	the condensation of gas and stars in the inner regions of dark matter halosleads to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. while this effect isbased on simple gravitational physics, the question of its validity inhierarchical galaxy formation has led to an active debate in the literature. weuse a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarfgalaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift. the simulations arerun by different groups with different codes and include hierarchical merging,gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback. we show that in all ourcases the inner dark matter density increases relative to the matchingsimulation without baryon dissipation, at least by a factor of several. thestrength of the contraction effect varies from system to system and cannot bereduced to a simple prescription. we present a revised analytical model thatdescribes the contracted mass profile to an rms accuracy of about 10%. themodel can be used to effectively bracket the response of the dark matter haloto baryon dissipation. the halo contraction effect is real and must be includedin modeling of the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

1112.1732	the x-factor in galaxies: i. dependence on environment and scale	characterizing the conversion factor between co emission and column densityof molecular hydrogen, x_co, is crucial in studying the gaseous content ofgalaxies, its evolution, and relation to star formation. in most cases theconversion factor is assumed to be close to that of giant molecular clouds(gmcs) in the milky way, except possibly for mergers and star-burstinggalaxies. however, there are physical grounds to expect that it should alsodepend on the gas metallicity, surface density, and strength of theinterstellar radiation field. the xco factor may also depend on the scale onwhich co emission is averaged due to effects of limited resolution. we studythe dependence of x_co on gas properties and averaging scale using a model thatis based on a combination of results of sub-pc scale magneto-hydrodynamicsimulations and on the gas distribution from self-consistent cosmologicalsimulations of galaxy formation. our model predicts a value of x_co that isconsistent with the galactic value for interstellar medium conditions typicalfor the milky way. for such conditions the predicted x_co varies by only afactor of two for gas surfaced densities in the range \sim 50 - 500 m_sun /pc^2. however, the model also predicts that more generally on the scale ofgmcs, x_co is a strong function of metallicity, and depends on the columndensity and the interstellar uv flux. we show explicitly that neglecting thesedependencies in observational estimates can strongly bias the inferreddistribution of h2 column densities of molecular clouds to have a narrower andoffset range compared to the true distribution. we find that when averaged on\sim kpc scales the x-factor depends only weakly on radiation field and columndensity, but is still a strong function of metallicity. the predictedmetallicity dependence can be approximated as x_co \sim z^{-{\gamma}} with{\gamma} ~ 0.5 - 0.8.

1201.2168	constraining cluster physics with the shape of x-ray clusters:  comparison of local x-ray clusters versus lcdm clusters	simulations of cluster formation have demonstrated that condensation ofbaryons into central galaxies during cluster formation can drive the shape ofthe gas distribution in galaxy clusters significantly rounder, even at radii aslarge as half of the virial radius. however, such simulations generally predictstellar fractions within cluster virial radii that are ~2 to 3 times largerthan the stellar masses deduced from observations. in this work we compareellipticity profiles of clusters simulated with and without baryonic cooling tothe cluster ellipticity profiles derived from chandra and rosat observations inan effort to constrain the fraction of gas that cools and condenses into thecentral galaxies within clusters. we find that the observed ellipticityprofiles are fairly constant with radius, with an average ellipticity of 0.18+/- 0.05. the observed ellipticity profiles are in good agreement with thepredictions of non-radiative simulations. on the other hand, the ellipticityprofiles of the clusters in simulations that include radiative cooling, starformation, and supernova feedback (but no agn feedback) deviate significantlyfrom the observed ellipticity profiles at all radii. the simulations withcooling overpredict (underpredict) ellipticity in the inner (outer) regions ofgalaxy clusters. by comparing the simulations with and without cooling, we showthat the cooling of gas via cooling flows in the central regions of simulatedclusters causes the gas distribution to be more oblate in the central regions,but makes the outer gas distribution more spherical. we find that late-time gascooling and star formation are responsible for the significantly oblate gasdistributions in cluster cores, but the gas shapes outside of cluster cores areset primarily by baryon dissipation at high redshift z &gt; 2.

1201.3653	on the origin of the high column density turnover in the hi column  density distribution	we study the high column density regime of the hi column density distributionfunction and argue that there are two distinct features: a turnover at nhi ~10^21 cm^-2 which is present at both z=0 and z ~ 3, and a lack of systems abovenhi ~ 10^22 cm^-2 at z=0. using observations of the column densitydistribution, we argue that the hi-h2 transition does not cause the turnover atnhi ~ 10^21 cm^-2, but can plausibly explain the turnover at nhi &gt; 10^22 cm^-2.we compute the hi column density distribution of individual galaxies in thethings sample and show that the turnover column density depends only weakly onmetallicity. furthermore, we show that the column density distribution ofgalaxies, corrected for inclination, is insensitive to the resolution of the himap or to averaging in radial shells. our results indicate that the similarityof hi column density distributions at z=3 and z=0 is due to the similarity ofthe maximum hi surface densities of high-z and low-z disks, set presumably byuniversal processes that shape properties of the gaseous disks of galaxies.using fully cosmological simulations, we explore other candidate physicalmechanisms that could produce a turnover in the column density distribution. weshow that while turbulence within gmcs cannot affect the dla column densitydistribution, stellar feedback can affect it significantly if the feedback issufficiently effective in removing gas from the central 2-3 kpc ofhigh-redshift galaxies. finally, we argue that it is meaningful to comparecolumn densities averaged over ~ kpc scales with those estimated from quasarspectra which probe sub-pc scales due to the steep power spectrum of hi columndensity fluctuations observed in nearby galaxies.

1204.3910	the x-factor in galaxies: ii. the molecular hydrogen -- star formation  relation	there is ample observational evidence that the star formation rate (sfr)surface density, sigma_sfr, is closely correlated with the surface density ofmolecular hydrogen, sigma_h2. this empirical relation holds both forgalaxy-wide averages and for individual &gt;=kpc sized patches of the interstellarmedium (ism), but appears to degrade substantially at a sub-kpc scale.identifying the physical mechanisms that determine the scale-dependentproperties of the observed sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relation remains a challenge froma theoretical perspective. to address this question, we analyze the slope andscatter of the sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relation using a set of cosmological, galaxyformation simulations with a peak resolution of ~100 pc. these simulationsinclude a chemical network for molecular hydrogen, a model for the co emission,and a simple, stochastic prescription for star formation that operates on ~100pc scales. specifically, star formation is modeled as a poisson process inwhich the average sfr is directly proportional to the present mass of h2. thepredictions of our numerical model are in good agreement with the observedkennicutt-schmidt and sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relations. we show that observationsbased on co emission are ill suited to reliably measure the slope of the latterrelation at low (&lt;20 m_sun pc^-2) h2 surface densities on sub-kpc scales. ourmodels also predict that the inferred sigma_h2-sigma_sfr relation steepens athigh h2 surface densities as a result of the surface density dependence of theco/h2 conversion factor. finally, we show that on sub-kpc scales most of thescatter in the relation is a consequence of discreteness effects in the starformation process. in contrast, variations of the co/h2 conversion factor areresponsible for most of the scatter measured on super-kpc scales.

1210.4957	towards a complete accounting of energy and momentum from stellar  feedback in galaxy formation simulations	stellar feedback plays a key role in galaxy formation by regulating starformation, driving interstellar turbulence and generating galactic scaleoutflows. although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, "subgrid" scales.great care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for theeffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. we investigate the momentum andenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, andstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local starforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in moderncosmological zoom-in simulations. in particular, we present a novel subgridmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar windsfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of youngstar clusters. early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in starforming regions, hence limiting star formation. the reduced gas densitymitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernovaexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. thedetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementationand choice of parameters. somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementationsin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of globalstar formation efficiency. we compare simulation results using our feedbackimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermalfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formalgas cooling time. we find that simulations with maximal momentum injectionsuppress star formation to a similar degree as is found in simulations adoptingadiabatic thermal feedback.

1212.2980	the size - virial radius relation of galaxies	sizes of galaxies are an important diagnostic for galaxy formation models. inthis study i use the abundance matching ansatz, which has proven to besuccessful in reproducing galaxy clustering and other statistics, to deriveestimates of the virial radius, r200, for galaxies of different morphologicaltypes and wide range of stellar mass. i show that over eight of orders ofmagnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow anapproximately linear relation between 3d half-mass radius of their stellardistribution, rhalf and virial radius, rhalf~0.015r200 with a scatter of ~0.2dex. such scaling is in remarkable agreement with expectation of models whichassume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, which impliesrhalf\propto lambda r200, where lambda is the spin of galaxy parent halo. thescatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from thedistribution of $\lambda$ and normalization of the relation agrees with thatpredicted by the model of mo, mao &amp; white (1998), if galaxy sizes were set onaverage at z~1-2. moreover, i show that when stellar and gas surface densityprofiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled using radiusr_n= 0.015 r200, the rescaled surface density profiles follow approximatelyuniversal exponential (for late types) and de vaucouleurs (for early types)profiles with scatter of only 30-50% at r~1-3r_n. remarkably, both late andearly type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles atr&gt;r_n. the main difference between their stellar distributions is thus atr&lt;r_n. the results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radialdistribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent haloand that sizes of both late type disks and early type spheroids are controlledby halo angular momentum.

1301.2605	satellites in mw-like hosts: environment dependence and close pairs	previous studies showed that an estimate of the likelihood distribution ofthe milky way halo mass can be derived using the properties of the satellitessimilar to the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc). however, itwould be straightforward to interpret such an estimate only if the propertiesof the magellanic clouds (mcs) are fairly typical and are not biased by theenvironment. in this study we explore whether the environment of the milky wayaffects the properties of the smc and lmc such as their velocities. to test forthe effect of the environment, we compare velocity distributions for mc-sizedsubhalos around milky way hosts in a sample selected simply by mass and in thesecond sample of such halos selected with additional restrictions on thedistance to the nearest cluster and the local galaxy density, designed to mimicthe environment of the local group (lg). we find that satellites in halos inthe lg-like environments do have somewhat larger velocities, as compared to thehalos of similar mass in the sample without environmental constraints. wederive the host halo likelihood distribution for the samples in the lg-likeenvirionment and in the control sample and find that the environment does notsignificantly affect the derived likelihood. we use the updated properties ofthe smc and lmc to derive the constraint on the mw halo mass $\log{({\rmm}_{200} /\msol)}=12.06^{+0.31}_{-0.19}$ (90% confidence interval). we alsoexplore the incidence of close pairs with relative velocities and separationssimilar to those of the lmc and smc and find that such pairs are quite rareamong $\lambda$cdm halos. taking into account the close separation of the mcsin the busha et al.\ 2011 method results in the shift of the mw halo massestimate to smaller masses, with the peak shifting approximately by a factor oftwo.[abridged]

1305.5471	modelling mass distribution in elliptical galaxies: mass profiles and  their correlation with velocity dispersion profiles	we assemble a statistical set of global mass models for ~2,000 nearlyspherical sdss galaxies at a mean redshift of 0.12 based on their aperturevelocity dispersions and newly derived luminosity profiles in conjunction withpublished velocity dispersion profiles and empirical properties and relationsof galaxy and halo parameters. when two-component (i.e. stellar plus dark) massmodels are fitted to the sdss aperture velocity dispersions, the predictedvelocity dispersion profile (vp) slopes within the effective radius r_eff matchwell the distribution in observed elliptical galaxies. in contrast, thesingle-component models cannot reproduce the vp slope distribution. from anumber of input variations the models exhibit for the radial range 0.1 r_eff &lt;r &lt; r_eff a tight correlation &lt;gamma_e&gt;=(1.865+/-0.008)+(-4.93+/-0.15)&lt;eta&gt;where &lt;gamma_e&gt; is the mean slope absolute value of the total mass density and&lt;eta&gt; is the mean slope of the velocity dispersion profile, which leads to asuper-isothermal &lt;gamma_e&gt; = 2.15+/-0.04 for &lt;eta&gt;=-0.058+/-0.008 in observedelliptical galaxies. furthermore, the successful two-component models appear toimply a typical slope curvature pattern in the total mass profile because forthe observed steep luminosity (stellar mass) profile and the weak lensinginferred halo profile at large radii a total mass profile with monotonicallyvarying slope would require too high dm density in the optical region givingrise to too large aperture velocity dispersion and too shallow vp.

1306.3165	on the evolution of cluster scaling relations	understanding the evolution of scaling relations between the observableproperties of clusters and their total mass is key to realizing their potentialas cosmological probes. in this study, we investigate whether the evolution ofcluster scaling relations is affected by the spurious evolution of mass causedby the evolving reference density with respect to which halo masses are defined(pseudo-evolution). we use the relation between mass, m, and velocitydispersion, sigma, as a test case, and show that the deviation from the m-sigmarelation of cluster-sized halos caused by pseudo-evolution is smaller than 10%for a wide range of mass definitions. the reason for this small impact is atight relation between the velocity dispersion and mass profiles, sigma(&lt;r) =const * (gm(&lt;r) / r)^1/2, which holds across a wide range of radii. we showthat such a relation is generically expected for a variety of density profiles,as long as halos are in approximate jeans equilibrium. thus, as the outer"virial" radius used to define the halo mass, r, increases due topseudo-evolution, halos approximately preserve their m-sigma relation. thisresult highlights the fact that tight scaling relations are the result of tightequilibrium relations between radial profiles of physical quantities. we findexceptions at very small and very large radii, where the profiles deviate fromthe relations they exhibit at intermediate radii. we discuss the implicationsof these results for other cluster scaling relations, and argue thatpseudo-evolution should have a small effect on most scaling relations, exceptfor those that involve the stellar masses of galaxies. in particular, we showthat the relation between stellar-mass fraction and total mass is affected bypseudo-evolution and is largely shaped by it for halo masses of less than 10^14solar masses.

1308.4974	simulations of disk galaxies with cosmic ray driven galactic winds	we present results from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of isolatedsmc- and milky way-sized galaxies that include a model for feedback fromgalactic cosmic rays (crs). we find that crs are naturally able to drive windswith mass loading factors of up to ~10 in dwarf systems. the scaling of themass loading factor with circular velocity between the two simulated systems isconsistent with \propto v_c^{1-2} required to reproduce the faint end of thegalaxy luminosity function. in addition, simulations with cr feedback reproduceboth the normalization and the slope of the observed trend of wind velocitywith galaxy circular velocity. we find that winds in simulations with crfeedback exhibit qualitatively different properties compared to sn drivenwinds, where most of the acceleration happens violently in situ near starforming sites. in contrast, the cr-driven winds are accelerated gently by thelarge-scale pressure gradient established by crs diffusing from thestar-forming galaxy disk out into the halo. the cr-driven winds also exhibitmuch cooler temperatures and, in the smc-sized system, warm (t~10^4 k) gasdominates the outflow. the prevalence of warm gas in such outflows may providea clue as to the origin of ubiquitous warm gas in the gaseous halos of galaxiesdetected via absorption lines in quasar spectra.

1312.2587	on the mass of the local group	we use recent proper motion measurements of the tangential velocity of m31,along with its radial velocity and distance, to derive the likelihood of thesum of halo masses of the milky way and m31. this is done using a sample halopairs in the bolshoi cosmological simulation of $\lambda$cdm cosmology selectedto match properties and environment of the local group. the resultinglikelihood gives estimate of the sum of masses of $m_{\rm mw,200}+m_{\rmm31,200}=$ $2.40_{-1.05}^{+1.95}\times10^{12}\,m_{\odot}$ ($90\%$ confidenceinterval). this estimate is consistent with individual mass estimates for themilky way and m31 and is consistent, albeit somewhat on the low side, with themass estimated using the timing argument. we show that although the timingargument is unbiased on average for all pairs, for pairs constrained to haveradial and tangential velocities similar to that of the local group theargument overestimates the sum of masses by a factor of $1.6$. using similartechnique we estimate the total dark matter mass enclosed within $1$ mpc fromthe local group barycenter to be $m_{\rm lg}(r&lt;1\, {\rmmpc})=4.2_{-2.0}^{+3.4}\times10^{12}\,m_{\odot}$ ($90\%$ confidence interval).

1401.1216	dependence of the outer density profiles of halos on their mass  accretion rate	we present a systematic study of the density profiles of lcdm halos, focusingon the outer regions, 0.1 &lt; r/rvir &lt; 9. we show that the median and meanprofiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviationsfrom the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature,such as the navarro-frenk-white and einasto profiles, at radii r &gt; 0.5 r200m.in particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median densityprofiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply thanpredicted. the steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r ~ r200m, and itsabsolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate,reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. importantly, we find that the outermostdensity profiles at r &gt; r200m are remarkably self-similar when radii arerescaled by r200m. this self-similarity indicates that radii defined withrespect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure andevolution of the outer profiles. however, the inner density profiles are mostself-similar when radii are rescaled by r200c. we propose a new fitting formulathat describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by theirpeak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy &lt; 10% at all radii, redshiftsand masses we studied, r &lt; 9 rvir, 0 &lt; z &lt; 6 and mvir &gt; 1.7e10 msun/h. wediscuss observational signatures of the profile features described above, andshow that the steepening of the outer profile should be detectable in futureweak-lensing analyses of massive clusters. such observations could be used toestimate the mass accretion rate of cluster halos.

1404.2613	on the interplay between star formation and feedback in galaxy formation  simulations	we investigate the star formation-feedback cycle in cosmological galaxyformation simulations, focusing on progenitors of milky way (mw)-sizedgalaxies. we find that in order to reproduce key properties of the mwprogenitors, such as semi-empirically derived star formation histories and theshape of rotation curves, our implementation of star formation and stellarfeedback requires 1) a combination of local early momentum feedback viaradiation pressure and stellar winds and subsequent efficient supernovaefeedback, and 2) efficacy of feedback that results in self-regulation of theglobal star formation rate on kiloparsec scales. we show that suchfeedback-driven self-regulation is achieved globally for a local star formationefficiency per free fall time of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\approx 10\%$. although thisvalue is larger that the $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\sim 1\%$ value usually inferredfrom the kennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation, we show that it is consistent withdirect observational estimates of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ in molecular clouds.moreover, we show that simulations with local efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rmff}\approx 10\%$ reproduce the global observed ks relation. such simulationsalso reproduce the cosmic star formation history of the milky way sizedgalaxies and satisfy a number of other observational constraints. conversely,we find that simulations that a priori assume an inefficient mode of starformation, instead of achieving it via stellar feedback regulation, fail toproduce sufficiently vigorous outflows and do not reproduce observations. thisillustrates the importance of understanding the complex interplay between starformation and feedback and the detailed processes that contribute to thefeedback-regulated formation of galaxies.

1407.4730	a universal model for halo concentrations	we present a numerical study of dark matter halo concentrations in$\lambda$cdm and self-similar cosmologies. we show that the relation betweenconcentration, $c$, and peak height, $\nu$, exhibits the smallest deviationsfrom universality if halo masses are defined with respect to the criticaldensity of the universe. these deviations can be explained by the residualdependence of concentration on the local slope of the matter power spectrum,$n$, which affects both the normalization and shape of the $c$-$\nu$ relation.in particular, there is no well-defined floor in the concentration values.instead, the minimum concentration depends on redshift: at fixed $\nu$, halosat higher $z$ experience steeper slopes $n$, and thus have lower minimumconcentrations. we show that the concentrations in our simulations can beaccurately described by a universal seven-parameter function of only $\nu$ and$n$. this model matches our $\lambda$cdm results to $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy upto $z = 6$, and matches scale-free $\omega_{\rm m} = 1$ models to $\lesssim15\%$. the model also reproduces the low concentration values of earth--masshalos at $z \approx 30$, and thus correctly extrapolates over $16$ orders ofmagnitude in halo mass. the predictions of our model differ significantly fromall models previously proposed in the literature at high masses and redshifts.our model is in excellent agreement with recent lensing measurements of clusterconcentrations.

1509.00853	the impact of stellar feedback on the structure, size and morphology of  galaxies in milky way size dark matter haloes	we use cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation in a milky way(mw)-sized halo started from identical initial conditions to investigate theevolution of galaxy sizes, baryon fractions, morphologies and angular momentain runs with different parameters of the star formation--feedback cycle. ourfiducial model with a high local star formation efficiency, which results inefficient feedback, produces a realistic late-type galaxy that matches theevolution of basic properties of late-type galaxies: stellar mass, disk size,morphology dominated by a kinematically cold disk, stellar and gas surfacedensity profiles, and specific angular momentum. we argue that feedback's rolein this success is twofold: (1) removal of low-angular momentum gas and (2)maintaining a low disk-to-halo mass fraction which suppresses diskinstabilities that lead to angular momentum redistribution and a centralconcentration of baryons. however, our model with a low local star formationefficiency, but large energy input per supernova, chosen to produce a galaxywith a similar star formation history as our fiducial model, leads to a highlyirregular galaxy with no kinematically cold component, overly extended stellardistribution and low angular momentum. this indicates that only when feedbackis allowed to become vigorous via locally efficient star formation in densecold gas, resulting galaxy sizes, gas/stellar surface density profiles andstellar disk angular momenta agree with observed $z=0$ galaxies.

astro-ph;0002214	reionization and the abundance of galactic satellites	one of the main challenges facing standard hierarchical structure formationmodels is that the predicted abundance of galactic subhalos with circularvelocities of 10-30 km/s is an order of magnitude higher than the number ofsatellites actually observed within the local group. using a simple model forthe formation and evolution of dark halos, based on the extendedpress-schechter formalism and tested against n-body results, we show that thetheoretical predictions can be reconciled with observations if gas accretion inlow-mass halos is suppressed after the epoch of reionization. in this picture,the observed dwarf satellites correspond to the small fraction of halos thataccreted substantial amounts of gas before reionization. the photoionizationmechanism naturally explains why the discrepancy between predicted halos andobserved satellites sets in at about 30 km/s, and for reasonable choices of thereionization redshift (z_re = 5-12) the model can reproduce both the amplitudeand shape of the observed velocity function of galactic satellites. if thisexplanation is correct, then typical bright galaxy halos contain many low-massdark matter subhalos. these might be detectable through their gravitationallensing effects, through their influence on stellar disks, or as dwarfsatellites with very high mass-to-light ratios. this model also predicts adiffuse stellar component produced by large numbers of tidally disrupteddwarfs, perhaps sufficient to account for most of the milky way's stellar halo.

astro-ph;0005323	velocity and mass functions of galactic halos: evolution and  environmental dependence	we study the distribution functions of mass and circular velocity for darkmatter halos in n-body simulations of the $\lambda$cdm cosmology, addressingredshift and environmental dependence. the dynamical range enables us toresolve subhalos and distinguish them from "distinct" halos. the mass functionis compared to analytic models, and is used to derive the more observationallyrelevant circular velocity function. the distribution functions in the velocityrange 100--500 km/s are well fit by a power-law with two parameters, slope andamplitude. we present the parameter dependence on redshift and provide usefulfitting formulae. the amplitudes of the mass functions decrease with z, but,contrary to naive expectation, the comoving density of halos of a fixedvelocity ~200 km/s actually increases out to z=5. this is because high-z halosare denser, so a fixed velocity corresponds to a smaller mass. the slope of thevelocity function at z=0 is as steep as ~ -4, and the mass and velocityfunctions of distinct halos steepen with increasing z, while the functions ofsubhalos do not steepen with $z$, and become even flatter at z&gt;2. a simpleobservable prediction is that the slope of the velocity function of isolatedgalaxies is steeper than that of galaxies in groups by as much as unity,reflecting the density biasing of high-velocity halos. we confirm that thepress-schechter approximation typically overestimates the halo mass function bya factor of ~2, while modified approximations provide improved predictions.

astro-ph;0006343	resolving the structure of cold dark matter halos ii	we study the effects of mass and force resolution on the density profiles ofgalaxy-size cold dark matter (cdm) halos in a flat, low-density cosmologicalmodel with vacuum energy. we show thatalthough increasing the mass and forceresolution allows us to probe deeper into the inner halo regions, it does notlead to steeper inner density profiles. instead, the halo profiles converge atscales larger than four times the formal resolution or the radius containingmore than 200 particles, whichever is larger. in the simulations presented inthis paper, we are able to probe density profile of a relaxed isolatedgalaxy-size halo at scales r=(0.005-1)r_vir. we find that the densitydistribution can be well approximated by the profile suggested by moore etal(1998): rho= x^{-1.5}(1+x^{1.5})^-1, where x=r/r_s and r_s is thecharacteristic radius. the analytical profile proposed by navarro et al. (1996)rho= x^{-1}(1+x)^-2, also provides a good fit, with the same relative errors ofabout 10% for radii larger than 1% of the virial radius. both analyticalprofiles fit equally well because for high-concentration galaxy-size halos thedifferences between these profiles become significant only at scales well below0.01r_vir. we also find that halos of similar mass may have somewhat differentparameters (characteristic radius, maximum rotation velocity, etc.) and shapesof their density profiles. we associate this scatter in properties withdifferences in halo merger histories and the amount of substructure present inthe analyzed halos.

astro-ph;0007295	hierarchical galaxy formation and substructure in the galaxy's stellar  halo	we develop an explicit model for the formation of the stellar halo fromtidally disrupted, accreted dwarf satellites in the cold dark matter (cdm)framework, focusing on predictions testable with the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and other wide-field surveys. subhalo accretion and orbital evolutionare calculated using a semi-analytic approach within the press-schechterformalism. motivated by our previous work, we assume that low-mass subhalos (v&lt; 30 km/s) can form significant populations of stars only if they accreted asubstantial fraction of their mass before the epoch of reionization. with thisassumption, the model reproduces the observed velocity function of galacticsatellites in the local group, solving the ``dwarf satellite problem'' withoutmodifying the popular lcdm cosmology. the disrupted satellites yield a stellardistribution with a total mass and radial density profile consistent with thoseobserved for the milky way stellar halo. most significantly, the model predictsthe presence of many large-scale, coherent substructures in the outer halo.these substructures are remnants of individual, tidally disrupted dwarfsatellite galaxies. substructure is more pronounced at large galactocentricradii because of the smaller number density of tidal streams and the longerorbital times. this model provides a natural explanation for the coherentstructures in the outer stellar halo found in the sdss commissioning data, andit predicts that many more such structures should be found as the survey coversmore of the sky. the detection (or non-detection) and characterization of suchstructures could eventually test variants of the cdm scenario, especially thosethat aim to solve the dwarf satellite problem by enhancing satellitedisruption.

astro-ph;0010222	interaction rates of dark-matter halos and subhalos	[abridged] the interaction rates of dark-matter halos and subhalos, arecomputed using high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations of thelambda-cdm model. although the number fraction of subhalos of mass$&gt;2x10^{11}\hsolmass$ is only ~10%, we find that the interaction rate of suchsubhalos is relatively high because they reside in high density environments.at low redshift, the subhalo collisions dominate the total collision rate, andeven at z=3 they are involved in more than 30% of all collisions. about 40% ofthe "major" mergers are between subhalos. therefore subhalo interactions mustbe incorporated in models of structure formation. we find that the collisionrate between halos in physical density units, is $\propto (1+z)^\delta $, with$\delta = 3-4$, in agreement with earlier simulations and most observationaldata. we test previous analytic estimates of the interaction rates of subhalosbased on statistical models, which could be very inaccurate because of thesmall number of subhalos and the variation of conditions within small hosthalos. we find that, while such statistical estimates may severely overestimatethe rate within hosts $&lt; 10^{13} \hsolmass$, typical of high redshifts, theyare valid for larger hosts regardless of the number of subhalos in them. wefind the makino &amp; hut (1997) estimate of the subhalo merger rate to be validfor hosts $ &gt; 6x10^{11}\hsolmass$ at all redshifts. the collision rate betweensubhalos and the central object of their host halo is approximated relativelywell using the timescale for dynamical friction in circular orbits. thisapproximation fails in ~40% of the cases, partly because of deviations from theassumption of circular orbits and partly because of the invalidity of theassumption that the subhalo mass is negligible.

astro-ph;0011001	a universal angular momentum profile for galactic halos	[abridged] we study the angular-momentum profiles of a statistical sample ofhalos drawn from a high-resolution n-body simulation of the lcdm cosmology. wefind that the cumulative mass distribution of specific angular momentum, j, ina halo of mass mv is well fit by a universal function, m(&lt;j) = mv \muj/(j_0+j). this profile is defined by one shape parameter (\mu or j_0) inaddition to the global spin parameter \lambda. it follows a power-law over mostof the mass, and flattens at large j, with the flattening more pronounced forsmall values of \mu. compared to a uniform sphere in solid-body rotation, mosthalos have a higher fraction of their mass in the low- and high-j tails of thedistribution. the spatial distribution of angular momentum in halos tends to becylindrical and is well-aligned within each halo for ~80% of the halos. weinvestigate two ideas for the origin of this profile. the first is based on arevised version of linear tidal-torque theory combined with extendedpress-schechter mass accretion, and the second focuses on j transport in minormergers. finally, we briefly explore implications of the m(&lt;j) profile on theformation of galactic disks assuming that j is conserved during an adiabaticbaryonic infall. the implied gas density profile deviates from an exponentialdisk, with a higher density at small radii and a tail extending to large radii.the steep central density profiles may imply disk scale lengths that aresmaller than observed. this is reminiscent of the "angular-momentum problem"seen in hydrodynamic simulations, even though we have assumed perfect jconservation. a possible solution is to associate the central excesses withbulge components and the outer regions with extended gaseous disks.

astro-ph;0108151	concentrations of dark halos from their assembly histories	(abridged) we study the relation between the density profiles of dark matterhalos and their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos ina high-resolution n-body simulation of the lcdm cosmology. for each halo atz=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentrationparameters c_vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger treefor each halo. we fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function withone parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretionrate dlogm/dloga falls below a critical value s. we find that late forminggalaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at anyepoch a_o is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1*a_o/a_c. scatter aboutthis relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_v and a_c, implying thatthe actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributedto scatter in a_c. we demonstrate that this relation can also be used topredict the mass and redshift dependence of c_v, and the scatter about themedian c_vir(m,z), using accretion histories derived from the extendedpress-schechter (eps) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset betweenthe formation times as predicted by eps and as measured in the simulations;thisnew ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation. the correlation found between halo concentration and massaccretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall ratesthe central density is related to the background density; when the mass infallrate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the haloconcentration just grows as r_vir. the tight correlation demonstrated hereprovides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.

astro-ph;0109432	angular momentum profiles of warm dark matter halos	we compare the specific angular momentum profiles of virialized dark halos incold dark matter (cdm) and warm dark matter (wdm) models using high-resolutiondissipationless simulations. the simulations were initialized using the sameset of modes, except on small scales, where the power was suppressed in wdmbelow the filtering length. remarkably, wdm as well as cdm halos arewell-described by the two-parameter angular momentum profile of bullock et al.(2001), even though the halo masses are below the filtering scale of the wdm.although the best-fit shape parameters change quantitatively for individualhalos in the two simulations, we find no systematic variation in profile shapesas a function of the dark matter type. the scatter in shape parameters issignificantly smaller for the wdm halos, suggesting that substructure and/ormerging history plays a role producing scatter about the mean angular momentumdistribution, but that the average angular momentum profiles of halos originatefrom larger-scale phenomena or a mechanism associated with the virializationprocess. the known mismatch between the angular momentum distributions of darkhalos and disk galaxies is therefore present in wdm as well as cdm models. ourwdm halos tend to have a less coherent (more misaligned) angular momentumstructure and smaller spin parameters than do their cdm counterparts, althoughwe caution that this result is based on a small number of halos.

astro-ph;0203169	sample variance considerations for cluster surveys	we present a general statistical framework for describing the effect ofsample variance in the number counts of virialized objects and examine itseffect on cosmological parameter estimation. specifically, we consider effectsof sample variance on the power spectrum normalization and properties of darkenergy extracted from current and future local and high-redshift samples ofclusters. we show that for future surveys that probe ever lower cluster massesand temperatures, sample variance is generally comparable to or greater thanshot noise and thus cannot be neglected in deriving precision cosmologicalconstraints. for example, sample variance is usually more important than shotvariance in constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy from z &lt; 1clusters. although we found that effects of sample variance on thesigma_8-omega_m constraints from the current flux and temperature limited x-raysurveys are not significant, they may be important for future studies utilizingthe shape of the temperature function to break the sigma_8-omega_m degeneracy.we also present numerical tests clarifying the definition of cluster massemployed in cosmological modelling and accurate fitting formula for theconversion between different definitions of halo mass (e.g., virial vs. fixedoverdensity).

astro-ph;0206469	cold fronts in cdm clusters	recently, high-resolution chandra observations revealed the existence of verysharp features in the x-ray surface brightness and temperature maps of severalclusters (vikhlinin et. al., 2001). these features, called ``cold fronts'', arecharacterized by an increase in surface brightness by a factor &gt;2 over 10-50kpc, accompanied by a drop in temperature of a similar magnitude. the existenceof such sharp gradients can be used to put interesting constraints on thephysics of the intracluster medium (icm), if their mechanism and longevity arewell understood. here, we present results of a search for cold fronts inhigh-resolution simulations of galaxy clusters in cold dark matter (cdm)models. we show that sharp gradients with properties similar to those ofobserved cold fronts naturally arise in cluster mergers when the shocks heatgas surrounding the merging sub-cluster, while its dense core remainsrelatively cold. the compression induced by supersonic motions and shockheating during the merger enhance the amplitude of gas density and temperaturegradients across the front. our results indicate that cold fronts arenon-equilibrium transient phenomena and can be observed for a period of lessthan a billion years. we show that the velocity and density fields of gassurrounding the cold front can be very irregular which would complicateanalyses aiming to put constraints on the physical conditions of theintracluster medium in the vicinity of the front.

astro-ph;0208308	effect of internal flows on sunyaev-zeldovich measurements of cluster  peculiar velocities	galaxy clusters are potentially powerful probes of the large-scale velocityfield in the universe because their peculiar velocity can be estimated directlyvia the kinematic sunyaev-zeldovich effect (ksz). using high-resolutioncosmological simulations of an evolving cluster of galaxies, we evaluate howwell the average velocity obtained via a ksz measurement reflects the actualcluster peculiar velocity. we find that the internal velocities in theintracluster gas are comparable to the overall cluster peculiar velocity, 20 to30% of the sound speed even when a cluster is relatively relaxed. nevertheless,the velocity averaged over the ksz map inside a circular aperture matched tothe cluster virial region provides an unbiased estimate of a cluster's radialpeculiar velocity with a dispersion of 50 to 100 km/s, depending on the line ofsight and dynamical state of the cluster. this dispersion puts a lower limit onthe accuracy with which cluster peculiar velocity can be measured. although thedispersion of the average is relatively small, the velocity distribution isbroad; regions of low signal must be treated with care to avoid bias. wediscuss the extent to which systematic errors might be modelled, and theresulting limitations on using galaxy clusters as cosmological velocitytracers.

astro-ph;0302005	lensing optical depth for substructure and isolated dark matter halos	multiply-imaged quasar lenses can be used to constrain the substructure massfraction in galaxy-sized dark matter halos via anomalous flux ratios in lensedimages. the flux ratios, however, can be affected by both the substructure inthe lens halo and by isolated small-mass halos along the entire line-of-sightto the lensed source. while lensing by dark matter clumps near the lens galaxyis more efficient than elsewhere, the cumulative effect of all objects alongthe line-of-sight could be significant. here we estimate the potentialcontribution of isolated clumps to the substructure lensing signal using asimple model motivated by cosmological simulations. we find that thecontribution of isolated clumps to the total lensing optical depth ranges froma few to tens percent, depending on assumptions and the particularconfiguration of the lens. therefore, although the contribution of isolatedclumps to the lensing signal is not dominant, it should not be neglected indetailed analyses of substructure lensing. for the currently favored lambda-cdmmodel, the total calculated optical depth for lensing is high, tau ~ 0.2-20 andcould, therefore, naturally explain the high frequency of anomalous flux ratiosin observed lenses. the prediction, however, is highly sensitive to the spatialdistribution of substructure halos in the innermost regions of the lens halo,which is still very uncertain. therefore, constraints on the properties of thesubstructure population or accurate cosmological constraints, such as the massof the warm dark matter particle, are difficult if not impossible to derive atthis point.

astro-ph;0303240	on the origin of the global schmidt law of star formation	one of the most puzzling properties of observed galaxies is the universalityof the empirical correlation between the star formation rate and average gassurface density on kiloparsec scales (the schmidt law). in this study i presentresults of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxyformation that reproduce the schmidt law naturally, without assuming it, andprovide some clues to this puzzle. the simulations incorporate the mainphysical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have adynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions. theresults indicate that the global schmidt law is a manifestation of the overalldensity distribution of the interstellar medium (ism). in particular, thedensity probability distribution function (pdf) in the simulated disks issimilar to that observed in recent state-of-the-art modeling of the turbulentism and has a well-defined generic shape. the shape of the pdf in a givenregion of the disk depends on the local average surface density sigma_g. thedependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail ofthe distribution scales as sigma_g^{n-1} with n~1.4, which gives rise to theschmidt-like correlation. the high-density tail of the pdf is remarkablyinsensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heatingprocesses. this indicates that the global star formation rate is determined bythe supersonic turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities on largescales, rather than stellar feedback or thermal instabilities on small scales.

astro-ph;0305199	formation of globular clusters in hierarchical cosmology	we study the formation of globular clusters (gcs) in a milky way-size galaxyusing a high-resolution cosmological simulation. the clusters in our model formin the dense cores of supergiant molecular clouds in the gaseous disks ofhigh-redshift galaxies. the properties of clusters are estimated using aphysically-motivated subgrid model of the isothermal cloud collapse. the firstclusters in the simulation form at z ~ 12, while we conjecture that the bestconditions for gc formation appear to be at z ~ 3-5. most clusters form in theprogenitor galaxies of the virial mass &gt;10^9 msun and the total mass of thecluster population is strongly correlated with the mass of its host galaxy witha fraction ~2x10^-4 of the galactic baryons being in the form of gcs. inaddition, the mass of the gc population and the maximum cluster mass in a givenregion strongly correlate with the local average star formation rate. we findthat the mass, size, and metallicity distributions of the cluster populationidentified in the simulation are remarkably similar to the correspondingdistributions of the milky way globulars. we find no clear mass-metallicity orage-metallicity correlations for the old clusters. the zero-age cluster massfunction can be approximated by a power-law, dn/dm ~ m^-alpha, with alpha ~ 2,in agreement with the mass function of young stellar clusters in starburstinggalaxies. however, the shape of the zero-age mass function may be betterdescribed by the high-mass tail of a lognormal distribution which peaks at~10^3 msun. we discuss in detail the origin, universality, and dynamicalevolution of the globular cluster mass function. our results indicate thatglobular clusters with properties similar to those of observed clusters canform naturally within young dense gaseous disks at z &gt;~ 3 in the lcdmcosmology.

astro-ph;0404350	simulating the formation of galaxy clusters	we study the effects of radiative cooling, star formation and stellarfeedback on the properties and evolution of galaxy clusters usinghigh-resolution adaptive mesh refinement n-body+gasdynamics simulations ofclusters forming in the lcdm universe. cooling leads to the condensation of gasin the inner regions of clusters, which in turn leads to steepening of the darkmatter profile. the cooling gas is replaced by the higher-entropy gas from theouter regions, which raises the entropy and temperature of gas in the clustercore. the magnitude of these effects is likely overestimated in the currentsimulations because they suffer from the overcooling problem: a much largerfraction of baryons is in the form of cold gas and stars than is observed. wefind that the thermal stellar feedback alone does not remedy this problem.additional ad-hoc preheating can lower the amount of cold gas but a simpleuniform preheating results in incorrect star formation history, as it delaysthe bulk of star formation until z&lt;1. our analysis shows that the overcoolingin a cluster as a whole is really the overcooling in the central galaxy and itsprogenitors at high redshifts. this indicates that an additional heatingmechanism that can continuously heat the gas in the cluster core is required toreproduce the observed cluster properties. energy injection by the activegalactic nuclei, which may provide such heating, may thus be an importantmissing ingredient in the current theoretical models of cluster formation.

astro-ph;0405189	the effect of gas cooling on the shapes of dark matter halos	we analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter (dm) halosusing high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters andgalaxies in the lcdm cosmology. we find that halos formed in simulations withgas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed inadiabatic simulations. gas cooling results in an average increase of theprinciple axis ratios of halos by ~ 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. thesystematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to thevirial radius. we argue that the differences in simulations with and withoutcooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools andcondenses toward the center, and during major mergers. we perform a series ofhigh-resolution n-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in majormergers of dm halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. in the dm halo-onlymergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentumof the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. however,significant shape changes in the dm distribution may result if stellar disksare included. in this case the shape of the dm halos is correlated with themorphology of the stellar remnants.

astro-ph;0406247	response of dark matter halos to condensation of baryons: cosmological  simulations and improved adiabatic contraction model	the cooling of gas in the centers of dark matter halos is expected to lead toa more concentrated dark matter distribution. the response of dark matter tothe condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabaticcontraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. in contrast,halos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multipleviolent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halosare highly eccentric. we study the effects of the cooling of gas in the innerregions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations which includegas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. we find that thedissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens itsradial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case withoutcooling. for the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model incosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematicallyoverpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5% of the virialradius. we show that the model can be improved by a simple modification of theassumed invariant from m(r)r to m(r_av)r, where r and r_av are the current andorbit-averaged particle positions. this modification approximately accounts fororbital eccentricities of particles and reproduces simulation profiles towithin 10-20%. we present analytical fitting functions that accurately describethe transformation of the dark matter profile in the modified model and can beused for interpretation of observations.

astro-ph;0408273	the radial distribution of galaxies in lcdm clusters	we study the radial distribution of subhalos and galaxies usinghigh-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters formed in theconcordance lcdm cosmology. in agreement with previous studies, we find thatthe radial distribution of subhalos is significantly less concentrated thanthat of the dark matter, when subhalos are selected using their present-daygravitationally bound mass. we show that the difference in the radialdistribution is not a numerical artifact and is due to tidal stripping. thesubhalos in the cluster core lose more than 70% of their initial mass sinceaccretion, while the average tidal mass loss for halos near the virial radiusis ~30%. this introduces a radial bias in the spatial distribution of subhaloswhen they are selected using their tidally truncated mass. we demonstrate thatthe radial bias disappears almost entirely if subhalos are selected using theirmass or circular velocity at the accretion epoch. the comparisons of theresults of dissipationless simulations to the observed distribution of galaxiesin clusters are therefore sensitive to the selection criteria used to selectsubhalo samples. using the simulations that include cooling and starformation,we show that the radial distribution of subhalos is in reasonable agreementwith the observed radial distribution of galaxies in clusters for0.1&lt;r/r200&lt;2.0, if subhalos are selected using the stellar mass of galaxies.the radial bias is minimized in this case because the stars are located in thecenters of dark matter subhalos and are tightly bound. the stellar mass of anobject is therefore approximately conserved as the dark matter is stripped fromthe outer regions. nevertheless, the concentration of the radial distributionof galaxies is systematically lower than that of the dark matter.

astro-ph;0410711	galaxy-galaxy lensing: dissipationless simulations versus the halo model	galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful probe of the relation between galaxiesand dark matter halos, but its theoretical interpretation requires a carefulmodeling of various contributions, such as the contribution from central andsatellite galaxies. for this purpose, a phenomenological approach based on thehalo model has been developed, allowing for fast exploration of the parameterspace of models. in this paper, we investigate the ability of the halo model toextract information from the g-g weak lensing signal by comparing it tohigh-resolution dissipationless simulations that resolve subhalos. we find thatthe halo model reliably determines parameters such as the host halo mass ofcentral galaxies, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites, and theirradial distribution inside larger halos. if there is a significant scatterpresent in the central galaxy host halo mass distribution, then the mean andmedian mass of that distribution can differ significantly from one another, andthe halo model mass determination lies between the two. this result suggeststhat when analyzing the data, galaxy subsamples with a narrow central galaxyhalo mass distribution, such as those based on stellar mass, should be chosenfor a simpler interpretation of the results.

astro-ph;0411586	the physics of galaxy clustering i: a model for subhalo populations	(abridged) we present a semi-analytic model for cold dark matter halosubstructure that can be used as a framework for studying galaxy formation andan ingredient in halo models of galaxy clustering. we perform a comprehensivecomparison of the model to the results of a suite of high-resolutioncosmological simulations. the comparisons reveal that subhalo statistics, suchas velocity and mass functions, radial distributions, and the halo occupationdistributions, agree well over three orders of magnitude in host halo mass atvarious redshifts. both in the simulations and in our model, the radialdistributions of subhalos are significantly shallower than that of the darkmatter density. the abundance of subhalos in a host is set by competitionbetween destruction and new accretion. high mass halos and halos at highredshift tend to host more subhalos because the subhalos have, on average, beenaccreted more recently. similarly, at fixed mass, halos that formed morerecently host more subhalos. observed "fossil groups" may represent an extremetail of this correlation. we find a related correlation between host haloconcentration and subhalo abundance at fixed host mass, nsat ~ c^-a, where achanges with redshift and host-to-subhalo mass ratio. lastly, we use our modelto populate host halos in one of our high-resolution cosmological simulations,replacing the subhalos resolved in the simulation with subhalos computedaccording to our model. we show that the resulting 2pt correlation function ofsuch a "hybrid" halo ensemble is indistinguishable from that measured directlyin the simulation. this supports one of the key tenets of the standard halomodel -- the assumption that the halo occupation distribution is statisticallyindependent of host halo environment.

astro-ph;0501227	effects of cooling and star formation on the baryon fractions in  clusters	we study the effects of dissipation on the baryon fractions in clusters usinghigh-resolution cosmological simulations of nine clusters that resolveformation of cluster galaxies. the simulations of each cluster are performedwith the shock-capturing eulerian adaptive mesh refinement n-body+gasdynamicsart code with and without radiative cooling. we show that dissipation andassociated galaxy formation increase the total baryon fractions within radii aslarge as the virial radius. the effect is the strongest within cluster cores,where the simulations with cooling have baryon fractions larger than theuniversal value, while the fraction of baryons in adiabatic simulations aresmaller than universal. at larger radii (r &gt;~ r_500) the cumulative baryonfractions in simulations with cooling are close to, while those in theadiabatic runs remain below than, the universal value. the gas fractions insimulations with dissipation are reduced by ~20-40% at r&lt;0.3r_vir and ~10% atlarger radii compared to the adiabatic runs, because a fraction of gas isconverted into stars. there is an indication that gas fractions withindifferent radii increase with increasing cluster mass as f_gas ~ m_vir^0.2. wefind that the total baryon fraction within the virial radius does not evolvewith time in both adiabatic simulations and in simulations with cooling.finally, to evaluate systematic uncertainties in the baryon fraction incosmological simulations we present a comparison of gas fractions in ouradiabatic simulations to re-simulations of the same objects with theentropy-conserving sph code gadget. the cumulative gas fraction profiles in thetwo sets of simulations on average agree to &lt;~3% at r/r_vir&gt;0.2, but differsystematically by up to 10% at small radii.

astro-ph;0502496	the anisotropic distribution of galactic satellites	we present a study of the spatial distribution of subhalos in galactic darkmatter halos using dissipationless cosmological simulations of the concordancelcdm model. we find that subhalos are distributed anisotropically and arepreferentially located along the major axes of the triaxial mass distributionsof their hosts. the kolmogorov-smirnov probability for drawing our simulatedsubhalo sample from an isotropic distribution is p_ks \simeq 1.5 \times10^{-4}. an isotropic distribution of subhalos is thus not the correct nullhypothesis for testing the cdm paradigm. the nearly planar distribution ofobserved milky way (mw) satellites is marginally consistent (probability \simeq0.02) with being drawn randomly from the subhalo distribution in oursimulations. furthermore, if we select the subhalos likely to be luminous, wefind a distribution that is consistent with the observed mw satellites. infact, we show that subsamples of the subhalo population with acentrally-concentrated radial distribution, similar to that of the mw dwarfs,typically exhibit a comparable degree of planarity. we explore the origin ofthe observed subhalo anisotropy and conclude that it is likely due to (1)preferential accretion of subhalos along filaments, often closely aligned withthe major axis of the host halo, and (2) evolution of satellite orbits withinthe prolate, triaxial potentials typical of cdm halos. agreement betweenpredictions and observations requires the major axis of the outer dark matterhalo of the milky way to be nearly perpendicular to the disk. we discusspossible observational tests of such disk-halo alignment with current largegalaxy surveys.

astro-ph;0504557	impact of dark matter substructure on the matter and weak lensing power  spectra	we explore the effect of substructure in dark matter halos on the powerspectrum and bispectrum of matter fluctuations and weak lensing shear. byexperimenting with substructure in a cosmological n = 512^3 simulation, we findthat when a larger fraction of the host halo mass is in subhalos, the resultingpower spectrum has less power at 1 &lt; k &lt; 100 h mpc^{-1} and more power at k &gt;100 h mpc^{-1}. we explain this effect using an analytic halo model includingsubhalos, which shows that the 1 &lt; k &lt; 100 h mpc^{-1} regime dependssensitively on the radial distribution of subhalo centers while the interiorstructure of subhalos is important at k &gt; 100 h mpc^{-1}. the correspondingeffect due to substructures on the weak lensing power spectrum is up to about11% at angular scale l &lt; 10^4. predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a fewpercent accuracy for future surveys would therefore require large cosmologicalsimulations that also have exquisite numerical resolution to model accuratelythe survivals of dark matter subhalos in the tidal fields of their hosts.

astro-ph;0510583	the robustness of dark matter density profiles in dissipationless  mergers	we present a comprehensive series of dissipationless n-body simulations toinvestigate the evolution of density distribution in equal-mass mergers betweendark matter (dm) halos and multicomponent galaxies. the dm halo models areconstructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cuspsto core-like profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models aremotivated by the lcdm paradigm of structure formation. the adopted forceresolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of thevirial radii of the simulated systems. we demonstrate that the central slopesand overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical tothose of the initial systems suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkablememory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxationthat accompanies merger activity. we also find that halo concentrations remainapproximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systemsand show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass wellbeyond their formal virial radii. these conclusions hold for a wide variety ofinitial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounterconfigurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneousmergers of severals ystems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryoniccomponents in the form of disks, spheroids, or both. as an immediateconsequence, the net effect of gas cooling, which contracts and steepens theinner density profiles of dm halos, should be preserved through a period ofdissipationless major merging. our results imply that the characteristicuniversal shape of dm density profiles may be set early in the evolution ofhalos.

astro-ph;0512234	modeling luminosity-dependent galaxy clustering through cosmic time	we employ high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance lcdmcosmology to model the observed luminosity dependence and evolution of galaxyclustering through most of the age of the universe, from z~5 to z~0. we use asimple, non-parametric model which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities tothe maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (v_max) by preserving theobserved galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulationswith observed galaxies. the novel feature of the model is the use of themaximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, v_max,acc, for subhalos,the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. we argue that forsubhalos in dissipationless simulations, v_max,acc reflects the luminosity andstellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity atthe epoch of observation, v_max,now. the simulations and our model l-v_maxrelation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of thetwo-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxyclustering in the sdss data at z~0 and in the deep2 samples at z~1 over theentire probed range of projected separations, 0.1&lt;r_p/(mpc/h)&lt;10.0. inparticular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from thepower-law form in the sdss and deep2 luminosity-selected samples is reproducedvery well. at z~3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape andamplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of lyman-break galaxies(lbgs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn.

astro-ph;0512376	constraining the projected radial distribution of galactic satellites  with the sloan digital sky survey	we use the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic sample to constrainthe projected radial distribution of satellites around isolated ~ l* galaxies.we employ mock galaxy catalogs derived from high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations to investigate the effects of interloper contamination and showthat interlopers significantly bias the estimated slope of the projected radialdistribution of satellites. we also show that the distribution of interlopersaround galaxies is expected to be non-uniform in velocity space becausegalaxies are clustered and reside in crowded environments. successful methodsof interloper contamination correction should therefore take into accountenvironments of the host galaxies. two such new methods are presented and themost reliable of them is used to correct for interloper contamination inanalyses of the sdss galaxy sample. the best fit power-law slope of theinterloper-corrected surface density distribution of satellites, sigma(r) ~r^alpha, in the volume-limited sdss sample is alpha ~ -1.7 +/- 0.1, independentof the galaxy and satellite luminosities. comparison with lambda-cdmsimulations shows that the radial distribution of the sdss satellites is moreconcentrated than that of subhalos around galaxy-sized halos, especially at r &lt;100 kpc/h. the predicted dark matter radial distribution is somewhat moreconcentrated than the profile of the sdss satellites, but the difference is notstatistically significant for our sample.

astro-ph;0512416	the dependence of halo clustering on halo formation history,  concentration, and occupation	we investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on haloformation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number,using high-resolution numerical simulations of a lcdm cosmology. we confirmresults that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and thatthis trend depends on halo mass. for the first time, we show unequivocally thathalo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that thedependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accuratelyparameterized in a simple way: b(c,m|z) = b(m|z) b(c|m/m*). the scaling betweenbias and concentration changes sign with the value of m/m*: high concentration(early forming) objects cluster more strongly for m &lt;~ m* while lowconcentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-masshalos, m &gt;~ m*. we show the first explicit demonstration that host dark haloclustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) anddiscuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectraand galaxy clustering statistics. the effect of these halo properties onclustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which aresignificantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. our resultssuggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs)should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clusteredcounterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies invoids. they also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster sampleswith their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and biascosmological parameter estimation.

astro-ph;0601401	fossils of reionization in the local group	we use a combination of high-resolution gasdynamics simulations ofhigh-redshift dwarf galaxies and dissipationless simulations of a milky waysized halo to estimate the expected abundance and spatial distribution of thedwarf satellite galaxies that formed most of their stars around z~8 and evolvedonly little since then. such galaxies can be considered as fossils of thereionization era, and studying their properties could provide a direct windowinto the early, pre-reionization stages of galaxy formation. we show that 5-15%of the objects existing at z~8 do indeed survive until the present in the mwlike environment without significant evolution. this implies that it isplausible that the fossil dwarf galaxies do exist in the local group. becausesuch galaxies form their stellar systems early during the period of activemerging and accretion, they should have spheroidal morphology regardless oftheir current distance from the host galaxy. we show that both the expectedluminosity function and spatial distribution of dark matter halos which arelikely to host fossil galaxies agree reasonably well with the observeddistributions of the luminous (l_v&gt;10^6 lsun) local group fossil candidatesnear the host galaxy (d&lt;200 kpc). however, the predicted abundance issubstantially larger (by a factor of 2-3) for fainter galaxies (l_v&lt;10^6 lsun)at larger distances (d&gt;300 kpc). we discuss several possible explanations forthis discrepancy.

astro-ph;0609247	testing x-ray measurements of galaxy clusters with cosmological  simulations	x-ray observations of galaxy clusters potentially provide powerfulcosmological probes if systematics due to our incomplete knowledge of theintracluster medium (icm) physics are understood and controlled. in this paper,we present mock chandra analyses of cosmological cluster simulations and assessx-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties using a model and procedureessentially identical to that used in real data analysis. we show thatreconstruction of three-dimensional icm density and temperature profiles isexcellent for relaxed clusters, but still reasonably accurate for unrelaxedsystems. the total icm mass is measured quite accurately (&lt;6%) in all clusters,while the hydrostatic estimate of the gravitationally bound mass is biased lowby about 5%-20% through the virial region, primarily due to additional pressuresupport provided by subsonic bulk motions in the icm, ubiquitous in oursimulations even in relaxed systems. gas fraction determinations are thereforebiased high; the bias increases toward cluster outskirts and dependssensitively on its dynamical state, but we do not observe significant trends ofthe bias with cluster mass or redshift. we also find that different average icmtemperatures, such as the x-ray spectroscopic tspec and gas-mass-weighted tmg,are related to each other by a constant factor with a relatively smallobject-to-object scatter and no systematic trend with mass, redshift or thedynamical state of clusters. we briefly discuss direct applications of ourresults for different cluster-based cosmological tests.

astro-ph;0609612	on relaxation processes in collisionless mergers	we analyze n-body simulations of halo mergers to investigate the mechanismsresponsible for driving mixing in phase-space and the evolution to dynamicalequilibrium. we focus on mixing in energy and angular momentum and show thatmixing occurs in step-like fashion following pericenter passages of the halos.this makes mixing during a merger unlike other well known mixing processes suchas phase mixing and chaotic mixing whose rates scale with local dynamical time.we conclude that the mixing process that drives the system to equilibrium isprimarily a response to energy and angular momentum redistribution that occursdue to impulsive tidal shocking and dynamical friction rather than a result ofchaotic mixing in a continuously changing potential. we also analyze the mergerremnants to determine the degree of mixing at various radii by monitoringchanges in radius, energy and angular momentum of particles. we confirmprevious findings that show that the majority of particles retain strong memoryof their original kinetic energies and angular momenta but do experiencechanges in their potential energies owing to the tidal shocks they experienceduring pericenter passages. finally, we show that a significant fraction ofmass (~ 40%) in the merger remnant lies outside its formal virial radius andthat this matter is ejected roughly uniformly from all radii outside the innerregions. this highlights the fact that mass, in its standard virial definition,is not additive in mergers. we discuss the implications of these results forour understanding of relaxation in collisionless dynamical systems.

astro-ph;0609763	scaling relations of dwarf galaxies without supernova-driven winds	nearby dwarf galaxies exhibit tight correlations between their global stellarand dynamical properties, such as circular velocity, mass-to-light ratio,stellar mass, surface brightness, and metallicity. such correlations have oftenbeen attributed to gas or metal-rich outflows driven by supernova energyfeedback to the interstellar medium. we use high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations of high-redshift galaxies with and without energy feedback, as wellas analytic modeling, to investigate whether the observed correlations canarise without supernova-driven outflows. we find that the simulated dwarfgalaxies exhibit correlations similar to those observed as early as z~10,regardless of whether supernova feedback is included. we also show that thecorrelations can be well reproduced by our analytic model that accounts forrealistic gas inflow but assumes no outflows, and star formation rate obeyingthe kennicutt-schmidt law with a critical density threshold. we argue thatcorrelations in simulated galaxies arise due to the increasingly inefficientconversion of gas into stars in low-mass dwarf galaxies rather thansupernova-driven outflows. we also show that the decrease of the observedeffective yield in low-mass objects, often used as an indicator of gas andmetal outflows, can be reasonably reproduced in our simulations withoutoutflows. we show that this trend can arise if a significant fraction of metalsin small galaxies is spread to the outer regions of the halo outside thestellar extent via mixing. in this case the effective yield can besignificantly underestimated if only metals within the stellar radius are takeninto account. measurements of gas metallicity in the outskirts of gaseous disksof dwarfs would thus provide a key test of such explanation.

astro-ph;9701195	adaptive refinement tree - a new high-resolution n-body code for  cosmological simulations	we present a new high-resolution n-body algorithm for cosmologicalsimulations. the algorithm employs a traditional particle-mesh technique on acubic grid and successive multilevel relaxations on the finer meshes,introduced recursively in a fully adaptive manner in the regions where thedensity exceeds a predefined threshold. the mesh is generated to effectivelymatch an arbitrary geometry of the underlying density field -- a propertyparticularly important for cosmological simulations. in a simulation the meshstructure is not created at every time step but is properly adjusted to theevolving particle distribution. the algorithm is fast and effectively parallel.we present a detailed description of the methodology, implementation, and testsof the code.  we further use the code to study the structure of dark matter halos inhigh-resolution (2/h kpc) simulations of standard cdm (omega=1, h=0.5,sigma_8=0.63) and lcdm (omega_lambda=1-omega_0=0.7, h=0.7, sigma_8=1.0) models.we find that halo density profiles in both cdm and lcdm models are well fittedby the analytical model presented recently by navarro et al., which predicts asingular [$\rho(r)\propto r^{-1}$] behavior of the halo density profiles atsmall radii. we therefore conclude that halos formed in the $\lambda$cdm modelhave structure similar to cdm halos and thus cannot explain the dynamics of thecentral parts of dwarf spiral galaxies, as inferred from the galaxies' rotationcurves.

astro-ph;9708176	the cores of dark matter dominated galaxies: theory vs. observations	we use the rotation curves of a sample of dark matter dominated dwarf andlow-surface brightness (lsb) late-type galaxies to study their radial massdistributions. we find that the shape of the rotation curves is remarkablysimilar for all (both dwarf and lsb) galaxies in the sample, suggesting aself-similar density distribution of their dark matter (dm) halos. this shapecan be reproduced well by a density profile with a shallow central cusp(rho(r)\propto 1/r^gamma, gamma\approx 0.2-0.4), corresponding to a steeplyrising velocity curve (v(r)\propto r^g, g\approx 0.9-0.8). we further show thatthe observed shape of the rotation curves is well matched by the densityprofiles of dm halos formed in very high resolution simulations of the cdm,lcdm, and chdm models of structure formation. this is surprising in light ofseveral previous studies which suggested that the structure of simulated dmhalos is inconsistent with the dynamics of dwarf galaxies. we discuss possibleexplanations for this discrepancy. we show that although the mass distributionin the hierarchically formed halos is on average consistent with the shape ofrotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies, the scatter of theindividual profiles around the average is substantial and should not beneglected in comparisons with the data. finally, we show that the dm halos inour hierarchical simulations and the real galaxies in our sample exhibit asimilar decrease in their characteristic densities with increasingcharacteristic radial scales, and increase in their maximum rotation velocitieswith increasing radii at which their maximum velocity occurs.

astro-ph;9901240	where are the missing galactic satellites?	using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (vc)distribution function (vdf) of galaxy satellites in the local group. we findthat within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400/h kpc for h=0.7) centered onthe milky way and andromeda, the average vdf is roughly approximated as n(&gt;vc)~45(vc/10 km/s)^{-1} h^3 mpc^{-3} for vc in the range ~10-70 km/s. the observedvdf is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. wefind that the vdf in models is very different from the observed one:n(&gt;vc)~1200(vc/10 km/s)^{-2.75}h^3 mpc^{-3}. cosmological models thus predictthat a halo of the size of our galaxy should have about 50 dark mattersatellites with circular velocity &gt;20 km/s and mass &gt;3x10^8/h msun within a 570kpc radius. this number is significantly higher than the approximate dozensatellites actually observed around our galaxy. the observed and predicted vdfscross at ~50 km/s, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites withvc&gt; 50 km/s is in reasonably good agreement with observations. we conclude,therefore, that unless a large fraction of the local group satellites has beenmissed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observationsand hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. we discuss severalpossible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of somesatellites with the high velocity clouds observed in the local group, and theexistence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars dueeither to the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or to gas heatingby the intergalactic ionizing background.

astro-ph;9907337	velocity bias in a lcdm model	we use n-body simulations to study the velocity bias of dark matter halos,the difference in the velocity fields of dark matter and halos, in a flat low-density lcdm model. the high force, 2kpc/h, and mass, 10^9msun/h, resolutionallows dark matter halos to survive in very dense environments of groups andclusters making it possible to use halos as galaxy tracers. we find that thevelocity bias pvb measured as a ratio of pairwise velocities of the halos tothat of the dark matter evolves with time and depends on scale. at highredshifts (z ~5) halos move generally faster than the dark matter almost on allscales: pvb(r)~1.2, r&gt;0.5mpc/h. at later moments the bias decreases and getsbelow unity on scales less than r=5mpc/h: pvb(r)~(0.6-0.8) at z=0. we find thatthe evolution of the pairwise velocity bias follows and probably is defined bythe spatial antibias of the dark matter halos at small scales. one-pointvelocity bias b_v, defined as the ratio of the rms velocities of halos and darkmatter, provides a more direct measure of the difference in velocities becauseit is less sensitive to the spatial bias. we analyze b_v in clusters ofgalaxies and find that halos are ``hotter'' than the dark matter: b_v=(1.2-1.3)for r=(0.2-0.8)r_vir, where r_vir is the virial radius. at larger radii, b_vdecreases and approaches unity at r=(1-2)r_vir. we argue that dynamicalfriction may be responsible for this small positive velocity bias b_v&gt;1 foundin the central parts of clusters. we do not find significant difference in thevelocity anisotropy of halos and the dark matter. the dark matter the velocityanisotropy can be approximated as beta(x)=0.15 +2x/(x^2+4), where x is measuredin units of the virial radius.

astro-ph;9908159	profiles of dark haloes: evolution, scatter, and environment	we study dark-matter halo density profiles in a high-resolution n-bodysimulation of an lcdm cosmology. our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloesin the range 10^{11}-10^{14} m_sun. the profiles are parameterized by an nfwform with two parameters, an inner radius r_s and a virial radius r_v, and wedefine the halo concentration c_v = r_v/r_s. first, we find that, for a givenhalo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is c_v ~1/(1+z), corresponding to a roughly constant r_s with redshift. we present animproved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relationsbetween halo parameters and their redshift dependence. the implications arethat high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer thanexpected before. second, we find that the scatter in log(c_v) is ~0.18,corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of dv/v ~ 0.12. wediscuss implications for modelling the tully-fisher relation, which has asmaller reported intrinsic scatter. third, haloes in dense environments tend tobe more concentrated than isolated haloes. these results suggest that c_v is anessential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discussimplications for the universality of the tully-fisher relation, the formationof low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the hubble sequence.

astro-ph;9910372	spatial and velocity biases	we give a summary of our recent studies of spatial and velocity biases ofgalaxy-size halos in cosmological models. recent progress in numericaltechniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a suchaccuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters ofgalaxies. dark matter halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus,can be used to study the biases - differences between galaxies and the darkmatter. for the standard lcdm model we find that the correlation function andthe power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scalesr&lt;5mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/mpc. the biases depend on scale, redshift, andcircular velocities of selected halos. two processes seem to define theevolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias (or peak bias) and mergerbias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces thenumber of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).there are two kinds of velocity bias. the pair-wise velocity bias isb_12=0.6-0.8 at r&lt;5mpc/h, z=0. this bias mostly reflects the spatial bias andprovides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies andthe dark matter. one-point velocity bias is a better measure of the velocities.inside clusters the galaxies should move slightly faster (b_v=1.1-1.3) than thedark matter. qualitatively this result can be understood using the jeansequations of the stellar dynamics.

astro-ph;9912257	on effects of resolution in dissipationless cosmological simulations	we present a study of numerical effects in dissipationless cosmologicalsimulations. the numerical effects are evaluated and studied by comparingresults of a series of 64^3-particle simulations of varying force resolutionand number of time steps, performed using three different n-body techniques:the particle mesh (pm), the adaptive p3m (ap3m) code, and the adaptiverefinement tree (art) code. this study can therefore be interesting both as ananalysis of numerical effects and as a systematic comparison of differentcodes. we find that the ap3m and the art codes produce similar results, giventhat convergence is reached within the code type. we also find that numericaleffects may affect the high-resolution simulations in ways that have not beendiscussed before. in particular, our study revealed the presence of two-bodyscattering, effects of which can be greatly amplified by inaccuracies of timeintegration. this process appears to affect the correlation function of matter,mass function and inner density of dark matter halos and other statistics atscales much larger than the force resolution, although different statistics maybe affected in different fashion. we discuss the conditions at which strongtwo-body scattering is possible and discuss the choice of the force resolutionand integration time step. furthermore, we discuss recent claims thatsimulations with force softening smaller than the mean interparticle separationare not trustworthy and argue that this claim is incorrect in general andapplies only to the phase-sensitive statistics. our conclusion is that,depending on the choice of mass and force resolution and integration time step,a force resolution as small as 0.01 of the mean interparticle separation can bejustified.

0810.4148	modeling molecular hydrogen and star formation in cosmological  simulations	we describe a phenomenological model for molecular hydrogen formation suitedfor applications in galaxy formation simulations, which includes on-equilibriumformation of molecular hydrogen on dust and approximate treatment of both itsself-shielding and shielding by dust from the dissociating uv radiation. themodel is applicable in simulations in which individual star forming regions -the giant molecular complexes - can be identified (resolution of tens of pc)and their mean internal density estimated reliably, even if internal structureis not resolved. in agreement with previous studies, calculations based on ourmodel show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase dependsprimarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dustabundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. the clumpiness simplyboosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as acatalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding fromdissociating uv radiation. the upshot is that it is difficult to formfully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low. however,once the gas is enriched to z ~ 0.01-0.1 solar, the subsequent star formationand enrichment can proceed at a much faster rate. this may keep star formationefficiency in the low-mass, low-metallicity progenitors of galaxies very lowfor a certain period of time with the effect similar to a strong "feedback"mechanism.

0812.3659	evolution of dark matter phase-space density distributions in equal-mass  halo mergers	we use dissipationless n-body simulations to investigate the evolution of thetrue coarse-grained phase-space density distribution f(x,v) in equal-massmergers between dark matter (dm) halos. the halo models are constructed withvarious asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to core-likeprofiles and we employ the phase-space density estimator ``enbid'' developed bysharma &amp; steinmetz to compute f(x,v). the adopted force resolution allowsrobust phase-space density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virialradii of the simulated systems. we confirm that mergers result in a decrease ofthe coarse-grained phase-space density in accordance with expectations frommixing theorems for collisionless systems. we demonstrate that binary mergersbetween identical dm halos produce remnants that retain excellent memories ofthe inner slopes and overall shapes of the phase-space density distribution oftheir progenitors. the robustness of the phase-space density profiles holds fora range of orbital energies, and a variety of encounter configurationsincluding sequences of several consecutive merger events, designed to mimichierarchical merging, and collisions occurring at different cosmologicalepochs. if the progenitor halos are constructed with appreciably differentasymptotic power-law indices, we find that the inner slope and overall shape ofthe phase-space density distribution of the remnant are substantially closer tothat of the initial system with the steepest central density cusp. theseresults explicitly demonstrate that mixing is incomplete in equal-mass mergersbetween dm halos, as it does not erase memory of the progenitor properties. ourresults also confirm the recent analytical predictions of dehnen (2005)regarding the preservation of merging self-gravitating central density cusps.
