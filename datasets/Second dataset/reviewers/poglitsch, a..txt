1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1105.1731	massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in ulirgs observed by  herschel-pacs	mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei are a key element inmany current models of galaxy evolution. they may produce the observed blackhole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in thehost galaxy and black hole accretion. however, observational evidence of suchfeedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star forming moleculargas is still scarce. here we report the detection of massive molecularoutflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (oh), in far-infrared spectra ofulirgs obtained with herschel-pacs as part of the shining key project. in someof these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km/s, and theiroutflow rates (up to ~1200 m_sol/yr) are several times larger than their starformation rates. we compare the outflow signatures in different types of ulirgsand in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (agn orstarburst) of these outflows. we report preliminary evidence that ulirgs with ahigher agn luminosity (and higher agn contribution to l_ir) have higherterminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales. the outflows in theobserved ulirgs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres ofthese objects within ~1e6-1e8 years.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

[oiii] is dominated byextended emission from the high-excitation diffuse ionized gas; it is thebrightest far-infrared line, ~4 times brighter than [cii]. the extent of the[oiii] emission suggests that the medium is rather fragmented, allowing far-uvphotons to permeate into the ism to scales of &gt;30pc. furthermore, by comparing[cii] with [nii], we find that 95% of [cii] arises in pdrs, except toward thestellar cluster for which as much as 15% could arise in the ionized gas. wefind a remarkable correlation between [cii]+[oi] and pah emission, with [cii]dominating the cooling in diffuse pdrs and [oi] dominating in the densest pdrs.the combination of [cii] and [oi] provides a proxy for the total gas cooling inpdrs. our results suggest that pah emission describes better the pdr gasheating as compared to the total infrared emission.

1211.5064	excited oh+, h2o+, and h3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220	we report on herschel/pacs observations of absorption lines of oh+, h2o+ andh3o+ in ngc 4418 and arp 220. excited lines of oh+ and h2o+ with e_lower of atleast 285 and \sim200 k, respectively, are detected in both sources, indicatingradiative pumping and location in the high radiation density environment of thenuclear regions. abundance ratios oh+/h2o+ of 1-2.5 are estimated in the nucleiof both sources. the inferred oh+ column and abundance relative to h nuclei are(0.5-1)x10^{16} cm-2 and \sim2x10^{-8}, respectively. additionally, in arp 220,an extended low excitation component around the nuclear region is found to haveoh+/h2o+\sim5-10. h3o+ is detected in both sources withn(h3o+)\sim(0.5-2)x10^{16} cm-2, and in arp 220 the pure inversion, metastablelines indicate a high rotational temperature of ~500 k, indicative of formationpumping and/or hot gas. simple chemical models favor an ionization sequencedominated by h+ - o+ - oh+ - h2o+ - h3o+, and we also argue that the h+production is most likely dominated by x-ray/cosmic ray ionization. the fullset of observations and models leads us to propose that the molecular ionsarise in a relatively low density (\gtrsim10^4 cm-3) interclump medium, inwhich case the ionization rate per h nucleus (including secondary ionizations)is zeta&gt;10^{-13} s-1, a lower limit that is severalx10^2 times the highest rateestimates for galactic regions. in arp 220, our lower limit for zeta iscompatible with estimates for the cosmic ray energy density inferred previouslyfrom the supernova rate and synchrotron radio emission, and also with theexpected ionization rate produced by x-rays. in ngc 4418, we argue that x-rayionization due to an agn is responsible for the molecular ion production.

1211.5770	the far-infrared, uv and molecular gas relation in galaxies up to z=2.5	we use the infrared excess (irx) fir/uv luminosity ratio to study therelation between the effective uv attenuation (a_irx) and the uv spectral slope(beta) in a sample of 450 1&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxies. the fir data is from very deepherschel observations in the goods fields that allow us to detect galaxies withsfrs typical of galaxies with log(m)&gt;9.3. thus, we are able to study galaxieson and even below the main sfr-stellar mass relation (main sequence). we findthat main sequence galaxies form a tight sequence in the irx--beta plane, whichhas a flatter slope than commonly used relations. this slope favors a smc-likeuv extinction curve, though the interpretation is model dependent. the scatterin the irx-beta plane, correlates with the position of the galaxies in thesfr-m plane. using a smaller sample of galaxies with co gas masses, we studythe relation between the uv attenuation and the molecular gas content. we finda very tight relation between the scatter in the irx-beta plane and thespecific attenuation (s_a), a quantity that represents the attenuationcontributed by the molecular gas mass per young star. s_a is sensitive to boththe geometrical arrangement of stars and dust, and to the compactness of thestar forming regions. we use this empirical relation to derive a method forestimating molecular gas masses using only widely available integratedrest-frame uv and fir photometry. the method produces gas masses with anaccuracy between 0.12-0.16 dex in samples of normal galaxies between z~0 andz~1.5. major mergers and sub-millimeter galaxies follow a different s_arelation.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1308.3139	fast molecular outflows in luminous galaxy mergers: evidence for quasar  feedback from herschel	we report the results from a systematic search for molecular (oh-119 um)outflows with herschel-pacs in a sample of 43 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) galaxy mergers,mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos. we find that thecharacter of the oh feature (strength of the absorption relative to theemission) correlates with that of the 9.7-um silicate feature, a measure ofobscuration in ulirgs. unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based onthe detection of oh absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshiftedthan -50 km/sec, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 oh-detected targets, suggestinga wide-angle (~145 degrees) outflow geometry. conversely, unambiguous evidencefor molecular inflows, based on the detection of oh absorption profiles withmedian velocities more redshifted than +50 km/sec, is seen in only 4 objects,suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. terminaloutflow velocities of ~-1000 km/sec are measured in several objects, but medianoutflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s^{-1}. while the outflow velocitiesshow no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, theyare distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large agn fractions andluminosities [log (l_agn / l_sun) &gt; 11.8 +/- 0.3]. the quasars in these systemsplay a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. in contrast, the mostagn dominated systems, where oh is seen purely in emission, show relativelymodest oh line widths, despite their large agn luminosities, perhaps indicatingthat molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through theobscuring material.

1310.1398	reversal or no reversal: the evolution of the star formation  rate-density relation up to z~1.6	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate (sfr)-densityrelation in the extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs) and the greatobservatories origin deep survey (goods) fields up to z~1.6. in addition to the"traditional method", in which the environment is defined according to astatistical measurement of the local galaxy density, we use a "dynamical"approach, where galaxies are classified according to three differentenvironment regimes: group, "filament-like", and field. both methods show noevidence of a sfr-density reversal. moreover, group galaxies show a mean sfrlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group andfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (sf) activity. wefind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant inthe suppression of the sf below z~1, with respect to purely density-relatedprocesses. we confirm this finding by studying the distribution of galaxies indifferent environments with respect to the so-called main sequence (ms) ofstar-forming galaxies. galaxies in both group and "filament-like" environmentspreferentially lie below the ms up to z~1, with group galaxies exhibiting lowerlevels of star-forming activity at a given mass. at z&gt;1, the star-forminggalaxies in groups reside on the ms. groups exhibit the highest fraction ofquiescent galaxies up to z~1, after which group, "filament-like", and fieldenvironments have a similar mix of galaxy types. we conclude that groups arethe most efficient locus for star-formation quenching. thus, a fundamentaldifference exists between bound and unbound objects, or between dark matterhaloes of different masses.

1310.3074	the mrk 231 molecular outflow as seen in oh	we report on the herschel/pacs observations of oh in mrk 231, with detectionsin 9 doublets observed within the pacs range, and present radiative transfermodels for the outflowing oh. signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to 6oh doublets with different excitation requirements. at least two outflowingcomponents are identified, one with oh radiatively excited, and the other withlow excitation, presumably spatially extended. particularly prominent, the bluewing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2pi_{3/2} j=9/2-7/2 oh doubletat 65 um, with e_lower=290 k, indicates that the excited outflowing gas isgenerated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. because the excited,outflowing oh gas in mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-ir continuumsource, it is likely more compact (diameter of 200-300 pc) than that probed byco and hcn. nevertheless, its mass-outflow rate per unit of solid angle asinferred from oh is similar to that previously derived from co,&gt;~70x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1} sr^{-1}, where x_{oh} is the ohabundance relative to h nuclei. in spherical symmetry, this would correspond to&gt;~850x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1}, though significant collimation isinferred from the line profiles. the momentum flux of the excited componentattains ~15 l_{agn}/c, with an oh column density of (1.5-3)x10^{17} cm^-2 and amechanical luminosity of ~10^{11} lsun. the detection of very excited ohpeaking at central velocities indicates the presence of a nuclear reservoir ofgas rich in oh, plausibly the 130-pc scale circumnuclear torus previouslydetected in oh megamaser emission, that may be feeding the outflow. anexceptional ^{18}oh enhancement, with oh/^{18}oh&lt;~30 at both central andblueshifted velocities, is likely the result of interstellar-medium processingby recent starburst/sne activity.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1511.01899	non-linearity and environmental dependence of the star forming galaxies  main sequence	using data from four deep fields (cosmos, aegis, ecdfs, and cdfn), we studythe correlation between the position of galaxies in the star formation rate(sfr) versus stellar mass plane and local environment at $z&lt;1.1$. to accuratelyestimate the galaxy sfr, we use the deepest available spitzer/mips 24 andherschel/pacs datasets. we distinguish group environments ($m_{halo}\sim$10$^{12.5-14.2}$$m_{\odot}$) based on the available deep x-raydata and lower halo mass environments based on the local galaxy density. weconfirm that the main sequence (ms) of star forming galaxies is not a linearrelation and there is a flattening towards higher stellar masses ($m_*&gt;10^{10.4-10.6}$ $m_{\odot}$), across all environments. at high redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1$ ), the ms varies little with environment. at low redshift ($0.15&lt;z&lt;0.5$ ), group galaxies tend to deviate from the mean ms towards theregion of quiescence with respect to isolated galaxies and less-denseenvironments. we find that the flattening of the ms toward low sfr is due to anincreased fraction of bulge dominated galaxies at high masses. instead, thedeviation of group galaxies from the ms at low redshift is caused by a largefraction of red disk dominated galaxies which are not present in the lowerdensity environments. our results suggest that above a mass threshold ($\sim10^{10.4}-10^{10.6}$$m_{\odot}$ ) stellar mass, morphology and environmentact together in driving the evolution of the sf activity towards lower level.the presence of a dominating bulge and the associated quenching processes arealready in place beyond $z\sim$1. the environmental effects appear, instead, atlower redshifts and have a long time-scale.

astro-ph;0107365	star formation in m51 triggered by galaxy interaction	we have mapped the inner 360'' regions of m51 in the 158micron [cii] line at55'' spatial resolution using the far-infrared imaging fabry-perotinterferometer (fifi) on the kuiper airborne observatory (kao). the emission ispeaked at the nucleus, but is detectable over the entire region mapped, whichcovers much of the optical disk of the galaxy. there are also two strongsecondary peaks at ~43% to 70% of the nuclear value located roughly 120'' tothe north-east, and south-west of the nucleus. these secondary peaks are at thesame distance from the nucleus as the corotation radius of the density wavepattern. the density wave also terminates at this location, and the outlyingspiral structure is attributed to material clumping due to the interactionbetween m51 and ngc5195. this orbit crowding results in cloud-cloud collisions,stimulating star formation, that we see as enhanced [cii] line emission. the[cii] emission at the peaks originates mainly from photodissociation regions(pdrs) formed on the surfaces of molecular clouds that are exposed to obstarlight, so that these [cii] peaks trace star formation peaks in m51. thetotal mass of [cii] emitting photodissociated gas is ~2.6x10^{8} m_{sun}, orabout 2% of the molecular gas as estimated from its co(1-0) line emission. atthe peak [cii] positions, the pdr gas mass to total gas mass fraction issomewhat higher, 3-17%, and at the secondary peaks the mass fraction of the[cii] emitting photodissociated gas can be as high as 72% of the molecularmass....

astro-ph;9804162	cii emission from ngc 4038/39 (the antennae)	we present observations of ngc 4038/39 in the [cii] 158 micron fine structureline taken with the mpe/ucb far-infrared imaging fabry-perot interferometer(fifi) on the kao with 55" resolution. the total [cii] luminosity of theantennae is 3.7x10^8 l(sun), which is about 1% of the fir luminosity. the mainpart of the [cii] emission probably arises from photodissociation regions(pdrs). up to 1/3 of the observed [cii] emission may originate from the cnm forhigher temperatures and densities. from pdr models we derive densities and fuvintensities for the nuclei and the interaction zone. the minimum masses in the[cii] emitting regions in the interaction zone and the nuclei are a few x10^(7) m(sun). we find that the [cii] to co intensity ratio at the interactionzone is a factor of 2.6 lower than usually observed in starburst galaxies, butstill a factor of about 1.3 to 1.4 higher than at the nuclei of ngc 4038/39,indicating no global starburst is taking place in the antennae. [cii] emissionarising partly from confined starburst regions and partly from surroundingquiescent clouds could explain the observed [cii] radiation at the interactionzone and the nuclei. there are small confined regions with high star formationactivity in the interaction zone and with a lower star formation activity inthe nuclei. this supports the high density and high fuv intensity for the pdrsin the interaction zone and the nuclei.
