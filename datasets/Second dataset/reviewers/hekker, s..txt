0904.0105	a semi-automatic procedure for abundance determination of a- and f-type  stars	a variety of physical processes leading to different types of pulsations andchemical compositions is observed among a- and f-type stars. to investigate theunderlying mechanisms responsible for these processes in stars with similarlocations in the h-r diagram, an accurate abundance determination is needed,among others. here, we describe a semi-automatic procedure developed todetermine chemical abundances of various elements ranging from helium tomercury for this type of stars. we test our procedure on synthetic spectra,demonstrating that our procedure provides abundances consistent with the inputvalues, even when the stellar parameters are offset by reasonable observationalerrors. for a fast-rotating star such as vega, our analysis is consistent withthose carried out with other plane-parallel model atmospheres. simulations showthat the offsets from the input abundances increase for stars with lowinclination angle of about 4 degrees. for this inclination angle, we also showthat the distribution of the iron abundance found in different regions isbimodal. furthermore, the effect of rapid rotation can be seen in the peculiarbehaviour of the h_beta line.

0906.5002	characteristics of solar-like oscillations in red giants observed in the  corot exoplanet field	observations during the first long run (~150 days) in the exo-planet field ofcorot increase the number of g-k giant stars for which solar-like oscillationsare observed by a factor of 100. this opens the possibility to study thecharacteristics of their oscillations in a statistical sense. we aim tounderstand the statistical distribution of the frequencies of maximumoscillation power (nu_max) in red giants and to search for a possiblecorrelation between nu_max and the large separation (delta_nu). the nu_maxdistribution shows a pronounced peak between 20 - 40 microhz. for about half ofthe stars we obtain delta_nu with at least two methods. the correlation betweennu_max and delta_nu follows the same scaling relation as inferred forsolar-like stars. the shape of the nu_max distribution can partly be explainedby granulation at low frequencies and by white noise at high frequencies, butthe population density of the observed stars turns out to be also an importantfactor. from the fact that the correlation between delta_nu and nu_max for redgiants follows the same scaling relation as obtained for sun-like stars, weconclude that the sound travel time over the pressure scale height of theatmosphere scales with the sound travel time through the whole starirrespective of evolution.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1002.2212	line-profile variations of stochastically excited oscillations in four  evolved stars	since solar-like oscillations were first detected in red-giant stars, thepresence of non-radial oscillation modes has been debated. spectroscopicline-profile analysis was used in the first attempt to perform modeidentification, which revealed that non-radial modes are observable. despitethe fact that the presence of non-radial modes could be confirmed, the degreeor azimuthal order could not be uniquely identified. here we present animprovement to this first spectroscopic line-profile analysis. aims: we aim tostudy line-profile variations of stochastically excited solar-like oscillationsin four evolved stars to derive the azimuthal order of the observed mode andthe surface rotational frequency. methods: spectroscopic line-profile analysisis applied to cross-correlation functions, using the fourier parameter fitmethod on the amplitude and phase distributions across the profiles. results:for four evolved stars, beta hydri (g2iv), epsilon ophiuchi (g9.5iii), etaserpentis (k0iii) and delta eridani (k0iv) the line-profile variations revealthe azimuthal order of the oscillations with an accuracy of ~1. furthermore,our analysis reveals the projected rotational velocity and the inclinationangle. from these parameters we obtain the surface rotational frequency.conclusions: we conclude that line-profile variations of cross-correlationfunctions behave differently for different frequencies and that they provideadditional information in terms of the surface rotational frequency andazimuthal order.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

1006.0925	modelling the autocovariance of the power spectrum of a solar-type  oscillator	asteroseismology is able to conduct studies on the interiors of solar-typestars from the analysis of stellar acoustic spectra. however, such an analysisprocess often has to rely upon subjective choices made throughout. a recurringproblem is to determine whether a signal in the acoustic spectrum originatesfrom a radial or a dipolar oscillation mode. in order to overcome this problem,we present a procedure for modelling and fitting the autocovariance of thepower spectrum which can be used to obtain global seismic parameters ofsolar-type stars, doing so in an automated fashion without the need to makesubjective choices. from the set of retrievable global seismic parameters weemphasize the mean small frequency separation and, depending on the intrinsiccharacteristics of the power spectrum, the mean rotational frequency splitting.since this procedure is automated, it can serve as a useful tool in theanalysis of the more than one thousand solar-type stars expected to be observedas part of the kepler asteroseismic investigation (kai). we apply theaforementioned procedure to simulations of the sun. assuming different apparentmagnitudes, we address the issues of how accurately and how precisely we canretrieve the several global seismic parameters were the sun to be observed aspart of the kai.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1109.2595	frequency dependence of the large frequency separation of solar-like  oscillators: influence of the helium second-ionization zone	the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive orders in a star is approximately proportional to the square rootof its mean density. to determine the large frequency separation as accuratelyas possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders isoften used. it is, however, known that the large frequency separation varieswith frequency in a second order effect. from observations it has been shownthat this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars thanit is for red-giant stars. here we use yrec models to verify and explain thisobservational result. we find that for stars with r &gt; 8 rsun the effect of thehelium second ionisation zone is relatively small. for these stars the deeplocation of the he ii zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a fewlarge separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to therelatively weak and extended he ii layer, causing a shallow wide depression inthe first adiabatic exponent. for less evolved stars the he ii zone is locatedcloser to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depressionin the first adiabatic exponent. this causes frequency modulations withrelatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducinga relatively large frequency modulation. additionally, we find that for lessevolved stars the he ii zone is stronger and more localised for more massivestars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude ofthe frequency modulation.

1109.3460	testing scaling relations for solar-like oscillations from the main  sequence to red giants using kepler data	we have analyzed solar-like oscillations in ~1700 stars observed by thekepler mission, spanning from the main-sequence to the red clump. usingevolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequencyof maximum power (nu_max), the large frequency separation (delta_nu) andoscillation amplitudes. we show that the difference of the delta_nu-nu_maxrelation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by differentdistributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with whatis expected from scaling relations. for oscillation amplitudes, we show thatneither (l/m)^s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by kjeldsen &amp; bedding(2011) are accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scalingrelation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculateamplitudes from the main-sequence to red-giants to a precision of ~25%. theresiduals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that anadditional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observedamplitudes. we investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellaractivity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is mostpronounced for subgiant stars. finally, we test the location of the cool edgeof the instability strip in the hertzsprung-russell diagram using solar-likeoscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with adomain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.

1110.0980	characterization of the power excess of solar-like oscillations in red  giants with kepler	we aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in kepler redgiants, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing theseparameters. from these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties ofred giant oscillations. various different methods were compared in order tovalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. for consistency, asingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevantglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of thebackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of thepower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility ofnon-radial modes. a method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillationspectrum. the comparison of the different methods has shown the important roleof the way the background is modelled. the convergence reached by thecollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning theoscillation power excess. we obtain several scaling relations, and identify theinfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. the effect of heliumburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strongmass-radius relation for clump stars. we find that none of the amplitudescaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observedmode amplitudes of red giant stars. in parallel, the degree-dependent modevisibility exhibits important variations. both effects seem related to thesignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. a familyof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties areanalyzed.

1206.3312	seismic evidence for a rapidly rotating core in a lower-giant-branch  star observed with kepler	rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and theevolution of stars. however, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport instars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account instellar models. to achieve a better understanding of these processes, wedesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,which until very recently were restricted to the sun. in this paper, we reportthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in thecore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giantkic7341231, which was observed during one year with the kepler spacecraft. byperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show thatits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able todetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. we then find astellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismicproperties of the star. we use this model to perform inversions of the internalrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of thestar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. this will shednew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. inparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angularmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, whichcould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed overthe last decades.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1210.0012	fundamental properties of stars using asteroseismology from kepler &amp;  corot and interferometry from the chara array	we present results of a long-baseline interferometry campaign using the pavobeam combiner at the chara array to measure the angular sizes of fivemain-sequence stars, one subgiant and four red giant stars for which solar-likeoscillations have been detected by either kepler or corot. by combininginterferometric angular diameters, hipparcos parallaxes, asteroseismicdensities, bolometric fluxes and high-resolution spectroscopy we derive a fullset of near model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. we firstuse these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequencyof maximum power (nu_max) and the large frequency separation (delta_nu). wefind excellent agreement within the observational uncertainties, andempirically show that simple estimates of asteroseismic radii for main-sequencestars are accurate to &lt;~4%. we furthermore find good agreement of our measuredeffective temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with meandeviations for stars between t_eff = 4600-6200 k of -22+/-32 k (with a scatterof 97k) and -58+/-31 k (with a scatter of 93 k), respectively. finally wepresent a first comparison with evolutionary models, and find differencesbetween observed and theoretical properties for the metal-rich main-sequencestar hd173701. we conclude that the constraints presented in this study willhave strong potential for testing stellar model physics, in particular whencombined with detailed modelling of individual oscillation frequencies.

1211.0153	constraining the core-rotation rate in red-giant stars from kepler space  photometry	rotation plays a key role in stellar structure and its evolution. throughtransport processes which induce rotational mixing of chemical species and theredistribution of angular momentum, internal stellar rotation influences theevolutionary tracks in the hertzsprung-russell diagram. in turn, evolutioninfluences the rotational properties. therefore, information on the rotationalproperties of the deep interior would help to better understand the stellarevolution. however, as the internal rotational profile cannot be measureddirectly, it remains a major unknown leaving this important aspect of modelsunconstrained. we can test for nonrigid rotation inside the stars withasteroseismology. through the effect of rotational splitting of non-radialoscillation modes, we investigate the internal rotation profile indirectly. redgiants have very slow rotation rates leading to a rotational splitting on thelevel of a few tenth of a \mu hz. only from more than 1.5 years of consecutivedata from the nasa kepler space telescope, these tiny variations could beresolved. a qualitative comparison to theoretical models allowed constrainingthe core-to-surface rotation rate for some of these evolved stars. in thispaper, we report on the first results of a large sample study of splitting ofindividual dipole modes.

0801.0741	precise radial velocities of giant stars. iv. a correlation between  surface gravity and radial velocity variation and a statistical investigation  of companion properties	since 1999, we have been conducting a radial velocity survey of 179 k giantsusing the cat at uco/lick observatory. at present ~20-100 measurements havebeen collected per star with a precision of 5 to 8 m/s. of the stars monitored,145 (80%) show radial velocity (rv) variations at a level &gt;20 m/s, of which 43exhibit significant periodicities. our aim is to investigate possiblemechanism(s) that cause these observed rv variations. we intend to test whetherthese variations are intrinsic in nature, or possibly induced by companions, orboth. in addition, we aim to characterise the parameters of these companions. arelation between log g and the amplitude of the rv variations is investigatedfor all stars in the sample. furthermore, the hypothesis that all periodic rvvariations are caused by companions is investigated by comparing their inferredorbital statistics with the statistics of companions around main sequencestars. a strong relation is found between the amplitude of the rv variationsand log g in k giant stars, as suggested earlier by hatzes &amp; cochran (1998).however, most of the stars exhibiting periodic variations are located abovethis relation. these rv variations can be split in a periodic component whichis not correlated with log g and a random residual part which does correlatewith log g. compared to main-sequence stars, k giants frequently exhibitperiodic rv variations. interpreting these rv variations as being caused bycompanions, the orbital param eters are different from the companions orbitingdwarfs. intrinsic mechanisms play an important role in producing rv variationsin k giants stars, as suggested by their dependence on log g. however, itappears that periodic rv variations are additional to these intrinsicvariations, consistent with them being caused by companions.

1305.6586	asteroseismic surface gravity for evolved stars	context: asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance indetermining spectroscopic stellar parameters. the independent log(g) value fromasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis toreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. since 2012, a combined analysisof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing fora large survey with sdss/apogee and kepler. therefore, knowledge of anypotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is nowbecoming important. aims: the seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is thefrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). here, we investigate theinfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)values. the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive radial orders (dnu) is often used as an additional constraint forthe determination of log(g). additionally, we checked the influence of smallcorrections applied to dnu on the derived values of log(g). methods we usemethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and dnutogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derivelog(g). results: we find that different approaches to derive oscillationparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases forred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. these biases are well within the quoteduncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). corrections suggested in the literature tothe dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). however somewhatunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the orderof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar referencevalues are used.

1306.4323	tests of the asymptotic large frequency separation of acoustic  oscillations in solar-type and red giant stars	asteroseismology, i.e. the study of the internal structures of stars viatheir global oscillations, is a valuable tool to obtain stellar parameters suchas mass, radius, surface gravity and mean density. these parameters can beobtained using certain scaling relations which are based on an asymptoticapproximation. usually the observed oscillation parameters are assumed tofollow these scaling relations. recently, it has been questioned whether thisis a valid approach, i.e., whether the order of the observed oscillation modesare high enough to be approximated with an asymptotic theory. in this work weuse stellar models to investigate whether the differences between observableoscillation parameters and their asymptotic estimates are indeed significant.we compute the asymptotic values directly from the stellar models and derivethe observable values from adiabatic pulsation calculations of the same models.we find that the extent to which the atmosphere is included in the models is akey parameter. considering a larger extension of the atmosphere beyond thephotosphere reduces the difference between the asymptotic and observable valuesof the large frequency separation. therefore, we conclude that the currentlysuggested discrepancies in the scaling relations might have been overestimated.hence, based on the results presented here we believe that the suggestions ofmosser et al. (2013) should not be followed without careful consideration.

1308.6617	calibrations of atmospheric parameters obtained from the first year of  sdss-iii apogee observations	the sdss-iii apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee)is a three year survey that is collecting 100,000 high-resolution spectra inthe near-ir across multiple galactic populations. to derive stellar parametersand chemical compositions from this massive data set, the apogee stellarparameters and chemical abundances pipeline (aspcap) has been developed. here,we describe empirical calibrations of stellar parameters presented in the firstsdss-iii apogee data release (dr10). these calibrations were enabled byobservations of 559 stars in 20 globular and open clusters. the clusterobservations were supplemented by observations of stars in nasa's kepler fieldthat have well determined surface gravities from asteroseismic analysis. wediscuss the accuracy and precision of the derived stellar parameters,considering especially effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity;we also briefly discuss the derived results for the abundances of thealpha-elements, carbon, and nitrogen. overall, we find that aspcap achievesreasonably accurate results for temperature and metallicity, but suffers fromsystematic errors in surface gravity. we derive calibration relations thatbring the raw aspcap results into better agreement with independentlydetermined stellar parameters. the internal scatter of aspcap parameters withinclusters suggests that, metallicities are measured with a precision better than0.1 dex, effective temperatures better than 150 k, and surface gravities betterthan 0.2 dex. the understanding provided by the clusters and kepler giants onthe current accuracy and precision will be invaluable for future improvementsof the pipeline.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

1310.0839	period-luminosity relations in evolved red giants explained by  solar-like oscillations	solar-like oscillations in red giants have been investigated with corot andkepler, while pulsations in more evolved m giants have been studied withground-based microlensing surveys. after 3.1 years of observation with kepler,it is now possible to make a link between these different observations ofsemi-regular variables. we aim to identify period-luminosity sequences inevolved red giants identified as semi-regular variables. then, we investigatethe consequences of the comparison of ground-based and space-borneobservations. we have first measured global oscillation parameters of evolvedred giants observed with kepler with the envelope autocorrelation functionmethod. we then used an extended form of the universal red giant oscillationpattern, extrapolated to very low frequency, to fully identify theiroscillations. from the link between red giant oscillations observed by keplerand period-luminosity sequences, we have identified these relations in evolvedred giants as radial and non-radial solar-like oscillations. we were able toexpand scaling relations at very low frequency. this helped us to identify thedifferent sequences of period-luminosity relations, and allowed us to propose acalibration of the k magnitude with the observed frequency large separation.interpreting period-luminosity relations in red giants in terms of solar-likeoscillations allows us to investigate, with a firm physical basis, the timeseries obtained from ground-based microlensing surveys. this can be done withan analytical expression that describes the low-frequency oscillation spectra.the different behavior of oscillations at low frequency, with frequencyseparations scaling only approximately with the square root of the mean stellardensity, can be used to address precisely the physics of the semi-regularvariables.

1312.4500	pulsating red giant stars in eccentric binary systems discovered from  kepler space-based photometry	the unparalleled photometric data obtained by nasa's kepler space telescopeled to an improved understanding of red giant stars and binary stars.seismology allows us to constrain the properties of red giants. in addition toeclipsing binaries, eccentric non-eclipsing binaries, exhibiting ellipsoidalmodulations, have been detected with kepler. we aim to study the properties ofeccentric binary systems containing a red giant star and derive the parametersof the primary giant component. we apply asteroseismic techniques to determinemasses and radii of the primary component of each system. for a selectedtarget, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques are applied toextract the parameters of the system. the effects of stellar on the binarysystem are studied. the paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radiiwere constrained. the orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to440days. from radial velocity measurements we find eccentricities between e=0.2to 0.76. as a case study we present a detailed analysis of kic5006817. fromseismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least165 d, roughly twice the orbital period. the stellar core rotates 13 timesfaster than the surface. from the spectrum and radial velocities we expect thatthe doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300ppm in thelight curve. through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondarycomponent to be 0.29$\pm$0.03\,$m_\odot$. for kic5006817 we excludepseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. the comparison ofthe results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possiblealignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2$\sigma$ level. red gianteccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hotsubdwarf b stars.

(2013) indicate the possibility of hd 175272having subsolar mass, while being of the order of 1000 k hotter than the sun.this seems unphysical -- standard stellar evolution theory generally does notpredict solar-metallicity stars of subsolar mass to be hotter than about 6000k-- and calls for a reanalysis of this star. aims: we aim to compare theperformance of differential asteroseismic analysis with that of grid-basedmodelling. methods: we use two sets of stellar model grids and two grid-fittingmethods to model hd 175272 and hd 181420. results: we find that we are able tomodel both stars with parameters that are both mutually compatible andcomparable with other modelling efforts. hence, with modest spectroscopic andasteroseismic inputs, we obtain reasonable estimates of stellar parameters. inthe case of hd 175272, the uncertainties of the stellar parameters from ourgrid-based modelling are smaller, and hence more physical, than those reportedin the differential analysis. conclusions: grid-based modelling provides moreprecise and more realistic results than obtained with differential seismology.

1408.0817	the connection between stellar granulation and oscillation as seen by  the kepler mission	the long and almost continuous observations by kepler show clear evidence ofa granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, which isinterpreted as the surface manifestation of convection. it has been shown thatits characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peakfrequency (\nu_{max}) of the solar-like oscillations. various attempts havebeen made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations, andto compare them to theoretical predictions. we use a probabilistic method tocompare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. we fit thepower density spectra of a large set of kepler targets, determine thegranulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relationsbetween them. we establish that a depression in power at about \nu_{max}/2,known from the sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statisticallysignificant in red giants and that a super-lorentzian function with twocomponents is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broadervicinity of the pulsation power excess. we also establish that the specificchoice of the background model can affect the determination of \nu_{max},introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the randomuncertainties. we find the characteristic background frequency and amplitude totightly scale with \nu_{max} for a wide variety of stars, and quantify a massdependency of the latter. to enable comparison with theoretical predictions, wecomputed effective timescales and intensity fluctuations and found them toapproximately scale as \tau_{eff} \propto g^{-0.85}\,t^{-0.4} and a_{gran}\propto (g^2m)^{-1/4}, respectively. similarly, the bolometric pulsationamplitude scales approximately as a_{puls} \propto (g^2m)^{-1/3}, whichimplicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of a_{puls}.

1505.01529	models of red giants in the corot asteroseismology fields combining  asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints	context. the availability of asteroseismic constraints for a large sample ofred giant stars from the corot and kepler missions paves the way for variousstatistical studies of the seismic properties of stellar populations.  aims. we use the first detailed spectroscopic study of 19 corot red-giantstars (morel et al 2014) to compare theoretical stellar evolution models toobservations of the open cluster ngc 6633 and field stars.  methods. in order to explore the effects of rotation-induced mixing andthermohaline instability, we compare surface abundances of carbon isotopicratio and lithium with stellar evolution predictions. these chemicals aresensitive to extra-mixing on the red-giant branch.  results. we estimate mass, radius, and distance for each star using theseismic constraints. we note that the hipparcos and seismic distances aredifferent. however, the uncertainties are such that this may not besignificant. although the seismic distances for the cluster members are selfconsistent they are somewhat larger than the hipparcos distance. this is anissue that should be considered elsewhere. models including thermohalineinstability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the seismicallydetermined masses can explain the chemical properties of red-giants targets.however, with this sample of stars we cannot perform stringent tests of thecurrent stellar models. tighter constraints on the physics of the models wouldrequire the measurement of the core and surface rotation rates, and of theperiod spacing of gravity-dominated mixed modes. a larger number of stars withlonger times series, as provided by kepler or expected with plato, would helpfor ensemble asteroseismology.

1505.07280	helium signature in red giant oscillation patterns observed by kepler	the space-borne missions corot and kepler have provided a large amount ofprecise photometric data. among the stars observed, red giants show a richoscillation pattern that allows their precise characterization. long-durationobservations allow for investigating the fine structure of this oscillationpattern. a common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giantstars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotictheory. this pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern,describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. we aim to investigate thedeviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them interms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium. we also show howthis seismic signature depends on stellar evolution. we measured thefrequencies of radial modes with a maximum likelihood estimator method, then weidentified a modulation corresponding to the departure from the universaloscillation pattern. we identify the modulation component of the radial modefrequency spacings in more than five hundred red giants. the variation in themodulation that we observe at different evolutionary states brings newconstraints on the interior models for these stars. we also derive an updatedform of the universal pattern that accounts for the modulation and provideshighly precise radial frequencies.

1511.02105	oscillation frequencies for 35 \kepler solar-type planet-hosting stars  using bayesian techniques and machine learning	\kepler has revolutionised our understanding of both exoplanets and theirhost stars. asteroseismology is a valuable tool in the characterisation ofstars and \kepler is an excellent observing facility to performasteroseismology. here we select a sample of 35 \kepler solar-type stars whichhost transiting exoplanets (or planet candidates) with detected solar-likeoscillations. using available \kepler short cadence data up to quarter 16 wecreate power spectra optimised for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. weidentify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by ``peak bagging''using a bayesian mcmc framework. in addition, we expand the methodology ofquality assurance using a bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. wereport the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 starsand frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. due tothe high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariancematrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. thesefrequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtaintight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.

1511.06160	internal rotation of the red-giant star kic 4448777 by means of  asteroseismic inversion	in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the earlyred-giant star kic 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of thedipole mixed modes obtained from {\it kepler} observations. in order toovercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods toextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. we find not onlythat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversionresults generated for other red giants (deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but wealso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core witha spatial resolution of $\delta r=0.001r$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharpdiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (deheuvels et al. 2014). theresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity ofabout $\langle\omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nhz and provide evidence for anangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part ofthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize therotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. theangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burningshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reachingan average value in the convective envelope of$\langle\omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nhz. hence, the core in kic~4448777 isrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficientto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the densecore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiativeregion and in the convective envelope.

astro-ph;0604502	precise radial velocities of giant stars: i. stable stars	context: future astrometric missions such as sim planetquest need very stablereference stars. k giants have large luminosities, which place them at largedistances and thus the jitter of their photocenters by companions is relativelysmall. therefore k giants would be best suited as references. to confirm thisobservationally a radial velocity survey is performed to quantify the level ofintrinsic variability in k giants.  aims: from this radial velocity survey we present 34 k giants with anobserved standard deviation of the radial velocity of less than 20 m/s. thesestars are considered ``stable'' and can be used as radial velocity standards.  methods: the radial velocity survey contains 179 k giants. all k giants havea declination between -30 and +65 degrees and visual magnitude of 3-6 mag. thecoude auxiliary telescope (cat) at uco/lick observatory is used to obtainradial velocities with an accuracy of 5-8 m/s. the number of epochs for the 34stable stars ranges from 11 to 28 with a total timespan of the observationsbetween 1800 and a little over 2200 days.  results: the observational results of the 34 ``stable'' stars are showntogether with a discussion about their position in the m_{v} vs. b-v diagramand some conclusions concerning the radial velocity variability of k giants.these results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. k giants in acertain range of the m_{v} vs. b-v diagram are suitable reference stars.

astro-ph;0608452	pulsations detected in the line profile variations of red giants:  modelling of line moments, line bisector and line shape	contents: so far, red giant oscillations have been studied from radialvelocity and/or light curve variations, which reveal frequencies of theoscillation modes. to characterise radial and non-radial oscillations, lineprofile variations are a valuable diagnostic. here we present for the firsttime a line profile analysis of pulsating red giants, taking into account thesmall line profile variations and the predicted short damping and re-excitationtimes. we do so by modelling the time variations in the cross correlationprofiles in terms of oscillation theory.  aims: the performance of existing diagnostics for mode identification isinvestigated for known oscillating giants which have very small line profilevariations. we modify these diagnostics, perform simulations, and characterisethe radial and non-radial modes detected in the cross correlation profiles.  methods: moments and line bisectors are computed and analysed for fourgiants. the robustness of the discriminant of the moments against smalloscillations with finite lifetimes is investigated. in addition, line profilesare simulated with short damping and re-excitation times and their line shapesare compared with the observations.  results: for three stars, we find evidence for the presence of non-radialpulsation modes, while for $\xi$ hydrae perhaps only radial modes are present.furthermore the line bisectors are not able to distinguish between differentpulsation modes and are an insufficient diagnostic to discriminate small lineprofile variations due to oscillations from exoplanet motion.

astro-ph;0609043	a line profile analysis of the pulsating red giant star epsilon ophiuchi  (g9.5iii)	so far, solar-like oscillations have been studied using radial velocityand/or light curve variations, which reveal frequencies of the oscillationmodes. line-profile variations, however, are also a valuable diagnostic tocharacterise radial and non-radial oscillations, including frequencies,amplitudes, the spherical mode wavenumbers (l,m) and the stellar inclinationangle. here we present a line profile analysis of epsilon ophiuchi, which is apulsating red giant. the main differences compared to previous line profileanalyses done for heat-driven oscillations are the small amplitudes and thepredicted short damping and re-excitation times in red giants.  two line diagnostics have been tested to see whether these are sensitive tothe small line profile variations present in red giants. in addition, lineprofiles have been simulated with short damping and re-excitation times and arecompared with the observations. this comparison reveals that non-radial modesare detected in the observed line profile variations of epsilon ophiuchi. thisis rather surprising, as theoretical predictions favours the occurrence ofradial modes.

0811.4674	oscillating red giants in the corot exo-field: asteroseismic mass and  radius determination	context. observations and analysis of solar-type oscillations in red-giantstars is an emerging aspect of asteroseismic analysis with a number of openquestions yet to be explored. although stochastic oscillations have previouslybeen detected in red giants from both radial velocity and photometricmeasurements, those data were either too short or had sampling that was notcomplete enough to perform a detailed data analysis of the variability. thequality and quantity of photometric data as provided by the corot satellite isnecessary to provide a breakthrough in observing p-mode oscillations in redgiants. we have analyzed continuous photometric time-series of about 11 400relatively faint stars obtained in the exofield of corot during the first 150days long-run campaign from may to october 2007. we find several hundred starsshowing a clear power excess in a frequency and amplitude range expected forred-giant pulsators. in this paper we present first results on a sub-sample ofthese stars. aims. knowing reliable fundamental parameters like mass and radiusis essential for detailed asteroseismic studies of red-giant stars. as thecorot exofield targets are relatively faint (11-16 mag) there are no (or onlyweak) constraints on the star's location in the h-r diagram. we therefore aimto extract information about such fundamental parameters solely from theavailable time series. methods. we model the convective background noise andthe power excess hump due to pulsation with a global model fit and deducereliable estimates for the stellar mass and radius from scaling relations forthe frequency of maximum oscillation power and the characteristic frequencyseparation.
