0903.0413	substructure boosts to dark matter annihilation from sommerfeld  enhancement	the recently introduced sommerfeld enhancement of the dark matterannihilation cross section has important implications for the detection of darkmatter annihilation in subhalos in the galactic halo. in addition to the boostto the dark matter annihilation cross section from the high densities of thesesubhalos with respect to the main halo, an additional boost caused by thesommerfeld enhancement results from the fact that they are kinematically colderthan the galactic halo. if we further believe the generic prediction of cdmthat in each subhalo there is an abundance of substructure which isapproximately self-similar to that of the galactic halo, then i show thatadditional boosts coming from the density enhancements of these smallsubstructures and their small velocity dispersions enhance the dark matterannihilation cross section even further. i find that very large boost factors($10^5$ to $10^9$) are obtained in a large class of models. the implications ofthese boost factors for the detection of dark matter annihilation from dwarfspheroidal galaxies in the galactic halo are such that, generically, theyoutshine the background gamma-ray flux and are detectable by the fermigamma-ray space telescope.

0903.5308	dynamical inference from a kinematic snapshot: the force law in the  solar system	if a dynamical system is long-lived and non-resonant (that is, if there is aset of tracers that have evolved independently through many orbital times), andif the system is observed at any non-special time, it is possible to infer thedynamical properties of the system (such as the gravitational force oracceleration law) from a snapshot of the positions and velocities of the tracerpopulation at a single moment in time. in this paper we describe a generalinference technique that solves this problem while allowing (1) the unknowndistribution function of the tracer population to be simultaneously inferredand marginalized over, and (2) prior information about the gravitational fieldand distribution function to be taken into account. as an example, we considerthe simplest problem of this kind: we infer the force law in the solar systemusing only an instantaneous kinematic snapshot (valid at 2009 april 1.0) forthe eight major planets. we consider purely radial acceleration laws of theform a_r = -a [r/r_0]^{-\alpha}, where r is the distance from the sun. using aprobabilistic inference technique, we infer 1.989 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2.052 (95 percentinterval), largely independent of any assumptions about the distribution ofenergies and eccentricities in the system beyond the assumption that the systemis phase-mixed. generalizations of the methods used here will permit, amongother things, inference of milky way dynamics from gaia-like observations.

0905.2980	the velocity distribution of nearby stars from hipparcos data i. the  significance of the moving groups	we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the velocity distribution ofnearby stars (&lt;~ 100 pc) using a maximum likelihood density estimationtechnique applied to the two-dimensional tangential velocities of stars. theunderlying distribution is modeled as a mixture of gaussian components. thealgorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved distribution function, even whenthe individual stars have unique error and missing-data properties. we applythis technique to the tangential velocity measurements from a kinematicallyunbiased sample of 11,865 main sequence stars observed by the hipparcossatellite. we explore various methods for validating the complexity of theresulting velocity distribution function, including criteria based on bayesianmodel selection and how accurately our reconstruction predicts the radialvelocities of a sample of stars from the geneva-copenhagen survey (gcs). usingthis very conservative external validation test based on the gcs, we find thatthere is little evidence for structure in the distribution function beyond themoving groups established prior to the hipparcos mission. this is in sharpcontrast with internal tests performed here and in previous analyses, whichpoint consistently to maximal structure in the velocity distribution. wequantify the information content of the radial velocity measurements and findthat the mean amount of new information gained from a radial velocitymeasurement of a single star is significant. this argues for complementaryradial velocity surveys to upcoming astrometric surveys.

0907.5423	galactic masers and the milky way circular velocity	masers found in massive star-forming regions can be located precisely insix-dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying milkyway dynamics. the non-random orbital phases at which the masers are found andthe sparseness of current samples require modeling. here we model thephase-space distribution function of 18 precisely measured galactic masers,permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensorrelative to their local standards of rest, and accounting for different piecesof prior information. with priors only on the sun's distance from the galacticcenter and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest, the maserdata provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the sun of v_c = 246+/- 30 km/s. including prior information on the proper motion of sgr a* leadsto v_c = 244 +/- 13 km/s. we do not confirm the value of v_c \approx 254 km/sfound in more restrictive models. this analysis shows that there is no conflictbetween recent determinations of v_c from galactic center analyses, orbitalfitting of the gd-1 stellar stream, and the kinematics of galactic masers; acombined estimate is v_c = 236 +/- 11 km/s. apart from the dynamicalparameters, we find that masers tend to occur at post-apocenter,circular-velocity-lagging phases of their orbits.

0912.3262	the velocity distribution of nearby stars from hipparcos data ii. the  nature of the low-velocity moving groups	the velocity distribution of nearby stars contains many "moving groups" thatare inconsistent with the standard assumption of an axisymmetric,time-independent, and steady-state galaxy. we study the age and metallicityproperties of the low-velocity moving groups based on the reconstruction of thelocal velocity distribution in paper i of this series. we perform stringent,conservative hypothesis testing to establish for each of these moving groupswhether it could conceivably consist of a coeval population of stars. weconclude that they do not: the moving groups are not trivially associated withtheir eponymous open clusters nor with any other inhomogeneous star formationevent. concerning a possible dynamical origin of the moving groups, we testwhether any of the moving groups has a higher or lower metallicity than thebackground population of thin disk stars, as would generically be the case ifthe moving groups are associated with resonances of the bar or spiralstructure. we find clear evidence that the hyades moving group has higher thanaverage metallicity and weak evidence that the sirius moving group has lowerthan average metallicity, which could indicate that these two groups arerelated to the inner lindblad resonance of the spiral structure. further wefind weak evidence that the hercules moving group has higher than averagemetallicity, as would be the case if it is associated with the bar's outerlindblad resonance. the pleiades moving group shows no clear metallicityanomaly, arguing against a common dynamical origin for the hyades and pleiadesgroups. overall, however, the moving groups are barely distinguishable from thebackground population of stars, raising the likelihood that the moving groupsare associated with transient perturbations.

1006.0736	tracing the hercules stream around the galaxy	it has been proposed that the hercules stream, a group of co-moving stars inthe solar neighborhood offset from the bulk of the velocity distribution, isthe result of resonant interactions between stars in the outer disk and thegalactic bar. so far it has only been seen in the immediate solar neighborhood,but the resonance model makes a prediction over a large fraction of thegalactic disk. i predict the distribution of stellar velocities and thechanging hercules feature in this distribution as a function of location in thegalactic disk in a simple model for the galaxy and the bar that produces theobserved hercules stream. the hercules feature is expected to be strong enoughto be unambiguously detected in the distribution of line-of-sight velocities inselected directions. i identify quantitatively the most promising lines ofsight for detection in line-of-sight velocities using the kullback-leiblerdivergence between the predictions of the resonance model and an axisymmetricmodel; these directions are at 250 deg &lt;~ l &lt;~ 290 deg. the predictionspresented here are only weakly affected by distance uncertainties, assumptionsabout the distribution function in the stellar disk, and the details of thegalactic potential including the effect of spiral structure. gaia and futurespectroscopic surveys of the galactic disk such as apogee and hermes will beable to robustly test the origin of the hercules stream and constrain theproperties of the galactic bar.

1007.4556	spherical harmonics analysis of fermi gamma-ray data and the galactic  dark matter halo	we argue that the decomposition of gamma-ray maps in spherical harmonics is asensitive tool to study dark matter (dm) annihilation or decay in the maingalactic halo of the milky way. using the spherical harmonic decomposition in awindow excluding the galactic plane, we show for one year of fermi data thatadding a spherical template (such as a line-of-sight dm annihilation profile)to an astrophysical background significantly reduces chi^2 of the fit to thedata. in some energy bins the significance of this dm-like fraction is abovethree sigma. this can be viewed as a hint of dm annihilation signal, althoughastrophysical sources cannot be ruled out at this moment. we use the derived dmfraction as a conservative upper limit on dm annihilation signal. in the caseof bb-bar annihilation channel the limits are about a factor of two lessconstraining than the limits from dwarf galaxies. the uncertainty of our methodis dominated by systematics related to modeling the astrophysical background.we show that with one year of fermi data the statistical sensitivity would besufficient to detect dm annihilation with thermal freeze out cross section formasses below 100 gev.

1008.4686	data analysis recipes: fitting a model to data	we go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data,using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in atwo-dimensional plane. standard weighted least-squares fitting is onlyappropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points havenegligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can bedescribed by gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met inpractice. we consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarilycovariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are baddata (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expectedintrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. above all we emphasizethe importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximateone. once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrarybecause the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of theparameters or the posterior probability distribution. construction of aposterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisanceparameters" to marginalize away.

1011.6392	think outside the color box: probabilistic target selection and the  sdss-xdqso quasar targeting catalog	we present the sdss-xdqso quasar targeting catalog for efficient flux-basedquasar target selection down to the faint limit of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) catalog, even at medium redshifts (2.5 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 3) where the stellarcontamination is significant. we build models of the distributions of stars andquasars in flux space down to the flux limit by applying theextreme-deconvolution method to estimate the underlying density. we convolvethis density with the flux uncertainties when evaluating the probability thatan object is a quasar. this approach results in a targeting algorithm that ismore principled, more efficient, and faster than other similar methods. weapply the algorithm to derive low-redshift (z &lt; 2.2), medium-redshift (2.2 &lt;= z&lt;= 3.5), and high-redshift (z &gt; 3.5) quasar probabilities for all 160,904,060point sources with dereddened i-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag inthe 14,555 deg^2 of imaging from sdss data release 8. the catalog can be usedto define a uniformly selected and efficient low- or medium-redshift quasarsurvey, such as that needed for the sdss-iii's baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey project. we show that the xdqso technique performs as well as thecurrent best photometric quasar-selection technique at low redshift, andoutperforms all other flux-based methods for selecting the medium-redshiftquasars of our primary interest. we make code to reproduce the xdqso quasartarget selection publicly available.

1101.1559	the eighth data release of the sloan digital sky survey: first data from  sdss-iii	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) started a new phase in august 2008, withnew instrumentation and new surveys focused on galactic structure and chemicalevolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering ofgalaxies and the quasar ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search forplanets around ~8000 stars. this paper describes the first data release ofsdss-iii (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the sdss). the releaseincludes five-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the southern galactic cap,bringing the total footprint of the sdss imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over athird of the celestial sphere. all the imaging data have been reprocessed withan improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometricrecalibration and flat-field determination. this release also includes all datafrom the second phase of the sloan extension for galactic understanding andevolution (segue-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 starsat both high and low galactic latitudes. all the more than half a millionstellar spectra obtained with the sdss spectrograph have been reprocessedthrough an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determinationof metallicity for high metallicity stars.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.3975	photometric redshifts and quasar probabilities from a single,  data-driven generative model	we describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating theredshift of quasars. it can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshiftranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, andnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelengthphotometry. we build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying theextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. byintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities indifferent redshift ranges. this approach allows for efficient, consistent, andfast classification and photometric redshift estimation. this is achieved bycombining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basisof our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through theuse of many simple components with many parameters. we show that this techniqueis competitive with the best photometric quasar classificationtechniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and highsignal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniqueswhen applied to broadband optical data. we demonstrate that the inclusion of uvand nir data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation andessentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent tothe ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noiseratio. for quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the sdss 84 and 97 percent ofthe objects with galex uv and ukidss nir data have photometric redshifts within0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to abouta factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. our codeto calculate quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions ispublicly available.

1109.6653	the color variability of quasars	we quantify quasar color-variability using an unprecedented variabilitydatabase - ugriz photometry of 9093 quasars from sdss stripe 82, observed over8 years at ~60 epochs each. we confirm previous reports that quasars becomebluer when brightening. we find a redshift dependence of this blueing in agiven set of bands (e.g. g and r), but show that it is the result of the fluxcontribution from less-variable or delayed emission lines in the different sdssbands at different redshifts. after correcting for this effect, quasarcolor-variability is remarkably uniform, and independent not only of redshift,but also of quasar luminosity and black hole mass. the color variations ofindividual quasars, as they vary in brightness on year timescales, are muchmore pronounced than the ranges in color seen in samples of quasars across manyorders of magnitude in luminosity. this indicates distinct physical mechanismsbehind quasar variability and the observed range of quasar luminosities at agiven black hole mass - quasar variations cannot be explained by changes in themean accretion rate. we do find some dependence of the color variability on thecharacteristics of the flux variations themselves, with fast, low-amplitude,brightness variations producing more color variability. the observed behaviorcould arise if quasar variability results from flares or ephemeral hot spots inan accretion disc.

1111.1724	the spatial structure of mono-abundance sub-populations of the milky way  disk	the spatial, kinematic, and elemental-abundance structure of the milky way'sstellar disk is complex, and has been difficult to dissect with localspectroscopic or global photometric data. here, we develop and apply a rigorousdensity modeling approach for galactic spectroscopic surveys that enablesinvestigation of the global spatial structure of stellar sub-populations innarrow bins of [\alpha/fe] and [fe/h], using 23,767 g-type dwarfs fromsdss/segue. we fit models for the number density of each such mono-abundancecomponent, properly accounting for the complex spectroscopic segue sampling ofthe underlying stellar population. we find that each mono-abundancesub-population has a simple spatial structure that can be described by a singleexponential in both the vertical and radial direction, with continuouslyincreasing scale heights (~200 pc to 1 kpc) and decreasing scale lengths (&gt;4.5kpc to 2 kpc) for increasingly older sub-populations, as indicated by theirlower metallicities and [\alpha/fe] enhancements. that the abundance-selectedsub-components with the largest scale heights have the shortest scale lengthsis in sharp contrast with purely geometric `thick--thin disk' decompositions.to the extent that [\alpha/fe] is an adequate proxy for age, our resultsdirectly show that older disk sub-populations are more centrally concentrated,which implies inside-out formation of galactic disks. the fact that the largestscale-height sub-components are most centrally concentrated in the milky way isan almost inevitable consequence of explaining the vertical structure of thedisk through internal evolution. whether the simple spatial structure of themono-abundance sub-components, and the striking correlations between age, scalelength, and scale height can be plausibly explained by satellite accretion orother external heating remains to be seen.

1111.6585	the milky way has no thick disk	different stellar sub-populations of the milky way's stellar disk are knownto have different vertical scale heights, their thickness increasing with age.using segue spectroscopic survey data, we have recently shown thatmono-abundance sub-populations, defined in the [\alpha/fe]-[fe/h] space, arewell described by single exponential spatial-density profiles in both theradial and the vertical direction; therefore any star of a given abundance isclearly associated with a sub-population of scale height h_z. here, we work outhow to determine the stellar surface-mass density contributions at the solarradius r_0 of each such sub-population, accounting for the survey selectionfunction, and for the fraction of the stellar population mass that is reflectedin the spectroscopic target stars given populations of different abundances andtheir presumed age distributions. taken together, this enables us to derive\sigma_{r_0}(h_z), the surface-mass contributions of stellar populations withscale height h_z. surprisingly, we find no hint of a thin-thick diskbi-modality in this mass-weighted scale-height distribution, but a smoothlydecreasing function, approximately \sigma_{r_0}(h_z)\propto \exp(-h_z), fromh_z ~ 200 pc to h_z ~ 1 kpc. as h_z is ultimately the structurally definingproperty of a thin or thick disk, this shows clearly that the milky way has acontinuous and monotonic distribution of disk thicknesses: there is no 'thickdisk' sensibly characterized as a distinct component. we discuss how our resultis consistent with evidence for seeming bi-modality in purely geometric diskdecompositions, or chemical abundances analyses. we constrain the total visiblestellar surface-mass density at the solar radius to be \sigma^*_{r_0} = 30 +/-1 m_\odot pc^{-2}.

1202.2819	the vertical motions of mono-abundance sub-populations in the milky way  disk	we present the vertical kinematics of stars in the milky way's stellar diskinferred from sdss/segue g-dwarf data, deriving the vertical velocitydispersion, \sigma_z, as a function of vertical height |z| and galactocentricradius r for a set of 'mono-abundance' sub-populations of stars with verysimilar elemental abundances [\alpha/fe] and [fe/h]. we find that allcomponents exhibit nearly isothermal kinematics in |z|, and a slow outwarddecrease of the vertical velocity dispersion: \sigma_z (z,r|[\alpha/fe],[fe/h])~ \sigma_z ([\alpha/fe],[fe/h]) x \exp (-(r-r_0)/7 kpc}). the characteristicvelocity dispersions of these components vary from ~ 15 km/s for chemicallyyoung, metal-rich stars, to &gt;~ 50 km/s for metal poor stars. the mean \sigma_zgradient away from the mid plane is only 0.3 +/- 0.2 km/s/kpc. we find acontinuum of vertical kinetic temperatures (~\sigma^2_z) as function of([\alpha/fe],[fe/h]), which contribute to the stellar surface mass density as\sigma_{r_0}(\sigma^2_z) ~ \exp(-\sigma^2_z). the existence of isothermalmono-abundance populations with intermediate dispersions reject the notion of athin-thick disk dichotomy. this continuum of disks argues against models wherethe thicker disk portions arise from massive satellite infall or heating;scenarios where either the oldest disk portion was born hot, or where internalevolution plays a major role, seem the most viable. the wide range of \sigma_z([\alpha/fe],[fe/h]) combined with a constant \sigma_z(z) for each abundancebin provides an independent check on the precision of the segue abundances:\delta_[\alpha/fe] ~ 0.07 dex and \delta_[fe/h] ~ 0.15 dex. the radial declineof the vertical dispersion presumably reflects the decrease in disksurface-mass density. this measurement constitutes a first step toward a purelydynamical estimate of the mass profile the disk in our galaxy.

1205.2083	low-mass suppression of the satellite luminosity function due to the  supersonic baryon--cold-dark-matter relative velocity	we study the effect of the supersonic baryon--cdm flow, which has recentlybeen shown to have a large effect on structure formation during the dark ages10 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1000, on the abundance of luminous, low-mass satellite galaxiesaround galaxies like the milky way. as the supersonic baryon--cdm flowsignificantly suppresses both the number of halos formed and the amount ofbaryons accreted onto such halos of masses 10^6 &lt; m_{halo} / m_solar &lt; 10^8 atz &gt;~ 10, a large effect results on the stellar luminosity function beforereionization. as halos of these masses are believed to have very little starformation after reionization due to the effects of photo-heating by theultraviolet background, this effect persists to the present day. we calculatethat the number of low-mass 10^6 &lt; m_{halo} / m_solar &lt; 10^8 halos that hostluminous satellite galaxies today is typically suppressed by 50 percent, withvalues ranging up to 90 percent in regions where the initial supersonicvelocity is high. we show that this previously-ignored cosmological effectresolves most of the tension between the observed and predicted number oflow-mass satellites in the milky way, obviating the need for any othermass-dependent star-formation suppression before reionization.

1205.4033	on the local dark matter density	an analysis of the kinematics of 412 stars at 1-4 kpc from the galacticmid-plane by moni bidin et al. (2012) has claimed to derive a local density ofdark matter that is an order of magnitude below standard expectations. we showthat this result is incorrect and that it arises from the assumption that themean azimuthal velocity of the stellar tracers is independent of galactocentricradius at all heights. we substitute the assumption, supported by data, thatthe circular speed is independent of radius in the mid-plane. we demonstratethat the assumption of constant mean azimuthal velocity is implausible byshowing that it requires the circular velocity to drop more steeply thanallowed by any plausible mass model, with or without dark matter, at largeheights above the mid-plane. using the approximation that the circular velocitycurve is flat in the mid-plane, we find that the data imply a local dark-matterdensity of 0.008 +/- 0.003 msun/pc^3 = 0.3 +/- 0.1 gev/cm3, fully consistentwith standard estimates of this quantity. this is the most robust directmeasurement of the local dark-matter density to date.

1209.0256	the gravitational potential near the sun from segue k-dwarf kinematics	to constrain the galactic gravitational potential near the sun ($\sim$1.5kpc), we derive and model the spatial and velocity distribution for a sample of9000 k-dwarfs that have spectra from sdss/segue, which yield radial velocitiesand abundances ([fe/h] &amp; [$\alpha$/fe]). we first derive the spatial densitydistribution for stars of three abundance-selected sub-populations byaccounting for the survey's selection function. the vertical profile of thesesub-populations are simple exponentials and their vertical dispersion profileis nearly isothermal. to model these data, we apply the `vertical' jeansequation, which relates the observable tracer number density and verticalvelocity dispersion to the gravitational potential or vertical force. weexplore a number of functional forms for the vertical force law, and fit thedispersion and density profiles of all abundance selected sub-populationssimultaneously in the same potential, and explore all parameter co-variancesusing mcmc. our fits constrain a disk {\it mass} scale height $\lesssim$ 300 pcand the total surface mass density to be $67 \pm 6 m_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at$|z| = 1.0$ kpc of which the contribution from all stars is $42 \pm 5 m_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}$ (presuming a contribution from cold gas of $13 m_{\odot} {\rmpc^{-2}}$). we find significant constraints on the local dark matter density of$0.0065\pm0.0023 m_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-3}}$ ($0.25\pm0.09 {\rm gev cm^{-3}} $).together with recent experiments this firms up the best estimate of$0.0075\pm0.0021 m_{\odot} {\rm pc^{-3}}$ ($0.28\pm0.08 {\rm gev cm^{-3}} $),consistent with global fits of approximately round dark matter halos tokinematic data in the outskirts of the galaxy.

1209.0759	the milky way's circular velocity curve between 4 and 14 kpc from apogee  data	we measure the milky way's rotation curve over the galactocentric range 4 kpc&lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc from the first year of data from the apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). we model the line-of-sight velocitiesof 3,365 stars in fourteen fields with b = 0 deg between 30 deg &lt; l &lt; 210 degout to distances of 10 kpc using an axisymmetric kinematical model thatincludes a correction for the asymmetric drift of the warm tracer population(\sigma_r ~ 35 km/s). we determine the local value of the circular velocity tobe v_c(r_0) = 218 +/- 6 km/s and find that the rotation curve is approximatelyflat with a local derivative between -3.0 km/s/kpc and 0.4 km/s/kpc. we alsomeasure the sun's position and velocity in the galactocentric rest frame,finding the distance to the galactic center to be 8 kpc &lt; r_0 &lt; 9 kpc, radialvelocity v_{r,sun} = -10 +/- 1 km/s, and rotational velocity v_{\phi,sun} =242^{+10}_{-3} km/s, in good agreement with local measurements of the sun'sradial velocity and with the observed proper motion of sgr a*. we investigatevarious systematic uncertainties and find that these are limited to offsets atthe percent level, ~2 km/s in v_c. marginalizing over all the systematics thatwe consider, we find that v_c(r_0) &lt; 235 km/s at &gt;99% confidence. we find anoffset between the sun's rotational velocity and the local circular velocity of26 +/- 3 km/s, which is larger than the locally-measured solar motion of 12km/s. this larger offset reconciles our value for v_c with recent claims thatv_c &gt;~ 240 km/s. combining our results with other data, we find that the milkyway's dark-halo mass within the virial radius is ~8x10^{11} m_sun.

1211.2616	baryon acoustic oscillations in the ly-\alpha\ forest of boss quasars	we report a detection of the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in thethree-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the\lya forest of high-redshift quasars. the study uses 48,640 quasars in theredshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-iii). at a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupolecomponents of the correlation function for separations in the range$20\hmpc&lt;r&lt;200\hmpc$. a peak in the correlation function is seen at aseparation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the baopeak within a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmology. this first detection of thebao peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansionrate $h$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $h_0$ and the baryon density,require the existence of dark energy. combined with constraints derived fromcosmic microwave background (cmb) observations, this result implies$h(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the timederivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=h(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ issignificantly greater than that measured with bao at $z\sim0.5$. thisdemonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7&lt;z&lt;2.3$, asexpected from the matter domination during this epoch. combined withmeasurements of $h_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed byacceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

1211.7073	the stellar metallicity distribution function of the galactic halo from  sdss photometry	we explore the stellar metallicity distribution function of the galactic halobased on sdss ugriz photometry. a set of stellar isochrones is calibrated usingobservations of several star clusters and validated by comparisons withmedium-resolution spectroscopic values over a wide range of metal abundance. weestimate distances and metallicities for individual main-sequence stars in themultiply scanned sdss stripe 82, at heliocentric distances in the range 5 - 8kpc and |b| &gt; 35 deg, and find that the in situ photometric metallicitydistribution has a shape that matches that of the kinematically-selected localhalo stars from ryan &amp; norris. we also examine independent kinematicinformation from proper-motion measurements for high galactic latitude stars inour sample. we find that stars with retrograde rotation in the rest frame ofthe galaxy are generally more metal poor than those exhibiting prograderotation, which is consistent with earlier arguments by carollo et al. that thehalo system comprises at least two spatially overlapping components withdiffering metallicity, kinematics, and spatial distributions. the observedphotometric metallicity distribution and that of ryan &amp; norris can be describedby a simple chemical evolution model by hartwick (or by a single gaussiandistribution); however, the suggestive metallicity-kinematic correlationcontradicts the basic assumption in this model that the milky way halo consistsprimarily of a single stellar population. when the observed metallicitydistribution is deconvolved using two gaussian components with peaks at [fe/h]~ -1.7 and -2.3, the metal-poor component accounts for ~20% - 35% of the entirehalo population in this distance range.

1212.0006	constraining the galactic potential via action-based distribution  functions for mono-abundance stellar populations	we present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the galacticpotential based on the phase-space information for many individual stars. suchan approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopicsurveys of the galaxy and in the future gaia. this approach describes the orbitdistribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (df)proposed by mcmillan and binney, which are based on actions. we find that theseparametrized dfs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-spacedistributions of individual abundance-selected galactic subpopulations of stars(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, whichenables independent dynamical constraints from each of the galacticmono-abundance populations. we lay out a statistically rigorous way toconstrain the galactic potential parameters by constructing the jointlikelihood of potential and df parameters, and subsequently marginalizing overthe df parameters. this approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selectionfunction inherent to all galactic surveys, and can account for theuncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. on that basis,we study the precision of the parameters of the galactic potential that can bereached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. bycreating mock samples from the df, we show that, even under a restrictive andrealistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitationalpotential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent withsample sizes of a few thousands. the assumptions of axisymmetry, of dfs thatare smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitationsin our current study.

1301.3459	measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations in the lyman-alpha forest  fluctuations in boss data release 9	we use the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) data release 9(dr9) to detect and measure the position of the baryonic acoustic oscillation(bao) feature in the three-dimensional correlation function in the lyman-alphaforest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. the feature is clearly detectedat significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model andmethod of error covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent withpredictions of the standard lcdm model. we assess the biases in our method,stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic effects. wefit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple thebroadband and acoustic scale information. for an isotropic dilation factor, wemeasure 100x(alpha_iso-1) = -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0(syst.) (multiple statistical errors denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits)with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological model (flatlcdm with omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). when fitting separately for the radial andtransversal dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1)= -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2} (stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). the dilationfactor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlationcoefficient of ~ -0.55. errors become significantly non-gaussian for deviationsover 3 standard deviations from best fit value. because of the data cuts andanalysis method, these measurements give tighter constraints than a previousbao analysis of the boss dr9 lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an importantconsistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.

1308.6222	quasars probing quasars vi. excess hi absorption within one proper mpc  of z~2 quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the hi lya absorptiontransverse to luminous, z~2 quasars at proper separations of 30kpc &lt; r &lt; 1mpc.in contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse toquasars exhibit enhanced hi lya absorption and a larger variance than theambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance towardsmaller scales. analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorptioncharacterized by a lya equivalent width profile w = 2.3a (r/100kpc)^-0.46. wealso observe a high (~60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick hiabsorbers (hi column log nhi &gt; 17.3) at separations r&lt;200kpc, which decreasesto ~20% at r~1mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmicaverage. this excess of optically thick absorption can be described by aquasar-absorber cross-correlation function xi_qa(r) = (r/r_0)^gamma with alarge correlation length r_0 = 12.5+2.7-1.4 mpc/h (comoving) and gamma =1.68+0.14-0.30. the hi absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of anypreviously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massivedark matter halos mhalo~10^12.5 msun at z~2.5. the environments of thesemassive halos are highly biased towards producing optically thick gas, and mayeven dominate the cosmic abundance of lyman limit systems and hence theintergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z~2.5. the anisotropic absorptionaround quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to beilluminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight, which we interpret interms of the same obscuration effects frequently invoked in unified models ofactive galactic nuclei.

1405.1032	the apogee red-clump catalog: precise distances, velocities, and  high-resolution elemental abundances over a large area of the milky way's  disk	the sloan digital sky survey iii's apache point observatory galacticevolution experiment (apogee) is a high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopicsurvey covering all of the major components of the galaxy, including thedust-obscured regions of the inner milky way disk and bulge. here we present asample of 10,341 likely red-clump stars (rc) from the first two years of apogeeoperations, selected based on their position incolor-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature space using a newmethod calibrated using stellar-evolution models and high-qualityasteroseismology data. the narrowness of the rc locus incolor-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the starswith an accuracy of 5 to 10%. the sample extends to typical distances of about3 kpc from the sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and spans a volume ofapproximately 100 kpc^3 over 5 kpc &lt;~ r &lt;~ 14 kpc, |z| &lt;~ 2 kpc, and -15 deg &lt;~galactocentric azimuth &lt;~ 30 deg. the apogee red-clump (apogee-rc) catalogcontains photometry from 2mass, reddening estimates, distances, line-of-sightvelocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances determined from thehigh-resolution apogee spectra, and matches to major proper motion catalogs. wedetermine the survey selection function for this data set and discuss how therc selection samples the underlying stellar populations. we use this sample tolimit any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the ~45degree-wide azimuthal region covered by the current sample to be &lt;= 0.02 dex,which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the radial metallicitygradient. this result constrains coherent non-axisymmetric flows within a fewkpc from the sun.

1408.5388	the milky way tomography with sdss. v. mapping the dark matter halo	we present robust constraints from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) on theshape and distribution of the dark matter halo within the milky way (mw). usingthe number density distribution and kinematics of sdss halo stars, we probe thedark matter distribution to heliocentric distances exceeding 10 kpc andgalactocentric distances exceeding 20 kpc. our analysis utilizes jeansequations to generate two-dimensional acceleration maps throughout the volume;this approach is thoroughly tested on a cosmologically derived n-body+sphsimulation of a mw-like galaxy. we show that the known accelerations (gradientsof the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such arealistic system. leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived bybovy &amp; rix (2013), we show that the gravitational potential implied by the sdssobservations cannot be explained, assuming newtonian gravity, by visible matteralone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric distancesof 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed topurely visible matter. we also show that the sdss data provide a strongconstraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential. withingalactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is welldescribed as an oblate halo with axis ratio qdm=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds toan axis ratio qdm=0.4+/-0.1 for the dark matter density distribution. becauseof our precise two-dimensional measurements of the acceleration of the halostars, we can reject several mond models as an explanation of the observedbehavior.

1409.3566	tracing chemical evolution over the extent of the milky way's disk with  apogee red clump stars	we employ the first two years of data from the near-infrared, high-resolutionsdss-iii/apogee spectroscopic survey to investigate the distribution ofmetallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of themilky way disk. using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clumpstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/fe] vs. [fe/h]distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/fe] at intermediatemetallicities, -0.9&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([fe/h]=+0.2) thetwo sequences smoothly merge. we investigate the effects of the apogeeselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have littlequalitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. the describedabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5&lt;r&lt;11 kpc and 0&lt;|z|&lt;2 kpcacross the galaxy. the [alpha/fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence issurprisingly constant throughout the galaxy, with little variation from regionto region (~10%). using simple galactic chemical evolution models we derive anaverage star formation efficiency (sfe) in the high-alpha sequence of ~4.5e-101/yr, which is quite close to the nearly-constant value found inmolecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. this result suggests thatthe early evolution of the milky way disk was characterized by stars thatshared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,turbulent, and molecular-dominated ism with a gas consumption timescale (1/sfe)of ~2 gyr. finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner galaxycan be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold inthe outer galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations withdistinct enrichment histories.

1410.1350	bayesian distances and extinctions for giants observed by kepler and  apogee	we present a first determination of distances and extinctions for individualstars in the first release of the apokasc catalogue, built from the jointefforts of the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee)and the kepler asteroseismic science consortium (kasc). our method takes intoaccount the spectroscopic constraints derived from the apogee stellarparameters and chemical abundances pipeline, together with the asteroseismicparameters from kasc. these parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsicstellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the bayesian toolparam. we then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observedphotometry in sdss, 2mass, and wise passbands. the first 1989 giants targetedby apokasc are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, withindividual uncertainties of just ~1.8 per cent. our extinction estimates aresystematically smaller than provided in the kepler input catalogue and by theschlegel, finkbeiner and davis maps. distances to individual stars in the ngc6791 and ngc 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals.comparison with the apogee red clump and saga catalogues provide another usefulcheck, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few percent.overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinctiondeterminations for the bulk of the apokasc sample. approximately one third ofthe stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions andhence increased uncertainties. uncertainties are expected to be reduced infuture releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will haveseismically-determined evolutionary status classifications.

1410.2503	the apokasc catalog: an asteroseismic and spectroscopic joint survey of  targets in the kepler fields	we present the first apokasc catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismicproperties of 1916 red giants observed in the kepler fields. the spectroscopicparameters provided from the apache point observatory galactic evolutionexperiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities,masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the keplerasteroseismology science consortium. we assess both random and systematicsources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in thekepler fields. total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of order80 k in teff , 0.06 dex in [m/h], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12% and 5% in massand radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and randomerrors. asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise andaccurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their meanvalues and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. there are, however,systematic underlying trends with teff and log g. our effective temperaturescale is between 0-200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared fluxmethod, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for alower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog (kic).we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic andspectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in kicmetallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in teffand log g consistent with those derived in the literature. we present meanfitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss futureprospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.

1410.8135	the power spectrum of the milky way: velocity fluctuations in the  galactic disk	we investigate the kinematics of stars in the mid-plane of the milky way onscales between 25 pc and 10 kpc with data from the apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee), the radial velocity experiment (rave),and the geneva-copenhagen survey (gcs). using red-clump stars in apogee, wedetermine the large-scale line-of-sight velocity field out to 5 kpc from thesun in (0.75 kpc)^2 bins. the solar motion v_{sun-c} with respect to thecircular velocity v_c is the largest contribution to the power on large scalesafter subtracting an axisymmetric rotation field; we determine the solar motionby minimizing the large-scale power to be v_{sun-c} = 24+/-1 (ran.)+/-2 (syst[v_c])+/-5 (syst. [large-scale]) km/s, where the systematic uncertainty is dueto (a) a conservative 20 km/s uncertainty in v_c and (b) the estimated power onunobserved larger scales. combining the apogee peculiar-velocity field withred-clump stars in rave out to 2 kpc from the sun and with local gcs stars, wedetermine the power spectrum of residual velocity fluctuations in the milkyway's disk on scales between 0.2/kpc &lt; k &lt; 40/kpc. most of the power iscontained in a broad peak between 0.2/kpc &lt; k &lt; 0.9/kpc. we investigate theexpected power spectrum for various non-axisymmetric perturbations anddemonstrate that the central bar with commonly used parameters but ofrelatively high mass can explain the bulk of velocity fluctuations in the planeof the galactic disk near the sun. streaming motions ~10 km/s on &gt;~3 kpc scalesin the milky way are in good agreement with observations of external galaxiesand directly explain why local determinations of the solar motion areinconsistent with global measurements.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1412.6531	estimating black hole masses in hundreds of quasars	we explore the practical feasibility of agn broad-band reverberation mappingand present first results. we lay out and apply a rigorous approach forstochastic reverberation mapping of unevenly sampled multi-broad-band fluxmeasurements, assuming that the broad-line region (blr) line flux iscontributing up to 15 % in some bands, and is directly constrained by onespectroscopical epoch.  the approach describes variations of the observed flux as the continuum,modeled as a stochastic gaussian process, and emission line contribution,modeled as a scaled, smoothed and delayed version of the continuum. thisapproach is capable not only to interpolate in time between measurements, butalso to determine confidence limits on continuum -- line emission delays. thisapproach is applied to sdss observations in 'stripe 82' (s82) providing fluxmeasurements precise to 2 % at $\sim$ 60 epochs over $\sim$ 10 years. thestrong annual variations in the epoch sampling prove a serious limitation inpractice. also, suitable redshift ranges must be identified, where strong broademission line contribute to one filter, but not to another.  through generating and evaluating problem-specific mock data, we verify thats82-like data can constrain $\tau_{\mathrm{delay}}$ for a simple transferfunction model. in application to real data, we estimate$\tau_{\mathrm{delay}}$ for 323 agn with $0.225 &lt; z &lt; 0.846$, combininginformation for different objects through the ensemble-scaling relationshipsfor blr size and bh mass. our analysis tentatively indicates a 1.7 times largerblr size of h$\alpha$ and mgii compared to kaspi2000 and vestergaard2002, butthe seasonal data sampling casts doubt on the robustness of the inference.

1501.05127	exploring anticorrelations and light element variations in northern  globular clusters observed by the apogee survey	we investigate the light-element behavior of red giant stars in northernglobular clusters (gcs) observed by the sdss-iii apache point observatorygalactic evolution experiment (apogee). we derive abundances of nine elements(fe, c, n, o, mg, al, si, ca, and ti) for 428 red giant stars in 10 globularclusters. the intrinsic abundance range relative to measurement errors isexamined, and the well-known c-n and mg-al anticorrelations are explored usingan extreme-deconvolution code for the first time in a consistent way. we findthat mg and al drive the population membership in most clusters, except in m107and m71, the two most metal-rich clusters in our study, where the grouping ismost sensitive to n. we also find a diversity in the abundance distributions,with some clusters exhibiting clear abundance bimodalities (for example m3 andm53) while others show extended distributions. the spread of al abundancesincreases significantly as cluster average metallicity decreases as previouslyfound by other works, which we take as evidence that low metallicity,intermediate mass agb polluters were more common in the more metal poorclusters. the statistically significant correlation of [al/fe] with [si/fe] inm15 suggests that $^{28}$si leakage has occurred in this cluster. we alsopresent c, n and o abundances for stars cooler than 4500 k and examine thebehavior of a(c+n+o) in each cluster as a function of temperature and [al/fe].the scatter of a(c+n+o) is close to its estimated uncertainty in all clustersand independent on stellar temperature. a(c+n+o) exhibits small correlationsand anticorrelations with [al/fe] in m3 and m13, but we cannot be certain aboutthese relations given the size of our abundance uncertainties. star-to-starvariations of $\alpha-$elements (si, ca, ti) abundances are comparable to ourestimated errors in all clusters.

1503.02110	chemical cartography with apogee: metallicity distribution functions and  the chemical structure of the milky way disk	using a sample of 69,919 red giants from the sdss-iii/apogee data release 12,we measure the distribution of stars in the [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane andthe metallicity distribution functions (mdf) across an unprecedented volume ofthe milky way disk, with radius $3&lt;r&lt;15$ kpc and height $|z|&lt;2$ kpc. stars inthe inner disk ($r&lt;5$ kpc) lie along a single track in [$\alpha$/fe] vs.[fe/h], starting with $\alpha$-enhanced, metal-poor stars and ending at[$\alpha$/fe]$\sim0$ and [fe/h]$\sim+0.4$. at larger radii we find two distinctsequences in [$\alpha$/fe] vs. [fe/h] space, with a roughly solar-$\alpha$sequence that spans a decade in metallicity and a high-$\alpha$ sequence thatmerges with the low-$\alpha$ sequence at super-solar [fe/h]. the location ofthe high-$\alpha$ sequence is nearly constant across the disk, however thereare very few high-$\alpha$ stars at $r&gt;11$ kpc. the peak of the midplane mdfshifts to lower metallicity at larger $r$, reflecting the galactic metallicitygradient. most strikingly, the shape of the midplane mdf changes systematicallywith radius, with a negatively skewed distribution at $3&lt;r&lt;7$ kpc, to a roughlygaussian distribution at the solar annulus, to a positively skewed shape in theouter galaxy. for stars with $|z|&gt;1$ kpc or [$\alpha$/fe]$&gt;0.18$, the mdf showslittle dependence on $r$. the positive skewness of the outer disk mdf may be asignature of radial migration; we show that blurring of stellar populations byorbital eccentricities is not enough to explain the reversal of mdf shape but asimple model of radial migration can do so.

1506.06144	the radial profile and flattening of the milky way's stellar halo to  $\rm 80~$kpc from the segue k-giant survey	we characterise the radial density, metallicity and flattening profile of themilky way's stellar halo, based on the large sample of 1757 spectroscopicallyconfirmed giant stars from sdss/segue-2 after excising stars that werealgorithmically attributed to apparent halo substructure (including thesagittarius stream). compared to bhb stars or rr lyrae, giants are more readilyunderstood tracers of the overall halo star population, with less bias in ageor metallicity. the well-characterized selection function of the sample enablesforward modelling of those data, based on ellipsoidal stellar density models,$\nu_* (r,z)$, with einasto profiles and (broken) power laws for their radialdependence, combined with a model for the metallicity gradient and theflattening profile. among models with constant flattening, these data arereasonably well fit by an einasto profile of $n=3.1\pm 0.5$ with an effectiveradius $\rm r_{eff} = 15\pm2~$kpc and a flattening of $q=0.7\pm 0.02$; orcomparably well by an equally flattened broken power-law, with radial slopes of$\alpha_{in}=2.1\pm 0.3$ and $\alpha_{out}=3.8\pm 0.1$, with a break-radius of$r_{break}=18\pm1$~kpc; this is largely consistent with earlier work. we find amodest, but significant metallicity gradient within the "outer" stellar halo,$\rm [fe/h]$ decreasing outward. if we allow for a variable flattening $q =f(r_{gc} )$, we find the distribution of halo giants to be considerably moreflattened at small radii, $q({\rm 10~kpc})\sim 0.57$, compared to $q(&gt;30{\rmkpc})\sim 0.8$. remarkably, the data are then very well fit by a singlepower-law of index $\rm \sim 4.2\pm0.1$ of the variable$r_q\equiv\sqrt{r^2+(z/q(r))^2}$. in this simple and better fitting model,there is a break in flattening at $\sim 20$~kpc, instead of a break in theradial density function.

1511.04088	determining ages of apogee giants with known distances	we present a sample of local red giant stars observed using the new mexicostate university 1 m telescope with the apogee spectrograph, for which weestimate stellar ages and the age distribution from the high-resolutionspectroscopic stellar parameters and accurate distance measurements fromhipparcos. the high-resolution (r ~ 23,000), near infrared (h-band, 1.5-1.7micron) apogee spectra provide measurements of the stellar atmosphericparameters (temperature, surface gravity, [m/h], and [alpha/m]). due to thesmaller uncertainties in surface gravity possible with high-resolution spectraand accurate hipparcos distance measurements, we are able to calculate thestellar masses to within 40%. for red giants, the relatively rapid evolution ofstars up the red giant branch allows the age to be constrained based on themass. we examine methods of estimating age using both the mass-age relationdirectly and a bayesian isochrone matching of measured parameters, assuming aconstant star formation history (sfh). to improve the prior on the sfh, we usea hierarchical modeling approach to constrain the parameters of a model sfhfrom the age probability distribution functions of the data. the results of analpha dependent gaussian sfh model shows a clear relation between age and[alpha/m] at all ages. using this sfh model as the prior for an empiricalbayesian analysis, we construct a full age probability distribution functionand determine ages for individual stars. the age-metallicity relation is flat,with a slight decrease in [m/h] at the oldest ages and a ~ 0.5 dex spread inmetallicity. for stars with ages &lt; 1 gyr we find a smaller spread, consistentwith radial migration having a smaller effect on these young stars than on theolder stars.

0810.5553	cosmic transparency: a test with the baryon acoustic feature and type ia  supernovae	conservation of the phase-space density of photons plus lorentz invariancerequires that the cosmological luminosity distance be larger than the angulardiameter distance by a factor of $(1+z)^2$, where $z$ is the redshift. becausethis is a fundamental symmetry, this prediction--known sometimes as the"etherington relation" or the "tolman test"--is independent of world model, oreven the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy. it depends, however, onlorentz invariance and transparency. transparency can be affected byintergalactic dust or interactions between photons and the dark sector. baryonacoustic feature and type ia supernovae measures of the expansion history aredifferently sensitive to the angular diameter and luminosity distances and cantherefore be used in conjunction to limit cosmic transparency. at the presentday, the comparison only limits the change $\delta\tau$ in the optical depthfrom redshift 0.20 to 0.35 at visible wavelengths to $\delta\tau &lt; 0.13$ at 95%confidence. in a model with a constant comoving number density $n$ ofscatterers of constant proper cross-section $\sigma$, this limit implies $n\sigma&lt; 2\times10^{-4} h \mpc^{-1}$. these limits depend weakly on thecosmological world model. within the next few years, the limits could extend toredshifts $z\approx2.5$ and improve to $n \sigma&lt;1.1 \times10^{-5} h\mpc^{-1}$. cosmic variance will eventually limit the sensitivity of any testusing the baf at the $n \sigma\sim 4\times10^{-7} h \mpc^{-1}$ level.comparison with other measures of the transparency is provided; no othermeasure in the visible is as free of astrophysical assumptions.
