hep-ph;9610325	an analysis of \pi\pi-scattering phase shift and existence of  \sigma(555) particle	in most of the nambu:jona-lasinio(njl)-type models, realizing the hiddenchiral symmetry, the existence of a scalar particle \sigma is needed with amass m_\sigma=2 m_q, as a partner of the nambu-goldstone boson \pi. however,the results of many analyses on \pi\pi phase-shift thus far made have beennegative for its existence. in this paper we re-analyze the phase-shift,applying a new method, the interfering amplitude method, which treats thet-matrix directly and describes multi-resonances in conformity with theunitarity. as a result, the existence of \sigma has been strongly suggestedfrom the behavior of the \pi\pi--&gt;\pi\pi phase shift between the \pi\pi- andthe kk- thresholds, with mass = 553.3 +- 0.5_{st} mev and width= 242.6 +-1.2_{st} mev. the most crucial point in our analysis is the introduction of anegative background phase, possibly reflecting a ``repulsive core" in \pi\piinteractions. the properties of f_0(980) are also investigated from dataincluding those over the kk threshold. its mass is obtained as 993.2 +-6.5_{st} +- 6.9_{sys} mev. its width is about a hundred mev, although thisdepends largely on the treatment of the elasticity and the \pi\pi--&gt;kk phaseshift, both of which may have large experimental uncertainties.

0901.0415	constraints on the intracluster dust emission in the coma cluster of  galaxies	we have undertaken a search for the infrared emission from the intraclusterdust in the coma cluster of galaxies by the multiband imaging photometer forspitzer. our observations yield the deepest mid and far-infrared images of agalaxy cluster ever achieved. in each of the three bands, we have not detecteda signature of the central excess component in contrast to the previous reporton the detection by infrared space observatory (iso). we still find that thebrightness ratio between 70 and 160 microns shows a marginal sign of thecentral excess, in qualitative agreement with the iso result. our analysissuggests that the excess ratio is more likely due to faint infrared sourceslying on fluctuating cirrus foreground. our observations yield the 2 sigmaupper limits on the excess emission within 100 kpc of the cluster center as 5 x10^-3 mjy/sr, 6 x 10^-2 mjy/sr, and 7 x 10^-2 mjy/sr, at 24, 70, and 160microns, respectively. these values are in agreement with those found in othergalaxy clusters and suggest that dust is deficient near the cluster center bymore than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the interstellar medium.

0908.4164	optical and near-infrared photometric observation during the  superoutburst of the wz sge-type dwarf nova, v455 andromedae	we report on optical and infrared photometric observations of a wz sge-typedwarf nova, v455 and during a superoutburst in 2007. these observations wereperformed with the kanata (v, j, and k_s bands) and mitsume (g', rc, and icbands) telescopes. our 6-band simultaneous observations allowed us toinvestigate the temporal variation of the temperature and the size of theemitting region associated with the superoutburst and short-term modulations,such as early and ordinary superhumps. a hot (&gt;11000 k) accretion disk suddenlydisappeared when the superoutburst finished, while blackbody emission, probablyfrom the disk, still remained dominant in the optical region with a moderatelyhigh temperature (~8000 k). this indicates that a substantial amount of gas wasstored in the disk even after the outburst. this remnant matter may be a signof an expected mass-reservoir which can trigger echo outbursts observed inseveral wz sge stars. the color variation associated with superhumps indicatesthat viscous heating in a superhump source stopped on the way to the superhumpmaximum, and a subsequent expansion of a low-temperature region made themaximum. the color variation of early superhumps was totally different fromthat of superhumps: the object was bluest at the early superhump minimum. thetemperature of the early superhump light source was lower than that of anunderlying component, indicating that the early superhump light source was avertically expanded low-temperature region at the outermost part of the disk.

0911.2306	is the black hole in gx 339-4 really spinning rapidly?	the wide-band suzaku spectra of the black hole binary gx 339-4, acquired in2007 february during the very high state, were reanalyzed. effects of eventpileup (significant within ~ 3' of the image center) and telemetry saturationof the xis data were carefully considered. the source was detected up to ~ 300$kev, with an unabsorbed 0.5--200 kev luminosity of ~3.8 10^{38} erg/s at 8 kpc.the spectrum can be approximated by a power-law of photon index 2.7, with amild soft excess and a hard x-ray hump. when using the xis data outside 2' ofthe image center, the fe-k line appeared extremely broad, suggesting a highblack hole spin as already reported by miller et al. (2008) based on the suzakudata and other ccd data. when the xis data accumulation is further limited to&gt;3' to avoid event pileup, the fe-k profile becomes narrower, and there appearsa marginally better solution that suggests the inner disk radius to be 5-14times the gravitational radius (1-sigma), though a maximally spinning blackhole is still allowed by the data at the 90% confidence level. consistently,the optically-thick accretion disk is inferred to be truncated at a radius 5-32times the gravitational radius. thus, the suzaku data allow an alternativeexplanation without invoking a rapidly spinning black hole. this inference isfurther supported by the disk radius measured previously in the high/softstate.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1003.0317	suzaku observation of grs 1915+105: evolution of accretion disc  structure during limit-cycle oscillation	we present results from the suzaku observation of the microquasar grs1915+105 performed during the 2005 october multiwavelength campaign. the datainclude both stable state (class \chi) and limit-cycle oscillation (class\theta). correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scatteringare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. the energy spectra inthe 2-120 kev band in both states are all dominated by strong comptonization ofdisk photons by an optically thick (\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (t_e ~2-3kev) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% ofthe total power input. absorption lines of highly ionized fe ions detectedduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. theionization stage of the wind correlates with the x-ray flux, supporting thephotoionization origin. the iron-k emission line shows a strong variabilityduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip butdisappears during the flare. we interpret this as evidence for "self-shielding"that the comptonizing corona becomes geometrically thick in the flare phase,preventing photons from irradiating the outer disk. the low-temperature andhigh luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar tothat in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries. the spectralvariability during the oscillation is explained by the change of the diskgeometry and of the physical parameters of comptonizing corona, particularlythe fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non-thermal particles.

1009.4567	transit timing variation and activity in the wasp-10 planetary system	transit timing analysis may be an effective method of discovering additionalbodies in extrasolar systems which harbour transiting exoplanets. thedeviations from the keplerian motion, caused by mutual gravitationalinteractions between planets, are expected to generate transit timingvariations of transiting exoplanets. in 2009 we collected 9 light curves of 8transits of the exoplanet wasp-10b. combining these data with published ones,we found that transit timing cannot be explained by a constant period but by aperiodic variation. simplified three-body models which reproduce the observedvariations of timing residuals were identified by numerical simulations. wefound that the configuration with an additional planet of mass of $\sim$0.1$m_{\rm{j}}$ and orbital period of $\sim$5.23 d, located close to the outer 5:3mean motion resonance, is the most likely scenario. if the second planet is atransiter, the estimated flux drop will be $\sim$0.3 per cent and can beobservable with a ground-based telescope. moreover, we present evidence thatthe spots on the stellar surface and rotation of the star affect the radialvelocity curve giving rise to spurious eccentricity of the orbit of the firstplanet. we argue that the orbit of wasp-10b is essentially circular. using thegyrochronology method, the host star was found to be $270 \pm 80$ myr old. thisyoung age can explain the large radius reported for wasp-10b.

1102.1495	first detection of ar-k line emission from the cygnus loop	we observed the cygnus loop with xmm-newton (9 pointings) and suzaku (32pointings) between 2002 and 2008. the total effective exposure time is 670.2ks. by using all of the available data, we intended to improve asignal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum. accordingly, the accumulated spectraobtained by the xis and the epic show some line features around 3 kev that areattributed to the s he$\beta$ and ar he$\alpha$ lines, respectively. since thecygnus loop is an evolved ($\sim$10,000 yr) supernova remnant whose temperatureis relatively low ($&lt;$1 kev) compared with other young remnants, its spectrumis generally faint above 3.0 kev, no emission lines, such as the ar-k line haveever been detected. the detection of the ar-k line is the first time and wefound that its abundance is significantly higher than that of the solar value;9.0$^{+4.0}_{-3.8}$ and 8.4$^{+2.5}_{-2.7}$ (in units of solar), estimated fromthe xis and the epic spectra, respectively. we conclude that the ar-k lineoriginated from the ejecta of the cygnus loop. follow-up x-ray observations totightly constrain the abundances of ar-rich ejecta will be useful to accuratelyestimate the progenitor's mass.

(b) on day 29, no such emission line wasfound. (c) on day 40, the 6.7 kev emission line emerged again. (d) on days 50and 60-150, three emission lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 7.0 kev respectively fromquasi-neutral fe, fe xxv, and fe xxvi were found. statistically significantchanges of the fe k line intensities were confirmed between day 29 and 50.based on these phenomena, we conclude that (1) the post-nova evolution can bedivided into two different phases, (2) ejecta is responsible for the x-rayemission in the earlier phase, while rekindled accretion is for the laterphase, and (3) the accretion process is considered to be reestablished as earlyas day 50 when the quasi-neutral fe emission line emerged, which is a commonsignature of accretion from magnetic cataclysmic variables.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1203.4939	gamma-ray follow-up studies on eta carinae	observations of high energy gamma rays recently revealed a persistent sourcein spatial coincidence with the binary system eta carinae. since modulation ofthe observed gamma-ray flux on orbital time scales has not been reported sofar, an unambiguous identification was hitherto not possible. particularly theobservations made by the fermi large area telescope (lat) posed additionalquestions regarding the actual emission scenario owing to the existence of twoenergetically distinct components in the gamma-ray spectrum of this source,best described by an exponentially cutoff power-law function (cpl) at energiesbelow 10 gev and a power-law (pl) component dominant at higher energies. theincreased exposure in conjunction with the improved instrumental responsefunctions of the lat now allow us to perform a more detailed investigation oflocation, spectral shape, and flux time history of the observed gamma-rayemission.  for the first time, we are able to report a weak but regular flux decreaseover time. this can be understood and interpreted in a colliding-wind binaryscenario for orbital modulation of the gamma-ray emission. we find the spectralshape of the gamma-ray signal in agreement with a single emitting particlepopulation in combination with significant absorption by gamma-gamma pairproduction.  studying the correlation of the flux decrease with the orbital separation ofthe binary components allows us to predict the behaviour up to the nextperiastron passage in 2014.

1205.6474	constraints on the galactic halo dark matter from fermi-lat diffuse  measurements	we have performed an analysis of the diffuse gamma-ray emission with thefermi large area telescope in the milky way halo region searching for a signalfrom dark matter annihilation or decay. in the absence of a robust dark mattersignal, constraints are presented. we consider both gamma rays produceddirectly in the dark matter annihilation/decay and produced by inverse comptonscattering of the e+e- produced in the annihilation/decay. conservative limitsare derived requiring that the dark matter signal does not exceed the observeddiffuse gamma-ray emission. a second set of more stringent limits is derivedbased on modeling the foreground astrophysical diffuse emission using thegalprop code. uncertainties in the height of the diffusive cosmic-ray halo, thedistribution of the cosmic-ray sources in the galaxy, the index of theinjection cosmic-ray electron spectrum and the column density of theinterstellar gas are taken into account using a profile likelihood formalism,while the parameters governing the cosmic-ray propagation have been derivedfrom fits to local cosmic-ray data. the resulting limits impact the range ofparticle masses over which dark matter thermal production in the early universeis possible, and challenge the interpretation of the pamela/fermi-lat cosmicray anomalies as annihilation of dark matter.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1501.05464	limits on dark matter annihilation signals from the fermi lat 4-year  measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background	we search for evidence of dark matter (dm) annihilation in the isotropicgamma-ray background (igrb) measured with 50 months of fermi large areatelescope (lat) observations. an improved theoretical description of thecosmological dm annihilation signal, based on two complementary techniques andassuming generic weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) properties, rendersmore precise predictions compared to previous work. more specifically, weestimate the cosmologically-induced gamma-ray intensity to have an uncertaintyof a factor ~20 in canonical setups. we consistently include both the galacticand extragalactic signals under the same theoretical framework, and study theimpact of the former on the igrb spectrum derivation. we find no evidence for adm signal and we set limits on the dm-induced isotropic gamma-ray signal. ourlimits are competitive for dm particle masses up to tens of tev and, indeed,are the strongest limits derived from fermi lat data at tev energies. this ispossible thanks to the new fermi lat igrb measurement, which now extends up toan energy of 820 gev. we quantify uncertainties in detail and show thepotential this type of search offers for testing the wimp paradigm with acomplementary and truly cosmological probe of dm particle signals.

1501.06054	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the fermi large  area telescope	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei (agns) detected by the fermi-lat(3lac) is presented. it is based on the third fermi-lat catalog (3fgl) ofsources detected between 100 mev and 300 gev with a test statistic (ts) greaterthan 25, between 2008 august 4 and 2012 july 31. the 3lac includes 1591 agnslocated at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;10{\deg}), a 71% increase over thesecond catalog based on 2 years of data. there are 28 duplicate associations,thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3fgl catalog areagns. most of them (98%) are blazars. about half of the newly detected blazarsare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficientquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. based on theirgamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split betweenflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) and bl~lacs. the most abundant detectedbl~lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (hsp) type. about 50% of the bl~lacshave no measured redshifts. a few new rare outliers (hsp-fsrqs andhigh-luminosity hsp bl~lacs) are reported. the general properties of the 3lacsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. the fraction of 3lacblazars in the total population of blazars listed in bzcat remainsnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the bzcat-blazar radio, optical andx-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazarscould eventually shine in gamma rays at lat-detection levels. the energy-fluxdistributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement withextrapolation from earlier catalogs.

1502.01390	suzaku observation of the fermi cygnus cocoon: search for a signature of  young cosmic-ray electrons	the origin of galactic cosmic rays remains unconfirmed, but promisingcandidates for their sources are found in star-forming regions. we report aseries of x-ray observations, with suzaku, toward the nearby star-formingregion of cygnus x. they aim at comparing diffuse x-ray emissions on and offthe $\gamma$-ray cocoon of hard cosmic rays revealed by fermi lat. afterexcluding point sources and small-scale structures and subtracting thenon-x-ray and cosmic x-ray backgrounds, the 2--10~kev x-ray intensitydistribution is found to monotonically decrease with increasing galacticlatitude. this indicates that most of the extended emission detected by suzakuoriginates from the galactic ridge. in two observations, we derive upper limitsof $3.4 \times 10^{-8}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~sr^{-1}}$ and $1.3 \times10^{-8}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~sr^{-1}}$ to x-ray emission in the 2--10 kevrange from the gamma-ray cocoon. these limits exclude the presence ofcosmic-ray electrons with energies above about 50 tev at a flux level capableof explaining the gamma-ray spectrum. they are consistent with the emissioncut-off observed near a tev in gamma rays. the properties of galactic ridge andlocal diffuse x-rays are also discussed.

1503.07637	the first full orbit of eta carinae seen by fermi	the binary system eta carinae has completed its first 5.54y orbit since thebeginning of science operation of the fermi large area telescope (lat). we arenow able to investigate the high-energy gamma-ray source at the position of etacarinae over its full orbital period. by this, we can address and confirmearlier predictions for temporal and spectral variability. newer versions ofthe lat datasets, instrument response functions and background models allow fora more accurate analysis. therefore it is important to re-evaluate thepreviously analyzed time period along with the new data to further constrainlocation, spectral shape, and flux time history of the gamma-ray source. weconfirm earlier predictions of increasing flux values above 10 gev toward thenext periastron passage. for the most recent part of the data sample, fluxvalues as high as those before the first periastron passage in 2008 arerecorded. a comparison of spectral energy distributions around periastron andapastron passages reveals strong variation in the high-energy band. this is dueto a second spectral component that is present only around periastron. improvedspatial consistency with the gamma-ray source at the position of eta carinaealong with the confirmation of temporal variability above 10 gev in conjunctionwith the orbital period strengthens the argument for unambiguous sourceidentification. spectral variability provides additional constraints for futuremodeling of the particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission in colliding-windbinary systems.

1506.01647	search for early gamma-ray production in supernovae located in a dense  circumstellar medium with the fermi lat	supernovae (sne) exploding in a dense circumstellar medium (csm) arehypothesized to accelerate cosmic rays in collisionless shocks and emit gevgamma rays and tev neutrinos on a time scale of several months. we perform thefirst systematic search for gamma-ray emission in fermi lat data in the energyrange from 100 mev to 300 gev from the ensemble of 147 sne type iin explodingin dense csm. we search for a gamma-ray excess at each sne location in a oneyear time window. in order to enhance a possible weak signal, we simultaneouslystudy the closest and optically brightest sources of our sample in ajoint-likelihood analysis in three different time windows (1 year, 6 months and3 months). for the most promising source of the sample, sn 2010jl (ptf10aaxf),we repeat the analysis with an extended time window lasting 4.5 years. we donot find a significant excess in gamma rays for any individual source nor forthe combined sources and provide model-independent flux upper limits for bothcases. in addition, we derive limits on the gamma-ray luminosity and the ratioof gamma-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio as a function of the index of theproton injection spectrum assuming a generic gamma-ray production model.furthermore, we present detailed flux predictions based on multi-wavelengthobservations and the corresponding flux upper limit at 95% confidence level(cl) for the source sn 2010jl (ptf10aaxf).

1508.00779	psr j1906+0722: an elusive gamma-ray pulsar	we report the discovery of psr j1906+0722, a gamma-ray pulsar detected aspart of a blind survey of unidentified fermi large area telescope (lat) sourcesbeing carried out on the volunteer distributed computing system, einstein@home.this newly discovered pulsar previously appeared as the most significantremaining unidentified gamma-ray source without a known association in thesecond fermi-lat source catalog (2fgl) and was among the top ten mostsignificant unassociated sources in the recent third catalog (3fgl). psrj1906+0722 is a young, energetic, isolated pulsar, with a spin frequency of$8.9$ hz, a characteristic age of $49$ kyr, and spin-down power $1.0 \times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. in 2009 august it suffered one of the largest glitchesdetected from a gamma-ray pulsar ($\delta f / f \approx 4.5\times10^{-6}$).remaining undetected in dedicated radio follow-up observations, the pulsar islikely radio-quiet. an off-pulse analysis of the gamma-ray flux from thelocation of psr j1906+0722 revealed the presence of an additional nearbysource, which may be emission from the interaction between a neighboringsupernova remnant and a molecular cloud. we discuss possible effects which mayhave hindered the detection of psr j1906+0722 in previous searches and describethe methods by which these effects were mitigated in this survey. we alsodemonstrate the use of advanced timing methods for estimating the positional,spin and glitch parameters of difficult-to-time pulsars such as this.

1508.03345	the design and flight performance of the pogolite pathfinder  balloon-borne hard x-ray polarimeter	in the 50 years since the advent of x-ray astronomy there have been manyscientific advances due to the development of new experimental techniques fordetecting and characterising x-rays. observations of x-ray polarisation have,however, not undergone a similar development. this is a shortcoming since aplethora of open questions related to the nature of x-ray sources could beresolved through measurements of the linear polarisation of emitted x-rays. thepogolite pathfinder is a balloon-borne hard x-ray polarimeter operating in the25 - 240 kev energy band from a stabilised observation platform. polarisationis determined using coincident energy deposits in a segmented array of plasticscintillators surrounded by a bgo anticoincidence system and a polyethyleneneutron shield. the pogolite pathfinder was launched from the ssc esrange spacecentre in july 2013. a near-circumpolar flight was achieved with a duration ofapproximately two weeks. the flight performance of the pathfinder design isdiscussed for the three crab observations conducted. the signal-to-backgroundratio for the observations is shown to be 0.25$\pm$0.03 and the minimumdetectable polarisation (99% c.l.) is (28.4$\pm$2.2)%. a strategy for thecontinuation of the pogolite programme is outlined based on experience gainedduring the 2013 maiden flight.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0008229	[ne ii] 12.8 micron images of four galactic ultracompact h ii regions:  ionized neon abundance as a tracer of the ionizing stars	we present the results of ground-based imaging spectroscopy of the [ne ii]12.8 micron line emitted from the ultracompact (uc) h ii regions; w51d,g45.12+0.13, g35.20-1.74 and monoceros r2, with 2arcsec spatial resolution. wefound that the overall distribution of the [ne ii] emission is generally ingood agreement with the radio (5 or 15 ghz) vla distribution for each source.the ne+ abundance ([ne+/h+]) distributions are also derived from the [ne ii]and the radio maps. as for g45.12+0.13 and w51d, the ne+ abundance decreasessteeply from the outer part of the map toward the radio peak. on the otherhand, the ne+ abundance distributions of g35.20-1.74 and mon r2 appear ratheruniform. these results can be interpreted by the variation of ionizingstructures of neon, which is primarily determined by the spectral type of theionizing stars. we have evaluated the effective temperature of the ionizingstar by comparing the ne+ abundance averaged over the whole observed regionwith that calculated by h ii region models based on recent non-lte stellaratmosphere models: 39,100 (+1100, -500) k (o7.5v-o8v) for w51d, 37,200 (+1000,-700) k (o8v-o8.5v) for g45.12+0.13, 35,000-37,600 (+1500, -600) k (o8v-o9v)for g35.20-1.74, and &lt; 34,000 k (&lt; b0v) for mon r2. these effectivetemperatures are consistent with those inferred from the observed ne+ abundancedistributions.

astro-ph;0610185	suzaku observation of two ultraluminous x-ray sources in ngc 1313	two ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in the nearby sb galaxy ngc 1313,named x-1 and x-2, were observed with suzaku on 2005 september 15. during theobservation for a net exposure of 28~ks (but over a gross time span of 90~ks),both objects varied in intensity by about 50~%. the 0.4--10 kev x-rayluminosity of x-1 and x-2 was measured as $2.5 \times 10^{40}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$and $5.8 \times 10^{39}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, respectively, with the former thehighest ever reported for this ulx. the spectrum of x-1 can be explained by asum of a strong and variable power-law component with a high energy cutoff, anda stable multicolor blackbody with an innermost disk temperature of $\sim 0.2$kev. these results suggest that x-1 was in a ``very high'' state, where thedisk emission is strongly comptonized. the absorber within ngc 1313 toward x-1is suggested to have a subsolar oxygen abundance. the spectrum of x-2 is bestrepresented, in its fainter phase, by a multicolor blackbody model with theinnermost disk temperature of 1.2--1.3 kev, and becomes flatter as the sourcebecomes brighter. hence x-2 is interpreted to be in a slim-disk state. theseresults suggest that the two ulxs have black hole masses of a few tens to a fewhundreds solar masses.

astro-ph;0611232	hard x-ray detector (hxd) on board suzaku	the hard x-ray detector (hxd) on board suzaku covers a wide energy range from10 kev to 600 kev by combination of silicon pin diodes and gso scintillators.the hxd is designed to achieve an extremely low in-orbit back ground based on acombination of new techniques, including the concept of well-type active shieldcounter. with an effective area of 142 cm^2 at 20 kev and 273 cm2 at 150 kev,the background level at the sea level reached ~1x10^{-5} cts s^{-1} cm^{-2}kev^{-1} at 30 kev for the pi n diodes, and ~2x10^{-5} cts s^{-1} cm^{-2}kev^{-1} at 100 kev, and ~7x10^{-6} cts s^{-1} cm^{-2} kev^{-1} at 200 kev forthe phoswich counter. tight active shielding of the hxd results in a largearray of guard counters surrounding the main detector parts. theseanti-coincidence counters, made of ~4 cm thick bgo crystals, have a largeeffective area for sub-mev to mev gamma-rays. they work as an excellentgamma-ray burst monitor with limited angular resolution (~5 degree). theon-board signal-processing system and the data transmitted to the ground arealso described.

0811.2663	broad-band spectrum of the black hole candidate igr j17497-2821 studied  with suzaku	the broad-band 1-300 kev suzaku spectrum of igr j17497-2821, the x-raytransient discovered by integral in september 2006, is presented. suzakuobserved igr j17497-2821 on september 25, eight days after its discovery, for anet exposure of about 53 ksec. during the suzaku observation, igr j17497-2821is very bright, 2 x 10^37 erg/s at 8 kpc in the 1-300 kev range, and shows ahard spectrum, typical of black hole candidates in the low-hard state. despitethe multi-mission x-ray monitoring of the source, only with suzaku is itpossible to obtain a broad-band spectrum in the 1-300 kev range with a veryhigh signal to noise ratio. a sum of a multi-color disc (diskbb) and a thermalcomptonization component (compps) with mild reflection is a good representationof our igr j17497-2821 suzaku spectrum. the spectral properties of theaccretion disc as well as the cut-off energy in the spectrum at about 150 kevare clearly detected and constrained. we discuss the implications on thephysical model used to interpret the data and the comparison with previousresults.
