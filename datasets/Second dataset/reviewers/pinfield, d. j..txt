0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0902.1812	the discovery of an m4+t8.5 binary system	we report the discovery of a t8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the m4 dwarfwolf 940. at a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 au. the m4 primarydisplays no halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of west etal. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 gyr. weak halphaabsorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limitof 6 gyr. we apply the relations of bonfils et al for v-ks and m_ks todetermine the metallicity, [fe/h] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for wolf~940a, and byextension the t8.5 secondary, wolf 940b. we have obtained jhk niri spectroscopyand jhkl' photometry of wolf 940b, and use these data, in combination withtheoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18e-16 wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(l*/lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. using the ageconstraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of baraffe etal. we determine teff = 570 +/- 25k and log g = 4.75-5.00 for wolf940b, basedon its bolometric luminosity. this represents the first determination of theseproperties for a t8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of t-dwarfspectral models. this object represents the first system containing a t8+ dwarffor which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compareits spectra with those of the latest very cool bt-settl models. this clearlydemonstrates that the use of the (w_j,k/j) spectral ratios (used previously toconstrain teff and log g) would have over-estimated teff by ~100k.

1001.0762	mid-infrared photometry of cold brown dwarfs: diversity in age, mass and  metallicity	we present spitzer irac photometry of twelve very late-type t dwarfs; ninehave [3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0] photometry and three have [3.6] and [4.5]photometry only. we investigate trends with type and color for the planning andinterpretation of surveys for the coldest t or y dwarfs. brown dwarfs witheffective temperature (t_eff) below 700k emit more than half their flux atwavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to thenear-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to t_eff. the color h-[4.5] is a goodindicator of t_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity andgravity. conversely, the colors h-k and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive tometallicity and gravity. thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide usefulindicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperatureand gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionarymodels. there are twelve dwarfs known with h-[4.5]&gt;3.0, and 500&lt; t_eff k &lt; 800,which we examine in detail. the ages of these dwarfs range from very young(0.1-1.0 gyr) to relatively old (3-12 gyr). the mass range is possibly as lowas 5 jupiter masses to up to 70 jupiter masses. the metallicities also span alarge range, from [m/h] -0.3 to [m/h] +0.3. the small number of t8-t9 dwarfsfound in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey to date appear to be mostly younglow-mass dwarfs. extensions to the mid-infrared space missions warm-spitzer andwise are desirable in order to obtain the vital mid-infrared data for coldbrown dwarfs, and to discover more of these rare objects.

1206.1200	four ultra-short period eclipsing m-dwarf binaries in the wfcam transit  survey	we report on the discovery of four ultra-short period (p&lt;0.18 days) eclipsingm-dwarf binaries in the wfcam transit survey. their orbital periods aresignificantly shorter than of any other known main-sequence binary system, andare all significantly below the sharp period cut-off at p~0.22 days as seen inbinaries of earlier type stars. the shortest-period binary consists of two m4type stars in a p=0.112 day orbit. the binaries are discovered as part of anextensive search for short-period eclipsing systems in over 260,000 stellarlightcurves, including over 10,000 m-dwarfs down to j=18 mag, yielding 25binaries with p&lt;0.23 days. in a popular paradigm, the evolution of short periodbinaries of cool main-sequence stars is driven by loss of angular momentumthrough magnetised winds. in this scheme, the observed p~0.22 day periodcut-off is explained as being due to timescales that are too long forlower-mass binaries to decay into tighter orbits. our discovery of low-massbinaries with significantly shorter orbits implies that either these timescaleshave been overestimated for m-dwarfs, e.g. due to a higher effective magneticactivity, or that the mechanism for forming these tight m-dwarf binaries isdifferent from that of earlier type main-sequence stars.

1206.2773	discovery and characterisation of detached m-dwarf eclipsing binaries in  the wfcam transit survey	we report the discovery of 16 detached m-dwarf eclipsing binaries with j&lt;16mag and provide a detailed characterisation of three of them, usinghigh-precision infrared light curves from the wfcam transit survey (wts). suchsystems provide the most accurate and model-independent method for measuringthe fundamental parameters of these poorly understood yet numerous stars, whichcurrently lack sufficient observations to precisely calibrate stellar evolutionmodels. we fully solve for the masses and radii of three of the systems,finding orbital periods in the range 1.5&lt;p&lt;4.9 days, with masses spanning0.35-0.50 msun and radii between 0.38-0.50 rsun, with uncertainties of~3.5-6.4% in mass and ~2.7-5.5% in radius. close-companions in short-periodbinaries are expected to be tidally-locked into fast rotational velocities,resulting in high levels of magnetic activity. this is predicted to inflatetheir radii by inhibiting convective flow and increasing star spot coverage.the radii of the wts systems are inflated above model predictions by ~3-12%, inagreement with the observed trend, despite an expected lower systematiccontribution from star spots signals at infrared wavelengths. we searched forcorrelation between the orbital period and radius inflation by combining ourresults with all existing m-dwarf radius measurements of comparable precision,but we found no statistically significant evidence for a decrease in radiusinflation for longer period, less active systems. radius inflation continues toexists in non-synchronised systems indicating that the problem remains even forvery low activity m-dwarfs. resolving this issue is vital not only forunderstanding the most populous stars in the universe, but also forcharacterising their planetary companions, which hold the best prospects forfinding earth-like planets in the traditional habitable zone.

1211.5288	j band variability of m dwarfs in the wfcam transit survey	we present an analysis of the photometric variability of m dwarfs in thewfcam transit survey. although periodic lightcurve variability in low massstars is generally dominated by photospheric star spot activity, m dwarfvariability in the j band has not been as thoroughly investigated as at visiblewavelengths. spectral type estimates for a sample of over 200,000 objects aremade using spectral type-colour relations, and over 9600 dwarfs (j&lt;17) withspectral types later than k7 were found. the light curves of the late-typesample are searched for periodicity using a lomb-scargle periodogram analysis.a total of 68 periodic variable m dwarfs are found in the sample with periodsranging from 0.16 days to 90.33 days, with amplitudes in the range of ~0.009 to~0.115 in the j band. we simulate active m dwarfs with a range oflatitude-independent spot coverages and estimate a periodically variablefractions of 1-3 per cent for stars where spots cover more than 10 per cent ofthe star's surface. our simulated spot distributions indicate that operating inthe j band, where spot contrast ratios are minimised, enables variability inonly the most active of stars to be detected. these findings affirm thebenefits of using the $j$ band for planetary transit searches compared tovisible bands. we also serendipitously find a \delta j&gt;0.2 mag flaring eventfrom an m4v star in our sample.

1303.0945	a highly unequal-mass eclipsing m-dwarf binary in the wfcam transit  survey	in this paper we present the discovery of a highly unequal-mass eclipsingm-dwarf binary, providing a unique constraint on binary star formation theoryand on evolutionary models for low-mass binary stars. the binary is discoveredusing high- precision infrared light curves from the wfcam transit survey (wts)and has an orbital period of 2.44 d. we find stellar masses of m1 = 0.53 (0.02)msun and m2 = 0.143 (0.006) msun (mass ratio 0.27), and radii of r1 = 0.51(0.01) rsun and r2 = 0.174 (0.006) rsun. this puts the companion in a verysparsely sampled and important late m-dwarf mass-regime. since both stars sharethe same age and metallicity and straddle the theoretical boundary betweenfully and partially convective stellar interiors, a comparison can be made tomodel predictions over a large range of m-dwarf masses using the same modelisochrone. both stars appear to have a slightly inflated radius compared to 1gyr model predictions for their masses, but future work is needed to properlyaccount for the effects of star spots on the light curve solution. asignificant, subsynchronous, ~2.56 d signal with ~2% peak-to-peak amplitude isdetected in the wfcam light curve, which we attribute to rotational modulationof cool star spots. we propose that the subsynchronous rotation is either dueto a stable star-spot complex at high latitude on the (magnetically active)primary (i.e. differential rotation), or to additional magnetic braking, or tointeraction of the binary with a third body or circumbinary disk during itspre-main-sequence phase.

0705.0272	near infrared spectroscopic search for the close orbiting planet hd  75289b	we present a search for the near infrared spectroscopic signature of theclose orbiting extrasolar giant planet hd 75289b. we obtained ~230 spectra inthe wavelength range 2.18 - 2.19 microns using the phoenix spectrograph atgemini south. by considering the direct spectrum, derived from irradiated modelatmospheres, we search for the absorption profile signature present in thecombined star and planet light. since the planetary spectrum is separated fromthe stellar spectrum at most phases, we apply a phase dependent orbital modeland tomographic techniques to search for absorption signatures.  because the absorption signature lies buried in the noise of a singleexposure we apply a multiline deconvolution to the spectral lines available inorder to boost the effective s/n ratio of the data. the wavelength coverage of80 angstroms is expected to contain ~100 planetary lines, enabling a mean linewith s/n ratio of ~800 to be achieved after deconvolution. we are neverthelessunable to detect the presence of the planet in the data and carry out furthersimulations to show that broader wavelength coverage should enable a planetlike hd 75289b to be detected with 99.9 per cent (4 sigma) confidence. weinvestigate the sensitivity of our method and estimate detection tolerances formismatches between observed and model planetary atmospheres.

1311.3617	is it possible to detect planets around young active g and k dwarfs?	theoretical predictions suggest that the distribution of planets in veryyoung stars could be very different to that typically observed in gyr oldsystems that are the current focus of radial velocity surveys. however, thedetection of planets around young stars is hampered by the increased stellaractivity associated with young stars, the signatures of which can bias thedetection of planets. in this paper we place realistic limitations on thepossibilities for detecting planets around young active g and k dwarfs. themodels of stellar activity based on tomographic imaging of the g dwarf hd141943 and the k1 dwarf ab dor and also include contributions from plage andmany small random starspots. our results show that the increased stellaractivity levels present on young solar-type stars strongly impacts thedetection of earth-mass and jupiter mass planets and that the degree ofactivity jitter is directly correlated with stellar \vsinis. we also show thatfor g and k dwarfs, the distribution of activity in individual stars is moreimportant than the differences in induced radial velocities as a function ofspectral type. we conclude that jupiter mass planets can be detected close-inaround fast-rotating young active stars, neptune-mass planets around moderaterotators and that super-earths are only detectable around very slowly rotatingstars. the effects of an increase in stellar activity jitter by observingyounger stars can be compensated for by extending the observational base-lineto at least 100 epochs.

1406.6698	high proper motion objects from the ukidss galactic plane survey	the ukidss galactic plane survey (gps) began in 2005 as a 7 year effort tosurvey ~1800 square degrees of the northern galactic plane in the j, h, and kpassbands. the survey included a second epoch of k band data, with a baselineof 2 to 8 years, for the purpose of investigating variability and measuringproper motions. we have calculated proper motions for 167 million sources in a900 square degree area located at l &gt; 60 degrees in order to search for newhigh proper motion objects. visual inspection has verified 617 high propermotion sources (&gt; 200 mas/yr) down to k=17, of which 153 are new discoveries.among these we have a new spectroscopically confirmed t5 dwarf, an additional tdwarf with estimated type t6, 13 new l dwarf candidates, and two new commonproper motion systems containing ultracool dwarf candidates. we provideimproved proper motions for an additional 12 high proper motion stars that wereindependently discovered in the wise dataset during the course of thisinvestigation.

1408.1208	binary frequency of planet-host stars at wide separations: a new brown  dwarf companion to a planet-host star	the aim of the project is to improve our knowledge on the multiplicity ofplanet-host stars at wide physical separations.  we cross-matched approximately 6200 square degree area of the southern skyimaged by the visible infrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista)hemisphere survey (vhs) with the two micron all sky survey (2mass) to look forwide common proper motion companions to known planet-host stars. wecomplemented our astrometric search with photometric criteria.  we confirmed spectroscopically the co-moving nature of seven sources out of16 companion candidates and discarded eight, while the remaining one stays as acandidate. among these new wide companions to planet-host stars, we discovereda t4.5 dwarf companion at 6.3 arcmin (~9000 au) from hip70849, a k7v star whichhosts a 9 jupiter mass planet with an eccentric orbit. we also report two newstellar m dwarf companions to one g and one metal-rich k star. we infer stellarand substellar binary frequencies for our complete sample of 37 targets of5.4+/-3.8% and 2.7+/-2.7% (1 sigma confidence level), respectively, forprojected physical separations larger than ~60-160 au assuming the range ofdistances of planet-host stars (24-75 pc). these values are comparable to thefrequencies of non planet-host stars. we find that the period-eccentricitytrend holds with a lack of multiple systems with planets at largeeccentricities (e &gt; 0.2) for periods less than 40 days. however, the lack ofplanets more massive than 2.5 jupiter masses and short periods (&lt;40 days)orbiting single stars is not so obvious due to recent discoveries byground-based transit surveys and space missions.

0804.1128	metallicities &amp; activities of southern stars	we present the results from high-resolution spectroscopic measurements todetermine metallicities and activities of bright stars in the southernhemisphere. we have measured the iron abundances ([fe/h]) and chromosphericemission indices (logr'hk) of 353 solar-type stars with v=7.5-9.5. [fe/h]abundances are determined using a custom chi^2 fitting procedure within a largegrid of kurucz model atmospheres. the chromospheric activities were determinedby measuring the amount of emission in the cores of the strong caii hk lines.the sample of metallicities has been compared to other [fe/h] determinationsand was found to agree with these at the +/-0.05 dex level for spectroscopicvalues and at the +/-0.1 dex level for photometric values. the distribution ofchromospheric activities is found to be described by a bimodal distribution,agreeing well with the conclusions from other works. also an analysis ofmaunder minimum status was attempted and it was found that 6+/-4 stars in thesample could be in a maunder minimum phase of their evolution and hence the sunshould only spend a few per cent of its main sequence lifetime in maunderminimum.

1502.06503	49 new t dwarfs identified using methane imaging	we present the discovery of 49 new photometrically classified t dwarfs fromthe combination of large infrared and optical surveys combined with follow-uptng photometry. we used multi-band infrared and optical photometry from theukirt and sloan digital sky surveys to identify possible brown dwarfcandidates, which were then confirmed using methane filter photometry. we havedefined a new photometric conversion between ch4s - ch4l colour and spectraltype for t4 to t8 brown dwarfs based on a part of the sample that has beenfollowed up using methane photometry and spectroscopy. using methanedifferential photometry as a proxy for spectral type for t dwarfs has proved tobe a very efficient technique. of a subset of 45 methane selected brown dwarfsthat were observed spectroscopically, 100% were confirmed as t dwarfs. futuredeep imaging surveys will produce large samples of faint brown dwarfcandidates, for which spectroscopy will not be feasible. when broad wavelengthcoverage is unavailable, methane imaging offers a means to efficiently classifycandidates from such surveys using just a pair of near-infrared images.

1503.04715	methane and ammonia in the near-infrared spectra of late t dwarfs	analysis of t dwarfs using model atmospheres has been hampered by the absenceof reliable line lists for methane and ammonia. newly computed high temperatureline lists for both of these important molecules are now available, so it istimely to investigate the appearance of the various absorption features in tdwarfs in order to better understand their atmospheres and validate the newline lists. we present high quality r~5000 gemini/nifs 1.0-2.4 microns spectraof the t8 standard 2mass 0415-0935 and the t9 standard ugps 0722-0540. we usethese spectra to identify numerous methane and ammonia features not previouslyseen and we discuss the implications for our understanding of t dwarfatmospheres. among our results, we find that ammonia is the dominant opacitysource between ~1.233-1.266 microns in ugps 0722-0540, and we tentativelyidentify several absorption features in this wavelength range in the t9'sspectrum which may be due entirely to ammonia opacity. our results also suggestthat water rather than methane is the dominant opacity source in the red halfof the j-band of the t8 dwarf. water appears to be the main absorber in thiswavelength region in the t9 dwarf until ~1.31 microns, when methane starts todominate.

1503.05082	a large spectroscopic sample of l and t dwarfs from ukidss las: peculiar  objects, binaries, and space density	we present the spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of late-m, l, and tdwarfs from ukidss. using the yjhk photometry from ulas and the red-opticalphotometry from sdss we selected a sample of 262 brown dwarf candidates and wefollowed-up 196 of them using x-shooter on the vlt. the large wavelengthcoverage (0.30-2.48 $\mu$m) and moderate resolution (r~5000-9000) of x-shooterallowed us to identify peculiar objects including 22 blue l dwarfs, 2 blue tdwarfs, and 2 low gravity m dwarfs. using a spectral indices-based technique weidentified 27 unresolved binary candidates, for which we determined thespectral type of the potential components via spectral deconvolution. thespectra allowed us to measure the equivalent width of the prominent absorptionfeatures and to compare them to atmospheric models. cross-correlating thespectra with a radial velocity standard, we measured the radial velocity forour targets, and we determined the distribution of the sample, which is centredat -1.7$\pm$1.2 km s$^{-1}$ with a dispersion of 31.5 km s$^{-1}$. using ourresults we estimated the space density of field brown dwarfs and compared itwith the results of numerical simulations. depending on the binary fraction, wefound that there are (0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ to (1.00$\pm$0.64) x 10$^{-3}$objects per cubic parsec in the l4-l6.5 range, (0.73$\pm$0.47) x 10$^{-3}$ to(0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ objects per cubic parsec in the l7-t0.5 range, and(0.74$\pm$0.48) x 10$^{-3}$ to (0.88$\pm$0.56) x 10$^{-3}$ objects per cubicparsec in the t1-t4.5 range. there seem to be an excess of objects in the l/ttransition with respect to the late t dwarfs, a discrepancy that could beexplained assuming a higher binary fraction than expected for the l/ttransition, or that objects in the high-mass end and low-mass end of thisregime form in different environments, i.e. following different imfs.

0806.0067	exploring the substellar temperature regime down to ~550k	we report the discovery of three very late t dwarfs in the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) third data release: ulas j101721.40+011817.9(ulas1017), ulas j123828.51+095351.3 (ulas1238) and ulas j133553.45+113005.2(ulas1335).we detail optical and near-infrared photometry for all threesources, and mid-infrared photometry for ulas1335. we use near-infrared spectraof each source to assign spectral types t8p (ulas1017), t8.5 (ulas1228) and t9(ulas1335) to these objects. we estimate that ulas1017 has 750 &lt; teff &lt; 850k,and 5.0 &lt; log g &lt; 5.5, assuming solar metallicity, an age of 1.6-15 gyr, a massof 33-70 mj and lies at a distance of 31-54 pc. we extend the unified scheme ofburgasser et al.

astro-ph;0412165	the prospects for finding brown dwarfs in eclipsing binary systems and  measuring brown dwarf properties	we present the results of a simulation to investigate the prospects ofmeasuring mass, age, radius, metallicity and luminosity data for brown dwarfsin fully eclipsing binary systems around late k and early m dwarfs identifiedby ultra-wide-field transit surveys. these surveys will monitor approximately amillion k and m dwarfs at a level sufficient to detect transits of lowluminosity companions. we look at the current observational evidence for suchsystems, and suggest that about 1% of late k and early-mid m dwarfs could havea very close bd companion. with this assumption, and using the superwasptransit survey as an example, our simulation predicts that 400 brown dwarfs infully eclipsing binary systems could be discovered. all of these eclipsingbinaries could yield accurate brown dwarf mass and radius measurements. byinferring the brown dwarf effective temperature distribution, assuming auniform age spread and an alpha=0.5 companion brown dwarf mass function, thesimulation estimates that brown dwarf brightness could also be measurable (atthe 10% level) for about 60 of these binary systems from the secondary eclipse.irradiation of the brown dwarfs will be below the 10% level for about 70% ofthese systems, meaning that the measured brown dwarf brightnesses shouldgenerally be the same as those of free-floating counterparts. the predicted agedistribution of the primaries is dominated by young systems, and about 20binaries could be younger than 1gyr. we suggest that many of these young binarysystems will be members of ``kinematic moving groups'', allowing their ages tobe accurately constrained.

astro-ph;0603320	finding benchmark brown dwarfs to probe the imf as a function of time	using a simulated disk brown dwarf (bd) population, we find that new largearea infrared surveys are expected to identify enough bds covering wide enoughmass--age ranges to potentially measure the mass function down to ~0.03mo, andthe bd formation history out to 10 gyr, at a level capable of establishing ifbd formation follows star formation. we suggest these capabilities are bestrealised by spectroscopic calibration of bd properties (teff, g and [m/h])which, when combined with a measured luminosity and an evolutionary model cangive bd mass and age relatively independent of bd atmosphere models. suchcalibration requires an empirical understanding of how bd spectra are affectedby variations in these properties, and thus the identification and study of"benchmark bds" whose age and composition can be established independently. weidentify the best sources of benchmark bds as young open cluster members,moving group members, and wide (&gt;1000au) bd companions to both subgiant starsand high mass white dwarfs (wds). we have used 2mass to measure a wide l dwarfcompanion fraction of 2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%, which equates to a bd companion fractionof 34(+9/-6)% for an alpha~1 companion mass function. using this value wesimulate populations of wide bd binaries, and estimate that 80(+21/-14)subgiant--bd binaries, and 50(+13/-10) benchmark wd--bd binaries could beidentified using current and new facilities. the wd--bd binaries should all beidentifiable using the large area survey component of ukidss combined withsloan. discovery of the subgiant--bd binaries will require a nir imagingcampaign around a large (~900) sample of hipparcos subgiants. if identified,spectral studies of these benchmark brown dwarfs could reveal the spectralsensitivities across the teff, g and [m/h] space probed by new surveys.
