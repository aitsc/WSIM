0707.1044	a low-mass h2 component to the au microscopii circumstellar disk	we present a determination of the molecular gas mass in the au microscopiicircumstellar disk. direct detection of a gas component to the au mic disk hasproven elusive, with upper limits derived from ultraviolet absorption line andsubmillimeter co emission studies. fluorescent emission lines of h2, pumped bythe ovi 1032 resonance line through the c-x (1 -- 1) q(3) 1031.87 \aa\transition, are detected by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer. theselines are used to derive the h2 column density associated with the au micsystem. the derived column density is in the range n(h2) = 1.9 x 10^{17} - 2.8x 10^{15} cm^{-2}, roughly two orders of magnitude lower than the upper limitinferred from absorption line studies. this range of column densities reflectsthe range of h2 excitation temperature consistent with the observations, t(h2)= 800 -- 2000 k, derived from the presence of emission lines excited by ovi inthe absence of those excited by lya. within the observational uncertainties,the data are consistent with the h2 gas residing in the disk. the inferredn(h2) range corresponds to h2-to-dust ratios of &lt; 1/30:1 and a total m(h2) =4.0 x 10^{-4} - 5.8 x 10^{-6} earth masses. we use these results to predict theintensity of the associated rovibrational emission lines of h2 at infraredwavelengths covered by ground-based instruments, hst-nicmos, and thespitzer-irs.

0909.4110	cosmic origins spectrograph observations of the chemical composition of  lmc n132d	we present new far-ultraviolet spectra of an oxygen-rich knot in the largemagellanic cloud supernova remnant n132d, obtained with the hubble spacetelescope/cosmic origins spectrograph. moderate resolution (v~200 km/s) spectrain the hst far-ultraviolet bandpass (1150 - 1750 a) show emission from severalionization states of oxygen as well as trace amounts of other species. we usethe improvements in sensitivity and resolving power offered by cos to separatecontributions from different velocity components within the remnant, as well asemission from different species within the oxygen-rich knot itself. this is thefirst time that compositional and velocity structure in the ultravioletemission lines from n132d has been resolved, and we use this to assess thechemical composition of the remnant. no nitrogen is detected in n132d andmultiple carbon species are found at velocities inconsistent with the mainoxygen component. we find helium and silicon to be associated with theoxygen-rich knot, and use the reddening-corrected line strengths of oiii],oiv], ov, and siiv to constrain the composition and physical characteristics ofthis oxygen-rich knot. we find that models with a silicon-to-oxygen abundanceratio of n(si)/n(o) = 0.01 can reproduce the observed emission for a shockvelocity of ~130 km/s, implying a mass of ~50 solar masses for the n132dprogenitor star.

0911.1812	atomic and molecular carbon as a tracer of translucent clouds	using archival, high-resolution far-ultraviolet hst/stis spectra of 34galactic o and b stars, we measure ci column densities and compare them withmeasurements from the literature of co and h_2 with regard to understanding thepresence of translucent clouds along the line-of-sight. we find that the co/h_2and co/ci ratios provide good discriminators for the presence of translucentmaterial, and both increase as a function of molecular fraction, f =2n(h_2)/n(h). we suggest that sightlines with values below co/h_2 ~ 1e-6 andco/ci ~ 1 contain mostly diffuse molecular clouds, while those with valuesabove sample clouds in the transition region between diffuse and dark. thesediscriminating values are also consistent with the change in slope of the co v.h_2 correlation near the column density at which co shielding becomesimportant, as evidenced by the change in photochemistry regime studied bysheffer et al. (2008). based on the lack of correlation of the presence oftranslucent material with traditional measures of extinction we recommenddefining 'translucent clouds' based on the molecular content rather thanline-of-sight extinction properties.

1004.1186	metal depletion and warm h2 in the brown dwarf 2m1207 accretion disk	we present new far-ultraviolet observations of the young m8 brown dwarf 2massj12073346-3932539, which is surrounded by an accretion disk. the data wereobtained using the hubble space telescope-cosmic origins spectrograph. moderateresolution spectra (r~17,000-18,000) obtained in the 1150-1750 a and 2770-2830a bandpasses reveal h2 emission excited by hi ly$\alpha$ photons, severalionization states of carbon (ci - civ), and hot gas emission lines of heii andnv (t ~ 10^4-5 k). emission from some species that would be found in a typicalthermal plasma at this temperature (siii, siiii, siiv, and mgii) are notdetected. the non-detections indicate that these refractory elements aredepleted into grains, and that accretion shocks dominate the production of thehot gas observed on 2mass j12073346-3932539. we use the observed civ luminosityto constrain the mass accretion rate in this system. we use the kinematicallybroadened h2 profile to confirm that the majority of the molecular emissionarises in the disk, measure the radius of the inner hole of the disk(r_{hole}~3r_{*}), and constrain the physical conditions of the warm molecularphase of the disk (t(h2)~2500-4000 k). a second, most likely unresolved h2component is identified. this feature is either near the stellar surface in theregion of the accretion shock or in a molecular outflow, although thepossibility that this jovian-like emission arises on the day-side disk of a 6m_{j} companion (2m1207b) cannot be conclusively ruled out. in general, we findthat this young brown dwarf disk system is a low-mass analog to classical ttauri stars that are observed to produce h2 emission from a warm layer in theirdisks, such as the well studied tw hya and df tau systems.

1109.1831	co and h2 absorption in the aa tauri circumstellar disk	the direct study of molecular gas in inner protoplanetary disks iscomplicated by uncertainties in the spatial distribution of the gas, thetime-variability of the source, and the comparison of observations across awide range of wavelengths. some of these challenges can be mitigated withfar-ultraviolet spectroscopy. using new observations obtained with thehst-cosmic origins spectrograph, we measure column densities and rovibrationaltemperatures for co and h2 observed on the line-of-sight through the aa tauricircumstellar disk. co a-x absorption bands are observed against the far-uvcontinuum. the co absorption is characterized by log(n(^{12}co)) = 17.5 +/- 0.5cm^{-2} and t_rot(co) = 500$^{+500}_{-200} k, although this rotationaltemperature may underestimate the local kinetic temperature of the co-bearinggas. we also detect ^{13}co in absorption with an isotopic ratio of ~20. we donot observe h2 absorption against the continuum; however, hot h2 (v &gt; 0) isdetected in absorption against the lya emission line. we measure the columndensities in eight individual rovibrational states, determining a totallog(n(h2)) = 17.9^{+0.6}_{-0.3} cm^{-2} with a thermal temperature of t(h2) =2500^{+800}_{-700} k. the high-temperature of the molecules, the relativelysmall h2 column density, and the high-inclination of the aa tauri disk suggestthat the absorbing gas resides in an inner disk atmosphere. if the h2 and coare co-spatial within a molecular layer ~ 0.6 au thick, this region ischaracterized by &lt;n_h2&gt; ~ 10^{5} cm^{-3} with an observed &lt;co/h2&gt; ratio of ~0.4. we also find evidence for a departure from a purely thermal h2distribution, suggesting that excitation by continuum photons and h2 formationmay be altering the level populations in the molecular gas.

1312.1650	direct measurement of interstellar extinction toward young stars using  atomic hydrogen lyman-$\alpha$ absorption	interstellar reddening corrections are necessary to reconstruct the intrinsicspectral energy distributions (seds) of accreting protostellar systems. thestellar sed determines the heating and chemical processes that can occur incircumstellar disks. measurement of neutral hydrogen absorption against broadlyman-$\alpha$ emission profiles in young stars can be used to obtain the totalh i column density (n(h i)) along the line of sight. we measure n(h i) with newand archival ultraviolet observations from the hubble space telescope ($hst$)of 31 classical t tauri and herbig ae/be stars. the h i column densities rangefrom log$_{10}$(n(h i)) $\approx 19.6 - 21.1$, with corresponding visualextinctions of a$_{v}$ $= 0.02 - 0.72$ mag, assuming an r$_{v}$ of 3.1. we findthat the majority of the h i absorption along the line of sight likely comesfrom interstellar rather than circumstellar material. extinctions derived fromnew $hst$ blue-optical spectral analyses, previous ir and optical measurements,and new x-ray column densities on average overestimate the interstellarextinction toward young stars compared to the n(h i) values by $\sim 0.6$ mag.we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy in the context of aprotoplanetary disk geometry.

1402.6341	high-resolution ultraviolet radiation fields of classical t tauri stars	the far-ultraviolet (fuv; 912--1700 \aa) radiation field from accretingcentral stars in classical t tauri systems influences the disk chemistry duringthe period of giant planet formation. previous efforts to measure the truestellar+accretion-generated fuv luminosity (both hot gas emission lines andcontinua) have been complicated by a combination of low-sensitivity and/orlow-spectral resolution and did not include the contribution from the brightly$\alpha$ emission line. in this work, we present a high-resolutionspectroscopic study of the fuv radiation fields of 16 t tauri stars whose dustdisks display a range of evolutionary states. we include reconstructedly$\alpha$ line profiles and remove atomic and molecular disk emission (fromh$_{2}$ and co fluorescence) to provide robust measurements of both the fuvcontinuum and hot gas lines (e.g., ly$\alpha$, \ion{n}{5}, \ion{c}{4},\ion{he}{2}) for an appreciable sample of t tauri stars for the first time. wefind that the flux of the typical classical t tauri star fuv radiation field at1 au from the central star is $\sim$ 10$^{7}$ times the average interstellarradiation field. the ly$\alpha$ emission line contributes an average of 88% ofthe total fuv flux, with the fuv continuum accounting for an average of 8%.both the fuv continuum and ly$\alpha$ flux are strongly correlated with\ion{c}{4} flux, suggesting that accretion processes dominate the production ofboth of these components. on average, only $\sim$ 0.5% of the total fuv flux isemitted between the lyman limit (912 \aa) and the h$_{2}$ (0 -- 0) absorptionband at 1110 \aa. the total and component-level high-resolution radiationfields are made publicly available in machine-readable format.

1403.6834	lyman-$\alpha$ transit spectroscopy and the neutral hydrogen tail of the  hot neptune gj436b	to date, more than 750 planets have been discovered orbiting stars other thanthe sun. two sub-classes of these exoplanets, "hot jupiters" and their lessmassive counterparts "hot neptunes," provide a unique opportunity to study theextended atmospheres of planets outside of our solar system. we describe herethe first far-ultraviolet transit study of a hot neptune, specifically gj436b,for which we use hst/stis lyman-$\alpha$ spectra to measure stellar flux as afunction of time, observing variations due to absorption from the planetaryatmosphere during transit. this analysis permits us to derive information aboutatmospheric extent, mass-loss rate from the planet, and interactions betweenthe star and planet. we observe an evolution of the lyman-$\alpha$ lightcurvewith a transit depth of gj436b from $8.8\pm4.5\%$ near mid-transit, to$22.9\pm3.9\%$ $\sim2$ hours after the nominal geometric egress of the planet.using data from the time-tag mode and considering astrophysical noise fromstellar variability, we calculate a post-egress occultation of $23.7\pm4.5\%$,demonstrating that the signature is statistically significant and of greateramplitude than can be attributed to stellar fluctuations alone. the extendedegress absorption indicates the probable existence of a comet-like tailtrailing the exoplanet. we calculate a mass-loss rate for gj436b in the rangeof $3.7\times10^6 -1.1\times10^{9}$ g s$^{-1}$, corresponding to an atmosphericlifetime of $4\times10^{11}-2\times10^{14}$ years.

1409.0861	co/h2 abundance ratio ~ 10^{-4} in a protoplanetary disk	the relative abundances of atomic and molecular species in planet-formingdisks around young stars provide important constraints on photochemical diskmodels and provide a baseline for calculating disk masses from measurements oftrace species. a knowledge of absolute abundances, those relative to molecularhydrogen (h2), are challenging because of the weak rovibrational transitionladder of h$_{2}$ and the inability to spatially resolve different emissioncomponents within the circumstellar environment. to address both of theseissues, we present new contemporaneous measurements of co and h2 absorptionthrough the "warm molecular layer" of the protoplanetary disk around theclassical t tauri star rw aurigae a. we use a newly commissioned observing modeof the hubble space telescope-cosmic origins spectrograph to detect warm h2absorption in this region for the first time. an analysis of the emission andabsorption spectrum of rw aur shows components from the accretion region nearthe stellar photosphere, the molecular disk, and several outflow components.the warm h2 and co absorption lines are consistent with a disk origin. we modelthe 1092-1117a spectrum of rw aur to derive log10n(h2)~=~19.90$^{+0.33}_{-0.22}$ at t$_{rot}$(h2) ~=~440~+/-~39 k. the co$a$~--~$x$ bands observed from 1410-1520a are best fit by log10n(co)~=~16.1~$^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$ at t$_{rot}$(co) ~=~200$^{+650}_{-125}$ k.combining direct measurements of the hi, h2, and co column densities, we find amolecular fraction in the warm disk surface of $f_{h2}$~&gt;=~0.47 and derive amolecular abundance ratio of co/h2~=~1.6$^{+4.7}_{-1.3}$~x~10$^{-4}$, bothconsistent with canonical interstellar dense cloud values.

1502.05403	mapping high-velocity h-alpha and lyman-alpha emission from supernova  1987a	we present new {\it hubble space telescope} images of high-velocityh-$\alpha$ and lyman-$\alpha$ emission in the outer debris of sn~1987a. theh-$\alpha$ images are dominated by emission from hydrogen atoms crossing thereverse shock. for the first time we observe emission from the reverse shocksurface well above and below the equatorial ring, suggesting a bipolar orconical structure perpendicular to the ring plane. using the h$\alpha$ imaging,we measure the mass flux of hydrogen atoms crossing the reverse shock front, inthe velocity intervals ($-$7,500~$&lt;$~$v_{obs}$~$&lt;$~$-$2,800 km s$^{-1}$) and(1,000~$&lt;$~$v_{obs}$~$&lt;$~7,500 km s$^{-1}$), $\dot{m_{h}}$ =1.2~$\times$~10$^{-3}$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. we also present the firstlyman-$\alpha$ imaging of the whole remnant and new $chandra$ x-rayobservations. comparing the spatial distribution of the lyman-$\alpha$ andx-ray emission, we observe that the majority of the high-velocitylyman-$\alpha$ emission originates interior to the equatorial ring. theobserved lyman-$\alpha$/h-$\alpha$ photon ratio, $\langle$$r(l\alpha /h\alpha)$$\rangle$ $\approx$~17, is significantly higher than the theoreticallypredicted ratio of $\approx$ 5 for neutral atoms crossing the reverse shockfront. we attribute this excess to lyman-$\alpha$ emission produced by x-rayheating of the outer debris. the spatial orientation of the lyman-$\alpha$ andx-ray emission suggests that x-ray heating of the outer debris is the dominantlyman-$\alpha$ production mechanism in sn 1987a at this phase in its evolution.

1509.02172	the evolution of inner disk gas in transition disks	investigating the molecular gas in the inner regions of protoplanetary disksprovides insight into how the molecular disk environment changes during thetransition from primordial to debris disk systems. we conduct a small survey ofmolecular hydrogen (h$_2$) fluorescent emission, using 14 well-studiedclassical t tauri stars at two distinct dust disk evolutionary stages, toexplore how the structure of the inner molecular disk changes as the opticallythick warm dust dissipates. we simulate the observed hi-lyman $\alpha$-pumpedh$_2$ disk fluorescence by creating a 2d radiative transfer model thatdescribes the radial distributions of h$_{2}$ emission in the disk atmosphereand compare these to observations from the hubble space telescope. we find theradial distributions that best describe the observed h$_2$ fuv emission arisingin primordial disk targets (full dust disk) are demonstrably different thanthose of transition disks (little-to-no warm dust observed). for each best-fitmodel, we estimate inner and outer disk emission boundaries (r$_{in}$ andr$_{out}$), describing where the bulk of the observed h$_2$ emission arises ineach disk, and we examine correlations between these and several observationaldisk evolution indicators, such as n$_{13-31}$, r$_{in,co}$, and the massaccretion rate. we find strong, positive correlations between the h$_2$ radialdistributions and the slope of the dust sed, implying the behavior of themolecular disk atmosphere changes as the inner dust clears in evolvingprotoplanetary disks. overall, we find that h$_2$ inner radii are $\sim$4 timeslarger in transition systems, while the bulk of the h$_2$ emission originatesinside the dust gap radius for all transitional sources.

astro-ph;0407464	fortis: pathfinder to the lyman continuum	shull et al. (1999) have asserted that the contribution of stars, relative toquasars, to the metagalactic background radiation that ionizes most of thebaryons in the universe remains almost completely unknown at all epochs. thepotential to directly quantify this contribution at low redshift has recentlybecome possible with the identification by galex of large numbers of sparselydistributed faint ultraviolet galaxies. neither stis nor fuse nor galex havethe ability to efficiently survey these sparse fields and directly measure thelyman continuum radiation that may leak into the low redshift (z &lt; 0.4)intergalactic medium. we present here a design for a new type of farultraviolet spectrograph, one that is more sensitive, covers wider fields, andcan provide spectra and images of a large number of objects simultaneously,called the far-ultraviolet off rowland-circle telescope for imaging andspectroscopy (fortis). we intend to use a sounding rocket flight to validatethe new instrument with a simple long-slit observation of the starburstpopulations in the galaxy m83. if however, the long-slit were replaced withmicroshutter array, this design could isolate the chains of blue galaxies foundby galex over an ~30' diameter field-of-view and directly address the lymancontinuum problem in a long duration orbital mission. thus, our development ofthe sounding rocket instrument is a pathfinder to a new wide fieldspectroscopic technology for enabling the potential discovery of the longhypothesized but elusive lyman continuum radiation that is thought to leak fromlow redshift galaxies and contribute to the ionization of the universe.

astro-ph;0610953	a cometary bow shock and mid-infrared emission variations revealed in  spitzer observations of hd 34078 and ic 405	we present new infrared observations of the emission/reflection nebula ic 405obtained with the spitzer space telescope. infrared images in the four iracbands (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 um) and two mips bands (24 and 70 um) arecomplemented by irs spectroscopy (5-30 um) of two nebular filaments. the irac(8.0 um) and mips imaging shows evidence of a bow shock associated with therunaway o9.5v star, hd 34078, created by the interaction between the star andnebular material. the ratio of emission at 24 to 70 um is higher in theimmediate vicinity of hd 34078 than in the outer filaments, providing evidencefor elevated dust temperatures (t_d &gt; 90 k) in the shock region. the nebularimaging reveals that the morphology is band dependent, with varyingcontributions from aromatic emission features, h2, and dust emission. nebularspectroscopy is used to quantify these contributions, showing several aromaticemission bands between 6-14 um, the s(5), s(3), s(2), and s(1) pure rotationalemission lines of h2, and atomic fine structure lines of ne, s, and ar. thelow-dispersion spectra provide constraints on the ionization state of the largemolecules responsible for the aromatic infrared features. h2 rotationaltemperatures of the two bright nebular filaments are determined from theobserved line strengths. an average t(h2) ~ 400 k is inferred, with evidencefor additional non-uniform excitation by uv photons in the intense radiationfield of hd 34078. the photoexcitation hypothesis is supported by directmeasurement of the far-uv h2 fluorescence spectrum, obtained with fuse.

astro-ph;0611853	direct measurement of the ratio of carbon monoxide to molecular hydrogen  in the diffuse interstellar medium	we have used archival far-ultraviolet spectra from observations made byhst/stis and fuse to determine the column densities and rotational excitationtemperatures for co and h2, respectively, along the lines of sight to 23galactic o and b stars. the sightlines have reddening values in the rangee(b-v)= 0.07-0.62, sampling the diffuse to translucent interstellar medium. wefind that the h2 column densities range from 5x10^18-8x10^20 cm^-2 and the cofrom upper limits around 2x10^12 cm^-2 to detections as high as 1.4x10^16cm^-2. co increases with increasing h2, roughly following a power law of factor\~2. the co/h2 column density ratio is thus not constant, and ranges from 10^-7- 10^-5, with a mean value of 3x10^-6. the sample segregates into "diffuse" and"translucent" regimes, the former having a molecular fraction less than ~0.25and a_v/d&lt;1 mag kpc^-1. the mean co/h2 for these two regimes are 3.6x10^-7 and9.3x10^-6, respectively, significantly lower than the canonical dark cloudvalue of 10^-4. in six of the sightlines, 13co is observed, and the isotopicratio we observe (~50-70) is consistent with, if perhaps a little below, theaverage 12c/13c for the ism at large. the average h2 rotational excitationtemperature is 74+/-24 k, in good agreement with previous studies, and theaverage co temperature is 4.1 k, with some sightlines as high as 6.4 k. thehigher excitation co is observed with higher column densities, consistent withthe effects of photon trapping in clouds with densities in the 20-100 cm^-3range. we discuss the implications for the structure of the diffuse/translucentregimes of the interstellar medium and the estimation of molecular mass ingalaxies.
