0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

0704.2136	the colour selection of distant galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey  early data release	we investigate colour selection techniques for high redshift galaxies in theukidss ultra deep survey early data release (uds edr). combined with very deepsubaru optical photometry, the depth (k_ab = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of theuds edr allows us to investigate optical/near-ir selection using a large sampleof over 30,000 objects. by using the b-z, z-k colour-colour diagram (the bzktechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z &gt; 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pbzk and sbzkrespectively). our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in bzk diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z &lt; 1.4. we also compare the bzk technique with ther-k colour selection of extremely red objects (eros) and the j-k selection ofdistant red galaxies (drgs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. we find that the majority of drgs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also eros. since previous studies have found that drgs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these drg/ero galaxieshave seds consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or agn at z &lt; 2.finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pbzk galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z &gt; 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

0710.3136	on the evolution of clustering of 24um-selected galaxies	this paper investigates the clustering properties of a complete sample of1041 24um-selected sources brighter than f[24um]=400 ujy in the overlappingregion between the swire and ukidss uds surveys. we have concentrated on thetwo (photometric) interval ranges z=[0.6-1.2] (low-z sample) and z&gt;1.6 (high-zsample) as it is in these regions were we expect the mid-ir population to bedominated by intense dust-enshrouded activity such as star formation and blackhole accretion. investigations of the angular correlation function produce acorrelation length are r0~15.9 mpc for the high-z sample and r0~8.5 mpc for thelow-z one. comparisons with physical models reveal that the high-z sources areexclusively associated with very massive (m&gt;~10^{13} m_sun)haloes, comparableto those which locally host groups-to-clusters of galaxies, and are very commonwithin such (rare) structures. conversely, lower-z galaxies are found to residein smaller halos (m_min~10^{12} m_sun) and to be very rare in such systems.while recent studies have determined a strong evolution of the 24um luminosityfunction between z~2 and z~0, they cannot provide information on the physicalnature of such an evolution. our clustering results instead indicate that thisis due to the presence of different populations of objects inhabiting differentstructures, as active systems at z&lt;~1.5 are found to be exclusively associatedwith low-mass galaxies, while very massive sources appear to have concludedtheir active phase before this epoch. finally, we note that the small-scaleclustering data seem to require steep profiles for the distribution of galaxieswithin their halos. this is suggestive of close encounters and/or mergers whichcould strongly favour both agn and star-formation activity.

1201.3609	improved constraints on the expansion rate of the universe up to z~1.1  from the spectroscopic evolution of cosmic chronometers	we present new improved constraints on the hubble parameter h(z) in theredshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopicevolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. we extract a largesample of early-type galaxies (\sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys,spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.42). weselect the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving andwithout signature of ongoing star formation. those galaxies can be used asstandard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by jimenez &amp; loeb (2002),whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probesh(z). we analyze the 4000 {\aa} break (d4000) as a function of redshift, usestellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependenceof the differential age evolution on the differential d4000, and estimate thehubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors.we provide 8 new measurements of h(z) (see tab. 4), and determine its change inh(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z\sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on h(z) at z \neq 0 with aprecision comparable with the one achieved for the hubble constant (about 5-6%at z \sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) which is crucialto distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. these measurements havebeen tested to best match a \lambda cdm model, clearly providing astatistically robust indication that the universe is undergoing an acceleratedexpansion. this method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constraina variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g.euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \sim 2.

1205.4058	the sizes, masses and specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies  at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5: strong evidence in favour of evolution via minor mergers	we report the results of a comprehensive study of the relationship betweengalaxy size, stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) at redshifts1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5. based on a mass complete (m_star &gt;= 6x10^10 msun), spectroscopicsample from the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), with accurate stellar-massmeasurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4the location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarilyby their ssfr. at this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive(ssfr &lt;= 0.1 gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii afactor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. moreover, amongst thepassive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the localsize-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. based on asub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimateof f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 andthe present day. focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that toproduce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would requirean unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end ofthe local stellar mass function. in contrast, we find that a scenario in whichmass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessaryevolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompaniedby an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile thesize-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally. finally, we note that asignificant fraction (44+/-12%) of the passive galaxies in our sample have adisk-like morphology, providing additional evidence that separate physicalprocesses are responsible for the quenching of star-formation and themorphological transformation of massive galaxies (abridged).

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1408.5407	the stellar-to-halo mass relations of local galaxies segregates by color	we derive the stellar-to-halo mass relations, shmr, of local blue and redcentral galaxies separately, as well as the fraction of halos hosting blue/redcentral galaxies. we find that: 1) the shmr of central galaxies is segregatedby color, with blue centrals having a shmr above the one of red centrals; atlogmh~12, the ms/mh ratio of the blue centrals is ~0.05, which is ~1.7 timeslarger than the value of red centrals. 2) the intrinsic scatters of the shmrsof red and blue centrals are ~0.14 and ~0.11dex, respectively. the intrinsicscatter of the average shmr of all central galaxies changes from ~0.20dex to~0.14dex in the 11.3&lt;logmh&lt;15 range. 3) the fraction of halos hosting bluecentrals at mh=1e11msun is 87%, but at 2x1e12msun decays to ~20%, approachingto a few per cents at higher masses. the characteristic mass at which thisfraction is the same for blue and red galaxies is mh~7x1e11msun. our resultssuggest that the shmr of central galaxies at large masses is shaped by halomass quenching (likely through shock virial heating and agn feedback), butgroup richness also plays an important role: central galaxies living in lessdense environments quenched their star formation later or did not quench ityet. at low masses, processes that delay star formation without invoking toostrong supernova-driven outflows could explain the high ms/mh ratios of bluecentrals as compared to those of the scarce red centrals.

0804.3471	a new measurement of the evolving near-infrared galaxy luminosity  function out to z~4: a continuing challenge to theoretical models of galaxy  formation	we present the most accurate measurement to date of cosmological evolution ofthe near-infrared galaxy luminosity function, from the local universe out toz~4. the analysis is based on a large and highly complete sample of galaxiesselected from the first data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey.exploiting a master catalogue of k- and z-band selected galaxies over an areaof 0.7 square degrees, we analyse a sample of ~50,000 galaxies, all withreliable photometry in 16-bands from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.the unique combination of large area and depth provided by the ultra deepsurvey allows us to trace the evolution of the k-band luminosity function withunprecedented accuracy. in particular, via a maximum likelihood analysis weobtain a simple parameterization for the luminosity function and itscosmological evolution, including both luminosity and density evolution, whichprovides an excellent description of the data from z =0 up to z~4. we finddifferential evolution for galaxies dependent on galaxy luminosity, revealingonce again the ``down-sizing behaviour'' of galaxy formation. finally, wecompare our results with the predictions of the latest theoretical models ofgalaxy formation, based both on semi-analytical prescriptions, and on fullhydrodynamical simulations.

0804.4568	the vimos vlt deep survey: global properties of 20000 galaxies in the  i_ab&lt;=22.5 wide survey	the vvds-wide survey has been designed with the general aim of tracing thelarge-scale distribution of galaxies at z~1 on comoving scales reaching~100mpc/h, while providing a good control of cosmic variance over areas aslarge as a few square degrees. this is achieved by measuring redshifts withvimos at the eso vlt to a limiting magnitude i_ab=22.5, targeting fourindependent fields with size up to 4 sq.deg. each. the whole survey covers 8.6sq.deg., here we present the general properties of the current redshift sample.this includes 32734 spectra in the four regions (19977 galaxies, 304 type iagns, and 9913 stars), covering a total area of 6.1 sq.deg, with a samplingrate of 22 to 24%. the redshift success rate is above 90% independently ofmagnitude. it is the currently largest area coverage among redshift surveysreaching z~1. we give the mean n(z) distribution averaged over 6.1 sq.deg.comparing galaxy densities from the four fields shows that in a redshift bindeltaz=0.1 at z~1 one still has factor-of-two variations over areas as large as~0.25 sq.deg. this level of cosmic variance agrees with that obtained byintegrating the galaxy two-point correlation function estimated from the f22field alone, and is also in fairly good statistical agreement with thatpredicted by the millennium mocks. the variance estimated over the surveyfields shows explicitly how clustering results from deep surveys of even ~1sq.deg. size should be interpreted with caution. this paper accompanies thepublic release of the first 18143 redshifts of the vvds-wide survey from the 4sq.deg. contiguous area of the f22 field at ra=22h, publicly available athttp://cencosw.oamp.fr

0805.1335	the luminosity function, halo masses and stellar masses of luminous  lyman-break galaxies at redshifts 5&lt;z&lt;6	we present the results of a study of a large sample of luminous (z'{ab}&lt;26)lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the redshift interval 4.7&lt;z&lt;6.3, selected from acontiguous 0.63 square degree area covered by the ukidss ultra deep survey(uds) and the subaru xmm-newton survey (sxds). utilising the large areacoverage and the excellent available optical+nearir data, we use a photometricredshift analysis to derive a new, robust, measurement of the bright end (l&gt;l*)of the uv-selected luminosity function at high redshift. when combined withliterature studies of the fainter lbg population, our new sample providesimproved constraints on the luminosity function of redshift 5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs over theluminosity range 0.1l*&lt;l&lt;10l*. a maximum likelihood analysis returnsbest-fitting schechter function parameters of m*_1500=-20.73, phi*=0.0009mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.66 for the luminosity function at z=5, and m*_1500 =-20.04, phi*=0.0018 mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.71 at z=6. in addition, an analysis ofthe angular clustering properties of our lbg sample demonstrates that luminous5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs are strongly clustered (r_0 = 8.1 mpc), and are consistent with theoccupation of dark matter halos with masses of ~10^{11.5-12.0} msun. moreover,by stacking the available multi-wavelength imaging data for the high-redshiftlbgs it is possible to place useful constraints on their typical stellar mass.the results of this analysis suggest that luminous lbgs at 5&lt;z&lt;6 have anaverage stellar mass of ~10^10 msun, consistent with the results of theclustering analysis assuming plausible values for the ratio of stellar to darkmatter. finally, by combining our luminosity function results with those of thestacking analysis we derive estimates of ~1x10^7 msun mpc^-3 and 4x10^6 msunmpc^-3 for the stellar mass density at z~5 and z~6 respectively.

0705.2438	the swire-vvds-cfhtls surveys: stellar mass assembly over the last 10  gyears. evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1	(abridged abstract) we present an analysis of the stellar mass growth overthe last 10 gyrs using a large 3.6$\mu$ selected sample. we split our sampleinto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. our measurements of the k-lfsand ld evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is alreadyassembled at $z\sim 1.2$. based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellarmass-to-light ratio (in k-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive thestellar mass density for the entire sample. we find that the global evolutionof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation ratederived from uv dust corrected measurements. over the last 8gyrs, we observethat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximatelyconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over thesame timescale. as a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in thequiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in activegalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. from $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, weobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by afactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch whenan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity andstart to build up the red sequence.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

astro-ph;0509628	a large population of galaxies 9 to 12 billion years back in the history  of the universe	to understand the evolution of galaxies, we need to know as accurately aspossible how many galaxies were present in the universe at different epochs.galaxies in the young universe have hitherto mainly been identified using theirexpected optical colours, but this leaves open the possibility that asignificant population remains undetected because their colours are the resultof a complex mix of stars, gas, dust or active galactic nuclei. here we reportthe results of a flux-limited i-band survey of galaxies at look-back times of 9to 12 billion years. we find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between1.4 and 5. this population is 1.6 to 6.2 times larger than previous estimates,with the difference increasing towards brighter magnitudes. strong ultravioletcontinua (in the rest frame of the galaxies) indicate vigorous star formationrates of more than 10 to 100 solar masses per year. as a consequence, thecosmic star formation rate is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3to 4.

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0607242	aegis: the diversity of bright near-ir selected distant red galaxies	we use deep and wide near infrared (nir) imaging from the palomar telescopecombined with deep2 spectroscopy and hubble space telescope (hst) and chandraspace telescope imaging to investigate the nature of galaxies that are red innir colors. we locate these `distant red galaxies' (drgs) through the color cut(j-k)_{vega} &gt; 2.3 over 0.7 deg^{2}, where we find 1010 drg candidates down tok_s = 20.5. we combine 95 high quality spectroscopic redshifts with photometricredshifts from brijk photometry to determine the redshift and stellar massdistributions for these systems, and morphological/structural and x-rayproperties for 107 drgs in the extended groth strip. we find that many bright(j-k)_{vega}&gt;2.3 galaxies with k_s&lt;20.5 are at redshifts z&lt;2, with 64% between1&lt;z&lt;2. the stellar mass distributions for these galaxies is broad, ranging from10^{9}-10^{12} m_solar, but with most z&gt;2 systems massive with m_*&gt;10^{11}m_solar. hst imaging shows that the structural properties and morphologies ofdrgs are also diverse, with the majority elliptical/compact (57%), and theremainder edge-on spirals (7%), and peculiar galaxies (29%). the drgs at z &lt;1.4 with high quality spectroscopic redshifts are generally compact, with smallhalf light radii, and span a range in rest-frame optical properties. thespectral energy distributions for these objects differ from higher redshiftdrgs: they are bluer by one magnitude in observed (i-j) color. a pure ir colorselection of high redshift populations is not sufficient to identify uniquepopulations, and other colors, or spectroscopic redshifts are needed to producehomogeneous samples.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0609287	the evolution of the near-ir galaxy luminosity function and colour  bimodality up to z ~ 2 from the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infraredgalaxy luminosity function, derived from the analysis of a new sample of\~22,000 k(ab) &lt; 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees fromthe early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds). our study hasexploited the multi-wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the newukidss wfcam k and j-band imaging, the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and thespitzer-swire survey. the unique combination of large area and depth providedby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and hasallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sourcesout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.  in agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosityof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0and z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2. using the rest-frame(u-b) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm theclassic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z&lt;1. however, the strength ofthe colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, andseems to disappear by z&gt;1.5. due to the large size of our sample we are able toinvestigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxypopulations. it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies(m_k &lt; -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sourcesdominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&lt;1. incontrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease inspace density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominatethe bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&gt;1.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

0809.2677	the clustering and abundance of star-forming and passive galaxies at $z  \sim 2$	we use the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), currently the deepest panoramicnear infra-red survey, together with deep subaru optical imaging to measure theclustering, number counts and luminosity function of galaxies at $z\sim 2$selected using the bzk selection technique. we find that both star-forming(sbzk) and passive (pbzk) galaxies, to a magnitude limit of $k_{ab} &lt; 23$, arestrongly clustered. the passive galaxies are the most strongly clusteredpopulation, with scale lengths of $r_0 = 15.0^{+1.9}_{-2.2}$h$^{-1}$mpccompared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$mpc for star-forminggalaxies. the direct implication is that passive galaxies inhabit the mostmassive dark-matter halos, and are thus identified as the progenitors of themost massive galaxies at the present day. in addition, the pbzks exhibit asharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreementwith other recent studies. this plateau cannot be explained by the effects ofincompleteness. we conclude that only very massive galaxies are undergoingpassive evolution at this early epoch, consistent with the downsizing scenariofor galaxy evolution. assuming a purely passive evolution for the pbzks fromtheir median redshift to the present day, their luminosity function suggeststhat only $\sim 2.5 %$ of present day massive ellipticals had a pbzk as a mainprogenitor.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

0811.2053	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z~0.9	we derive the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies up to$z\sim0.9$, using data from the vimos vlt deep survey. automatic measurement ofemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the fullspectroscopic sample. this sample is divided into two sub-samples depending onthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;22.5$) and deep$i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;24$). these two samples span two different ranges of stellarmasses. emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxiesand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. for the star-forminggalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phaseoxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to giveconsistent results at low and high redshifts. the stellar masses have beenestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set ofstellar population synthesis models. we assume at first order that the shape ofthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. then we find astronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deepsample. we thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter athigher redshift. the observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation athigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.
