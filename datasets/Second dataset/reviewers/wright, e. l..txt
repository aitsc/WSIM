0906.0024	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey	the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs) is a four-epoch infrared surveyof ten square degrees in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field surveyusing the irac instrument on the spitzer space telescope. sdwfs, a cycle fourspitzer legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth surveyspace defined by other spitzer surveys. the four epochs that make up sdwfspermit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and highproper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. because of itslarge survey volume, sdwfs is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relativelylittle impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. the sdwfsdatasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolutionbeyond z~1.5. this paper explains the sdwfs observing strategy and dataprocessing, presents the sdwfs mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses someearly scientific findings. the publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average5-sigma, 4" diameter, aperture-corrected limits of 19.77, 18.83, 16.50, and15.82 vega mag at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron, respectively. the sdwfs numbercounts and color-color distribution are consistent with other, earlier spitzersurveys. at the 6 min integration time of the sdwfs irac imaging, more than 50%of isolated first radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis xbootes sourcesare detected out to 8.0 micron. finally, we present the four highest propermotion irac-selected sources identified from the multi-epoch imaging, two ofwhich are likely field brown dwarfs of mid-t spectral class.

1001.4538	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  cosmological interpretation	(abridged) the 7-year wmap data and improved astrophysical data rigorouslytest the standard cosmological model and its extensions. by combining wmap withthe latest distance measurements from bao and h0 measurement, we determine theparameters of the simplest lcdm model. the power-law index of the primordialpower spectrum is n_s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes thescale-invariant spectrum by 99.5%cl. the other parameters are also improvedfrom the 5-year results. notable examples of improved parameters are the totalmass of neutrinos, sum(m_nu)&lt;0.58ev, and the effective number of neutrinospecies, n_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. we detect the effect of primordial helium on thetemperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis.we detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radialpolarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, animportant test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabaticscalar fluctuations. with the 7-year tb power spectrum, the limit on a rotationof the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects hasimproved to delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. we reportsignificant detections of the sz effect at the locations of known clusters ofgalaxies. the measured sz signal agrees well with the expected signal from thex-ray data. however, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from"universal profile" of arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamicalsimulations. we find, for the first time in the sz effect, a significantdifference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxedand non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. thislower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected szpower spectrum recently measured by the south pole telescope collaboration.

1001.4555	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  galactic foreground emission	[abridged] we present updated estimates of galactic foreground emission usingseven years of wmap data. using the power spectrum of differences betweenmulti-frequency template-cleaned maps, we find no evidence for foregroundcontamination outside of the updated (kq85y7) foreground mask. we place a 15microkelvin upper bound on rms foreground contamination in the cleaned mapsused for cosmological analysis. we find no indication in the polarization dataof an extra "haze" of hard synchrotron emission from energetic electrons nearthe galactic center. we provide an updated map of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) using the internal linear combination (ilc) method, updatedforeground masks, and updates to point source catalogs with 62 newly detectedsources. also new are tests of the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) foregroundfitting procedure against systematics in the time-stream data, and testsagainst the observed beam asymmetry.  within a few degrees of the galactic plane, wmap total intensity data show arapidly steepening spectrum from 20-40 ghz, which may be due to emission fromspinning dust grains, steepening synchrotron, or other effects. comparisons aremade to a 1-degree 408 mhz map (haslam et al.) and the 11-degree arcade 2 data(singal et al.). we find that spinning dust or steepening synchrotron modelsfit the combination of wmap and 408 mhz data equally well. arcade data appearinconsistent with the steepening synchrotron model, and consistent with thespinning dust model, though some discrepancies remain regarding the relativestrength of spinning dust emission. more high-resolution data in the 10-40 ghzrange would shed much light on these issues.

1001.4758	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations: are  there cosmic microwave background anomalies?	(abridged) a simple six-parameter lcdm model provides a successful fit towmap data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with othercosmological data. even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints ofdeviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. the cosmological communityhas subjected the wmap data to extensive and varied analyses. while there iswidespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter lcdm model,various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. in this paper weexamine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of theirsignificance. in most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posteriorselection of some aspect or subset of the data. compared with sky simulationsbased on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of thewmap data. low probability features are expected, but it is not usuallystraightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature isthe result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. weexamine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the lcdmmodel. we examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the skymaps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, andquadrupole power asymmetry. we conclude that there is no compelling evidencefor deviations from the lcdm model, which is generally an acceptablestatistical fit to wmap and other cosmological data.

astro-ph;0201196	distant supernovae and the accelerating universe	the observation of sn 1997ff at redshift 1.7 has been claimed to refutealternative models such as grey dust or evolution for the faintness of distantsupernovae, leaving only an accelerating universe as a viable model. however, avery simple one parameter evolution model, with the peak luminosity varying asan exponential function of cosmic time, converts the flux vs. distance law ofthe critical density matter-dominated model into that of the concordanceomega_matter = 0.3 flat vacuum-dominated model with an error no larger than0.03 mag over the range 0-2 in redshift. a grey dust model that matches thisaccuracy can easily be contrived but it still fails by overproducing the far-irbackground or distorting the cmb. models that involve oscillation betweenphotons and axions could emulate an exponential function of cosmic time withoutviolating these background constraints. clearly a better and well-testedunderstanding of the type ia supernova explosion mechanism and the origin ofthe correlation between the decay rate and luminosity is needed before anyeffort to reduce statistical errors in the supernova hubble diagram to verysmall levels.

astro-ph;0305097	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  dark energy induced correlation with radio sources	the first-year wmap data, in combination with any one of a number of othercosmic probes, show that we live in a flat \lambda-dominated cdm universe with\omega_m ~ 0.27 and \omega_\lambda ~ 0.73. in this model the late-time actionof the dark energy, through the integrated sachs-wolfe effect, should producecmb anisotropies correlated with matter density fluctuations at z&lt;2 (crittenden&amp; turok 1996). the measurement of such a signal is an important independentcheck of the model. we cross-correlate the nrao vla sky survey radio sourcecatalog (condon et al. 1998) with the wmap data in search of this signal, andsee indications of the expected correlation. assuming a flat \lambda-cdmcosmology, we find \omega_\lambda&gt;0 (95% cl, statistical errors only) with thepeak of the likelihood at \omega_\lambda=0.68, consistent with the preferredwmap value. a closed model with \omega_m=1.28, h=0.33, and no dark energycomponent (\omega_\lambda=0), marginally consistent with the wmap cmb ttangular power spectrum, would produce an anti-correlation between the matterdistribution and the cmb. our analysis of the cross-correlation of the wmapdata with the nvss catalog rejects this cosmology at the 3\sigma level.

astro-ph;9909428	tentative detection of the cosmic infrared background at 2.2 and 3.5  microns using ground based and space based observations	the cosmic infrared background (cirb) is the sum total of the redshifted andreprocessed short wavelength radiation from the era of galaxy formation, andhence contains vital information about the history of galactic evolution. oneof the main problems associated with estimating an isotropic cirb in the nearinfrared (1-5 microns) is the unknown contribution from stars within our owngalaxy. the optimal observational window to search for a background in thenear-ir is at 3.5 microns since that is the wavelength region where the othermain foreground, the zodiacal dust emission, is the least. it is not possibleto map out the entire 3.5 micron sky at a resolution which will accuratelyestimate the flux from stars. however, since the cirb is presumably isotropic,it can potentially be detected by selecting a smaller field and imaging it atgood resolution to estimate the stellar intensity. we selected a 2x2 degree"dark spot" near the north galactic pole which had the least intensity at 3.5microns after a zodiacal light model was subtracted from the all-sky mapsgenerated by the diffuse infrared background experiment (dirbe). the measuredtotal intensity of the few bright stars in this field was combined with a modelfor the contribution from dimmer stars and subtracted from the zodi-subtracteddirbe map. the contribution from the interstellar medium was also subtractedleaving a residual intensity at 2.2 microns of: 16.4+/-4.4 kjy/sr or 22.4+/-6nw/m^2/sr, and at 3.5 microns: 12.8+/-3.8 kjy/sr or 11+/-3.3 nw/m^2/sr.[abridged]

0811.4280	five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  bayesian estimation of cmb polarization maps	we describe a sampling method to estimate the polarized cmb signal fromobserved maps of the sky. we use a metropolis-within-gibbs algorithm toestimate the polarized cmb map, containing q and u stokes parameters at eachpixel, and its covariance matrix. these can be used as inputs for cosmologicalanalyses. the polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of threecomponents: cmb, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. the polarizedgalactic components are modeled with spatially varying power law spectralindices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and theircomponent maps are estimated as by-products. we apply the method to simulatedlow resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 degrees, using diagonal and fullnoise realizations drawn from the wmap noise matrices. the cmb maps arerecovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. computing the likelihoodof the e-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization,tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau=0.091+-0.019 for asimulation with input tau=0.1, and mean tau=0.098 averaged over 10 simulations.a `null' simulation with no polarized cmb signal has maximum likelihoodconsistent with tau=0. the method is applied to the five-year wmap data, usingthe k, ka, q and v channels. we find tau=0.090+-0.019, compared totau=0.086+-0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary wmapanalysis. the synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over highsignal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta)&lt;0.25, but excluding~6% of the sky masked in the galactic plane, is -3.03+-0.04. this estimate doesnot vary significantly with galactic latitude, although includes an informativeprior.
