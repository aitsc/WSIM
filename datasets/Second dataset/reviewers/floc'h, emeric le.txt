0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0904.4244	spitzer observations of cold dust galaxies	we combine new spitzer space telescope observations in the mid- andfar-infrared with scuba 850 micron observations to improve the measurement ofdust temperatures, masses and luminosities for 11 galaxies of the scuba localuniverse galaxy survey (slugs). by fitting dust models we measure typical dustmasses of 10e7.9 m_sol and dust luminosities of ~ 10e10 l_sol, for galaxieswith modest star formation rates. the data presented in this paper combinedwith previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types ofspiral galaxies and is a major contributor to their total luminosity. becauseof the lower dust temperature of the scuba sources measured in this paper, theyhave flatter far-ir nu f_nu(160um)/nu f_nu(850um) slopes than the largerspitzer nearby galaxies survey (sings), the sample that provides the bestmeasurements of the dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe. the newdata presented here added to sings extend the parameter space that is wellcovered by local galaxies, providing a comprehensive set of templates that canbe used to interpret the observations of nearby and distant galaxies.

0905.1122	turning back the clock: inferring the history of the eight o'clock arc	we present the results from an optical and near-infrared spectroscopic studyof the ultraviolet-luminous z = 2.73 galaxy, the 8 o'clock arc. due togravitational lensing, this galaxy is magnified by a factor of &gt; 10, allowingin-depth measurements which are usually unfeasible at such redshifts. in theoptical spectra, we measured the systemic redshift of the galaxy, z = 2.7322+/- 0.0012, using stellar photospheric lines. this differs from the redshift ofabsorption lines in the interstellar medium, z = 2.7302 +/- 0.0006, implyinggas outflows on the order of 160 km/s. with h and k-band near-infrared spectra,we have measured nebular emission lines of halpha, hbeta, hgamma, [n ii] and [oiii], which have a redshift z = 2.7333 +/- 0.0001, consistent with the derivedsystemic redshift. from the balmer decrement, we measured the dust extinctionto be a_5500 = 1.17 +/- 0.36 mag. correcting halpha for dust extinction and theassumed lensing factor, we measure a star-formation rate of ~ 270 msol/yr,which is higher than ~ 85% of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. usingcombinations of all detected emission lines, we find that the 8 o'clock arc hasa gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.8 zsol, showing that enrichment at high-redshiftis not rare, even in blue, star-forming galaxies. studying spectra from two ofthe arc components separately, we find that one component dominates the dustextinction and star-formation rate, although the metallicities between the twocomponents are similar. we derive the mass via stellar population modeling, andfind that the arc has a total stellar mass of ~ 4 x 10^11 msol, which falls onthe mass-metallicity relation at z ~ 2. finally, we estimate the total gasmass, and find it to be only ~ 12% of the stellar mass, implying that the 8o'clock arc is likely nearing the end of a starburst.

0905.4274	strong pah emission from z~2 ulirgs	using the infrared spectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope, wepresent low-resolution (64 &lt; lambda / dlambda &lt; 124), mid-infrared (20-38micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ulirgs detected in the bootes field of thenoao deep wide-field survey. all of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24micron) &gt; 0.5 mjy; 2) r-[24] &gt; 14 vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into spitzer's 3-8 micron iracbands. of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs),usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. the pah features indicateredshifts in the range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, with a mean of &lt;z&gt;=1.96 and a dispersionof 0.30. based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infraredluminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. our results confirmprevious indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can beefficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, andthat the fraction of starburst-dominated ulirgs increases to faint 24 micronflux densities. using local templates, we find that the observed narrowredshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability ofpah-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. we can analogously explain thebroader redshift distribution of spitzer-detected agn-dominated ulirgs based onthe shapes of their seds. finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with adetectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient agn emission toveil the 7.7 micron pah band.

0909.5367	on the nature of the first galaxies selected at 350 microns	[abridged] we present constraints on the nature of the first galaxiesselected at 350 microns. the sample includes galaxies discovered in the deepestblank-field survey at 350 microns (in the bootes deep field) and also laterserendipitous detections in the lockman hole. spectral energy distributiontemplates are fit to identified counterparts, and the sample is found tocomprise ir-luminous galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 predominantly powered by star formation.the first spectrum of a 350-micron-selected galaxy provides an additionalconfirmation, showing prominent dust grain features typically associated withstar-forming galaxies.  compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100 microns, galaxiesselected at 350 microns have a similar range of far-infrared colortemperatures. however, no 350-micron-selected sources are reliably detected at850 or 1100 microns. galaxies in our sample with redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;2 show a tightcorrelation between the far- and mid-infrared flux densities, but galaxies athigher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far-infrared colors.  the 350-micron flux densities (15&lt;s(350)&lt;40 mjy) place these objects near theherschel/spire 350-micron confusion threshold, with the lower limit on the starformation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350-micron contribution willcome from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies.

1005.3852	a far-ir characterization of 24 micron selected galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5  using stacking at 70 microns and 160 microns in the cosmos field	we present a study of the average properties of luminous infrared galaxiesdetected directly at 24 $\mu$m in the cosmos field using a median stackinganalysis at 70$\mu$m and 160 $\mu$m. over 35000 sources spanning 0&lt;z&lt;3 and 0.06mjy&lt;s_{24}&lt;3.0 mjy are stacked, divided into bins of both photometric redshiftand 24 $\mu$m flux. we find no correlation of $s_{70}/s_{24}$ flux densityratio with $s_{24}$, but find that galaxies with higher $s_{24}$ have a lower$s_{160}/s_{24}$ flux density ratio. these observed ratios suggest that 24$\mu$m selected galaxies have warmer seds at higher mid-ir fluxes, andtherefore have a possible higher fraction of agn. comparisons of the average$s_{70}/s_{24}$ and $s_{160}/s_{24}$ colors with various empirical templatesand theoretical models show that the galaxies detected at 24 $\mu$m areconsistent with "normal" star-forming galaxies and warm mid-ir galaxies such asmrk 231, but inconsistent with heavily obscured galaxies such as arp 220. weperform a $\chi^{2}$ analysis to determine best fit galactic model seds andtotal ir luminosities for each of our bins. we compare our results to previousmethods of estimating $l_{\rm{ir}}$ and find that previous methods showconsiderable agreement over the full redshift range, except for the brightest$s_{24}$ sources, where previous methods overpredict the bolometric irluminosity at high redshift, most likely due to their warmer dust sed. wepresent a table that can be used as a more accurate and robust method forestimating bolometric infrared luminosity from 24 $\mu$m flux densities.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

1008.0859	luminosity functions of local infrared galaxies with akari: implications  to the cosmic star formation history and agn evolution	infrared (ir) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic starformation history and agn evolution. the akari ir space telescope performed allsky survey in 6 ir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) with 3-10 times bettersensitivity than iras, covering the crucial far-ir wavelengths across the peakof the dust emission. combined with a better spatial resolution, akari can muchmore precisely measure the total infrared luminosity (l_tir) of individualgalaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity density in the localuniverse. by fitting ir sed models, we have re-measured l_tir of the irasrevised bright galaxy sample. we present mid-ir monochromatic luminosity tol_tir conversions for spitzer 8,24um, akari 9,18um, iras 12um, wise 12,22um,and iso 15um filters, with scatter ranging 13-44%. the resulting akari irluminosity function (lf) agrees well with that from the iras. we integrate thelf weighted by l_tir to obtain a cosmic ir luminosity density of omega_tir=(8.5^{+1.5}_{-2.3})x 10^7 l mpc^-3, of which 7+-1% is produced by lirgs, andonly 0.4+-0.1% is from ulirgs in the local universe. once ir contributions fromagn and star-forming galaxies (sfg) are separated, sfg ir lf shows a steepdecline at the bright-end. compared with high-redshift results from the akarinep deep survey, these data show a strong evolution of omega_tirsf propto(1+z)^4.0+-0.5, and omega_tiragn propto (1+z)^4.4+-0.4. for omega_tiragn, theulirg contribution exceeds that from lirg already by z~1. a rapid evolution inboth omega_tiragn and omega_tirsfg suggests the correlation between starformation and black hole accretion rate continues up to higher redshifts. wecompare the evolution of omega_tiragn to that of x-ray luminosity density. theomega_tiragn/omega_x-rayagn ratio shows a possible increase at z&gt;1, suggestingan increase of obscured agn at z&gt;1.

1102.2929	the dirt on dry mergers	using data from the spitzer space telescope, we analyze the mid-infrared(3-70 micron) spectral energy distributions of dry merger candidates in thebootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. these candidates were selectedby previous authors to be luminous, red, early-type galaxies with morphologicalevidence of recent tidal interactions. we find that a significant fraction ofthese candidates exhibit 8 and 24 micron excesses compared to expectations forold stellar populations. we estimate that a quarter of dry merger candidateshave mid-infrared-derived star formation rates greater than ~1 msun/yr. thisrepresents a "frosting" on top of a large old stellar population, and has beenseen in previous studies of elliptical galaxies. further, the dry mergercandidates include a higher fraction of starforming galaxies relative to acontrol sample without tidal features. we therefore conclude that the starformation in these massive ellipticals is likely triggered by merger activity.our data suggest that the mergers responsible for the observed tidal featureswere not completely dry, and may be minor mergers involving a gas-rich dwarfgalaxy.

1102.3430	infrared luminosity functions of akari-sdss galaxies	by cross-correlating akari infrared (ir) sources with the sdss galaxies, weidentified 2357 infrared galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift. this is notjust one of the largest samples of local ir galaxies, but akari providescrucial fir bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160um) in accurately measuringgalaxy sed across the peak of the dust emission at ~100um. by fitting modern irsed models to the akari photometry, we measured the total infrared luminosity(l_ir) of individual galaxies more accurately. using this l_ir, we constructedluminosity functions of infrared galaxies at a median redshift of z=0.031, with4 times larger sample than previous work. the lf agrees well with that atz=0.0082 (rbgs), showing smooth and continuous evolution toward higher redshiftlfs measured in the akari nep deep field. the derived local cosmic irluminosity density is omega_ir=3.8x10^8 lsunmpc^-3. we separate galaxies intoagn, star-forming, and composite by using the [nii]/ha vs [oiii]/hb lineratios. the fraction of agn shows a continuous increase with increasing l_irfrom 25% to 90% at 9&lt;log l_ir&lt;12.5. the sfr_ha and l_[oiii] show goodcorrelations with l_ir for sfg (star-forming galaxies) and agn, respectively.the self-absorption corrected ha/hb ratio shows a weak increase with l_ir witha substantial scatter. when we separate ir lfs into contributions from agn andsfg, the agn contribution becomes dominant at l_ir&gt;10^11lsun, coinciding thebreak of the both sfg and agn ir lfs. at l_ir&lt;10^11lsun, sfg dominates ir lfs.only 1.1% of omega_ir is produced by lirg, and only 0.03% is by ulirg in thelocal universe. this work also provides the most accurate infrared luminositydensity of the local universe to date. compared with high redshift results fromthe akari nep deep survey, we observed a strong evolution of omega_ir^sfg~(1+z)^4.1+-0.4 and omega_ir^agn ~(1+z)^4.1+-0.5 (abridged).

1102.4850	clustering of obscured and unobscured quasars in the bootes field:  placing rapidly growing black holes in the cosmic web	we present the first measurement of the spatial clustering of mid-infraredselected obscured and unobscured quasars, using a sample in the redshift range0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.8 selected from the 9 deg^2 bootes multiwavelength survey. recentlythe spitzer space telescope and x-ray observations have revealed largepopulations of obscured quasars that have been inferred from models of thex-ray background and supermassive black hole evolution. to date, little isknown about obscured quasar clustering, which allows us to measure the massesof their host dark matter halos and explore their role in the cosmic evolutionof black holes and galaxies. in this study we use a sample of 806 mid-infraredselected quasars and ~250,000 galaxies to calculate the projected quasar-galaxycross-correlation function w_p(r). the observed clustering yieldscharacteristic dark matter halo masses of log (m_halo [h^-1 m_sun]) =12.7^+0.4_-0.6 and 13.3^+0.3_-0.4 for unobscured quasars (qso-1s) and obscuredquasars (obs-qsos), respectively. the results for qso-1s are in excellentagreement with previous measurements for optically-selected quasars, while weconclude that the obs-qsos are at least as strongly clustered as the qso-1s. wetest for the effects of photometric redshift errors on the optically-faintobs-qsos, and find that our method yields a robust lower limit on theclustering; photo-z errors may cause us to underestimate the clusteringamplitude of the obs-qsos by at most ~20%. we compare our results to previousstudies, and speculate on physical implications of stronger clustering forobscured quasars.

1109.6040	galaxies in x-ray groups i: robust membership assignment and the impact  of group environments on quenching	understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxieswith redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formationrates than field populations remains an important problem. as most candidateprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations ofthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a rangein halo mass and redshift are needed. in this work, we present and test arigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based onprecise photometric redshifts and x-ray selected groups drawn from the cosmosfield. the groups have masses in the range 10^13 &lt; m_200c/m_sun &lt; 10^14 andspan redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. we characterize our selection algorithm via tests onspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the vlt, and byapplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. we find that our group membergalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 r200c. wemeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on thequality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as wellas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. as a first application of our newgroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that membergalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixedstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between starformation and environment at group scales. we also address the suggestion thatdusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrumof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannotexplain the low power seen in recent sz measurements.

1111.0987	an observed link between active galactic nuclei and violent disk  instabilities in high-redshift galaxies	we provide evidence for a correlation between the presence of giant clumpsand the occurrence of active galactic nuclei (agn) in disk galaxies. giantclumps of 10^8-9 msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-richgalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feedsupermassive black holes (bh). we use emission line diagnostics to compare asample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disksat redshift z~0.7. the majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a highprobability of containing agn. their [oiii] emission line is strongly excited,inconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [neiii] excitation isalso higher. stable disks rarely have such properties. stacking ultra sensitivechandra observations (4 ms) reveals an x-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, whichcannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of agn. theclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical ofgas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the mainsequence of star formation. this suggests that our findings apply to thephysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z&gt;1. using theobserved [oiii] and x-ray luminosities, we conservatively estimate that agnhosted by clumpy disks have typical bolometric luminosities of the order of afew 10^43 erg/s, bh growth rates ~10^-2 msun/yr, and that these agn aresubstantially obscured in x-rays. this moderate-luminosity mode could besufficient to provide a large fraction of today's bh mass over a couple of gyrgiven that our observations suggest a high duty cycle (&gt;10%), accretion burstswith higher luminosities being possible over shorter phases. the observedevolution of disk instabilities with mass and redshift could explain thesimultaneous downsizing of star formation and of bh growth.

1201.3792	star formation in liner host galaxies at z~0.3	we present the results of a herschel-pacs study of a sample of 97 liners atredshift z\sim 0.3 selected from the zcosmos survey. of these sources, 34 aredetected in a least one pacs band, enabling reliable estimates of thefar-infrared l(fir) luminosities, and a comparison to the fir luminosities oflocal liners. many of our pacs-detected liners are also uv sources detected bygalex. assuming that the fir is produced in young dusty star-forming regions,the typical star-formation rates (sfrs) for the host galaxies in our sample is\sim 10 m_sun yr-1, 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than in many local liners.given stellar masses inferred from optical/nir photometry of the (unobscured)evolved stellar populations, we find that the entire sample lies close to thestar-forming "main sequence" for galaxies at redshift 0.3. for youngstar-forming regions, the h\alpha- and uv-based estimates of the sfrs are muchsmaller than the fir-based estimates, by factors \sim 30, even assuming thatall of the h\alpha\ emission is produced by o-star ionization rather than bythe agns. these discrepancies may be due to large (and uncertain) extinctionstowards the young stellar systems. alternatively, the h\alpha\ and uv emissionscould be tracing residual star-formation in an older less obscured populationwith decaying star formation. we also compare l(sf) and l(agn) in local linersand in our sample and comment on the problematic use of several line diagnosticdiagrams in cases similar to the sample under study.

1204.3897	co j=2-1 line emission in cluster galaxies at z~1: fueling star  formation in dense environments	we present observations of co j=2-1 line emission in infrared-luminouscluster galaxies at z~1 using the iram plateau de bure interferometer. our twoprimary targets are optically faint, dust-obscured galaxies (dogs) found to liewithin 2 mpc of the centers of two massive (&gt;10^14 msun) galaxy clusters. coline emission is not detected in either dog. we calculate 3-sigma upper limitsto the co j=2-1 line luminosities, l'_co &lt; 6.08x10^9 and &lt; 6.63x10^9 k km/spc^2. assuming a co-to-h_2 conversion factor derived for ultraluminous infraredgalaxies in the local universe, this translates to limits on the cold moleculargas mass of m_h_2 &lt; 4.86x10^9 msun and m_h_2 &lt; 5.30x10^9 msun. both dogsexhibit mid-infrared continuum emission that follows a power-law, suggestingthat an agn contributes to the dust heating. as such, estimates of the starformation efficiencies in these dogs are uncertain. a third cluster member withan infrared luminosity, l_ir &lt; 7.4x10^11 lsun, is serendipitously detected inco j=2-1 line emission in the field of one of the dogs located roughly twovirial radii away from the cluster center. the optical spectrum of this objectsuggests that it is likely an obscured agn, and the measured co line luminosityis l'_co = (1.94 +/- 0.35)x10^10 k km/s pc^2, which leads to an estimated coldmolecular gas mass m_h_2 = (1.55+/-0.28)x10^10 msun. a significant reservoir ofmolecular gas in a z~1 galaxy located away from the cluster center demonstratesthat the fuel can exist to drive an increase in star-formation and agn activityat the outskirts of high-redshift clusters.

1211.2823	pah emission in powerful high-redshift radio galaxies	we present the mid-infrared spectra of seven of the most powerfulradio-galaxies known to exist at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6. the radio emission of thesesources is dominated by the agn with 500 mhz luminosities in the range 10^27.8- 10^29.1 w/hz. the agn signature is clearly evident in the mid-infraredspectra, however, we also detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emission,indicative of prodigious star formation at a rate of up to ~1000 msun/yr.interestingly, we observe no significant correlation between agn power and starformation in the host galaxy. we also find most of these radio galaxies to haveweak 9.7 um silicate absorption features (tau_{9.7 um} &lt; 0.8) which impliesthat their mid-ir obscuration is predominantly due to the dusty torus thatsurrounds the central engine, rather than the host galaxy. the tori are likelyto have an inhomogeneous distribution with the obscuring structure consistingof individual clouds. we estimate that these radio galaxies have already formedthe bulk of their stellar mass and appear to lie at a stage in their evolutionwhere the obscured agn dominates the energy output of the system but starformation is also prevalent.

1211.6798	the clustering of extremely red objects	we measure the clustering of extremely red objects (eros) in ~8 deg^2 of thenoao deep wide field survey bo\"otes field in order to establish robust linksbetween ero z~1.2 and local galaxy z&lt;0.1 populations. three different colorselection criteria from the literature are analyzed to assess the consequencesof using different criteria for selecting eros. specifically, our samples are(r-k_s)&gt;5.0 (28,724 galaxies), (i-k_s)&gt;4.0 (22,451 galaxies) and (i-[3.6])&gt;5.0(64,370 galaxies). magnitude-limited samples show the correlation length (r_0)to increase for more luminous eros, implying a correlation with stellar mass.we can separate star-forming and passive ero populations using the (k_s-[24])and ([3.6]-[24]) colors to k_s=18.4 and [3.6]=17.5, respectively. star-formingand passive eros in magnitude limited samples have different clusteringproperties and host dark halo masses, and cannot be simply understood as asingle population. based on the clustering, we find that bright passive erosare the likely progenitors of &gt;4l^* elliptical galaxies. bright eros withongoing star formation were found to occupy denser environments thanstar-forming galaxies in the local universe, making these the likelyprogenitors of &gt;l^* local ellipticals. this suggests that the progenitors ofmassive &gt;4l^* local ellipticals had stopped forming stars by z&gt;1.2, but thatthe progenitors of less massive ellipticals (down to l^*) can still showsignificant star formation at this epoch.

1306.1227	a correlation between star formation rate and average black hole  accretion in star forming galaxies	we present a measurement of the average supermassive black hole accretionrate (bhar) as a function of star formation rate (sfr) for galaxies in theredshift range 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.8. we study a sample of 1,767 far-ir selectedstar-forming galaxies in the 9 deg^2 bo\"otes multiwavelength survey field. thesfr is estimated using 250 micron observations from the herschel spaceobservatory, for which the contribution from the agn is minimal. in thissample, 121 agns are directly identified using x-ray or mid-ir selectioncriteria. we combined these detected agns and an x-ray stacking analysis forundetected sources to study the average bhar for all of the star-forminggalaxies in our sample. we find an almost linear relation between the averagebhar (in m_sun/year) and the sfr (in m_sun/year) for galaxies across a wide sfrrange 0.85&lt;log sfr&lt;2.56 : log bhar=(-3.72\pm0.52)+(1.05\pm0.33) log sfr. thisglobal correlation between sfr and average bhar is consistent with a simplepicture in which sfr and agn activity are tightly linked over galaxy evolutiontimescales.

1309.0008	encoding the infrared excess (irx) in the nuvrk color diagram for  star-forming galaxies	we present an empirical method of assessing the star formation rate (sfr) ofstar-forming galaxies based on their locations in the rest-frame color-colordiagram (nuv-r) vs (r-k). by using the spitzer 24 micron sample in the cosmosfield (~16400 galaxies with 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.3) and a local galex-sdss-swire sample(~700 galaxies with z &lt; 0.2), we show that the mean infrared excess &lt;irx&gt;= &lt;l_ir / l_uv &gt; can be described by a single vector, nrk, that combines the twocolors. the calibration between &lt;irx&gt; and nrk allows us to recover the irluminosity, l_ir, with an accuracy of ~0.21 dex for the cosmos sample and ~0.27dex for the local one. the sfrs derived with this method agree with the onesbased on the observed (uv+ir) luminosities and on the spectral energydistribution fitting for the vast majority (~85 %) of the star-formingpopulation. thanks to a library of model galaxy seds with realisticprescriptions for the star formation history, we show that we need to include atwo-component dust model (i.e., birth clouds and diffuse ism) and a fulldistribution of galaxy inclinations in order to reproduce the behavior of the&lt;irx&gt; stripes in the nuvrk diagram. in conclusion, the nrk method, based onlyon rest-frame uv and optical colors available in most of the extragalacticfields, offers a simple alternative of assessing the sfr of star-forminggalaxies in the absence of far-ir or spectral diagnostic observations.

0705.0660	hudf-jd2: mid-infrared evidence for a z~2 luminous infrared galaxy	the hubble ultra deep field source jd2 presented in mobasher et al. (2005) isan unusual galaxy that is very faint at all wavelengths shortward of 1.1micron. photometric redshift fits to data at 0.4 to 8 microns yield asignificant probability that it is an extremely massive galaxy at z~6.5. inthis paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from spitzerinfrared spectrograph (irs) peak-up imaging of the great observatories originsdeep survey (goods) fields. we find that the spectral energy distribution showsa factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micronbandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands. theflux ratio between these bandpasses can be best fit by a z~1.7 luminousinfrared galaxy with a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\times10^{11} l_suncorresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 m_sun/yr. the predicted fluxdensity values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits ofcurrent instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected inlensed submillimeter surveys. re-evaluation of the optical/near-infraredphotometry continues to favor z&gt;6 photometric redshift solutions, but we arguethat the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy withother dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. thedata presented here provide evidence that optically undetected near-infraredsources which are detected at 24 microns are most likely dusty, starburstgalaxies at a redshift of z~2 with stellar masses &gt;10^{10} m_sun.

1309.4459	the role of galaxy interaction in the sfr-m relation: characterizing  morphological properties of herschel-selected galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5	galaxy interactions/mergers have been shown to dominate the population of irluminous galaxies (log(lir)&gt;11.6lsun) in the local universe (z&lt;0.25). recentstudies based on the relation between galaxies' star formation rates andstellar mass (the sfr-m relation or the galaxy main sequence (ms)) havesuggested that galaxy interaction/mergers may only become significant whengalaxies fall well above the galaxy ms. since the typical sfr at given mincreases with redshift, the existence of galaxy ms implies that massive,ir-luminous galaxies at high-z may not necessarily be driven by galaxyinteractions. we examine the role of galaxy interactions in the sfr-m relationby carrying out a morphological analysis of 2084 herschel-selected galaxies at0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.5 in the cosmos field. herschel-pacs and -spire observationscovering the full 2-deg^2 cosmos field provide one of the largest far-irselected samples of high-redshift galaxies with well-determined redshifts todate, with sufficient sensitivity at z ~ 1, to sample objects lying on andabove the galaxy ms. using a detailed visual classification scheme, we showthat the fraction of "disk galaxies" decreases and the fraction of "irregular"galaxies increases systematically with increasing lir out to z ~ 1.5 and z ~1.0, respectively. at log(lir) &gt; 11.5 lsun, &gt;50% of the objects show evidentfeatures of strongly interacting/merger systems, where this percentage issimilar to the studies of local ir-luminous galaxies. the fraction ofinteracting/merger systems also systematically increases with the deviationfrom the sfr-m relation, supporting the view that galaxies fall above the msare more dominated by mergers than the ms galaxies. meanwhile, we find that~18% of massive ir-luminous ms galaxies are classified as interacting systems,where this population may not evolve through the evolutionary track predictedby a simple gas exhaustion model.

0801.4578	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of distant x-ray luminous agn	we present mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 16 optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope. these sources were jointly selected from spitzer andchandra imaging surveys in the ndwfs bootes field and were selected from theirbright x-ray fluxes to host luminous agn. none of the spectra show significantemission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs; 6.2um equivalent widths&lt;0.2um), consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by agn. nineof the x-ray sources show 9.7um silicate absorption features. their redshiftsare in the range 0.9&lt;z&lt;2.6, implying infrared luminosities oflog(l{ir})=12.5-13.6 solar luminosities. the average silicate absorptionstrength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faintinfrared luminous galaxies with similar mid-infrared luminosities implying thatthe x-ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of si-rich dust thannon-x-ray selection. seven of the x-ray sources have featureless power-lawmid-ir spectra. we argue that the featureless spectra likely result from thesources having weak or absent silicate and pah features rather than the sourceslying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the irsspectral window. we investigate whether there are any correlations betweenx-ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorptionfeatures tend to have fainter x-ray fluxes and harder x-ray spectra, indicatinga weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density ofx-ray-absorbing gas.

1311.5228	hidden starbursts and active galactic nuclei at 0&lt;z&lt;4 from the  herschel-vvds-cfhtls-d1 field: inferences on coevolution and feedback	we investigate of the properties of $\sim$2000 herschel/spire-selectedgalaxies from $0&lt;z&lt;4$ using a combination of extensive spectroscopy, deepimaging from cfht, vla, spitzer, xmm-newton, and herschel, and well-calibratedsed fitting. herschel galaxies are observed to span a range of stellar masses,colors, and absolute magnitudes equivalent to galaxies undetected in spire.though many herschel galaxies appear to be in transition, such galaxies arelargely consistent with normal star-forming galaxies when rest-frame colors areutilized. the nature of the star-forming "main sequence" is studied and we warnagainst adopting this framework unless the main sequence is determinedprecisely. herschel galaxies at different total infrared luminosities($l_{tir}$) are compared. bluer colors, larger nebular extinctions, and largercontributions from younger stellar populations are observed for galaxies withlarger $l_{tir}$, suggesting that low-$l_{tir}$ galaxies are undergoingrejuvenated starbursts while galaxies with higher $l_{tir}$ are forming alarger percentage of their stellar mass. a variety of methods are used toselect powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). galaxies hosting agn are observedto be undergoing starbursts more commonly and vigorously than a matched sampleof galaxies without powerful agn and, additionally, the fraction of galaxieswith an agn increases with increasing star formation rate at all redshifts. atall redshifts ($0&lt;z&lt;4$) the most prodigious star-forming galaxies are found tocontain the highest fraction of powerful agn. for redshift bins that allow acomparison ($z&gt;0.5$), the highest $l_{tir}$ galaxies in a given redshift binare unobserved by spire at subsequently lower redshifts, a trend linked todownsizing. in conjunction with other results, this evidence is used to arguefor prevalent agn-driven quenching in starburst galaxies across cosmic time.

1403.6832	agn emission line diagnostics and the mass-metallicity relation up to  redshift z~2: the impact of selection effects and evolution	emission line diagnostic diagrams probing the ionization sources in galaxies,such as the baldwin-phillips-terlevich (bpt) diagram, have been usedextensively to distinguish agn from purely star-forming galaxies. yet, theyremain poorly understood at higher redshifts. we shed light on this issue withan empirical approach based on a z~0 reference sample built from ~300,000 sdssgalaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission linedetection limits at higher redshift. we combine this low-redshift referencesample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxypopulation to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the bpt andmass-excitation (mex) diagnostic diagrams. the predicted bivariatedistributions agree remarkably well with direct observations of galaxies out toz~1.5, including the observed stellar mass-metallicity (mz) relation evolution.as a result, we infer that high-redshift star-forming galaxies are consistentwith having "normal" ism properties out to z~1.5, after accounting forselection effects and line luminosity evolution. namely, their optical lineratios and gas-phase metallicities are comparable to that of low-redshiftgalaxies with equivalent emission-line luminosities. in contrast, agnnarrow-line regions may show a shift toward lower metallicities at higherredshift. while a physical evolution of the ism conditions is not ruled out forpurely star-forming galaxies, and may be more important starting at z&gt;2, wefind that reliably quantifying this evolution is hindered by selectionseffects. the recipes provided here may serve as a basis for future studiestoward this goal. code to predict the loci of galaxies on the bpt and mexdiagnostic diagrams, and the mz relation as a function of emission lineluminosity limits, is made publicly available.

1409.5796	evolution of the dust emission of massive galaxies up to z=4 and  constraints on their dominant mode of star formation	we aim to measure the average dust and molecular gas content of massivestar-forming galaxies ($\rm &gt; 3 \times 10^{10}\,m_\odot$) up to z=4 in thecosmos field to determine if the intense star formation observed at highredshift is induced by major mergers or caused by large gas reservoirs.firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributionsas a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of spitzer, herschel,laboca, and aztec data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objectsand strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. wefound that the mean intensity of the radiation field $&lt; u &gt;$ heating the dust(strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshiftup to z$\sim$4 in main-sequence galaxies. we can reproduce this evolution withsimple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity withredshift. no evolution of $&lt; u &gt;$ with redshift is found in strong starbursts.we then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as$\rm m_{\rm mol}/(m_{\rm mol}+m_\star)$) with redshift and found a similar,steeply increasing trend for both samples. at z$\sim$4, this fraction reaches$\sim$60%. the average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locusof the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated schmidt-kennicuttdiagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that thebulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.

1501.01080	a turnover in the galaxy main sequence of star formation at $m_{*} \sim  10^{10} m_{\odot}$ for redshifts $z &lt; 1.3$	the relationship between galaxy star formation rates (sfr) and stellar masses($m_\ast$) is re-examined using a mass-selected sample of $\sim$62,000star-forming galaxies at $z \le 1.3$ in the cosmos 2-deg$^2$ field. using newfar-infrared photometry from $herschel$-pacs and spire and $spitzer$-mips 24$\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the nrk method based ongalaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram $(nuv - r)$ vs. $(r -k)$, we are able to more accurately determine total sfrs for our completesample. at all redshifts, the relationship between median $sfr$ and $m_\ast$follows a power-law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant sfrat high stellar masses. we describe a new parameterization that provides thebest fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope,turnover mass, and overall scaling. the turnover in the main sequence occurs ata characteristic mass of about $m_{0} \sim 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ at all redshifts.the low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling risesin sfr as a function of $(1+z)^{4.12 \pm 0.10}$. a broken power-law fit belowand above the turnover mass gives relationships of $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.88 \pm0.06}$ below the turnover mass and $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.27 \pm 0.04}$ abovethe turnover mass. galaxies more massive than $m_\ast \gtrsim 10^{10}\ m_{\rm\odot}$ have on average, a much lower specific star formation rate (ssfr) thanwould be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to themain sequence found for less massive galaxies.

1503.06220	a physical approach to the identification of high-z mergers:  morphological classification in the stellar mass domain	at z&gt;1, the distinction between merging and 'normal' star-forming galaxiesbased on single band morphology is often hampered by the presence of largeclumps which result in a disturbed, merger-like appearance even in rotationallysupported disks. in this paper we discuss how a classification based oncanonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar massmaps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification ofclumpy but not merging galaxies. we calibrate the mass-based selection ofmergers using the mirage hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated andmerging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}m_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3. thesesimulations are processed to reproduce the typical depth and spatial resolutionof observed hudf data. we test our approach on a sample of real z~2 galaxieswith kinematic classification into disks or mergers and on ~100 galaxies in thehudf field with photometric/spectroscopic redshift between 1.5$\leqslant z\leqslant$3 and $m&gt;10^{9.4}m_{sun}$. we find that a combination of theasymmetry $a_{mass}$ and $m_{20, mass}$ indices measured on the stellar massmaps can efficiently identify real (major) mergers with $\lesssim$20%contamination from clumpy disks in the merger sample. this mass-basedclassification cannot be reproduced in star-forming galaxies by $h-$bandmeasurements alone, which instead result in a contamination from clumpygalaxies that can be as high as 50%. moreover, we find that the mass-basedclassification always results in a lower contamination from clumpy galaxiesthan an $h-$band classification, regardless of the depth of the imaging used(e.g., candels vs. hudf).

astro-ph;0408454	studying distant infrared-luminous galaxies with spitzer and hubble	new surveys with the spitzer space telescope identify distant star-formingand active galaxies by their strong emission at far-infrared wavelengths, whichprovides strong constraints on these galaxies' bolometric energy. using earlyresults from spitzer surveys at 24 micron, we argue that the faint sourcescorrespond to the existence of a population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z&gt; 1 that are not expected from predictions based on previous observations fromiso and iras. combining spitzer images with deep ground-based optical andhubble space telescope imaging, we discuss the properties of galaxies selectedat 24 micron in the region of the chandra deep field south, including redshiftand morphological distributions. galaxies with z &lt; 1 constitute roughly half ofthe faint 24 micron sources. infrared-luminous galaxies at these redshifts spana wide variety of normal to strongly interacting/merging morphologies, whichsuggests that a range of mechanisms produce infrared activity. large-area,joint surveys between spitzer and hst are needed to understand the complexrelation between galaxy morphology, structure, environment and activity level,and how this evolves with cosmic time. we briefly discuss strategies forconstructing surveys to maximize the legacy of these missions.

astro-ph;0502246	towards an understanding of the rapid decline of the cosmic star  formation rate	we present a first analysis of deep 24 micron observations with the spitzerspace telescope of a sample of nearly 1500 galaxies in a thin redshift slice,0.65&lt;z&lt;0.75. we combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frameluminosities, and colors from combo-17, and with morphologies from hubble spacetelescope images collected by the gems and goods projects. to characterize thedecline in star-formation rate (sfr) since z~0.7, we estimate the total thermalinfrared (ir) luminosities, sfrs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in thissample. at z~0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate and high-mass galaxies (withstellar masses &gt;2x10^10 solar masses) are undergoing a period of intense starformation above their past-averaged sfr. in contrast, less than 1% ofequally-massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense starformation activity. morphologically-undisturbed galaxies dominate the totalinfrared luminosity density and sfr density: at z~0.7, more than half of theintensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than\~30% are strongly interacting. thus, a decline in major-merger rate is not theunderlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic sfr since z~0.7. physicalproperties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology - for example, gasconsumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies - appear to beresponsible.

astro-ph;0508657	black hole masses and eddington ratios at 0.3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the distribution of eddington luminosity ratios, l_bol/l_edd, ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) discovered in the agn and galaxy evolution survey(ages). we combine h-beta, mgii, and civ line widths with continuumluminosities to estimate black hole (bh) masses in 407 agns, covering theredshift range z~0.3-4 and the bolometric luminosity range l_bol~10^45-10^47erg/s. the sample consists of x-ray or mid-infrared (24 micron) point sourceswith optical magnitude r&lt;=21.5 mag and optical emission line spectracharacteristic of agns. for the range of luminosity and redshift probed byages, the distribution of estimated eddington ratios is well described aslog-normal with a peak at l_bol/l_edd ~ 1/4 and a dispersion of 0.3 dex. sinceadditional sources of scatter are minimal, this dispersion must account forcontributions from the scatter between estimated and true bh mass and thescatter between estimated and true bolometric luminosity. therefore, weconclude that: (1) neither of these sources of error can contribute more than\~0.3 dex rms; and (2) the true eddington ratios of optically luminous agns areeven more sharply peaked. because the mass estimation errors must be smallerthan ~0.3 dex, we can also investigate the distribution of eddington ratios atfixed bh mass. we show for the first time that the distribution of eddingtonratios at fixed bh mass is peaked, and that the dearth of agns at a factor ~10below eddington is real and not an artifact of sample selection. these resultsprovide strong evidence that supermassive bhs gain most of their mass whileradiating close to the eddington limit, and they suggest that the fueling ratesin luminous agns are ultimately determined by bh self-regulation of theaccretion flow rather than galactic scale dynamical disturbances.

astro-ph;0608006	probing the evolution of ir properties of z~6 quasars: spitzer  observations	we present spitzer observations of thirteen z~6 quasars using the infraredarray camera (irac) and multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips). allthe quasars except sdss j000552.34-000655.8 (sdss j0005-0006) were detectedwith high s/n in the four irac channels and the mips 24um band, while sdssj0005-0006 was marginally detected in the irac 8.0um band, and not detected inthe mips 24um band. we find that most of these quasars have prominent emissionfrom hot dust as evidenced by the observed 24um fluxes. their spectral energydistributions (seds) are similar to those of low-redshift quasars at rest-frame0.15-3.5 um, suggesting that accretion disks and hot-dust structures for thesesources already have reached maturity. however, sdss j0005-0006 has an unusualsed that lies significantly below low-redshift sed templates at rest-frame 1and 3.5 um, and thus shows a strong near-ir (nir) deficit and no hot-dustemission. type i quasars with extremely small nir-to-optical flux ratios likesdss j0005-0006 are not found in low-redshift quasar samples, indicating thatsdss j0005-0006 has different dust properties at high redshift. we combine thespitzer observations with x-ray, uv/optical, mm/submm and radio observations todetermine bolometric luminosities for all the quasars. we find that the fourquasars with central black-hole mass measurements have eddington ratios oforder unity.
