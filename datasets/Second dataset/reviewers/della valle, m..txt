0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0904.3463	five supernova survey galaxies in the southern hemisphere. i. optical  and near-infrared database	the determination of the supernova (sn) rate is based not only on the numberof detected events, but also on the properties of the parent galaxy population.this is the first paper of a series aimed at obtaining new, refined, sn ratesfrom a set of five sn surveys, by making use of a joint analysis ofnear-infrared (nir) data. we describe the properties of the 3838 galaxies thatwere monitored for sne events, including newly determined morphologies andtheir denis and poss-ii/ukst i, 2mass and denis j and ks and 2mass hmagnitudes. we have compared 2mass, denis and poss-ii/ukst ijk magnitudes inorder to find possible systematic photometric shifts in the measurements. thedenis and poss-ii/ukst i band magnitudes show large discrepancies (meanabsolute difference of 0.4 mag), mostly due to different spectral responses ofthe two instruments, with an important contribution (0.33 mag rms) from thelarge uncertainties in the photometric calibration of the poss-ii and ukstphotographic plates. in the other wavebands, the limiting near infraredmagnitude, morphology and inclination of the galaxies are the most influentialfactors which affect the determination of photometry of the galaxies.nevertheless, no significant systematic differences have been found between ofany pair of nir magnitude measurements, except for a few percent of galaxiesshowing large discrepancies. this allows us to combine denis and 2mass data forthe j and ks filters.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

1004.0901	unveiling the origin of x-ray flares in gamma-ray bursts	we present an updated catalog of 113 x-ray flares detected by swift in the~33% of the x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grb). 43 flares have ameasured redshift. for the first time the analysis is performed in 4 differentx-ray energy bands, allowing us to constrain the evolution of the flaretemporal properties with energy. we find that flares are narrower at higherenergies: their width follows a power-law relation w~e^{-0.5} reminiscent ofthe prompt emission. flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time whichis twice the rise time on average. both time scales linearly evolve with time,giving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both timescales are stretched by the same factor. as a consequence, the flare widthlinearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearlydistinguishes the flare from the grb prompt emission. the flare 0.3-10 kev peakluminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with largescatter: l_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. when multiple flares are present, a globalsoftening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than theprevious one. the 0.3-10 kev isotropic energy distribution is a log-normalpeaked at 10^{51} erg, with a possible excess at low energies. the flareaverage spectral energy distribution (sed) is found to be a power-law withspectral energy index beta~1.1. these results confirmed that the flares aretightly linked to the prompt emission. however, after considering variousmodels we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entireset of observations.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1006.0800	the afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205: evidence for a ly-alpha  emitter at z=4.65	gamma-ray bursts have been proved to be detectable up to distances muchlarger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. to thisend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to thestudy of the high-z grb 090205. we carried out optical/nir spectroscopy andimaging of grb 090205 with the eso-vlt starting from hours after the event upto several days later to detect the host galaxy. we compared the resultsobtained from our optical/nir observations with the available swift high-energydata of this burst. our observational campaign led to the detection of theoptical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205 and to the first measure of itsredshift, z=4.65. similar to other, recent high-z grbs, grb 090205 has a shortduration in the rest-frame with t_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibilitythat it might belong to the short grbs class. the x-ray afterglow of grb 090205shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. photometricobservations of the grb 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxywith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 myr. moreover, the metallicity ofz &gt; 0.27 z_sun derived from the grb afterglow spectrum is among the highestderived from grb afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burstoccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. finally, a detailed analysis of theafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to lyman-alphaemission at the redshift of the burst. grb 090205 is thus hosted in a typicallyman-alpha emitter (lae) at z=4.65. this makes the grb 090205 host thefarthest grb host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

(1999) and mannucci et al. (2005).  early-type cluster galaxies show a type ia sn rate (0.066 snum) similar tothat obtained by sharon et al. (2007) and more than 3 times larger than that infield early-type galaxies (0.019 snum). this difference has a 98% statisticalconfidence level. we examine many possible observational biases which couldaffect the rate determination, and conclude that none of them is likely tosignificantly alter the results. we investigate how the rate is related toseveral properties of the parent galaxies, and find that cluster membership,morphology and radio power all affect the sn rate, while galaxy mass has nomeasurable effect. the increased rate may be due to galaxy interactions inclusters, inducing either the formation of young stars or a different evolutionof the progenitor binary systems.  we present the first measurement of the core-collapse sn rate in clusterlate-type galaxies, which turns out to be comparable to the rate in fieldgalaxies. this suggests that no large systematic difference in the initial massfunction exists between the two environments.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1408.6227	a search for \textit{fermi} bursts associated to supernovae and their  frequency of occurrence	context: observations suggest that the major fraction of long durationgamma-ray bursts (grbs) are connected with broad-lines supernovae ib/c,(sne-ibc). the presence of grb-sne is revealed by rebrightenings emerging fromthe optical grb afterglow $10$--$15$ days, in the rest-frame of the source,after the prompt grb emission. aims: \textit{fermi}-gbm has a field of view(fov) which is about 6.5 times larger than the fov of \textit{swift}, thereforewe expect that a number of grb-sn connections have been missed due to lack ofoptical and x-ray instruments on board of \textit{fermi}, which are essentialto reveal sne associated with grbs. this fact has motivated our search in the\textit{fermi} catalogue for possible grb-sn events. methods: the search forpossible grb-sn associations follows two requirements: (1) sn should fallinside the \textit{fermi}-gbm error box of the considered long grb, and (2)this grb should occur within $20$ days before the sn event. results: we havefound $5$ cases, within $z&lt;0.2$ fulfilling the above reported requirements. oneof them, grb 130702a-sn 2013dx, was already known as grb-sn association. wehave analyzed the remaining $4$ cases and we concluded that three of them are,very likely, just random coincidences, due to the \textit{fermi}-gbm largeerror box associated with each grb detection. we found one grb possiblyassociated with a sn 1998bw-like, grb 120121b/sn 2012ba. conclusions: the verylow redshift of grb 120121b/sn 2012ba ($z = 0.017$) implies a low isotropicenergy of this burst ($e_{iso} = 1.39 \times 10^{48}$) erg. we then compute therate of \textit{fermi} low-luminosity grbs connected with sne to be $\rho_{0,b}\leq 770\ $gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. we estimate that \textit{fermi}-gbm coulddetect $1$--$4$ grbs-sne within $z \leq 0.2$ in the next 4 years.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

0805.0377	measuring the cosmological parameters with the ep,i-eiso correlation of  gamma-ray bursts	we have used the ep,i-eiso correlation of grbs to measure the cosmologicalparameter omega_m. by adopting a maximum likelihood approach which allows us tocorrectly quantify the extrinsic (i.e. non--poissonian) scatter of thecorrelation, we constrain (for a flat universe) omega_m to 0.04-0.40 (68%confidence level), with a best fit value of omega_m ~ 0.15, and exclude omega_m= 1 at 99.9% confidence level. if we release the assumption of a flat universe,we still find evidence for a low value of omega_m (0.04-0.50 at 68% confidencelevel) and a weak dependence of the dispersion of the ep,i-eiso correlation onomega_lambda (with an upper limit of omega_lambda ~ 1.15 at 90% confidencelevel). our approach makes no assumptions on the ep,i-eiso correlation and itdoes not use other calibrators to set the "zero' point of the relation,therefore our treatment of the data is not affected by circularity and theresults are independent of those derived via type ia sne (or other cosmologicalprobes). unlike other multi-parameters correlations, our analysis grounds ononly two parameters, then including a larger number (a factor ~3) of grbs andbeing less affected by systematics. simulations based on realisticextrapolations of ongoing (and future) grb experiments (e.g., swift,konus-wind, glast) show that: i) the uncertainties on cosmological parameterscan be significantly decreased; ii) future data will allow us to get clues onthe "dark energy" evolution.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

0805.4698	outliers from the mainstream: how a massive star can produce a gamma-ray  burst	it is now recognized that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are linked tothe collapse of massive stars, based on the association between (low-redshift)grbs and (type ic) core-collapse supernovae (sne). the census of massive starsand grbs reveals, however, that not all massive stars do produce a grb. only~1% of core collapse sne are able to produce a highly relativistic collimatedoutflow, and hence a grb. the extra crucial parameter has long been suspectedto be metallicity and/or rotation. we find observational evidence stronglysupporting that both ingredients are necessary in order to make a grb out of acore-collapsing star. a detailed study of the absorption pattern in the x-rayspectrum of grb060218 reveals evidence of material highly enriched in lowatomic number metals ejected before the sn/grb explosion. we find that, withinthe current scenarios of stellar evolution, only a progenitor starcharacterized by a fast stellar rotation and sub-solar initial metallicitycould produce such a metal enrichment in its close surrounding.

astro-ph;0205120	first optical identification of a suprsoft x-ray source in m31	we propose the first association of an optical counterpart with a luminoussupersoft x-ray source in m31, rx j0044.0+4118, observed with rosat in july1991. the pspc position is at 1.6" angular distance from a candidate nova inoutburst in september of 1990. this is interesting because the incidence ofclassical novae among supersoft x-ray sources is an open question. the proposedoptical counterpart was measured at r~17.7 in september of 1990, and it hadfaded to r&gt;19.2 when it was observed again after 70 days.  the light curve was too sparsely monitored for definite conclusions on thespeed class of the nova. no other variable objects with v&lt;23.5 were found inthe rosat spatial error box. we evaluate that the probability that a classicalor recurrent nova was in outburst in the rosat error box in the few yearspreceding the observation is very small, so the proposed identification ismeaningful. we also show evidence that the associated supersoft x-ray sourceturned off in the third year after the outburst.

astro-ph;0607504	a new formulation of the type ia sn rate and its consequences on  galactic chemical evolution	in recent papers mannucci et al. (2005, 2006) suggested, on the basis ofobservational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay timesfor the explosion of type ia sne. in this paper, we test this hypothesis inmodels of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. we show that this proposed scenario iscompatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. when the newrate is introduced in the two-infall model for the milky way, the derived typeia sn rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at veryearly epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo morethan in the previous widely adopted formulations for the snia rate. as aconsequence of this, the [o/fe] ratio decreases faster for [fe/h] &gt; -2.0 dex,relative to the old models. for a typical elliptical of 10^11 m_sun of luminousmass, the new rate produces average [alpha/ fe] ratios in the dominant stellarpopulation still in agreement with observations. the type ia sn rate also inthis case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to theprevious results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of ourgalaxy. we have also checked the effects of the new type ia sn rate on theevolution of the fe content in the icm, as a consequence of its production fromcluster ellipticals and we found that less fe in the icm is produced with thenew rate, due to the higher fraction of fe synthesized at early times andremaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. for dwarf irregular galaxiessuffering few bursts of star formation we obtain [o/fe] ratios larger by 0.2dex relative to the previous models.

astro-ph;0610783	a nicmos search for obscured supernovae in starburst galaxies	the detection of obscured supernovae (sne) in near-infrared monitoringcampaigns of starburst galaxies has shown that a significant fraction of sne ismissed by optical surveys. however, the number of sne detected in ground-basednear-ir observations is still significantly lower than the number of sneextrapolated from the fir luminosity of the hosts. a possibility is that mostsne occur within the nuclear regions, where the limited angular resolution ofground-based observations prevents their detection. this issue prompted us toexploit the superior angular resolution of nicmos-hst to search for obscuredsne within the first kpc from the nucleus of strong starbursting galaxies. atotal of 17 galaxies were observed in snapshot mode. based on their firluminosity, we expected to detect not less than ~12 sne. however, no confirmedsn event was found. from our data we derive an observed nuclear sn rate &lt;0.5sn/yr per galaxy. the shortage of sn detections can be explained by acombination of several effects. the most important are: i) the existence of astrong extinction, a_v&gt;11; ii) most sne occur within the first 0.5" (whichcorresponds in our sample to about 500pc) where even nicmos is unable to detectsn events.

astro-ph;0702355	how many supernovae are we missing at high redshift?	near-infrared and radio searches for core-collapse supernovae (cc sne) in thelocal universe have shown that the vast majority of the events occurring inmassive starburst are missed by the current optical searches as they explode invery dusty environments. recent infrared observations have shown that thefraction of star-formation activity that takes place in very luminous dustystarbursts sharply increases with redshift and becomes the dominant starformation component at z&gt;0.5. as a consequence, an increasing fraction of sneare expected to be missed by high-redshift optical searches. we estimate that5-10% of the local cc sne are out of reach of the optical searches. thefraction of missing events rises sharply toward z=1, when about 30% of the ccsne will be undetected. at z=2 the missing fraction will be about 60%.correspondingly, for type ia sne, our computations provide missing fractions of15% at z=1 and 35% at z=2. such large corrections are crucially important tocompare the observed sn rate with the expectations from the evolution of thecosmic star formation history, and to design the future sn searches at highredshifts.

astro-ph;9706191	supernova 1994aj: a probe for pre-supernova evolution and mass loss from  the progenitor	extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn1994aj until 540dafter maximum light have been obtained. the photometry around maximum suggeststhat the sn belongs to the type ii linear class, with a peak absolute magnitudeof mv ~ -17.8 (assuming ho=75 km/s/mpc). the spectra of sn1994aj were unusualwith the presence of a narrow line with a p-cygni profile on the top of thebroad balmer line emission. this narrow feature is attributed to the presenceof a dense superwind surrounding the sn. at 100-120 days after maximum lightthe sn ejecta starts to interact with this csm. the sn luminosity decline ratesslowed down (gamma_r=0.46 mag/100d), becoming less steep than the average lateluminosity decline of normal snii (~1 mag/100d). this dense (mdot/u_w ~ 10^15g/cm) wind was confined to a short distance from the progenitor (r_out ~5x10^16 cm), and results from a very strong mass loss episode (mdot = 10^-3msun/yr), which terminated shortly before explosion (~5-10 yr).

astro-ph;9707016	snia light curves and radioactive decay	the absolute v light curves of 5 sne ia, selected to represent the knownrange of absolute luminosities at maximum for this class of objects, arepresented. comparison of the long term luminosity evolution shows that thedifferences seen at maximum persist, and actually increase with time,einforcing the notion that intrinsic differences do exist among sne ia. sincesuch differences are not accounted for in the standard progenitor scenario, itbecomes important to derive constraints for the models directly from theobservations. in order to investigate the influence of the two most importantparameters, that is the masses of the synthesized radioactive material and ofthe ejecta, a simple mc light curve model was used to simulate the luminosityevolution from the explosion to very late epochs (~1000 days). it was foundthat the observations require a range of a factor 10 in the masses of theradioactive material synthesized in the explosion (mni= 0.1-1.1 msun,) and afactor 2 in the total mass of the ejecta (mej = 0.7-1.4 msun). differences of afactor 2 in mni seem to be present even among `normal' sne ia. some evidencewas also found that the deposition of the positrons from co decay varies fromobject to object, and with time. in particular, the latest hst observations ofsn 1992a seem to imply complete trapping of the positrons.

astro-ph;9712212	discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe and  its cosmological implications	the ultimate fate of the universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can bedetermined by measuring the redshifts, apparent brightnesses, and intrinsicluminosities of very distant supernovae. recent developments have providedtools that make such a program practicable: (1) studies of relatively nearbytype ia supernovae (sne ia) have shown that their intrinsic luminosities can beaccurately determined; (2) new research techniques have made it possible toschedule the discovery and follow-up observations of distant supernovae,producing well over 50 very distant (z = 0.3 -- 0.7) sne ia to date. thesedistant supernovae provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over thepast several billion years. by making precise measurements of supernovae atstill greater distances, and thus extending this expansion history back farenough in time, we can distinguish the slowing caused by the gravitationalattraction of the universe's mass density omega_m from the effect of a possiblyinflationary pressure caused by a cosmological constant lambda. we report herethe first such measurements, with our discovery of a type ia supernova (sn1997ap) at z = 0.83. measurements at the keck ii 10-m telescope make this themost distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. over two months ofphotometry of sn 1997ap with the hubble space telescope and ground-basedtelescopes, when combined with previous measurements of nearer sne ia, suggeststhat we may live in a low mass-density universe. further supernovae atcomparable distances are currently scheduled for ground and space-basedobservations.

astro-ph;9905016	nova sagittarii 1994 #1 (v4332 sagittarii): the discovery and evolution  of an unusual luminous red variable star	we report photometry and spectroscopy of the evolution of nova sagittarii1994 #1 (v4332 sagittarii) during outburst. we compare the photometric andspectral evolution of this outburst to known classes of outbursts -- includingclassical novae and outbursts occurring on symbiotic stars -- and find thisobject does not conform to any known class of outburst. the closest match tothe behavior of this unusual object is m31 rv, an extremely luminous and redvariable object discovered in the bulge of m31 in 1988. however, the temporalbehavior and maximum luminosity of the two events differ by several orders ofmagnitude, requiring substantial intrinsic variation if these two events aremembers the same type of outburst.  our model of the spectroscopic evolution of this outburst shows that theeffective temperature cooled from 4400 k to 2300 k over the three month span ofour observations. in combination with line diagnostics in our later spectra,including [oi] lambda 5577 and the dramatic increase in the halpha to hbetaratio, we infer the existence of a cool, dense (n_e ~ 10^{8-9} cm^{-3})envelope that is optically thick in the hydrogen balmer recombination lines(case c). we suggest that a nuclear event in a single star, in which a slowshock drove the photosphere outwards, can power the observed luminosityevolution and the emission spectrum.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.

0811.0718	the first two transient supersoft x-ray sources in m 31 globular  clusters and the connection to classical novae	classical novae (cne) have been found to represent the major class ofsupersoft x-ray sources (sss) in our neighbour galaxy m 31. we determineproperties and evolution of the two first ssss ever discovered in the m 31globular cluster (gc) system. we have used xmm-newton, chandra and swiftobservations of the centre region of m 31 to discover both sss and to determinetheir x-ray light curves and spectra. we performed detailed analysis ofxmm-newton epic pn spectra of the source in bol 111 (ss1) using blackbody andnlte white dwarf (wd) atmosphere models. for the sss in bol 194 (ss2) we usedoptical monitoring data to search for an optical counterpart. both gc x-raysources were classified as sss. we identify ss1 with the cn m31n 2007-06brecently discovered in the m 31 gc bol 111. for ss2 we did not find evidencefor a recent nova outburst and can only provide useful constraints on the timeof the outburst of a hypothetical nova. the only known cn in a m 31 gc can beidentified with the first sss found in a m31 gc. we discuss the impact of ourobservations on the nova rate for the m 31 gc system.

0811.0989	probing the complex environments of grb host galaxies and intervening  systems: high resolution spectroscopy of grb050922c	the aim of this paper is to investigate the environment of gamma ray bursts(grbs) and the interstellar matter of their host galaxies. we use to thispurpose high resolution spectroscopic observations of the afterglow ofgrb050922c, obtained with uves/vlt 3.5 hours after the grb event. we foundthat, as for most high resolution spectra of grbs, the spectrum of theafterglow of grb050922c is complex. at least seven components contribute to themain absorption system at z=2.1992. the detection of lines of neutral elementslike mgi and the detection of fine-structure levels of the ions feii, siii andcii allows us to separate components in the grb ism along the line of sight.moreover, in addition to the main system, we have analyzed the five interveningsystems between z = 2.077 and z = 1.5664 identified along the grb line ofsight. grb afterglow spectra are very complex, but full of information. thiscan be used to disentangle the contribution of the different parts of the grbhost galaxy and to study their properties. our metallicity estimates agree withthe scenario of grbs exploding in low metallicity galaxies

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
