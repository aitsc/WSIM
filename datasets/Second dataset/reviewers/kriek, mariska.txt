0901.0551	the newfirm medium-band survey: filter definitions and first results	deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distantgalaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding ofthe early universe. as the vast majority of k- or irac-selected galaxies is toofaint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almostexclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to thebroad-band photometry. the best-achieved accuracy of these redshiftsdelta(z)/(1+z) ~ 0.06 at z&gt;1.5, which is sufficient for determining the broadcharacteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accuraterest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density.we have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the newfirm camera on thekitt peak 4m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshiftsin the range 1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5. the survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, whichprovide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 micron for all objectsin the 27.6 x 27.6 arcmin newfirm field. in this first paper, we illustrate thetechnique by showing medium band newfirm photometry of several galaxies at1.7&lt;z&lt;2.7 from the near-infrared spectroscopic sample of kriek et al. (2008).the filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted balmer breakin these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. the fullsurvey will provide similar data for ~8000 faint k-selected galaxies at z&gt;1.5in the cosmos and aegis fields. the filter set also enables efficient selectionof exotic objects such as high redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emissionlines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late t and candidate "y" dwarfscould be identified using only two of the filters.

0903.2044	the relation between compact, quiescent high redshift galaxies and  massive nearby elliptical galaxies: evidence for hierarchical, inside-out  growth	recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshiftare much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. here wecompare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sampleof massive galaxies at z ~ 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. weconfirm that the average stellar densities of the z ~ 2.3 galaxies within theeffective radius, rho(&lt;r_e), are two orders of magnitude higher than those oflocal elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. however, we also find thatthe densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, rho(&lt;1 kpc),are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. this suggests that inside-out growthscenarios are plausible, in which the compact high redshift galaxies make upthe centers of normal nearby ellipticals. the compact galaxies are common athigh redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution byrequiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceedconstraints imposed by the z=0 galaxy mass function. we infer that size growthmust be efficient, with (r_{1+2}/r_1) ~ (m_{1+2}/m_1)^2. a simple model wherecompact galaxies with masses ~ 10^11 msun primarily grow through minor mergersproduces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and numberdensity of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 x10^11 msun in the localuniverse. we note that this model also predicts evolution in the m_bh - sigmarelation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower blackhole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. the main observational uncertainty isthe conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed tocalibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high redshift galaxies.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0905.1692	an ultra-deep near-infrared spectrum of a compact quiescent galaxy at  z=2.2	several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies atz~2 are in a quiescent phase. moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to beultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. we have obtained a ~29 hrspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the gemininear-infrared spectrograph. the spectrum exhibits a strong optical break andseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z&gt;2quiescent galaxies. comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellarpopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (sfr) of 1-3msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 msol. we detectseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [nii]/halpha,[sii]/halpha and [oii]/[oiii] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions. thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission impliesactive star formation. the current sfr is &lt;1% of the past average sfr. if thisgalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it impliesthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates thatlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) could be common in these objects.nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. however, weshow that the agn contributes &lt;8% to the rest-frame optical emission. apossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;although a 0.5 gyr old stellar population can make up &lt;10% of the total stellarmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. nevertheless, thisspectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellarpopulation.

0906.2012	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3:  comparison of stellar population synthesis codes and constraints from the  rest-frame nir	we present sed modeling of a sample of 34 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3.these galaxies have nir spectroscopy that samples the rest-frame balmer/4000abreak as well as deep photometry in thirteen broadband filters. new to ouranalysis is irac data that extend the seds into the rest-frame nir. comparingparameters determined from sed fits with and without the irac data we find thatthe irac photometry significantly improves the confidence intervals of tau,a_v, stellar mass, and sfr for individual galaxies, but does not systematicallyalter the mean parameters of the sample. we use the irac data to assess howwell current stellar population synthesis codes describe the rest-frame nirseds of young galaxies where discrepancies between treatments of the tp-agbphase of stellar evolution are most pronounced. the models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), maraston (2005), and charlot &amp; bruzual (2008) all successfullyreproduce the seds of our galaxies with &lt; 5% differences in the quality of fit;however, the best-fit masses from each code differ systematically by as much asa factor of 1.5, and other parameters vary more, up to factors of 2-3. acomparison of best-fit stellar population parameters from different sps codes,dust laws, and metallicities shows that the choice of sps code is the largestsystematic uncertainty in most parameters, and that systematic uncertaintiesare typically larger than the formal random uncertainties. the sed fittingconfirms our previous result that galaxies with strongly suppressed starformation account for ~ 50% of the k-bright population at z ~ 2.3; however, theuncertainty in this fraction is large due to systematic differences in thessfrs derived from the three sps models.

0906.2778	a high stellar velocity dispersion for a compact massive galaxy at z=2.2	recent studies have found that the oldest and most luminous galaxies in theearly universe are surprisingly compact, having stellar masses similar topresent-day elliptical galaxies but much smaller sizes. this finding hasattracted considerable attention as it suggests that massive galaxies havegrown by a factor of ~five in size over the past ten billion years. a key testof these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of thecompact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has beenclaimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those inpresent-day galaxies of the same mass. here we report a measurement of thestellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z=2.186,corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 billion years. the velocitydispersion is very high at 510 (+165, -95) km/s, consistent with the mass andcompactness of the galaxy inferred from photometric data and indicatingsignificant recent structural and dynamical evolution of massive galaxies. theuncertainty in the dispersion was determined from simulations which include theeffects of noise and template mismatch. however, we caution that some subtlesystematic effect may influence the analysis given the low signal-to-noiseratio of our spectrum.

0906.4786	the evolving relations between size, mass, surface density, and star  formation in 3x10^4 galaxies since z=2	the presence of massive, compact, quiescent galaxies at z&gt;2 presents a majorchallenge for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. using oneof the deepest large public near-ir surveys to date, we investigate in detailthe correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size,stellar mass, and surface density) from z=2 to the present. at all redshifts,massive quiescent galaxies (i.e. those with little or no star formation) occupythe extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tightmass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of bothdensities and sizes. conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densitiescomprise a nearly-homogeneous population with little or no ongoing starformation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star-formation rates andvarying levels of dust obscuration. both the sizes and surface densities ofquiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z=2-0; we parameterize this evolutionfor both populations with simple power law functions and present best-fitparameters for comparison to future theoretical models. higher-mass quiescentgalaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results.interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at ratessimilar to those of quiescent galaxies. it is therefore possible that the samephysical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations,suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this sizeevolution.

0909.0111	a spatially resolved map of the kinematics, star-formation and stellar  mass assembly in a star-forming galaxy at z=4.9	we present a detailed study of the spatially resolved kinematics,star-formation and stellar mass in a highly amplified galaxy at z=4.92 behindthe lensing cluster ms1358+62. we use the observed optical, near- andmid-infrared imaging from hst acs &amp; nicmos and spitzer irac to derive thestellar mass and the gemini/nifs ifu to investigate the velocity structure ofthe galaxy from the nebular [oii] emission. using a detailed gravitational lensmodel, we account for lensing amplification factor 12.+/-2.0 and find that thisintrinsically l* galaxy has a stellar mass of m*=7+/-2x10^8mo, a dynamical massof mdyn=3+/-1x10^9csc^2(i)mo (within of 2kpc) and a star-formation rate of42+/-8mo/yr. the source-plane uv/optical morphology of this galaxy is dominatedby five discrete star-forming regions. exploiting the dynamical information wederive masses for individual star-forming regions of mcl~10^(8-9)mo with sizesof ~200pc. we find that, at a fixed size, the star-formation rate densitywithin these hii regions is approximately two orders of magnitude greater thanthose observed in local spiral/starburst galaxies, but consistent with the mostmassive hii regions in the local universe such as 30dor. finally, we comparethe spatially resolved nebular emission line velocity with the ly-alpha anduv-ism lines and find that this galaxy is surrounded by a galactic scaleoutflow in which the ly-alpha appears redshifted by ~150km/s and the uv-ismlines blue-shifted by -200km/s from the (systemic) nebular emission. thevelocity structure of the outflow mirrors that of the nebular emissionsuggesting the outflow is young (~15myr), and has yet to burst out of thesystem. taken together, these results suggest that this young galaxy isundergoing its first major epoch of mass assembly.

0909.0260	the hubble sequence beyond z=2 for massive galaxies: contrasting large  star-forming and compact quiescent galaxies	we present hubble space telescope nic2 morphologies of a spectroscopic sampleof massive galaxies at z~2.3, by extending our sample of 9 compact quiescentgalaxies (r_e~0.9 kpc) with 10 massive emission-line galaxies. theemission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission;there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an activegalactic nucleus (agn). the star-forming galaxies are the largest among theemission-line galaxies, with a median size of re = 2.8 kpc. the three galaxieswith the highest star formation rates (&gt; 100m \odot/yr) have irregular andclumpy morphologies. the agn host galaxies are more similar to the compactquiescent galaxies in terms of their structures (re~1.1 kpc) and spectralenergy distributions. the total sample clearly separates into two classes in acolor-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud,and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. however, it is unclearhow or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. three out of sixmassive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolveinto compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. for thesegalaxies a reverse scenario, in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by starformation is also plausible. we do caution though that the sample is small.nonetheless, it is evident that a hubble sequence of massive galaxies withstrongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z &gt; 2.

0909.3517	the stellar mass density and specific star formation rate of the  universe at z~7	we use a robust sample of 11 z~7 galaxies (z-dropouts) to estimate thestellar mass density of the universe when it was only ~750 myr old. we combinethe very deep optical to near-infrared photometry from the hst acs and nicmoscameras with mid-infrared spitzer irac imaging available through the goodsprogram. after carefully removing the flux from contaminating foregroundsources we have obtained reliable photometry in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron iracchannels. the spectral shapes of these sources, including their rest frameoptical colors, strongly support their being at z~7 with a mean photometricredshift of &lt;z&gt;=7.2+/-0.5. we use bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) synthetic stellarpopulation models to constrain their stellar masses and star formationhistories. we find stellar masses that range over 0.1 -12x10^9 m_sol andaverage ages from 20 myr to up to 425 myr with a mean of ~300 myr, suggestingthat in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z&gt;8 (andprobably at z&gt;~10). the best fits to the observed seds are consistent withlittle or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z~4-8. thestar formation rates (sfr) are in the range from 5-20 m_sol/yr. from thissample we measure a stellar mass density of 6.6_{-3.3}^{+5.4}x10^5 m_sol/mpc^3to a limit of m_{uv,ab}&lt;-20 (or 0.4 l*(z=3)). combined with a fiducial lowerlimit for their ages (80 myr) this implies a maximum sfr density of 0.008m_sol/yr/mpc^3. this is well below the critical level needed to reionize theuniverse at z~8 using standard assumptions. however, this result is based onluminous sources (&gt;l*) and does not include the dominant contribution of thefainter galaxies. strikingly, we find that the specific sfr is constant fromz~7 to z~2 but drops substantially at more recent times.

0909.5182	how massive are massive compact galaxies?	using a sample of nine massive compact galaxies at z ~ 2.3 with rest-frameoptical spectroscopy and comprehensive u through 8um photometry we investigatehow assumptions in sed modeling change the stellar mass estimates of thesegalaxies, and how this affects our interpretation of their size evolution. theseds are fit to tau-models with a range of metallicities, dust laws, as well asdifferent stellar population synthesis codes. these models indicate massesequal to, or slightly smaller than our default masses. the maximum differenceis 0.16 dex for each parameter considered, and only 0.18 dex for the mostextreme combination of parameters. two-component populations with a maximallyold stellar population superposed with a young component provide reasonablefits to these seds using the models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003); however, usingmodels with updated treatment of tp-agb stars the fits are poorer. thetwo-component models predict masses that are 0.08 to 0.22 dex larger than thetau-models. we also test the effect of a bottom-light imf and find that itwould reduce the masses of these galaxies by 0.3 dex. considering the range ofallowable masses from the tau-models, two-component fits, and imf, we concludethat on average these galaxies lie below the mass-size relation of galaxies inthe local universe by a factor of 3-9, depending on the sed models used.

0912.0514	the growth of massive galaxies since z=2	we study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using datafrom the newfirm medium band survey. the sample is selected at a constantnumber density of n=2x10^-4 mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can becompared in a meaningful way. we show that the stellar mass of galaxies at thisnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following therelation log(m)=11.45-0.15z. in order to determine at what physical radii thismass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame r-band images atredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. these image stacks of typically 70-80galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surfacebrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. we find that massive galaxiesgradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 gyr. the mass within aradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpchas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. parameterizing the surfacebrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and sersic n parameterevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. the data demonstratethat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extendedstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radialdensity distributions. comparing the observed mass evolution to the averagestar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likelydominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% ofthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. the main uncertainties in this study arepossible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses andthe conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

1003.3479	well-sampled far-infrared spectral energy distributions of z ~ 2  galaxies: evidence for scaled up cool galaxies	we present an analysis of the far-infrared (fir) spectral energydistributions (seds) of two massive k-selected galaxies at z = 2.122 and z =2.024 detected at 24um, 70um, 160um by spitzer, 250um, 350um, 500um by blast,and 870um by apex. the large wavelength range of these observations and theavailability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify thepeak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um. the seds of bothgalaxies are reasonably well fit by synthetic templates of local galaxies withl_ir ~ 10^{11} l_{sun} -- 10^{12} l_{sun} yet both galaxies have l_{ir} ~10^{13} l_{sun}. this suggests that these galaxies are not high redshiftanalogues of the hyper-lirgs/ulirgs used in local templates, but are instead"scaled up" versions of local ulirgs/lirgs. for both galaxies the starformation rate determined from the best-fit fir seds (sfr(l_{ir})) agrees withthe sfr determined from the dust corrected h-alpha luminosity (sfr(h-alpha)) towithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the sfr of these galaxies is estimatedusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependenttemplate method (sfr(24um)), it systematically overestimates the sfr by as muchas a factor of 6. a larger sample of 24 k-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3 drawnfrom the kriek et al. (2008) gnirs sample shows the same trend betweensfr(24um) and sfr(h-alpha). using that sample we show that sfr(24um) andsfr(h-alpha) are in better agreement when sfr(24um) is estimated using the logaverage of local templates rather than selecting a single luminosity-dependenttemplate, because this incorporates lower luminosity templates. the betteragreement between sfrs from lower luminosity templates suggests that the firseds of the blast-detected galaxies may be typical for massive galaxies at z ~2, and that the majority are scaled up versions of lower luminosity localgalaxies.

1008.3901	evolution of galaxy stellar mass functions, mass densities, and mass to  light ratios from z 7 to z 4	we derive stellar masses from sed fitting to rest-frame optical and uv fluxesfor 401 star-forming galaxies at z 4, 5, and 6 from hubble-wfc3/ir observationsof the ers combined with the deep goods-s spitzer/irac data (and include apreviously-published z 7 sample). a mass-luminosity relation with stronglyluminosity-dependent m/luv ratios is found for the largest sample (299galaxies) at z 4. the relation m \propto l_{uv,1500}^(1.7+/-0.2) has awell-determined intrinsic sample variance of 0.5 dex. this relation is alsoconsistent with the more limited samples at z 5-7. this z 4 mass-luminosityrelation, and the well-established faint uv luminosity functions at z 4-7, areused to derive galaxy mass functions (mf) to masses m~10^8 at z 4-7. a bootstapapproach is used to derive the mfs to account for the large scatter in them--luv relation and the luminosity function uncertainties, along with ananalytical crosscheck. the mfs are also corrected for the effects ofincompleteness. the incompleteness-corrected mfs are steeper than previouslyfound, with slopes \alpha_m-1.4 to -1.6 at low masses. these slopes are,however, still substantially flatter than the mfs obtained from recenthydrodynamical simulations. we use these mfs to estimate the stellar massdensity (smd) of the universe to a fixed m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 as a function ofredshift and find a smd growth \propto(1+z)^{-3.4 +/-0.8} from z 7 to z 4. wealso derive the smd from the completeness-corrected mfs to a mass limitm~10^{8} msun. such completeness-corrected mfs and the derived smds will beparticularly important for model comparisons as future mfs reach to lowermasses.

1008.4357	the spectral energy distribution of post-starburst galaxies in the  newfirm medium-band survey: a low contribution from tp-agb stars	stellar population synthesis (sps) models are a key ingredient of many galaxyevolution studies. unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated forcertain stellar evolution stages. of particular concern is the treatment of thethermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase, as differentimplementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties.post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as tp-agb stars arethought to be most prominently visible during this phase. here, we usepost-starburst galaxies in the newfirm medium-band survey to assess differentsps models. the available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous andwell-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.0, from which weconstruct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (sed) over therange 1200-40 000 angstrom. the sed is well-fit by the bruzual &amp; charlot spsmodels, while the maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical andnear-infrared parts of the sed simultaneously. when the fitting is restrictedto lambda &lt; 6000 angstrom, the maraston models overpredict the near-infraredluminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to tp-agb stars.using the flexible sps models by conroy et al, and assuming solar metallicity,we find that the contribution of tp-agb stars to the integrated sed is a factorof ~3 lower than predicted by the latest padova tp-agb models. whether this isdue to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dustobscuration of tp-agb stars remains to be addressed. altogether, our datademand a low contribution from tp-agb stars to the sed of post-starburstgalaxies.

1103.0279	halpha and 4000 angstrom break measurements for ~3500 k-selected  galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0	we measure spectral features of ~3500 k-selected galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 fromhigh quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. first, we divide thegalaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the fullspectral energy distributions (seds) of the galaxies. for each of these 32galaxy types we construct a composite sed by de-redshifting and scaling theobserved photometry. this approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio andsampling of galaxy seds and allows for model-independent stellar populationstudies. the composite seds are of spectroscopic quality, and facilitate -- forthe first time -- halpha measurement for a large magnitude-limited sample ofdistant galaxies. the linewidths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty ofdz&lt;0.02x(1+z). the composite seds also show the balmer and 4000 angstrombreaks, mgii absorption at ~2800 angstrom, the dust absorption feature at 2175angstrom, and blended [oiii]+hbeta emission. we compare the total equivalentwidth of halpha, [nii], and [sii] (w_halpha+) with the strength of the 4000angstrom break (d(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, andfind that all these properties are strongly correlated. this is a reassuringresult, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on justcontinuum emission. furthermore, the relation between w_halpha+ and dn(4000)provides interesting clues to the sfhs of galaxies, as these features aresensitive to different stellar ages. we find that the correlation betweenw_halpha+ and d(4000) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 is similar to z~0, and that the suppressionof star formation in galaxies at z&lt;2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradualprocess.

1104.2595	the number density and mass density of star-forming and quiescent  galaxies at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.2	we study the build-up of the bimodal galaxy population using the newfirmmedium-band survey, which provides excellent redshifts and well-sampledspectral energy distributions of ~27,000 galaxies with k&lt;22.8 at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.2.we first show that star-forming galaxies and quiescent galaxies can be robustlyseparated with a two-color criterion over this entire redshift range. we thenstudy the evolution of the number density and mass density of quiescent andstar-forming galaxies, extending the results of the combo-17, deep2, and othersurveys to z=2.2. the mass density of quiescent galaxies with m &gt; 3 10^11 solarmasses increases by a factor of ~10 from z=2 to the present day, whereas themass density in star-forming galaxies is flat or decreases over the same timeperiod. modest mass growth by a factor of 2 of individual quiescent galaxiescan explain roughly half of the strong density evolution at m&gt;10^11 solarmasses, due to the steepness of the exponential tail of the mass function. therest of the density evolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is likely due totransformation (e.g. quenching) of the massive star-forming population, aconclusion which is consistent with the density evolution we observe for thestar-forming galaxies themselves, which is flat or decreasing with cosmic time.modest mass growth does not explain the evolution of less massive quiescentgalaxies (~10^10.5 solar masses), which show a similarly steep increase intheir number densities. the less massive quiescent galaxies are thereforecontinuously formed by transforming galaxies from the star-forming population

1104.3860	the stellar velocity dispersion of a compact massive galaxy at z=1.80  using x-shooter: confirmation of the evolution in the mass-size and  mass-dispersion relations	recent photometric studies have shown that early-type galaxies at fixedstellar mass were smaller and denser at earlier times. in this paper we assessthat finding by deriving the dynamical mass of such a compact quiescent galaxyat z=1.8. we have obtained a high-quality spectrum with full uv-nir wavelengthcoverage of galaxy nmbs-c7447 using x-shooter on the vlt. we determined avelocity dispersion of 294 +- 51 km/s. given this velocity dispersion and theeffective radius of 1.64 +- 0.15 kpc (as determined from hst-wfc3 f160wobservations) we derive a dynamical mass of 1.7 +- 0.5 x 10^11 msun. comparisonof the full spectrum with stellar population synthesis models indicates thatnmbs-c774 has a relatively young stellar population (0.40 gyr) with little orno star formation and a stellar mass of ~1.5 x 10^11 msun. the dynamical andphotometric stellar mass are in good agreement. thus, our study supports theconclusion that the mass densities of quiescent galaxies were indeed higher atearlier times, and this earlier result is not caused by systematic measurementerrors. by combining available spectroscopic measurements at differentredshifts, we find that the velocity dispersion at fixed dynamical mass was afactor of ~1.8 higher at z=1.8 compared to z=0. finally, we show that theapparent discrepancies between the few available velocity dispersionmeasurements at z&gt;1.5 are consistent with the intrinsic scatter of themass-size relation.

1105.4609	the newfirm medium-band survey: photometric catalogs, redshifts and the  bimodal color distribution of galaxies out to z~3	we present deep near-infrared (nir) medium-bandwidth photometry over thewavelength range 1-1.8 microns in the all-wavelength extended groth stripinternational survey (aegis) and cosmic evolution survey (cosmos) fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs),an noao survey program on the mayall 4m telescope on kitt peak using the noaoextremely wide-field infrared imager (newfirm). in this paper, we describe thefull details of the observations, data reduction and photometry for the survey.we also present a public k-selected photometric catalog, along with accuratephotometric redshifts. the redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in thecosmos (aegis) fields, combining the nir medium-bandwidth data with existingultraviolet (uv; galaxy evolution explorer), visible and nir(canada-france-hawaii telescope and subaru) and mid-ir (spitzer/irac) imaging.we find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts,with sigma_z/(1+z)~1-2% for ~4000 galaxies at z=0-3. the nmbs catalogs contain~13,000 galaxies at z&gt;1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-framecolors. due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five nirmedium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometricredshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of ~2 timessmaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band nir photometry to nirbroadband photometry. we show evidence for a clear bimodal color distributionbetween quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z~3, a higherredshift than has been probed so far.

1107.0972	redshift evolution of the galaxy velocity dispersion function	we present a study of the evolution of the galaxy velocity dispersionfunction (vdf) from z=0 to z=1.5 using photometric data from the ukidss ultradeep survey (uds) and newfirm medium band survey (nmbs) cosmos surveys. the vdfhas been measured locally using direct kinematic measurements from the sloandigital sky survey, but direct studies of the vdf at high redshift aredifficult as they require velocity dispersion measurements of many thousands ofgalaxies. taylor et al. (2010) demonstrated that dynamical and stellar mass arelinearly related when the structure of the galaxy is accounted for. we showthat the stellar mass, size and s\'ersic index can reliably predict thevelocity dispersions of sdss galaxies. we apply this relation to galaxies athigh redshift and determine the evolution of the inferred vdf. we find that thevdf at z~0.5 is very similar to the vdf at z=0. at higher redshifts, we findthat the number density of galaxies with dispersions &lt;~200 km/s is lower, butthe number of high dispersion galaxies is constant or even higher. at fixedcumulative number density, the velocity dispersions of galaxies withlogn[mpc^{-3}]&lt;-3.5 increase with time by a factor of ~1.4 from z~1.5-0,whereas the dispersions of galaxies with lower number density are approximatelyconstant or decrease with time. the vdf appears to show less evolution than thestellar mass function, particularly at the lowest number densities. we notethat these results are still somewhat uncertain and we suggest several avenuesfor further calibrating the inferred velocity dispersions.

1108.6060	first results from the 3d-hst survey: the striking diversity of massive  galaxies at z&gt;1	we present first results from the 3d-hst program, a near-ir spectroscopicsurvey performed with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope. wehave used 3d-hst spectra to measure redshifts and halpha equivalent widths fora stellar mass-limited sample of 34 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 with m(stellar)&gt;10^11m(sun) in the cosmos, goods, and aegis fields. we find that a substantialfraction of massive galaxies at this epoch are forming stars at a high rate:the fraction of galaxies with halpha equivalent widths &gt;10 a is 59%, comparedto 10% among sdss galaxies of similar masses at z=0.1. galaxies with weakhalpha emission show absorption lines typical of 2-4 gyr old stellarpopulations. the structural parameters of the galaxies, derived from theassociated wfc3 f140w imaging data, correlate with the presence of halpha:quiescent galaxies are compact with high sersic index and high inferredvelocity dispersion, whereas star-forming galaxies are typically largetwo-armed spiral galaxies, with low sersic index. some of these star forminggalaxies might be progenitors of the most massive s0 and sa galaxies. ourresults challenge the idea that galaxies at fixed mass form a homogeneouspopulation with small scatter in their properties. instead we find that massivegalaxies form a highly diverse population at z&gt;1, in marked contrast to thelocal universe.

1112.0313	a large population of massive compact post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;1:  implications for the size evolution and quenching mechanism of quiescent  galaxies	we study the growth of the red sequence through the number density andstructural evolution of a sample of young and old quiescent galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.the galaxies are selected from the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) in thecosmic evolution survey (cosmos) field. we find a large population of massiveyoung recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z&gt;1 that are almostnon-existent at z&lt;1; their number density is 5 x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} at z=2,whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z=0.5. the observed number densities ofyoung and old quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 are consistent with a simple model inwhich all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburstgalaxies. we find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies havesmaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, inagreement with other recent studies. interestingly, the most recently quenchedgalaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than oldergalaxies at those redshifts. this result is inconsistent with the idea that theevolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven bycontinuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, theyoungest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. instead, mergers orother mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescentgalaxies from z=2 to the present.

1202.1822	spatially resolved halpha maps and sizes of 57 strongly star-forming  galaxies at z~1 from 3d-hst: evidence for rapid inside-out assembly of disk  galaxies	we investigate the build-up of galaxies at z~1 using maps of halpha andstellar continuum emission for a sample of 57 galaxies with rest-frame halphaequivalent widths &gt;100 angstroms in the 3d-hst grism survey. we find that thehalpha emission broadly follows the rest-frame r-band light but that it istypically somewhat more extended and clumpy. we quantify the spatialdistribution with the half-light radius. the median halpha effective radiusr_e(halpha) is 4.2+-0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compactobjects with r_e(halpha) ~ 1.0 kpc to extended disks with r_e(halpha) ~ 15 kpc.comparing halpha sizes to continuum sizes, we find&lt;r_e(halpha)/r_e(r)&gt;=1.3+-0.1 for the full sample. that is, star formation, astraced by halpha, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-framer-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up fromthe inside out. this effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for thelargest galaxies. using the measured halpha sizes, we derive star formationrate surface densities. we find that they range from ~0.05 msun yr^{-1}kpc^{-2} for the largest galaxies to ~5 msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2} for the smallestgalaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-formingz~1 galaxies. finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very highgas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times &lt; 500 myr. although otherexplanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we aresimultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disksat z~1.

1204.2829	3d-hst: a wide-field grism spectroscopic survey with the hubble space  telescope	we present 3d-hst, a near-infrared spectroscopic treasury program with thehubble space telescope for studying the processes that shape galaxies in thedistant universe. 3d-hst provides rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of~7000 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, the epoch when 60% of all star formation took place,the number density of quasars peaked, the first galaxies stopped forming stars,and the structural regularity that we see in galaxies today must have emerged.3d-hst will cover 3/4 (625 sq.arcmin) of the candels survey area with twoorbits of primary wfc3/g141 grism coverage and two to four parallel orbits withthe acs/g800l grism. in the ir these exposure times yield a continuumsignal-to-noise of ~5 per resolution element at h~23.1 and a 5sigma emissionline sensitivity of 5x10-17 erg/s/cm2 for typical objects, improving by afactor of ~2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. thewfc3/g141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1-1.6 um at aspatial resolution of ~0."13, which, combined with their depth, makes them aunique resource for studying galaxy evolution. we present the preliminaryreduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission line andredshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra andphotometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. the present analysisyields redshift estimates with a precision of sigma(z)=0.0034(1+z), orsigma(v)~1000 km/s. we illustrate how the generalized nature of the surveyyields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types ofobjects, including a quasar at z=4.7, quiescent galaxies at z~2, and the mostdistant t-type brown dwarf star known. the candels and 3d-hst surveys combinedwill provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic dataset for studies ofthe 1&lt;z&lt;3.5 universe until the launch of the james webb space telescope.

1206.2645	halpha equivalent widths from the 3d-hst survey: evolution with redshift  and dependence on stellar mass	we investigate the evolution of the halpha equivalent width, ew(halpha), withredshift and its dependence on stellar mass, taking advantage of the first datafrom the 3d-hst survey, a large spectroscopic treasury program with the hubblespace telescope wfc3. combining our halpha measurements of 854 galaxies at0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5 with those of ground based surveys at lower and higher redshift, wecan consistently determine the evolution of the ew(halpha) distribution fromz=0 to z=2.2. we find that at all masses the characteristic ew(halpha) isdecreasing towards the present epoch, and that at each redshift the ew(halpha)is lower for high-mass galaxies. we measure a slope of ew(halpha) ~ (1+z)^(1.8)with little mass dependence. qualitatively, this measurement is amodel-independent confirmation of the evolution of star forming galaxies withredshift. a quantitative conversion of ew(halpha) to ssfr is very modeldependent, because of differential reddening corrections between the continuumsed and the balmer lines. the observed ew(halpha) can be reproduced with asimple model in which the sfr for galaxies rises to the epoch of z~2.5 and thendecreases with time to z = 0. the model implies that the ew(halpha) rises to400 a at z=8. the ssfr evolves faster than ew(halpha), as the mass-to-lightratio also evolves with redshift. in this context, we find that the ssfrevolves as (1+z)^(3.2), nearly independent of mass, consistent with previousreddening insensitive estimates. we confirm previous results that the observedslope of the ssfr-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, butmodels and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

1211.3424	stellar kinematics of z~2 galaxies and the inside-out growth of  quiescent galaxies	using stellar kinematics measurements, we investigate the growth of massive,quiescent galaxies from z~2 to today. we present x-shooter spectra from the uvto nir and dynamical mass measurements of 5 quiescent massive (&gt;10^11 msun)galaxies at z~2. this triples the sample of z&gt;1.5 galaxies with wellconstrained (dsigma &lt;100 km/s) velocity dispersion measurements. from spectralpopulation synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar agesthat range from 0.5-2 gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. we measurevelocity dispersions (290-450 km/s) from absorption lines and find that theyare 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the sdss at the same mass.sizes are measured using galfit from hst-wfc3 h160 and uds k-band images. thedynamical masses correspond well to the sed based stellar masses, withdynamical masses that are ~15% higher. we find that m_*/m_dyn may decreaseslightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matterfraction within an increasing effective radius. we combine different stellarkinematic studies from the literature, and examine the structural evolutionfrom z~2 to z~0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radiusincreases by a factor of ~2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by afactor of ~1.7. the mass density within one effective radius decreases by afactor of ~20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases onlymildly (~2). when we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a populationof galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found(~4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.4, and interestingly, themass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. this findingsuggests that massive quiescent galaxies at ~2 grow inside-out, consistent withthe expectations from minor mergers.

1301.0320	the radial distribution of star formation in galaxies at z~1 from the  3d-hst survey	the assembly of galaxies can be described by the distribution of their starformation as a function of cosmic time. thanks to the wfc3 grism on hst it isnow possible to measure this beyond the local universe. here we present thespatial distribution of halpha emission for a sample of 54 stronglystar-forming galaxies at z~1 in the 3d-hst treasury survey. by stacking thehalpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximatelyexponential distributions at z~1, with median sersic index of n=1.0+-0.2. thestacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a=0.58+-0.09 in halpha,consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. keckspectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence forrotation, with inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. the moststraightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation instrongly star-forming galaxies at z~1 generally occurred in disks. the disksappear to be "scaled-up" versions of nearby spiral galaxies: they haveew(halpha)~100 angstroms out to the solar orbit and they have star formationsurface densities above the threshold for driving galactic scale winds.

1304.2391	the assembly of milky way-like galaxies since z~2.5	galaxies with the mass of the milky way dominate the stellar mass density ofthe universe but it is uncertain how and when they were assembled. here westudy progenitors of these galaxies out to z=2.5, using data from the 3d-hstand candels treasury surveys. we find that galaxies with present-day stellarmasses of log(m)~10.7 built ~90% of their stellar mass since z=2.5, with mostof the star formation occurring before z=1. in marked contrast to the assemblyhistory of massive elliptical galaxies, mass growth is not limited to largeradii: the mass in the central 2 kpc of the galaxies increased by a factor of3.2+-0.8 between z=2.5 and z=1. we therefore rule out simple models in whichbulges were fully assembled at high redshift and disks gradually formed aroundthem. instead, bulges (and black holes) likely formed in lockstep with disks,through bar instabilities, migration, or other processes. we find that afterz=1 the growth in the central regions gradually stopped and the disk continuedto build, consistent with recent studies of the gas distributions in z~1galaxies and the properties of many spiral galaxies today.

1305.1943	quiescent galaxies in the 3d-hst survey: spectroscopic confirmation of a  large number of galaxies with relatively old stellar populations at z~2	quiescent galaxies at z~2 have been identified in large numbers based onrest-frame colors, but only a small number of these galaxies have beenspectroscopically confirmed to show that their rest-frame optical spectra showeither strong balmer or metal absorption lines. here, we median stack therest-frame optical spectra for 171 photometrically-quiescent galaxies at 1.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.2 from the 3d-hst grism survey. in addition to hbeta (4861a), weunambiguously identify metal absorption lines in the stacked spectrum,including the g-band (4304a), mg i (5175a), and na i (5894a). this findingdemonstrates that galaxies with relatively old stellar populations alreadyexisted when the universe was ~3 gyr old, and that rest-frame color selectiontechniques can efficiently select them. we find an average age of 1.3^0.1_0.3gyr when fitting a simple stellar population to the entire stack. we confirmour previous result from medium-band photometry that the stellar age varieswith the colors of quiescent galaxies: the reddest 80% of galaxies aredominated by metal lines and have a relatively old mean age of 1.6^0.5_0.4 gyr,whereas the bluest (and brightest) galaxies have strong balmer lines and aspectroscopic age of 0.9^0.2_0.1 gyr. although the spectrum is dominated by anevolved stellar population, we also find [oiii] and hbeta emission.interestingly, this emission is more centrally concentrated than the continuumwith l_[oiii] = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10^40 erg s^-1, indicating residual central starformation or nuclear activity.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1308.1099	the dust attenuation law in distant galaxies: evidence for variation  with spectral type	this letter utilizes composite spectral energy distributions (seds)constructed from newfirm medium-band survey photometry to constrain the dustattenuation curve in 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 galaxies. based on similarities between the fullsed shapes (0.3-8 micron), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectralclasses and stacked their photometry. as each class contains galaxies over arange in redshift, the resulting rest-frame seds are well-sampled in wavelengthand show various spectral features including halpha and the uv dust bump at2175 angstrom. we fit all composite seds with flexible stellar populationsynthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and uvbump strengths. the milky way and calzetti law provide poor fits at uvwavelengths for nearly all seds. consistent with previous studies, we find thatthe best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type. there is a strongcorrelation between the best-fit dust slope and uv bump strength, with steeperlaws having stronger bumps. moreover, the attenuation curve correlates withspecific star formation rate (sfr), with more active galaxies having shallowerdust curves and weaker bumps. there is also a weak correlation withinclination. the observed trends can be explained by differences in thedust-to-star geometry, a varying grain size distribution, or a combination ofboth. our results have several implications for galaxy evolution studies.first, the assumption of a universal dust model leads to biases in derivedgalaxy properties. second, the presence of a dust bump may result inunderestimated values for the uv slope, used to correct sfrs of distantgalaxies.

1308.4132	how dead are dead galaxies? mid-infrared fluxes of quiescent galaxies at  redshift 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5: implications for star formation rates and dust  heating	we investigate the star formation rates of quiescent galaxies at highredshift (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.5) using 3d-hst wfc3 grism spectroscopy and spitzermid-infrared data. we select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely useduvj color-color criteria. spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frameoptical and near-ir) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescentgalaxies (ssfr ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). however, sed fitting can miss star formation ifit is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emittedin the mid-infrared. it is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscuredsfrs with a mid-ir indicator. we stack the mips-24um images of quiescentobjects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 andperform aperture photometry. including direct 24um detections, we find ssfr ~10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. these values are higher than those indicated by sedfitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typicalstar forming galaxies. the true sfrs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower,as we show that the mid-ir fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoingstar formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations andcircumstellar dust. our measurements show that star formation quenching is veryefficient at every redshift. the measured sfr values are at z &gt; 1.5 marginallyconsistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass lossfrom evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lowerredshifts.

1309.6638	tight correlations between massive galaxy structural properties and  dynamics: the mass fundamental plane was in place by z~2	the fundamental plane (fp) is an empirical relation between the size, surfacebrightness, and velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. this relation hasbeen studied extensively for early-type galaxies in the local universe toconstrain galaxy formation mechanisms. the evolution of the zeropoint of thisplane has been extended to high redshifts to study the luminosity evolution ofmassive galaxies, under the assumption of structural homology. in this work, weassess this assumption by replacing surface brightness with stellar massdensity and present the evolution of the "mass fp" for massive, quiescentgalaxies since z~2. by accounting for stellar populations, we thereby isolateand trace structural and dynamical evolution. despite the observed dramaticevolution in the sizes and morphologies of massive galaxies since z~3, we findthat quiescent galaxies lie on the mass fp out to z~2. in contrast with ~1.4dex evolution in the luminosity fp, average residuals from the z~0 mass fp areless than ~0.15 dex since z~2. assuming the hyde &amp; bernardi (2009) mass fpslope, we find that this minimal offset scales as (1+z)^{-0.095+/-0.043}. thisresult lends credence to previous studies that derived luminosity evolutionfrom the fp. therefore, despite their compact sizes and suggestions thatmassive galaxies are more disk-like at z~2, the relationship between theirdynamics and structural properties are consistent with local early-typegalaxies. finally, we find no strong evidence for a tilt of the mass fprelative to the virial plane, but emphasize the need for full models includingselection biases to fully investigate this issue.

1310.4177	direct measurements of dust attenuation in z~1.5 star-forming galaxies  from 3d-hst: implications for dust geometry and star formation rates	the nature of dust in distant galaxies is not well understood, and untilrecently few direct dust measurements have been possible. we investigate dustin distant star-forming galaxies using near-infrared grism spectra of the3d-hst survey combined with archival multi-wavelength photometry. these dataallow us to make a direct comparison between dust around star-forming regions($a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$) and the integrated dust content ($a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$).we select a sample of 163 galaxies between $1.36\le{}z\le1.5$ with h$\alpha$signal-to-noise ratio $\ge5$ and measure balmer decrements from stacked spectrato calculate $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$. first, we stack spectra in bins of$a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, and find that$a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}=1.86\,a_{v,\mathrm{star}}$, with a significance of$\sigma=1.7$. our result is consistent with the two-component dust model, inwhich galaxies contain both diffuse and stellar birth cloud dust. next, westack spectra in bins of specific star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{ssfr}$),star formation rate ($\log\,\mathrm{sfr}$), and stellar mass ($\log{}m_*$). wefind that on average $a_{v,\mathrm{hii}}$ increases with sfr and mass, butdecreases with increasing ssfr. interestingly, the data hint that the amount ofextra attenuation decreases with increasing ssfr. this trend is expected fromthe two-component model, as the extra attenuation will increase once olderstars outside the star-forming regions become more dominant in the galaxyspectrum. finally, using balmer decrements we derive dust-corrected h$\alpha$sfrs, and find that stellar population modeling produces incorrect sfrs ifrapidly declining star formation histories are included in the exploredparameter space.

1310.7020	exploring the chemical link between local ellipticals and their  high-redshift progenitors	we present keck/mosfire k-band spectroscopy of the first mass-selected sampleof galaxies at $z\sim2.3$. targets are selected from the 3d-hst treasurysurvey. the six detected galaxies have a mean [nii]$\lambda$6584/h$\alpha$ratio of $0.27\pm0.01$, with a small standard deviation of 0.05. this meanvalue is similar to that of uv-selected galaxies of the same mass. the meangas-phase oxygen abundance inferred from the [nii]/h$\alpha$ ratios depends onthe calibration method, and ranges from 12+log(o/h)$_{gas}=8.57$ for the{pettini} &amp; {pagel} (2004) calibration to 12+log(o/h)$_{gas}= 8.87$ for the{maiolino} {et~al.} (2008) calibration. measurements of the stellar oxygenabundance in nearby quiescent galaxies with the same number density indicate12+log(o/h)$_{stars}= 8.95$, similar to the gas-phase abundances of the$z\sim2.3$ galaxies if the {maiolino} {et~al.} (2008) calibration is used. thissuggests that these high-redshift star forming galaxies may be progenitors oftoday's massive early-type galaxies. the main uncertainties are the absolutecalibration of the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the incompleteness of the$z\sim2.3$ sample: the galaxies with detected h$\alpha$ tend to be larger andhave higher star formation rates than the galaxies without detected h$\alpha$,and we may still be missing the most dust-obscured progenitors.

1312.3950	x-ray properties of k-selected galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0: investigating  trends with stellar mass, redshift and spectral type	we examine how the total x-ray luminosity correlates with stellar mass,stellar population, and redshift for a k-band limited sample of ~3500 galaxiesat 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0 from the newfirm medium band survey in the cosmos field. thegalaxy sample is divided into 32 different galaxy types, based on similaritiesbetween the spectral energy distributions. for each galaxy type, we furtherdivide the sample into bins of redshift and stellar mass, and perform an x-raystacking analysis using the chandra cosmos (c-cosmos) data. we find that fullband x-ray luminosity is primarily increasing with stellar mass, and at similarmass and spectral type is higher at larger redshifts. when comparing at thesame stellar mass, we find that the x-ray luminosity is slightly higher foryounger galaxies (i.e., weaker 4000\aa breaks), but the scatter in thisrelation is large. we compare the observed x-ray luminosities to those expectedfrom low and high mass x-ray binaries (xrbs). for blue galaxies, xrbs canalmost fully account for the observed emission, while for older galaxies withlarger 4000\aa breaks, active galactic nuclei (agn) or hot gas dominate themeasured x-ray flux. after correcting for xrbs, the x-ray luminosity is stillslightly higher in younger galaxies, although this correlation is notsignificant. agn appear to be a larger component of galaxy x-ray luminosity atearlier times, as the hardness ratio increases with redshift. together with theslight increase in x-ray luminosity this may indicate more obscured agns orhigher accretion rates at earlier times.

1401.5472	simultaneous modeling of the stellar and dust emission in distant  galaxies: implications for star formation rate measurements	we have used near-ultraviolet (nuv) to mid-infrared (mir) composite spectralenergy distributions (seds) to simultaneously model the attenuated stellar anddust emission of 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 galaxies. these composite seds were previouslyconstructed from the photometric catalogs of the newfirm medium-band survey, bystacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-framenuv-to-nir seds. in this work, we include a stacked mips 24 micron measurementfor each sed type to extend the seds to rest-frame mir wavelengths. consistentwith previous studies, the observed mir emission for most sed types is higherthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. we fit the nuv-to-mircomposite seds by the flexible stellar population synthesis (sps) models, whichinclude both stellar and dust emission. we compare the best-fit star formationrates (sfrs) to the sfrs based on simple uv+ir estimators. interestingly, theuv and ir luminosities overestimate sfrs - compared to the model sfrs - by morethan ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forminggalaxies in our sample the two sfrs are broadly consistent. the difference inspecific sfrs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specificsfr, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific sfrs thanpreviously found. contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the uvand the mir seds most likely explain the discrepancy. based on this work, weconclude that sfrs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellarand dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple uv+ir-based sfrestimators.

0802.4094	confirmation of the remarkable compactness of massive quiescent galaxies  at z~2.3: early-type galaxies did not form in a simple monolithic collapse	using deep near-infrared spectroscopy kriek et al. (2006) found that ~45% ofmassive galaxies at z~2.3 have evolved stellar populations and little or noongoing star formation. here we determine the sizes of these quiescent galaxiesusing deep, high-resolution images obtained with hst/nic2 and laser guidestar-assisted keck/ao. considering that their median stellar mass is 1.7x10^11solar masses the galaxies are remarkably small, with a median effective radiusof 0.9 kpc. galaxies of similar mass in the nearby universe have sizes of ~5kpc and average stellar densities which are two orders of magnitude lower thanthe z~2.3 galaxies. these results extend earlier work at z~1.5 and confirmprevious studies at z&gt;2 which lacked spectroscopic redshifts and imaging ofsufficient resolution to resolve the galaxies. our findings demonstrate thatfully assembled early-type galaxies make up at most ~10% of the population ofk-selected quiescent galaxies at z~2.3, effectively ruling out simplemonolithic models for their formation. the galaxies must evolve significantlyafter z~2.3, through dry mergers or other processes, consistent withpredictions from hierarchical models.

1404.4874	dense cores in galaxies out to z=2.5 in sdss, ultravista, and the five  3d-hst/candels fields	the dense interiors of massive galaxies are among the most intriguingenvironments in the universe. in this paper we ask when these dense cores wereformed and determine how galaxies gradually assembled around them. we selectgalaxies that have a stellar mass &gt;3x10^10 msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,using the 3d-hst survey and data at low redshift. remarkably, the numberdensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 tothe present. this decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and theresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. we inferthat dense cores were mostly formed at z&gt;2.5, consistent with their largelyquiescent stellar populations. while the cores appear to form early, thegalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total massesincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radiiincrease by a factor of 5-6. as a result, the contribution of dense cores tothe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% atz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. because of their early formation, the contribution ofdense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the universe is a strongfunction of redshift. the stars in cores with m_1kpc&gt;3x10^10 msun make up ~0.1%of the stellar mass density of the universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, dependingon their imf. the formation of these cores required the conversion of ~10^11msun of gas into stars within ~1 kpc, while preventing significant starformation at larger radii.

1408.2521	the mosdef survey: mass, metallicity, and star-formation rate at z~2.3	we present results on the z~2.3 mass-metallicity relation (mzr) using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. we use aninitial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage ofh\beta, [oiii]\lambda 5007, h\alpha, and [nii]\lambda 6584 rest-frame opticalemission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the n2 ando3n2 strong-line indicators. we find a positive correlation between stellarmass and metallicity among individual z~2.3 galaxies using both the n2 and o3n2indicators. we also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygenabundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. among compositespectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellarmass, offset ~0.15-0.3 dex below the local mzr. when the sample is divided atthe median star-formation rate (sfr), we do not observe significant sfrdependence of the z~2.3 mzr among either individual galaxies or compositespectra. we furthermore find that z~2.3 galaxies have metallicities ~0.1 dexlower at a given stellar mass and sfr than is observed locally. this offsetsuggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local "fundamentalmetallicity relation" among stellar mass, metallicity, and sfr, and may provideevidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up dueto inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. however,robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshiftgalaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locallycalibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.

1409.2492	the fundamental plane of massive quiescent galaxies out to z~2	the fundamental plane (fp) of early-type galaxies, relating the effectiveradius, velocity dispersion, and surface brightness, has long been recognizedas a unique tool for analyzing galaxy structure and evolution. with thediscovery of distant quiescent galaxies and the introduction of highsensitivity near-infrared spectrographs, it is now possible to explore the fpout to z~2. in this letter we study the evolution of the fp out to z~2 usingkinematic measurements of massive quiescent galaxies ($m_{*}&gt;10^{11}m_{\odot}$). we find preliminary evidence for the existence of an fp out toz~2. the scatter of the fp, however, increases from z~0 to z~2, even whentaking into account the larger measurement uncertainties at higher redshifts.we find a strong evolution of the zero point from z~2 to z~0:$\delta\log_{10}m/l_g\propto(-0.49\pm0.03)~z$. in order to assess whether ourspectroscopic sample is representative of the early-type galaxy population atall redshifts, we compare their rest-frame g-z colors with those from a largermass complete sample of quiescent galaxies. at z&gt;1 we find that thespectroscopic sample is bluer. we use the color offsets to estimate amass-to-light ratio (m/l) correction. the implied fp zero point evolution aftercorrection is significantly smaller: $\delta\log_{10}m/l_g\propto(-0.39\pm0.02)~z$. this is consistent with an apparent formation redshift of$z_{\rm{form}}=6.62^{+3.19}_{-1.44}$ for the underlying population, ignoringthe effects of progenitor bias. a more complete spectroscopic sample isrequired at z~2 to properly measure the m/l evolution from the fp evolution.

1409.6522	the mosdef survey: optical agn diagnostics at z~2.3	we present results from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey onrest-frame optical agn identification and completeness at z~2.3. with oursample of 50 galaxies and 10 x-ray and ir-selected agn with measured h-beta,[oiii], h-alpha, and [nii] emission lines, we investigate the location of agnin the bpt, mex (mass-excitation), and cex (color-excitation) diagrams. we findthat the bpt diagram works well to identify agn at z~2.3 and that the z~0agn/star-forming galaxy classifications do not need to shift substantially atz~2.3 to robustly separate these populations. however, the mex diagram fails toidentify all of the agn identified in the bpt diagram, and the cex diagram issubstantially contaminated at high redshift. we further show that agn samplesselected using the bpt diagram have selection biases in terms of both hoststellar mass and stellar population, in that agn in low mass and/or highspecific star formation rate galaxies are difficult to identify using the bptdiagram. these selection biases become increasingly severe at high redshift,such that optically-selected agn samples at high redshift will necessarily beincomplete. we also find that the gas in the narrow-line region appears to bemore enriched than gas in the host galaxy for at least some mosdef agn.however, agn at z~2 are generally less enriched than local agn with the samehost stellar mass.

1409.7071	the mosdef survey: excitation properties of $z\sim 2.3$ star-forming  galaxies	we present results on the excitation properties of z~2.3 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. with itscoverage of the full suite of strong rest-frame optical emission lines, mosdefprovides an unprecedented view of the rest-frame optical spectra of arepresentative sample of distant star-forming galaxies. we investigate thelocations of z~2.3 mosdef galaxies in multiple emission-line diagnosticdiagrams. these include the [oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha and [oiii]/hb vs. [sii]/ha"bpt" diagrams, as well as the o_32 vs. r_23 excitation diagram. we recover thewell-known offset in the star-forming sequence of high-redshift galaxies in the[oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha bpt diagram relative to sdss star-forming galaxies.however, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is lesssignificant than for rest-frame-uv selected and emission-line selected galaxiesat z~2. furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearingwithin the low-mass half of the z~2.3 mosdef sample, where galaxies are shiftedtowards higher [nii]/ha at fixed [oiii]/hb. within the [oiii]/hb vs. [sii]/haand o_32 vs. r_23 diagrams, we find that z~2.3 galaxies are distributed likelocal ones, and therefore attribute the shift in the [oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha bptdiagram to elevated n/o abundance ratios among lower-mass (m_*&lt;10^10 m_sun)high-redshift galaxies. the variation in n/o ratios calls into question the useat high redshift of oxygen abundance indicators based on nitrogen lines, butthe apparent invariance with redshift of the excitation sequence in the o_32vs. r_23 diagram paves the way for using the combination of o_32 and r_23 as anunbiased metallicity indicator over a wide range in redshift. this indicatorwill allow for an accurate characterization of the shape and normalization ofthe mass-metallicity relationship over more than 10 gyr.

1411.0667	the formation of massive, compact galaxies at z=2 in the illustris  simulation	massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshift have been found to beconsiderably more compact than galaxies of similar mass in the local universe.how these compact galaxies formed has yet to be determined, though severalprogenitor populations have been proposed. here we investigate the formationprocesses and quantify the assembly histories of such galaxies in illustris, asuite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations encompassing a sufficientlylarge volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously resolving theinternal structure of galaxies. we select massive (~10^11 solar masses) andcompact (stellar half-mass radius &lt; 2 kpc) galaxies from the simulation at z=2.within the illustris suite, we find that these quantities are not perfectlyconverged, but are reasonably reliable for our purposes. the resultingpopulation is composed primarily of quiescent galaxies, but we also findseveral star-forming compact galaxies. the simulated compact galaxies aresimilar to observed galaxies in star formation activity and appearance. wefollow their evolution at high redshift in the simulation and find that thereare multiple pathways to form these compact galaxies, dominated by twomechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally triggeredby gas-rich major mergers between z~2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radiiby a factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times whenthe universe was much denser; the galaxies formed compact and remained so untilz~2.

1411.5363	the relation between dynamical mass-to-light ratio and color for massive  quiescent galaxies out to z~2 and comparison with stellar population  synthesis models	we explore the relation between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($m/l$) andrest-frame color of massive quiescent galaxies out to z~2. we use a galaxysample with measured stellar velocity dispersions in combination with hubblespace telescope and ground-based multi-band photometry. our sample spans alarge range in $\log m_{dyn}/l_{g}$ (of 1.6~dex) and $\log m_{dyn}/l_{k}$ (of1.3~dex). there is a strong, approximately linear correlation between the $m/l$for different wavebands and rest-frame color. the root-mean-scatter scatter in$\log~m_{dyn}/l$ residuals implies that it is possible to estimate the $m/l$with an accuracy of ~0.25 dex from a single rest-frame optical color. stellarpopulation synthesis (sps) models with a salpeter stellar initial mass function(imf) can not simultaneously match $m_{dyn}/l_{g}$ vs. $(g-z)_{rest-frame}$ and$m_{dyn}/l_{k}$ vs. $(g-k)_{rest-frame}$. by changing the slope of the imf weare still unable to explain the m/l of the bluest and reddest galaxies. we findthat an imf with a slope between $\alpha=2.35$ and $\alpha=1.35$ provides thebest match. we also explore a broken imf with a salpeter slope at$m&lt;1m_{\odot}$ and $m&gt;4m_{\odot}$ and a slope $\alpha$ in the intermediateregion. the data favor a slope of $\alpha=1.35$ over $\alpha=2.35$.nonetheless, our results show that variations between different sps models arecomparable to the imf variations. in our analysis we assume that the variationin $m/l$ and color is driven by differences in age, and that othercontributions (e.g., metallicity evolution, dark matter) are small. theseassumptions may be an important source of uncertainty as galaxies evolve inmore complex ways.

0804.4175	the detection of a red sequence of massive field galaxies at z~2.3 and  its evolution to z~0	the existence of massive galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation atz~2.3, identified in a previous paper, suggests that a red sequence may alreadybe in place beyond z=2. in order to test this hypothesis, we study therest-frame u-b color distribution of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3. the sample isdrawn from our near-infrared spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies. thecolor distribution shows a statistically significant (&gt;3 sigma) red sequence,which hosts ~60% of the stellar mass at the high-mass end. the red-sequencegalaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, as inferred from bothemission-line diagnostics and stellar continuum shapes. their strong balmerbreaks and their location in the rest-frame u-b, b-v plane indicate that theyare in a post-starburst phase, with typical ages of ~0.5-1.0 gyr. in order tostudy the evolution of the red sequence, we compare our sample withspectroscopic massive galaxy samples at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.045 and 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0. therest-frame u-b color reddens by ~0.25 mag from z~2.3 to the present at a givenmass. over the same redshift interval, the number and stellar mass density onthe high-mass end (&gt;10^11 msol) of the red sequence grow by factors of ~8 and~6, respectively. we explore simple models to explain the observed evolution.passive evolution models predict too strong d(u-b), and produce z~0 galaxiesthat are too red. more complicated models that include aging, galaxytransformations, and red mergers can explain both the number density and colorevolution of the massive end of the red sequence between z~2.3 and the present.

1504.02782	the mosdef survey: measurements of balmer decrements and the dust  attenuation curve at redshifts z~1.4-2.6	we present results on the dust attenuation curve of z~2 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. our sampleconsists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts inthe range z= 1.36-2.59 and high s/n measurements of, or upper limits on, theh-alpha and h-beta emission lines obtained with keck/mosfire. we constructcomposite seds of galaxies in bins of specific sfr and balmer optical depth inorder to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the uv throughnear-ir for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. our results implyan attenuation curve that is very similar to the smc extinction curve atwavelengths redward of 2500 angstroms. at shorter wavelengths, the shape of thecurve is identical to that of the calzetti relation, but with a lowernormalization (r_v). hence, the new attenuation curve results in sfrs that are~20% lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtainedwith the calzetti attenuation curve. moreover, we find that the difference inthe reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellarcontinuum correlates strongly with sfr, such that for dust-corrected sfrslarger than 20 msun/yr assuming a chabrier imf, the nebular emission linessuffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. a simplemodel that can account for these trends is one in which the uv through opticalstellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, whilethe nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated bydustier stellar populations for galaxies with large sfrs, as a result of theincreased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. consequently, uv- andsed-based sfrs may underestimate the total sfr at even modest levels of ~20msun/yr.

1506.03085	forming compact massive galaxies	in this paper we study a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies: thetransition of star forming galaxies into massive (m_stars~10^11 msun), compact(r_e~1 kpc) quiescent galaxies, which takes place from z~3 to z~1.5. we use hstgrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3d-hst/candels fields,more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine thesedata with keck mosfire and nirspec spectroscopy. we first confirm that apopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, usingk-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5. they have a mediannii/halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with sfr(tot)/sfr(halpha)~10, andhave a large range of observed line widths. we infer from the kinematics andspatial distribution of halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionizedgas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. bycombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics areconsistent with a nearly keplerian fall-off from v_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc tov_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius isdominated by the dense stellar component. next, we study the size and massevolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. even thoughindividual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compactionand mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed asimple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(logm_stars). this mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within afixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density orvelocity dispersion threshold. as shown in other studies, the mode of growthchanges after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steeptrack in the size-mass plane.

1507.03017	the mosdef survey: dissecting the star-formation rate vs. stellar mass  relation using h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ emission lines at z ~ 2	we present results on the star-formation rate (sfr) versus stellar mass($m_*$) relation (i.e., the "main sequence") among star-forming galaxies at1.37$\leq$$z$$\leq$2.61 using the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey.based on a sample of 261 galaxies with h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ spectroscopy, wehave estimated robust dust-corrected instantaneous sfrs over a large range in$m_*$ ($\sim10^{9.5}-10^{11.5}m_\odot$). we find a correlation betweenlog(sfr(h$\alpha$)) and log($m_*$) with a slope of 0.65$\pm$0.08(0.58$\pm$0.10) at 1.4&lt;z&lt;2.6 (2.1&lt;z&lt;2.6). we find that different assumptionsfor the dust correction, such as using the color-excess of the stellarcontinuum to correct the nebular lines, sample selection biases against redstar-forming galaxies, and not accounting for balmer absorption can yieldsteeper slopes of the log(sfr)-log($m_*$) relation. our sample is immune fromthese biases as it is rest-frame optically selected, h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ arecorrected for balmer absorption, and the h$\alpha$ luminosity is dust-correctedusing the nebular color-excess computed from the balmer decrement. the scatterof the log(sfr(h$\alpha$))-log($m_*$) relation, after accounting for themeasurement uncertainties, is 0.31 dex at 2.1&lt;z&lt;2.6, which is 0.05 dex largerthan the scatter in log(sfr(uv))-log($m_*$). based on comparisons to asimulated sfr-$m_*$ relation with some intrinsic scatter, we argue that in theabsence of direct measurements of galaxy-to-galaxy variations in theattenuation/extinction curves and the imf, one cannot use the difference in thescatter of the sfr(h$\alpha$)- and sfr(uv)-$m_*$ relations to constrain thestochasticity of star formation in high-redshift galaxies.

1507.03999	where stars form: inside-out growth and coherent star formation from hst  halpha maps of 2676 galaxies across the main sequence at z~1	we present ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies atz~1, made possible by the wfc3 grism on hst. employing this capability over allfive 3d-hst/candels fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. by creating deepstacked halpha (ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of1x10^-18\erg\s\cm^2\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionizedgas out to &gt;10kpc for typical l* galaxies at this epoch. we find that thespatial extent of the ha distribution increases with stellar mass asr(ha)[kpc]=1.5(mstars/10^10msun)^0.23. furthermore, the ha emission is moreextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-outassembly of galactic disks. this effect, however, is mass dependent withr(ha)/r(stars)=1.1(m/10^10msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(ha)~r(stars).we map the ha distribution as a function of sfr(ir+uv) and find evidence for`coherent star formation' across the sfr-m plane: above the main sequence, hais enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, ha is depressed at allradii. this suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving theenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks ofgalaxies. it also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequenceis real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. athigh masses (10^10.5&lt;m/msun&lt;10^11), above the main sequence, ha is particularlyenhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive blackholes. below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and astrong central dip in the ew(ha), and the inferred specific star formationrate, appears. importantly though, across the entirety of the sfr-m plane, theabsolute star formation rate as traced by ha is always centrally peaked, evenin galaxies below the main sequence.

1509.03636	the mosdef survey: electron density and ionization parameter at  $z\sim2.3$	using observations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey, weinvestigate the physical conditions of star-forming regions in $z\sim2.3$galaxies, specifically the electron density and ionization state. frommeasurements of the [o ii]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729 and [sii]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731 doublets, we find a median electron density of$\sim250$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim2.3$, an increase of an order of magnitudecompared to measurements of galaxies at $z\sim0$. while $z\sim2.3$ galaxies areoffset towards significantly higher o$_{32}$ values relative to local galaxiesat fixed stellar mass, we find that the high-redshift sample follows a similardistribution to the low-metallicity tail of the local distribution in theo$_{32}$ vs. r$_{23}$ and o3n2 diagrams. based on these results, we proposethat $z\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies have the same ionization parameter aslocal galaxies at fixed metallicity. in combination with simple photoionizationmodels, the position of local and $z\sim2.3$ galaxies in excitation diagramssuggests that there is no significant change in the hardness of the ionizingspectrum at fixed metallicity from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim2.3$. we find that$z\sim2.3$ galaxies show no offset compared to low-metallicity local galaxiesin emission line ratio diagrams involving only lines of hydrogen, oxygen, andsulfur, but show a systematic offset in diagrams involving [n ii]$\lambda$6584.we conclude that the offset of $z\sim2.3$ galaxies from the local star-formingsequence in the [n ii] bpt diagram is primarily driven by elevated n/o at fixedo/h compared to local galaxies. these results suggest that the local gas-phaseand stellar metallicity sets the ionization state of star-forming regions at$z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$.

1510.02106	the 3d-hst survey: hubble space telescope wfc3/g141 grism spectra,  redshifts, and emission line measurements for $\sim 100,000$ galaxies	we present reduced data and data products from the 3d-hst survey, a 248-orbithst treasury program. the survey obtained wfc3 g141 grism spectroscopy in fourof the five candels fields: aegis, cosmos, goods-s, and uds, along with wfc3$h_{140}$ imaging, parallel acs g800l spectroscopy, and parallel $i_{814}$imaging. in a previous paper (skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometriccatalogs in these four fields and in goods-n, the fifth candels field. here wedescribe and present the wfc3 g141 spectroscopic data, again augmented withdata from go-1600 in goods-n. the data analysis is complicated by the fact thatno slits are used: all objects in the wfc3 field are dispersed, and manyspectra overlap. we developed software to automatically and optimally extractinterlaced 2d and 1d spectra for all objects in the skelton et al. (2014)photometric catalogs. the 2d spectra and the multi-band photometry were fitsimultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking themorphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. the resulting catalog has98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $jh_{ir}\leq 26$ and22,548 with $jh_{ir}\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.of this sample 5,459 galaxies are at $z&gt;1.5$ and 9,621 are at $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5$,where h$\alpha$ falls in the g141 wavelength coverage. based on comparisonswith ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxiesand repeat observations, the typical redshift error for $jh_{ir}\leq 24$galaxies in our catalog is $\sigma_z \approx 0.003 \times (1+z)$, i.e., onenative wfc3 pixel. the $3\sigma$ limit for emission line fluxes of pointsources is $1.5\times10^{-17}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we show variousrepresentations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples thathighlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.

astro-ph;0603063	direct measurements of the stellar continua and balmer/4000 angstrom  breaks of red z&gt;2 galaxies: redshifts and improved constraints on stellar  populations	we use near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini,nirspec on keck, and isaac on the vlt to study the rest-frame optical continuaof three `distant red galaxies' (having js - ks &gt; 2.3) at z&gt;2. all three galaxyspectra show the balmer/4000 angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. thespectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum withan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. these redshifts agree well withthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with halpha emission. thistechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in therest-frame uv, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selectedin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. furthermore, weuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of halpha together withevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. inclusionof the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range ofpossible solutions for stellar population properties. we find that the stellarpopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dustystarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxywith a strong break and no detected line emission. the dusty starburst galaxyhas an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 msun. the spectra of thetwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 gyr and stellar masses of4*10^11 msun. the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthensour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry. largersamples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starburstsand (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0606330	clustering of k-selected galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5: evidence for a  color-density relation	we study the clustering properties of k-selected galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 usingdeep multiwavelength imaging in three fields from the musyc survey. these arethe first measurements to probe the spatial correlation function of k-selectedgalaxies in this redshift range on large scales, allowing for robustconclusions about the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. k-selectedgalaxies with k&lt;21 have a correlation length r_0 ~ 6 h^-1 mpc, larger thantypical values found for optically-selected galaxies. the correlation lengthdoes not depend on k-band magnitude, but it does increase strongly with color;the j-k&gt;2.3 distant red galaxies (drgs) have r_0 ~ 11 h^-1 mpc. contrary tofindings for optically-selected galaxies, k-selected galaxies that are faint inthe r-band cluster more strongly than brighter galaxies. these results suggestthat a color-density relation was in place at z&gt;2. our results indicate thatk-bright blue galaxies and k-bright red galaxies are fundamentally different,as they have different clustering properties. using a simple model of onegalaxy per halo, we infer halo masses ~ 5 x 10^12 m_sun for k&lt;21 galaxies and ~2 x 10^13 m_sun for drgs. a comparison of the observed space density of drgs tothe density of their host halos suggests large halo occupation numbers;however, this result is at odds with the lack of a strong small-scale excess inthe angular correlation function. we find that the z=0 descendants of thegalaxies considered here reside primarily in groups and clusters.

astro-ph;0606536	measuring the average evolution of luminous galaxies at z&lt;3: the  rest-frame optical luminosity density, spectral energy distribution, and  stellar mass density	(abridged) we present the evolution of the volume averaged properties of therest-frame optically luminous galaxy population to z~3, determined from fourdisjoint deep fields with optical to near-infrared wavelength coverage. weselect galaxies above a rest-frame v-band luminosity of 3x10^10 lsol andcharacterize their rest-frame uv through optical properties via the meanspectral energy distribution (sed). to measure evolution we apply the sameselection criteria to a sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky surveyand combo-17. the mean rest-frame 2200ang through v-band sed becomes steadilybluer with increasing redshift but at z&lt;3 the mean sed falls within the rangedefined by ``normal'' galaxies in the nearby universe. we measure stellarmass-to-light ratios (mstar/l) by fitting models to the rest-frame uv-opticalseds and derive the stellar mass density. the stellar mass density in luminousgalaxies has increased by a factor of 3.5-7.9 from z=3 to z=0.1, includingfield-to-field variance uncertainties. after correcting to total, the measuredmass densities at z&lt;2 lie below the integral of the star formation rate (sfr)density as a function of redshift as derived from uv selected samples. this mayindicate a systematic error in the mass densities or sfr(z) estimates. we findlarge discrepancies between recent model predictions for the evolution of themass density and our results, even when our observational selection is appliedto the models. finally we determine that distant red galaxies (selected to havej_s - k_s&gt;2.3) in our lv selected samples contribute 30% and 64% of the stellarmass budget at z~2 and z~ 2.8 respectively. these galaxies are largely absentfrom uv surveys and this result highlights the need for mass selection of highredshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0608446	spectroscopic identification of massive galaxies at z~2.3 with strongly  suppressed star formation	we present first results of a spectroscopic survey targeting k-selectedgalaxies at z=2.0-2.7 using the gnirs instrument on gemini-south. we obtainednear-infrared spectra with a wavelength coverage of 1.0-2.5 micron for 26k-bright galaxies (k&lt;19.7) selected from the musyc survey using photometricredshifts. we successfully derived spectroscopic redshifts for all 26 galaxiesusing rest-frame optical emission lines or the redshifted balmer/4000 angstrombreak. twenty galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7, forwhich bright emission lines like halpha and [oiii] fall in atmospheric windows.surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. themedian 2 sigma upper limit on the rest-frame equivalent width of halpha forthese nine galaxies is ~10 angstrom. the stellar continuum emission of thesesame nine galaxies is best fitted by evolved stellar population models. thebest-fit star formation rate (sfr) is zero for five out of nine galaxies, andconsistent with zero within 1 sigma for the remaining four. thus, both thehalpha measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that45% of our k-selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. this highfraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low sfrs may imply thatthe suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshiftthan is predicted by current cdm galaxy formation models. however, obscuredstar formation may have been missed, and deep mid-infrared imaging is needed toclarify this situation.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.
