0901.3321	spectrophotometrically identified stars in the pears-n and pears-s  fields	deep acs slitless grism observations and identification of stellar sourcesare presented within the great observatories origins deep survey (goods) northand south fields which were obtained in the probing evolution and reionizationspectroscopically (pears) program. it is demonstrated that even low resolutionspectra can be a very powerful means to identify stars in the field, especiallylow mass stars with stellar types m0 and later. the pears fields lay within thelarger goods fields, and we used new, deeper images to further refine theselection of stars in the pears field, down to a magnitude of mz = 25 using anewly developed stellarity parameter. the total number of stars with reliablespectroscopic and morphological identification was 95 and 108 in the north andsouth fields respectively. the sample of spectroscopically identified starsallows constraints to be set on the thickness of the galactic thin disk as wellas contributions from a thick disk and a halo component. we derive a thin diskscale height, as traced by the population of m4 to m9 dwarfs along twoindependent lines of sight, of h_thin = 370 +60/-65 pc. when including the moremassive m0 to m4 dwarf population, we derive h_thin = 300 +/- 70pc. in bothcases, we observe that we must include a combination of thick and halocomponents in our models in order to account for the observed numbers of faintdwarfs. the required thick disk scale height is typically h_thick=1000 pc andthe acceptable relative stellar densities of the thin disk to thick disk andthe thin disk to halo components are in the range of 0.00025&lt;f_halo&lt;0.0005 and0.05&lt;f_thick&lt;0.08 and are somewhat dependent on whether the more massive m0 tom4 dwarfs are included in our sample.

0706.2275	a dust component 2 kpc above the plane in ngc 891	the halo of ngc 891 has been the subject of studies for more than a decade.one of its most striking features is the large asymmetry in h$\alpha$ emission.in this letter, we will take a quantitative look at this asymmetry at differentwavelengths for the first time. we suggest that ngc 891 is intrinsically almostsymmetric and the large asymmetry in h$\alpha$ emission is mostly due to dustattenuation. we will quantify the additional optical depth needed to cause theobserved asymmetry in this model. by comparing large strips on the north eastside of the galaxy with strips covering the same area in the south west we canquantify and analyze the asymmetry in the different wavelengths. from the 24$\mu$m emission we find that the intrinsic asymmetry in star formation in ngc891 is small i.e., $\sim 30%$. the additional asymmetry in h$\alpha$ is modeledas additional symmetric dust attenuation which extends up to $\sim$ 40\arcsec(1.9 kpc) above the plane of the galaxy with a mid-plane value of $\tau$=0.8and a scale height of 0.5 kpc

0908.0693	quantified morphology of hi disks in the universe	he upcoming new perspective of the high redshift universe in the 21 cm lineof atomic hydrogen opens possibilities to explore topics of spiral diskevolution, hitherto reserved for the optical regime. the growth of spiral gasdisks over cosmic time can be explored with the new generation of radiotelescopes, notably the ska, and its precursors, as accurately as with thehubble space telescope for stellar disks. since the atomic hydrogen gas is thebuilding block of these disks, it should trace their formation accurately.morphology of hi disks can now equally be quantified over cosmic time. instudies of hst deep fields, the optical or uv morphology of high-redshiftgalaxy disks have been characterized using a few quantities: concentration (c),asymmetry (a), smoothness (s), second-order-moment (m20), the gini coefficient(g), and ellipticity (e). we have applied these parameters across wavelengthsand compared them to the hi morphology over the things sample. ngc 3184, anunperturbed disk, and ngc 5194, the canonical 3:1 interaction, serve asexamples for quantified morphology. we find that morphology parametersdetermined in hi are as good or better a tracer of interaction compared tothose in any other wavelength, notably in asymmetry, gini and m20. this opensthe possibility of using them in the parameterization pipeline for skaprecursor catalogues to select interacting or harassed galaxies from their himorphology. asymmetry, gini and m20 may be redefined for use on data-cubesrather than hi column density image.

0707.4165	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks viii: structure of the cold ism	the quantity of dust in a spiral disk can be estimated using the dust'stypical emission or the extinction of a known source. in this paper, we comparetwo techniques, one based on emission and one on absorption, applied onsections of fourteen disk galaxies. the two measurements reflect, respectivelythe average and apparent optical depth of a disk section. hence, they dependdifferently on the average number and optical depth of ism structures in thedisk. the small scale geometry of the cold ism is critical for accurate modelsof the overall energy budget of spiral disks. ism geometry, relativecontributions of different stellar populations and dust emissivity are all freeparameters in galaxy spectral energy distribution (sed) models; they are alsosometimes degenerate, depending on wavelength coverage. our aim is to constraintypical ism geometry. the apparent optical depth measurement comes from thenumber of distant galaxies seen in hst images through the foreground disk. wemeasure the ir flux in images from the {\it spitzer} infrared nearby galaxysurvey in the same section of the disk that was covered by hst. a physicalmodel of the dust is fit to the sed to estimate the dust surface density, meantemperature, and brightness in these disk sections. the surface density issubsequently converted into the average optical depth estimate. the twomeasurements generally agree. the ratios between the measured average andapparent optical depths of the disk sections imply optically thin clouds inthese disks. optically thick disks, are likely to have more than a single cloudalong the line-of-sight.

0707.4167	gaps in the cloud cover? comparing extinction measures in spiral disks	dust in galaxies can be mapped by either the fir/sub-mm emission, the opticalor infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known backgroundsource. we compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of fifteensections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ismresponsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a knownbackground source. in our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurementsof 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objectsidentified though foreground disks in hst/wfpc2 images. for the 13 galaxiesthat overlap with the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), we nowcompare these results with those obtained from an i-l color map. our goal is todetermine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dustyism, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the diskextinction.  we find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sectionsmarked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on thecloud cover of {\it spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiralarms--and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. we note that our infraredcolor map (e[i-l]) underestimates the overall dust presence in these disksseverely, because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in frontof the stellar distribution.

0708.0826	stellar populations across the ngc4244 truncated galactic disk	we use hst/acs to study the resolved stellar populations of the nearby,nearly edge-on galaxy ngc4244 across its outer disk surface density break. thestellar photometry allows us to study the distribution of different stellarpopulations and reach very low equivalent surface brightnesses. we find thatthe break occurs at the same radius for young, intermediate age, and old stars.the stellar density beyond the break drops sharply by a factor of at least 600in 5 kpc. the break occurs at the same radius independent of height above thedisk, but is sharpest in the midplane and nearly disappears at large heights.these results make it unlikely that truncations are caused by a star formationthreshold alone: the threshold would have to keep the same radial position fromless than 100 myr to 10 gyr ago, in spite of potential disturbances such asinfall and redistribution of gas by internal processes. a dynamicalinterpretation of truncation formation is more likely such as due to angularmomentum redistribution by bars or density waves, or heating and stripping ofstars caused by the bombardment of dark matter sub-halos. the latterexplanation is also in quantitative agreement with the small diffuse componentwe see around the galaxy.

0708.1119	spiral disk opacity from occulting galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky  survey	a spiral galaxy partially ovelapping a more distant elliptical offers anunique opportunity to measure the dust extinction in the foreground spiral.  from the sloan digital sky survey dr4 spectroscopic sample, we selected 83occulting galaxy pairs and measured disk opacity over the redshift range z =0.0-0.2 with the goal to determine the recent evolution of disk dust opacity.the enrichment of the ism changes over the lifetime of a disk and it isreasonable to expect the dust extinction properties of spiral disks as a wholeto change over their lifetime. when they do, the change will affect ourmeasurements of galaxies over the observable universe.  from the sdss pairs we conclude that spiral disks show evidence of extinctionto ~2 effective radii. however, no evidence for recent evolution of diskopacity is evident, due to the limited redshift range and our inability todistinguish other factors on disk opacity such as the presence of spiral armsand hubble type. such effects also mask any relation between surface brightnessand optical depth that has been found in nearby galaxies. hence, we concludethat the sdss spectral catalog is an excellent way to find occulting pairs andconstruct a uniform local sample. however, higher resolution than the sdssimages is needed to disentangle the effects of spiral arms and hubble type fromevolution since z = 0.2.

1104.3291	quantified hi morphology i: multi-wavelengths analysis of the things  galaxies	galaxy evolution is driven to a large extent by interactions and mergers withother galaxies and the gas in galaxies is extremely sensitive to theinteractions. one method to measure such interactions uses the quantifiedmorphology of galaxy images. well-established parameters are concentration,asymmetry, smoothness, gini, and m20 of a galaxy image. thus far, theapplication of this technique has mostly been restricted to restframeultra-violet and optical images. however, with the new radio observatoriesbeing commissioned (meerkat, askap, evla, wsrt/apertif, and ultimately ska), anew window on the neutral atomic hydrogen gas (hi) morphology of a largenumbers of galaxies will open up. the quantified morphology of gas disks ofspirals can be an alternative indicator of the level and frequency ofinteraction. the hi in galaxies is typically spatially more extended and moresensitive to low-mass or weak interactions. in this paper, we explore sixmorphological parameters calculated over the extent of the stellar (optical)disk and the extent of the gas disk for a range of wavelengths spanning uv,optical, near- and far-infrared and 21 cm (hi) of 28 galaxies from the hinearby galaxy survey (things). though the things sample is small and containsonly a single ongoing interaction, it spans both non-interacting andpost-interacting galaxies with a wealth of multi-wavelength data. we find thatthe choice of area for the computation of the morphological parameters is lessof an issue than the wavelength at which they are measured. the signal ofinteraction is as good in the hi as in any of the other wavelengths in whichmorphology has been used to trace the interaction rate to date, mostlystar-formation dominated ones (near- and far-ultraviolet). the asymmetry andm20 parameters are the ones which show the most promise as tracers ofinteraction in 21 cm line observations.

1104.3292	quantified hi morphology ii : lopsidedness and interaction in whisp  column density maps	lopsidedness of the gaseous disk of spiral galaxies is a common phenomenon indisk morphology, profile and kinematics. simultaneously, the asymmetry of agalaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, hasseen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxysamples. quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue todetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the universe. in this paper,we measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the hi column densitymaps from the westerbork observations of neutral hydrogen in irregular andspiral galaxies (whisp). these are concentration, asymmetry, smoothness, gini,m20, and one addition of our own, the gini parameter of the second order moment(gm). our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can beidentified with these parameters. our sample of 141 hi maps have all previousclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. we find that theasymmetry, m20, and our new gm parameter correlate only weakly with theprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. these three parameters maybe used to compute a probability that an hi disk is morphologically lopsidedbut not unequivocally to determine it. however, we do find that that thequestion whether or not an hi disk is interacting can be settled well usingmorphological parameters. parameter cuts from the literature do not translatefrom ultraviolet to hi directly but new selection criteria using combinationsof asymmetry and m20 or concentration and m20, work very well. we suggest thatfuture all-sky hi surveys may use these parameters of the column density mapsto determine the merger fraction and hence rate in the local universe with ahigh degree of accuracy.

1104.3297	quantified hi morphology iv: the merger fraction and rate in whisp	the morphology of the atomic hydrogen (hi) disk of a spiral galaxy is thefirst component to be disturbed by a gravitational interaction such as a mergerbetween two galaxies. we use a simple parametrisation of the morphology of hicolumn density maps of westerbork hi spiral project (whisp) to select thosegalaxies that are likely undergoing a significant interaction. merging galaxiesoccupy a particular part of parameter space defined by asymmetry (a), therelative contribution of the 20% brightest pixels to the second order moment ofthe column density map (m20) and the distribution of the second order momentover all the pixels (gm). based on their hi morphology, we find that 13% of thewhisp galaxies are in an interaction (concentration-m20) and only 7% based onclose companions in the data-cube. this apparent discrepancy can be attributedto the difference in visibility time scales: mergers are identifiable as closepairs for 0.5 gyr but ~1 gyr by their disturbed hi morphology. expressed asvolume merger rates, the two estimates agree very well: 7 and 6.8 x 10^-3mergers gyr^-1 mpc^-3 for paired and morphologically disturbed hi disksrespectively. the consistency of our merger fractions to those published forbigger surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey, shows that hi morphologycan be a very viable way to identify mergers in a large hi survey. therelatively high value for the volume merger rate may be a bias in the selectionor whisp volume. the expected boon in high-resolution hi data by the plannedmeerkat, askap and wsrt/apertif radio observatories will reveal the importanceof mergers in the local universe and, with the advent of ska, over cosmictimes.

1104.3305	quantified hi morphology v: hi disks in the virgo cluster	we explore the quantified morphology of atomic hydrogen (hi) disks in thevirgo cluster. these galaxies display a wealth of phenomena in their himorphology, e.g., tails, truncation and warps. these morphological disturbancesare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxiesundergo in this dense cluster environment. to quantify the morphologicaltransformation of the hi disks, we compute the morphological parameters of cas,gini, and m20 and our own gm for 51 galaxies in 48 hi column density maps fromthe viva project. some morphological phenomena can be identified in this spaceof relatively low resolution hi data. truncation of the hi disk can be cleanlyidentified via the concentration parameter (c&lt;1) and concentration can also beused to identify hi deficient disks (1&lt;c&lt;5). tidal interaction is typicallyidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to(optical) images of galaxies. we find that some selection criteria (gini-m20,asymmetry, and a modified concentration-m20) are still applicable for thecoarse (~15" fwhm) viva hi data. the phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonablywell identified using the gini-m20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tailsidentified but with as many contaminants). ram-pressure does move hi disks intoand out of most of our interaction criteria: the ram-pressure sequenceidentified by vollmer et al. (2009) tracks into and out of some of thesecriteria (asymmetry based and the gini-m20 selections, but not theconcentration-m20 or the gm based ones). therefore, future searches forinteraction using hi morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as amechanism to disturb hi disks enough to make them appear as gravitationallyinteracting. one mechanism would be to remove all the hi deficient (c&lt;5) disksfrom the sample, as these have undergone more than one hi removal mechanism.

1104.3306	quantified hi morphology iii: merger visibility times from hi in galaxy  simulations	major mergers of disk galaxies are thought to be a substantial driver ingalaxy evolution. to trace the fraction and the rate galaxies are in mergersover cosmic times, several observational techniques, including morphologicalselection criteria, have been developed over the last decade. we apply thismorphological selection of mergers to 21 cm radio emission line (hi) columndensity images of spiral galaxies in nearby surveys. in this paper, weinvestigate how long a 1:1 merger is visible in hi from n-body simulations. weevaluate the merger visibility times for selection criteria based on fourparameters: concentration, asymmetry, m20, and the gini parameter of secondorder moment of the flux distribution (gm). of three selection criteria used inthe literature, one based on concentration and m20 works well for the hiperspective with a merger time scale of 0.4 gyr. of the three selectioncriteria defined in our previous paper, the gm performs well and cleanlyselects mergers for 0.69 gyr. the other two criteria (a-m20 and c-m20), selectisolated disks as well, but perform best for face-on, gas-rich disks (t(merger)~ 1 gyr). the different visibility scales can be combined with the selectedfractions of galaxies in any large hi survey to obtain merger rates in thenearby universe. all-sky surveys such as wallaby with askap and the medium deepsurvey with the apetif instrument on westerbork are set to revolutionize ourperspective on neutral hydrogen and will provide an accurate measure of themerger fraction and rate of the present epoch.

0710.3191	galaxy structural parameters in source extractor	over the last decade, the concentration, asymmetry and smoothness (cas), aswell as the m20 and gini parameters have become popular to automaticallyclassify distant galaxies in images. ellipticals, spirals and irregulargalaxies all appear to occupy different regions of this parameter space. at thesame time, the source extractor (se) program has become the mainstay to produceob ject catalogs from large image surveys. a logical next step would be toincorporate the structural parameters into the source extractor software. thereare however several problems that arise: 1) the cas parameters are fits to theimages and source extractor eschews fits in the interest of speed, 2) thedefinition of the structural parameters changed over time. now that there is aclear and agreed-upon definition of the structural parameters, i amincorporating computed versions in the source extractor code (v2.5). the fittedcas parameters are available for the goods-n/s fields and i compare thecomputed structural parameters to those found by the previous fits. my goal isto expand the source structure information in source extractor catalogs inorder to improve automatic identification of sources, specifically of distantgalaxies. the computed parameters perform reasonably close to the fittedversions but noise appears in faint ob jects due to a lack of information. fora subset of objects, the asymmetry signal is outside the se boundaries andsmoothness still fails to compute for many ob jects. type classification basedon the se parameters still lacks resolving power.

0710.3776	structure and evolution of the opacity of spiral disks	the opacity of a spiral disk due to dust absorption influences everymeasurement we make of it in the uv and optical. two separate techniquesdirectly measure the total absorption by dust in the disk: calibrated distantgalaxy counts and overlapping galaxy pairs. the main results from both so farare a semi-transparent disk with more opaque arms, and a relation betweensurface brightness and disk opacity. in the spitzer era, sed models of spiraldisks add a new perspective on the role of dust in spiral disks. combined withthe overall opacity from galaxy counts, they yield a typical optical depth ofthe dusty ism clouds: 0.4 that implies a size of ~60 pc. work on galaxy countsis currently ongoing on the acs fields of m51, m101 and m81. occulting galaxiesoffer the possibility of probing the history of disk opacity from higherredshift pairs. evolution in disk opacity could influence distance measurements(sn1a, tully-fisher relation). here, we present first results fromspectroscopically selected occulting pairs in the sdss. the redshift range forthis sample is limited, but does offer a first insight into disk opacityevolution as well as a reference for higher redshift measurements.

1204.2940	evolution in the dust lane fraction of edge-on l* spiral galaxies since  z=0.8	the presence of a well-defined and narrow dust lane in an edge-on spiralgalaxy is the observational signature of a thin and dense molecular disk, inwhich gravitational collapse has overcome turbulence. using a sample ofgalaxies out to z~1 extracted from the cosmos survey, we identify the fractionof massive disks that display a dust lane. our goal is to explore the evolutionin the stability of the molecular ism disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmictimescale. we check the reliability of our morphological classificationsagainst changes in restframe wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with(artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from sdss. we find that thefraction of l* disks with dust lanes in cosmos is consistent with the localfraction (~80%) out to z~0.7. at z=0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightlylower. a somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentativelysupports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficientlydestroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. a small subsample of higher redshiftcosmos galaxies display low internal reddening (e[b-v]), as well as a lowincidence of dust lanes. these may be disks in which the growth of the dustyism disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. we note that at z=0.8, the mostmassive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. asmall contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massivepopulation may be responsible. the fact that the fraction of galaxies with dustlanes in cosmos is consistent with little or no evolution implies that modelsto explain the spectral energy distribution or the host galaxy dust extinctionof supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshiftspirals. it also suggests that dust lanes are long lived phenomena or can bereformed over very short time-scales.

1207.4916	quantified h i morphology vii: the morphology of extended disks in uv  and h i	extended ultraviolet (xuv) disks have been found in a substantial fraction oflate-type --s0, spiral and irregular-- galaxies. similarly, most late-typespirals have an extended gas disk, observable in the 21cm radio line (hi). themorphology of galaxies can be quantified well using a series of scale-invariantparameters; concentration- asymmetry-smoothness (cas), gini, m20, and gmparameters. in this paper, we compare the quantified morphology and effectiveradius (r50) of the westerbork observations of neutral hydrogen in irregularand spiral galaxies project (whisp) hi maps to those of far-andnear-ultraviolet images obtained with galex, to explore how close themorphology and scales of hi and uv in these disks correlate. we find that xuvdisks do not stand out by their effective radii in uv or hi. however, theconcentration index in fuv appears to select some xuv disks. and known xuvdisks can be identified via a criterion using asymmetry and m20; 80% of xuvdisks are included but with 55% contamination. this translates into 61candidate xuv disk out of our 266 galaxies, (23%) consistent with previousfindings. we consider three scenarios; tidal features from major mergers, thetypical extended hi disk is a photo- dissociation product of the xuv regionsand both hi and uv features originate in cold flows fueling the main galaxy. wedefine extended hi and uv disks based on their concentration (chi &gt; 5 and cfuv&gt; 4 respectively), but note that these two subsamples never overlap in thewhisp sample. this appears to discount a simple photo-dissociation origin ofthe outer hi disk. previously, we identified the morphology space occupied byongoing major mergers. known xuv disks rarely reside in the merger dominatedpart of hi morphology space but those that do are type 1. this suggests coldflows as the origin for the xuv complexes and their surrounding hi structures.

1209.0306	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks ix; dust and gas surface densities	our aim is to explore the relation between gas, atomic and molecular, anddust in spiral galaxies. gas surface densities are from atomic hydrogen and coline emission maps. to estimate the dust content, we use the disk opacity asinferred from the number of distant galaxies identified in twelve hst/wfpc2fields of ten nearby spiral galaxies. the observed number of distant galaxiesis calibrated for source confusion and crowding with artificial galaxy countsand here we verify our results with sub-mm surface brightnesses from archivalherschel-spire data. we find that the opacity of the spiral disk does notcorrelate well with the surface density of atomic (hi) or molecular hydrogen(h2) alone implying that dust is not only associated with the molecular cloudsbut also the diffuse atomic disk in these galaxies. our result is a typicaldust-to-gas ratio of 0.04, with some evidence that this ratio declines withgalactocentric radius, consistent with recent herschel results. we discuss thepossible causes of this high dust-to-gas ratio; an over-estimate of the dustsurface-density, an under-estimate of the molecular hydrogen density from comaps or a combination of both. we note that while our value of the meandust-to-gas ratio is high, it is consistent with the metallicity at themeasured radii if one assumes the pilyugin &amp; thuan calibration of gasmetallicity.

1304.3615	vlt/vimos observations of an occulting galaxy pair: redshifts and  effective extinction curve	we present vlt/vimos ifu observations of an occulting galaxy pair previouslydiscovered in hst observations. the foreground galaxy is a low-inclinationspiral disk, which causes clear attenuation features seen against the brightbulge and disk of the background galaxy. we find redshifts of $z=0.064\pm0.003$ and z=0.065 for the foreground and background galaxy respectively.this relatively small difference does not rule out gravitational interactionbetween the two galaxies. emission line ratios point to a star-forming, notagn-dominated foreground galaxy.  we fit the cardelli, clayton &amp; mathis (ccm) extinction law to the spectra ofindividual fibres to derive slope ($r_v$) and normalization ($a_v$). thenormalization agrees with the hst attenuation map and the slope is lower thanthe milky way relation ($r_v&lt;3.1$), which is likely linked to the spatialsampling of the disk. we speculate that the values of $r_v$ point to eithercoherent ism structures in the disk larger than usual ($\sim9$ kpc) or higherstarting values of $r_v$, indicative of recent processing of the dust.  the foreground galaxy is a low stellar mass spiral ($m_* \sim 3 \times 10^9m_\odot$) with a high dust content ($m_{\rm dust} \sim 0.5 \times 10^6m_\odot$). the dust disk geometry visible in the hst image would explain theobserved sed properties of smaller galaxies: a lower mean dust temperature, ahigh dust-to-stellar mass ratio but relatively little optical attenuation.ongoing efforts to find occulting pairs with a small foreground galaxies willshow how common this geometry is.

1305.3130	herschel observations of edge-on spirals (heroes). i: far-infrared  morphology and dust mass determination	context. edge-on spiral galaxies with prominent dust lanes provide us with anexcellent opportunity to study the distribution and properties of the dustwithin them. the heroes project was set up to observe a sample of seven largeedge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.  aims. within this first paper, we present the herschel observations andperform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive someglobal properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.  methods. we determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the herschelobservations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.modified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperturephotometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. the latter values arecompared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken fromthe literature.  results. on the whole, our herschel flux measurements agree well witharchival values. we find that the exponential horizontal dust distributionmodel often used in the literature generally provides a good description of theobserved horizontal profiles. three out of the seven galaxies show signaturesof extended vertical emission at 100 and 160 {\mu}m at the 5{\sigma} level, butin two of these it is probably due to deviations from an exactly edge-onorientation. only for ngc 4013, a galaxy in which vertically extended dust hasalready been detected in optical images, we can detect vertically extendeddust, and the derived scaleheight agrees with the value estimated throughradiative transfer modelling. our analysis hints at a correlation between thedust scaleheight and its degree of clumpiness, which we infer from thedifference between the dust masses as calculated from modelling of optical dataand from fitting the spectral energy distribution of herschel datapoints.

1307.2085	quantified hi morphology vii: star-formation and tidal influence on  local dwarf hi morphology	scale-invariant morphology parameters applied to atomic hydrogen maps (hi) ofgalaxies can be used to quantify the effects of tidal interaction orstar-formation on the ism. here we apply these parameters, concentration,asymmetry, smoothness, gini, m20, and the gm parameter, to two public surveysof nearby dwarf galaxies, the vla-angst and little-things survey, to explorewhether tidal interaction or the ongoing or past star-formation is a dominantforce shaping the hi disk of these dwarfs.  previously, hi morphological criteria were identified for ongoingspiral-spiral interactions. when we apply these to the irregular dwarfpopulation, they either select almost all or none of the population. we findthat only the asymmetry-based criteria can be used to identify very isolateddwarfs (i.e., these have a low tidal indication). otherwise, there is little orno relation between the level of tidal interaction and the hi morphology. wecompare the hi morphology to three star-formation rates based on either halpha,fuv or the resolved stellar population, probing different star-formationtime-scales.  the hi morphology parameters that trace the inequality of the distribution,the gini, gm, and m20 parameters, correlate weakly with all thesestar-formation rates. this is in line with the picture that local physicsdominates the ism appearance and not tidal effects. finally, we compare thesdss measures of star-formation and stellar mass to the hi morphologicalparameters for all four hi surveys. in the two lower-resolution hi surveys(12"), there is no relation between star-formation measures and hi morphology.the morphology of the two high-resolution hi surveys (6"), the asymmetry,smoothness, gini, m20, and gm, do show a link to the total star-formation, buta weak one.

0801.2909	the vertical dust structure in spiral disks	the halo of ngc 891 has been the subject of studies for more than a decade.one of its most striking features is the large asymmetry in h-$\alpha$emission. we have taken a quantitative look at this asymmetry at differentwavelengths for the first time. we propose that ngc 891 is intrinsically almostsymmetric, as seen in spitzer observations, and the large asymmetry inh-$\alpha$ emission is mostly due to dust attenuation. we quantify theadditional optical depth needed to cause the observed h-$\alpha$ asymmetry. acomparison of large strips on the north east side of the galaxy with stripscovering the same area in the south west we can quantify and analyze theasymmetry in the different wavelengths. from the 24 $\mu$m emission we findthat the intrinsic asymmetry in star-formation in ngc 891 is small i.e.,approximately 30%. the additional asymmetry in h-alpha is modeled as additionalsymmetric dust attenuation which extends up to ~ 40'' (1.9 kpc) above the planeof the galaxy with a mid-plane value of $\tau$=0.8 and a scale height of 0.5kpc. this observational technique offers the possibility to quantify theeffects of vertical ism disk stability as an explanation for dust lanes inmassive galaxies dalcanton et al.

0801.2933	structure and evolution of the opacity of spiral disks	the opacity of a spiral disk due to dust absorption influences everymeasurement we make of it in the uv and optical. two separate techniquesdirectly measure the total absorption by dust in the disk: calibrated distantgalaxy counts and overlapping galaxy pairs. the main results from both so farare a semi-transparent disk with more opaque arms, and a relation betweensurface brightness and disk opacity. in the spitzer era, sed models of spiraldisks add a new perspective on the role of dust in spiral disks. combined withthe overall opacity from galaxy counts, they yield a typical optical depth ofthe dusty ism clouds: 0.4 that implies a size of $\sim$ 60 pc. work on galaxycounts is currently ongoing on the acs fields of m51, m101 and m81. occultinggalaxies offer the possibility of probing the history of disk opacity fromhigher redshift pairs. evolution in disk opacity could influence distancemeasurements (sn1a, tully-fisher relation). here, we present first results fromspectroscopically selected occulting pairs in the sdss. the redshift range forthis sample is limited, but does offer a first insight into disk opacityevolution as well as a reference for higher redshift measurements. spiral diskopacity has not undergone significant evolution since z=0.2. hst imaging wouldhelp disentangle the effects of spiral arms in these pairs. many moremixed-morphology types are being identified in sdss by the galaxyzoo project.the occulting galaxy technique can be pushed to a redshift of 1 using manypairs identified in the imaging campaigns with hst (deep2, gems, goods,cosmos).

1309.1444	morphological parameters of spitzer survey of stellar structure in  galaxies (s4g)	the morphology of galaxies can be quantified to some degree using a set ofscale-invariant parameters. concentration (c), asymmetry (a), smoothness (s),the gini index (g), relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the secondorder moment of the flux (m20), ellipticity (e), and the gini index of thesecond order moment (gm) have all been applied to morphologically classifygalaxies at various wavelengths. here we present a catalog of these parametersfor the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g), a volume-limitednear-infrared imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 micronchannels of the irac camera. our goal is to provide a reference catalog ofnear-infrared quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxyevolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology.  we explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies -those typically found onthe hubble tuning fork- lie in this parameter space and show that there is atight relation between concentration and m20 for normal galaxies. m20 can beused to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (e.g., to separatespirals from irregulars). several criteria using these parameters exist toselect systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to beundergoing a tidal interaction. we examine the applicability of these criteriato spitzer near-infrared imaging. we find that four relations, based on theparameters a&amp;s, g&amp;m20, gm, and c&amp;m20, respectively, select outliers in themorphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies.two criteria (gm &gt; 0.6, g &gt; -0.115 x m20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate toidentify possible mergers and the merger fraction in near-infrared surveys. wefind no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphologicalparameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on concentration andm20.

0801.4926	host galaxy extinction of snia: co-evolution of ism structure and  extinction law with star-formation	this paper presents a mechanism that may modify the extinction law for sniaobserved at higher redshift. starting from the observations that (1) snia occurpredominantly in spiral galaxies, (2) star-formation ejects ism out of theplane of spirals, (3) star-formation alters the extinction properties of thedust in the ism, and (4) there is substantially more star-formation at higherredshift, i propose that spiral galaxies have a dustier halo in the past thanthey do now. the ejected material's lower value of $r_v$ will lead to a loweraverage value ($\bar{r}_v$) for snia observed at higher redshift.  two relations in snia observations indicate evolution of the average $r_v$:the relation of observed $r_v$ with inclination of the host galaxy at lowredshift and the matching of the distribution of extinction values ($a_v$) forsnia in different redshift intervals. the inclination effect does point to ahalo with lower $r_v$ values. in contrast, the distributions of $a_v$ valuesmatch best for a $\bar{r}_v(z)$ evolution that mimics the relation of sniadimming with redshift attributed to the cosmological constant. however, even inthe worse case scenario, the evolution $\bar{r}_v$ can not fully explain thedimming of snia: host galaxy extinction law evolution is not a viablealternative to account for the dimming of snia.  future observations of snia --multi-color lightcurves and spectra-- willsolve separately for values of $a_v$ and $r_v$ for each snia . solving forevolution of $\bar{r}_v$ (and $a_v$) with redshift will be important for thecoming generation of cosmological snia measurements and has the bonus scienceof insight into the distribution of dust-rich ism in the host galaxies in thedistant past.

1312.0866	arrakis: atlas of resonance rings as known in the s4g	resonance rings are the consequence of secular evolution processes thatredistribute material and angular momentum in discs. we produced a catalogueand an atlas of the rings detected in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g) and to conduct a statistical study of the data in thecatalogue.  we traced the contours of rings previously identified by buta et al. (inpreparation) and fitted them with ellipses. we found the orientation of bars bystudying the galaxy ellipse fits from s4g's pipeline 4. we used the galaxyorientation data obtained by s4g's pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticitiesand orientations of rings and the bars.  arrakis contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the s4g. the frequency ofresonance rings in the s4g is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and innerfeatures, respectively. outer rings are mostly found in hubble stages -1&lt;=t&lt;=4.inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1&lt;=t&lt;=7. weconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel andperpendicular to the bar. we confirm a tendency for inner rings to be orientedparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of themhave random orientations with respect to the bar. these misaligned inner ringsare mostly found in late-type galaxies (t&gt;=4). this may be due to spiral modesdecoupled from the bar dominating the fourier amplitude spectrum at the radiusof the inner ring.  we find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. the fact that rings are onlymildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formeddue to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or thatthey are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ringformation.

1401.0837	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mid-infrared properties and empirical  relations from $wise$	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey furnishes a deep redshift catalogthat, when combined with the wide-field infrared explorer ($wise$), allows usto explore for the first time the mid-infrared properties of $&gt; 110, 000$galaxies over 120 deg$^2$ to $z\simeq 0.5$. in this paper we detail theprocedure for producing the matched gama-$wise$ catalog for the g12 and g15fields, in particular characterising and measuring resolved sources; thecomplete catalogs for all three gama equatorial fields will be made availablethrough the gama public releases. the wealth of multiwavelength photometry andoptical spectroscopy allows us to explore empirical relations between opticallydetermined stellar mass (derived from synthetic stellar population models) and3.4micron and 4.6micron wise measurements. similarly dust-correctedhalpha-derived star formation rates can be compared to 12micron and 22micronluminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples to$z&lt;0.5$. to illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12micronstar formation prescription to investigate the behavior of specific starformation within the gama-wise sample and underscore the ability of wise todetect star-forming systems at $z\sim0.5$. within galaxy groups (determined bya sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies witha neighbor within 100$\,h^{-1} $kpc have, on average, lower specific starformation rates than typical gama galaxies with the same stellar mass.

1404.2626	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): autoz spectral redshift measurements,  confidence and errors	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has obtained spectra of over230000 targets using the anglo-australian telescope. to homogenise the redshiftmeasurements and improve the reliability, a fully automatic redshift code wasdeveloped (autoz). the measurements were made using a cross-correlation methodfor both absorption-line and emission-line spectra. large deviations in thehigh-pass filtered spectra are partially clipped in order to be robust againstuncorrected artefacts and to reduce the weight given to single-line matches. asingle figure of merit (fom) was developed that puts all template matches ontoa similar confidence scale. the redshift confidence as a function of the fomwas fitted with a tanh function using a maximum likelihood method applied torepeat observations of targets. the method could be adapted to provide robustautomatic redshifts for other large galaxy redshift surveys. for the gamasurvey, there was a substantial improvement in the reliability of assignedredshifts and in the lowering of redshift uncertainties with a median velocityuncertainty of 33 km/s.

1408.1476	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy close-pairs, mergers, and the  future fate of stellar mass	we use a highly complete subset of the gama-ii redshift sample to fullydescribe the stellar mass dependence of close-pairs and mergers between 10^8msun and 10^12 msun. using the analytic form of this fit we investigate thetotal stellar mass accreting onto more massive galaxies across all mass ratios.depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, thefraction of mass merging onto more massive companions is 2.0%-5.6%. using thegama-ii data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close-pairfraction between redshift $z = 0.05-0.2$. however, we find a systematicallyhigher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to publishedresults over a similar redshift baseline. using a compendium of data and thefunction $\gamma_m =a(1+z)m$ to predict the major close-pair fraction, we findfitting parameters of $a = 0.021 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 1.53 \pm 0.08$, whichrepresents a higher low-redshift normalisation and shallower power-law slopethan recent literature values. we find that the relative importance of in-situstar-formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, withstar-formation dominating the addition of stellar material below mstar andmerger accretion events dominating beyond mstar. we find mergers have ameasurable impact on the whole extent of the gsmf, manifest as a deepening ofthe dip in the gsmf over the next gyr and an increase in mstar by as much as0.01-0.05 dex.

(2012) to separate the dominant light from old starsand the dust emission that can significantly contribute to the observed 3.6$\mum$ flux. we exclude from our ica analysis galaxies with low signal-to-noiseratio (s/n &lt; 10) and those with original [3.6]-[4.5] colors compatible with anold stellar population, indicative of little dust emission (mostly early hubbletypes, which can directly provide good mass maps). for the remaining 1251galaxies to which ica was successfully applied, we find that as much as 10-30%of the total light at 3.6$\mu m$ typically originates from dust, and locally itcan reach even higher values. this contamination fraction shows a correlationwith specific star formation rates, confirming that the dust emission that wedetect is related to star formation. additionally, we have used our largesample of mass estimates to calibrate a relationship of effective mass-to-lightratio ($m/l$) as a function of observed [3.6]-[4.5] color: $\log(m/l)=-0.339(\pm 0.057) \times ([3.6]-[4.5]) -0.336 (\pm 0.002)$. our final pipelineproducts have been made public through irsa, providing the astronomicalcommunity with an unprecedentedly large set of stellar mass maps ready to usefor scientific applications.

1411.0596	snia host galaxy properties and the dust extinction distribution	supernovae type ia display a complex relation with their host galaxies. animportant prior to the fit of the supernovae's lightcurve is the distributionof host galaxy extinction values that can be encountered. the sdss-sn projecthas published light curve fits using both mlcs2k2 and salt2. we use the formerfits extinction parameter ($a_v$) to map this distribution of extinctionvalues.  we explore the dependence of this distribution on four observables; theinclination of the host galaxy disk, radial position of the supernova, redshiftof the supernova and host, and the level of star-formation in the host galaxy.the distribution of $a_v$ values encountered by supernovae is typicallycharacterised by: $\rm n_0 ~ e^{-a_v/\tau}$, with $\tau$= 0.4 or 0.33.  we find that the inclination correction using an infinitely thin disk for thesnia is sufficient, resulting in similar exponential $a_v$ distributions forhigh- and low-inclination disks. the $a_v$ distribution also depends on theradial position in the disk, consistent with previous results on thetransparency of spiral disks. the distribution of $a_v$ values narrows withincreased star-formation, possibly due to the destruction or dispersion of thedusty ism by stellar winds prior to the ignition of the supernova.  in future supernova searches, certainly the inclination of the host galaxydisk, should be considered in the construction of the \av \ prior with$\tau=0.4/cos(i)$ as the most likely prior in each individual host galaxy'scase.

1503.04813	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) blended spectra catalog: strong  galaxy-galaxy lens and occulting galaxy pair candidates	we present the catalogue of blended galaxy spectra from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. these are cases where light from two galaxies aresignificantly detected in a single gama fibre. galaxy pairs identified fromtheir blended spectrum fall into two principal classes: they are either stronglenses, a passive galaxy lensing an emission-line galaxy; or occultinggalaxies, serendipitous overlaps of two galaxies, of any type. blended spectracan thus be used to reliably identify strong lenses for follow-up observations(high resolution imaging) and occulting pairs, especially those that are alate-type partly obscuring an early-type galaxy which are of interest for thestudy of dust content of spiral and irregular galaxies. the gama survey setupand its autoz automated redshift determination were used to identify candidateblended galaxy spectra from the cross-correlation peaks. we identify 280blended spectra with a minimum velocity separation of 600 km/s, of which 104are lens pair candidates, 71 emission-line-passive pairs, 78 are pairs ofemission-line galaxies and and 27 are pairs of galaxies with passive spectra.we have visually inspected the candidates in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and kilo degree survey (kids) images. many blended objects areellipticals with blue fuzz (ef in our classification). these latter "ef"classifications are candidates for possible strong lenses, massive ellipticalswith an emission-line galaxy in one or more lensed images. the gama lens andocculting galaxy candidate samples are similar in size to those identified inthe entire sdss. this blended spectrum sample stands as a testament of thepower of this highly complete, second-largest spectroscopic survey in existenceand offers the possibility to expand e.g., strong gravitational lens surveys.

1505.03949	the dependence of the $a_v$ prior for sn\,ia on host mass and disk  inclination	supernovae type ia (snia) are used as "standard candles" for cosmologicaldistance scales. to fit their light curve shape -- absolute luminosityrelation, one needs to assume an intrinsic color and a likelihood of hostgalaxy extinction or a convolution of these, a color distribution prior. thehost galaxy extinction prior is typically assumed to be an exponential drop-offfor the current supernova programs ($p(a_v) \propto e^{-a_v/\tau_0}$). weexplore the validity of this prior using the distribution of extinction valuesinferred when two galaxies accidentally overlap (an occulting galaxy pair). wecorrect the supernova luminosity distances from the sdss-iii supernova projects(sdss-sn) by matching the host galaxies to one of three templates fromocculting galaxy pairs based on the host galaxy mass and the $a_v$-bias -prior-scale ($\tau_0$) relation from jha et al. (2007).  we find that introducing an $a_v$ prior that depends on host mass results inlowered luminosity distances for the sdss-sn on average but it does not reducethe scatter in individual measurements. this points, in our view, to the needfor many more occulting galaxy templates to match to snia host galaxies to ruleout this possible source of scatter in the snia distance measurements. we matchocculting galaxy templates based on both mass and projected radius and we findthat one should match by stellar mass first with radius as a secondaryconsideration. we discuss the caveats of the current approach and our aim is toconvince the reader that a library of occulting galaxy pairs observed with hstwill provide sufficient priors to improve (optical) snia measurements to thenext required accuracy in cosmology.

1511.02245	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): growing up in a bad neighbourhood - how  do low-mass galaxies become passive?	both theoretical predictions and observations of the very nearby universesuggest that low-mass galaxies (log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;9.5) are likelyto remain star-forming unless they are affected by their local environment. totest this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of bothpassive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. we find that passive fractions are higher inboth interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,and that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. we also findthat essentially all passive log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;8.5 galaxies arefound in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with amore massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. we find that theeffects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in formingpassive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that thisis potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient timefor the galaxy to become passive via starvation. we then present a simplisticmodel to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, itis consistent with our observed results.

astro-ph;0411662	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks iii: automating the "synthetic field  method"	the dust extinction in spiral disks can be estimated from the counts ofbackground field galaxies, provided the deleterious effects of confusionintroduced by structure in the image of the foreground spiral disk can becalibrated. gonzalez et al. (1998) developed a method for this calibration, the``synthetic field method'' (sfm), and applied this concept to a hst/wfpc2 imageof ngc4536. the sfm estimates the total extinction through the disk without thenecessity of assumptions about the distribution of absorbers or the disk light.the poor statistics, however, result in a large error in individualmeasurements. we report on improvements to and automation of the syntheticfield method which render it suitable for application to large archivaldatasets. to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this new method, theresults on ngc 1365, a sbb, and ngc 4536, a sabbc, are presented. theextinction estimate for ngc1365 is a_i = 0.6 (+0.6/-0.7) at 0.45 r_25 and forngc4536 it is a_i = 1.6 (+1.0/-1.3) at 0.75 r_25. the results for ngc4536 arecompared with those of gonzalez et al. (1998). the automation is found to limitthe maximum depth to which field galaxies can be found. taking this intoaccount, our results agree with those of gonzalez et al. (1998). we concludethat this method can only give an inaccurate measure of extinction for a fieldcovering a small solid angle. an improved measurement of disk extinction can bedone by averaging the results over a series of hst fields, thereby improvingthe statistics. this can be achieved with the automated method, trading somecompleteness limit for speed. the results from this set of fields are reportedin a companion paper holwerda et al. (2005b).

astro-ph;0411663	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks iv: radial extinction profiles from  counts of distant galaxies seen through foreground disks	dust extinction can be determined from the number of distant field galaxiesseen through a spiral disk. to calibrate this number for the crowding andconfusion introduced by the foreground image, gonzalez et al.(1998) andholwerda et al. (2005) developed the ``synthetic field method'' (sfm), whichanalyses synthetic fields constructed by adding various deep exposures ofunobstructed background fields to the candidate foreground galaxy field.  the advantage of the sfm is that it gives the average opacity for area ofgalaxy disk without assumptions about either the distribution of absorbers orof the disk starlight. however it is limited by low statistics of the survivingfield galaxies, hence the need to combine a larger sample of fields. this paperpresents the first results for a sample of 32 deep hst/wfpc2 archival fields of29 spirals.  the radial profiles of average dust extinction in spiral galaxies based oncalibrated counts of distant field galaxies is presented here, both forindividual galaxies as well as for composites from our sample. the effects ofinclination, spiral arms and hubble type on the radial extinction profile arediscussed.

astro-ph;0508075	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks v: dust opacity, hi distributions and  sub-mm emission	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks, from counts of distant galaxies, iscompared to hi column densities. the opacity measurements are calibrated usingthe ``synthetic field method'' from gonzalez et al (1998) and holwerda et al.(2005a).  when compared for individual disks, the hi column density and dust opacity donot seem to be correlated as hi and opacity follow different radial profiles.  to improve statistics, an average radial opacity profile is compared to anaverage hi profile. compared to dust-to-hi estimates from the literature, moreextinction is found in this profile. this difference may be accounted for by anunderestimate of the dust in earlier measurements due to their dependence ondust temperature. since the sfm is insensitive to the dust temperature, theratio between the sfm opacity and hi could very well be indicative of the trueratio.  earlier claims for a radially extended cold dust disk were based on sub-mmobservations. a comparison between sub-mm observations and counts of distantgalaxies is therefore desirable. we present the best current example of such acomparison, m51, for which the measurements seem to agree. however, thisremains an area where improved counts of distant galaxies, sub-mm observationsand our understanding of dust emissivity are needed.

astro-ph;0508077	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks vii: the accuracy of galaxy counts as  an extinction probe	the ``synthetic field method'' (sfm) was introduced by gonzalez et al. (1998)to calibrate numbers of distant galaxies as a probe of extinction in aforeground spiral disk. gonzalez et al. (2003) studied the effect of theforeground disk on these numbers using simulations of current and futureinstruments for fields in the lmc, m31 and ngc 4536, a galaxy in virgo. theyconcluded that: (1) the brighter centers of disks were unsuitable, (2) thegranularity of the disk at a fixed surface brightness is the limiting factor inthe detection of distant galaxies, and (3) the optimum distance formeasurements would be that of the virgo cluster for the current instruments onboard hst. at this distance the foreground disk is smoothed with distance,improving detection of distant background galaxies. holwerda et al. (2005a)automated the sfm and holwerda et al. (2005b) applied it to a large set ofwfpc2 fields. in this paper, the quality of the extinction measurement in thesefields is compared to their distance, granularity, surface brightness andstructure. the average surface brightness of the of a field is shown todirectly influence the accuracy of the sfm. this restricts meaningfulmeasurements to the disks of spiral galaxies. large structures such as spiralarms have a similar effect. the granularity or small scale structure in a fieldinfluences the detection of distant galaxies, limiting the sfm measurements innearby disks. from the trends in the accuracy and maximum practicalfield-of-view considerations, the minimum and maximum distance for sfmapplication, approximately 5 and 35 mpc respectively. using the same instrumentand detection method, the relations with sfm parameters and fieldcharacteristics can be used to forgo the synthetic fields altogether.

astro-ph;0508261	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks: dust opacity from calibrated counts  of distant galaxies	the opacity of foreground spiral disks can be probed from the number ofdistant galaxies seen through them. to calibrate this number for effects otherthan the dust extinction, gonzalez et al (1998) developed the "synthetic fieldmethod". a synthetic field is an extincted hubble deep field added to thescience field. the relation between the dimming and the number of retrievedsynthetic galaxies calibrates the number found in the science field. here ipresent results from counts in 32 hst/wfpc2 fields. the relation betweenopacity and radius, arm and disk, surface brightness and hi are presented. theopacity is found to be caused by a clumpy distribution of clouds in the disk.the brighter parts of the disk -the center and arms- are also the more opaqueones. the dust distribution in spiral disks is found to be more extended thanthe stellar disk. a comparison between hi column densities and opacity showslittle relation between the two.

astro-ph;0509438	the opacity of spiral galaxy disks vi: extinction, stellar light and  color	in this paper we explore the relation between dust extinction and stellarlight distribution in disks of spiral galaxies. extinction influences ourdynamical and photometric perception of disks, since it can distort ourmeasurement of the contribution of the stellar component. to characterize thetotal extinction by a foreground disk, gonzalez et al. (1998) proposed the``synthetic field method'' (sfm), which uses the calibrated number of distantgalaxies seen through the foreground disk as a direct indication of extinction.the method is described in gonzalez et al. (1998) and holwerda et al. (2005a).to obtain good statistics, the method was applied to a set of hst/wfpc2 fieldsholwerda et al. (2005b) and radial extinction profiles were derived, based onthese counts. in the present paper, we explore the relation of opacity withsurface brightness or color from 2mass images, as well as the relation betweenthe scalelengths for extinction and light in the i band. we find that there isindeed a relation between the opacity (a_i) and the surface brightness,particularly at the higher surface brightnesses. no strong relation betweennear infrared (h-j, h-k) color and opacity is found. the scalelengths of theextinction are uncertain for individual galaxies but seem to indicate that thedust distribution is much more extended than the stellar light. the resultsfrom the distant galaxy counts are also compared to the reddening derived fromthe cepheids light-curves freedman et al. (2001). the extinction values areconsistent, provided the selection effect against cepheids with higher valuesof a_i is taken into account. the implications from these relations for diskphotometry, m/l conversion and galaxy dynamical modeling are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0603395	dust in spiral disks: opacity profiles from fir emission and counts of  distant galaxies	dust emission in the far-infrared (fir) characterizes the temperature andquantity of interstellar dust in a spiral disk. the three spitzer/mips bandsare well suited to measuring the gradient in temperature and the total opticaldepth in the disk of a spiral galaxy. another way to estimate the quantity ofdust in a spiral disk is the "synthetic field method" (sfm, gonzalez et al.1998), which uses the number of distant field galaxies seen through the disk ofthe nearby spiral. the optical depth estimated from this method can be comparedto the values derived from the fir emission. since the two techniques depend ondifferent assumptions regarding the dust geometry and emissivity, thiscomparison between the optical depth profiles can potentially shed light on thestructure and quantity of the ism in spiral disks, especially any coldercomponents. the dust responsible for the opacity from distant galaxy countsappears to be predominantly cold (t &lt; 20 k.). the differences between theradial absorption profiles can be explained by spiral arms in the sfmmeasurements. taken over the same aperture, galaxy counts show higherextinction values than the fir derived ones. the implications for dust geometrycan hopefully be explored with a more rigorous estimate of dust mass from thefir fluxes.

0810.2646	an extended dust disk in a spiral galaxy; an occulting galaxy pair in  angst	we present an analysis of an occulting galaxy pair, serendipitouslydiscovered in acs nearby galaxy survey treasury (angst) observations of ngc 253taken with hubble space telescope's advanced camera for survey in f475w, f606w$and f814w (sdss-g, broad v and i). the foreground disk system (at z &lt; 0.06)shows a dusty disk much more extended than the starlight, with spiral lanesseen in extinction out to 1.5 r\_25, approximately six half-light radii. thispair is the first where extinction can be mapped reliably out to this distancefrom the center. the spiral arms of the extended dust disk show typicalextinction values of a\_f475w ~ 0.25, a\_f606w ~ 0.25, and a\_f814w ~ 0.15. theextinction law inferred from these measures is similar to the local milky wayone, and we show that the smoothing effects of sampling at limited spatialresolution (&lt;57 pc, in these data) flattens the observed function throughmixing of regions with different extinction. this galaxy illustrates thediversity of dust distributions in spirals, and the limitations of adopting asingle dust model for optically similar galaxies. the ideal geometry of thispair of overlapping galaxies and the high sampling of hst data make thisdataset ideal to analyze this pair with three separate approaches tooverlapping galaxies: (a) a combined fit, rotating copies of both galaxies, (b)a simple flip of the background image and (c) an estimate of the originalfluxes for the individual galaxies based on reconstructions of their properisophotes. we conclude that in the case of high quality data such as these,isophotal models are to be preferred.
