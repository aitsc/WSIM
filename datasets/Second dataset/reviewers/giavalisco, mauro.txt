0812.5111	biases and uncertainties in physical parameter estimates of lyman break  galaxies from broad-band photometry	we investigate the biases and uncertainties in estimates of physicalparameters of high-redshift lyman break galaxies (lbgs), such as stellar mass,mean stellar population age, and star formation rate (sfr), obtained frombroad-band photometry. by combining lcdm hierarchical structure formationtheory, semi-analytic treatments of baryonic physics, and stellar populationsynthesis models, we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select lbgsat redshifts z ~ 3.4, 4.0, and 5.0. the broad-band spectral energydistributions (seds) of these model lbgs are then analysed by fitting galaxytemplate seds derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothlydeclining sfrs. we compare the statistical properties of lbgs' physicalparameters -- such as stellar mass, sfr, and stellar population age -- asderived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from thesemi-analytic model. we find some trends in these distributions: first, whenthe redshift is known, sed-fitting methods reproduce the input distributions oflbgs' stellar masses relatively well, with a minor tendency to underestimatethe masses overall, but with substantial scatter. second, there are largesystematic biases in the distributions of best-fit sfrs and mean ages, in thesense that single-component sed-fitting methods underestimate sfrs andoverestimate ages. we attribute these trends to the different star formationhistories predicted by the semi-analytic models and assumed in the galaxytemplates used in sed-fitting procedure, and to the fact that light from thecurrent generation of star-formation can hide older generations of stars. thesebiases, which arise from the sed-fitting procedure, can significantly affectinferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry.

0902.3245	expanding the search for galaxies at z ~7-10 with new nicmos parallel  fields	we have carried out a search for galaxies at z ~ 7-10 in ~14.4 sq. arcmin ofnew nicmos parallel imaging taken in the great observatories origins deepsurvey (goods, 5.9 sq. arcmin), the cosmic origins survey (cosmos, 7.2 sq.arcmin), and ssa22 (1.3 sq. arcmin). these images reach 5 sigma sensitivitiesof j110 = 26.0-27.5 (ab), and combined they increase the amount of deepnear-infrared data by more than 60% in fields where the investment in deepoptical data has already been made. we find no z&gt;7 candidates in our surveyarea, consistent with the bouwens et al. (2008) measurements at z~7 and 9 (over23 sq. arcmin), which predict 0.7 galaxies at z~7 and &lt;0.03 galaxies at z~9. weestimate that 10-20% of z&gt;7 galaxies are missed by this survey, due toincompleteness from foreground contamination by faint sources. for the case ofluminosity evolution, assuming a schecter parameterization with a typical phi*= 10^-3 mpc^-3, we find m* &gt; -20.0 for z~7 and m* &gt; -20.7 for z~9 (68%confidence). this suggests that the downward luminosity evolution of lbgscontinues to z~7, although our result is marginally consistent with the z~6 lfof bouwens et al.(2006, 2007). in addition we present newly-acquired deepmmt/megacam imaging of the z~9 candidate jd2325+1433, first presented in henryet al.

0706.4093	new constraints on the lyman continuum escape fraction at z~1.3	we examine deep far-ultraviolet (1600 angstrom) imaging of the hubble deepfield-north (hdfn) and the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) to search for leakinglyman continuum radiation from starburst galaxies at z~1.3. there are 21(primarily sub-l*) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.1&lt;z&lt;1.5 andnone are detected in the far-uv. we fit stellar population templates to thegalaxies' optical/near-infrared seds to determine the starburst age and levelof dust attenuation, giving an accurate estimate of the intrinsic lymancontinuum ratio, f_1500/f_700, and allowing a conversion from f_700 limits torelative escape fractions. we show that previous high-redshift studies may haveunderestimated the amplitude of the lyman break, and thus the relative escapefraction, by a factor of ~2. once the starburst age and intergalactic hiabsorption are accounted for, 18 galaxies in our sample have limits to therelative escape fraction, f_esc,rel &lt; 1.0 with some limits as low as f_esc,rel&lt; 0.10 and a stacked limit of f_esc,rel &lt; 0.08. this demonstrates, for thefirst time, that most sub-l* galaxies at high redshift do not have large escapefractions. when combined with a similar study of more luminous galaxies at thesame redshift we show that, if all star-forming galaxies at z~1 have similarrelative escape fractions, the value must be less than 0.14 (3 sigma). we alsoshow that less than 20% (3 sigma) of star-forming galaxies at z~1 have relativeescape fractions near unity. these limits contrast with the large escapefractions found at z~3 and suggest that the average escape fraction hasdecreased between z~3 and z~1.

0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

1001.3412	a deep hst search for escaping lyman continuum flux at z~1.3: evidence  for an evolving ionizing emissivity	we have obtained deep hubble space telescope far-uv images of 15 starburstgalaxies at z~1.3 in the goods fields to search for escaping lyman continuumphotons. these are the deepest far-uv images m_{ab}=28.7, 3\sigma, 1" diameter)over this large an area (4.83 arcmin^2) and provide the best escape fractionconstraints for any galaxy at any redshift. we do not detect any individualgalaxies, with 3\sigma limits to the lyman continuum (~700 \aa) flux 50--149times fainter (in f_nu) than the rest-frame uv (1500 \aa) continuum fluxes.correcting for the mean igm attenuation (factor ~2), as well as an intrinsicstellar lyman break (~3), these limits translate to relative escape fractionlimits of f_{esc,rel}&lt;[0.03,0.21]. the stacked limit isf_{esc,rel}(3\sigma)&lt;0.02. we use a monte carlo simulation to properly accountfor the expected distribution of igm opacities. when including constraints fromprevious surveys at z~1.3 we find that, at the 95% confidence level, no morethan 8% of star--forming galaxies at z~1.3 can have relative escape fractionsgreater than 0.50. alternatively, if the majority of galaxies have low, butnon-zero, escaping lyman continuum, the escape fraction can not be more than0.04. both the stacked limits, and the limits from the monte carlo simulationsuggest that the average ionizing emissivity (relative to non-ionizing uvemissivity) at z~1.3 is significantly lower than has been observed in lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at z~3. if the ionizing emissivity of star-forminggalaxies is in fact increasing with redshift, it would help to explain the highphotoionization rates seen in the igm at z&gt;4 and reionization of theintergalactic medium at z&gt;6.

1009.2503	origins of the extragalactic background at 1mm from a combined analysis  of the aztec and mambo data in goods-n	we present a study of the cosmic infrared background, which is a measure ofthe dust obscured activity in all galaxies in the universe. we venture toisolate the galaxies responsible for the background at 1mm; with spectroscopicand photometric redshifts we constrain the redshift distribution of thesegalaxies. we create a deep 1.16mm map (sigma ~ 0.5mjy) by combining the aztec1.1mm and mambo 1.2mm datasets in goods-n. this combined map contains 41 securedetections, 13 of which are new. by averaging the 1.16mm flux densities ofindividually undetected galaxies with 24um flux densities &gt; 25ujy, we resolve31--45 per cent of the 1.16mm background. repeating our analysis on the scuba850um map, we resolve a higher percentage (40--64 per cent) of the 850umbackground. a majority of the background resolved (attributed to individualgalaxies) at both wavelengths comes from galaxies at z &gt; 1.3. if the ratio ofthe resolved submillimeter to millimeter background is applied to a reasonablescenario for the origins of the unresolved submillimeter background, 60--88 percent of the total 1.16mm background comes from galaxies at z &gt; 1.3.

1009.3504	a detailed study of photometric redshifts for goods-south galaxies	we use the deepest and the most comprehensive photometric data currentlyavailable for goods-south galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. thephotometry includes vlt/vimos (u-band), hst/acs (f435w, f606w, f775w, andf850lp bands), vlt/isaac (j-, h-, and ks-bands), and four spitzer/irac channels(3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron). the catalog is selected in the z-band (f850lp)and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed tfitalgorithm, which performs psf matched photometry uniformly across differentinstruments and filters, despite large variations in psfs and pixel scales.photometric redshifts are derived using the goodz code, which is based on thetemplate fitting method using priors. the code also implements "training" ofthe template sed set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order tominimize systematic differences between the templates and the seds of theobserved galaxies. our final catalog covers an area of 153 sq. arcmin andincludes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. the scatterbetween our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma=0.040with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing tosigma=0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit m(z)&lt;24.5. this isconsistent with the best results previously published for goods-s galaxies,however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and providesphotometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits andhigher redshifts than earlier works. furthermore, we show that the photometricredshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent withthose expected based on the lyman break technique.

1010.1966	improving the estimation of star formation rates and stellar population  ages of high-redshift galaxies from broadband photometry	we explore methods to improve the estimates of star formation rates and meanstellar population ages from broadband photometry of high redshift star-forminggalaxies. we use synthetic spectral templates with a variety of simpleparametric star formation histories to fit broadband spectral energydistributions. these parametric models are used to infer ages, star formationrates and stellar masses for a mock data set drawn from a hierarchicalsemi-analytic model of galaxy evolution. traditional parametric modelsgenerally assume an exponentially declining rate of star-formation after aninitial instantaneous rise. our results show that star formation histories witha much more gradual rise in the star formation rate are likely to be bettertemplates, and are likely to give better overall estimates of the agedistribution and star formation rate distribution of lyman break galaxies. forb- and v-dropouts, we find the best simple parametric model to be one where thestar formation rate increases linearly with time. the exponentially-decliningmodel overpredicts the age by 100 % and 120 % for b- and v-dropouts, onaverage, while for a linearly-increasing model, the age is overpredicted by 9 %and 16 %, respectively. similarly, the exponential model underpredictsstar-formation rates by 56 % and 60 %, while the linearly-increasing modelunderpredicts by 15 % 22 %, respectively. for u-dropouts, the models where thestar-formation rate has a peak (near z ~ 3) provide the best match for age --overprediction is reduced from 110 % to 26 % -- and star-formation rate --underprediction is reduced from 58 % to 22 %. we classify different types ofstar-formation histories in the semi-analytic models and show how the biasesbehave for the different classes. we also provide two-band calibration formulaefor stellar mass and star formation rate estimations.

1103.3703	on the clustering of sub-millimeter galaxies	we measure the angular two-point correlation function of sub-millimetergalaxies (smgs) from 1.1-millimeter imaging of the cosmos field with the azteccamera and aste 10-meter telescope. these data yields one of the largestcontiguous samples of smgs to date, covering an area of 0.72 degrees^2 down toa 1.26 mjy/beam (1-sigma) limit, including 189 (328) sources with s/n greaterthan 3.5 (3). we can only set upper limits to the correlation length r_0,modeling the correlation function as a power-law with pre-assigned slope.assuming existing redshift distributions, we derive 68.3% confidence levelupper limits of r_0 &lt; 6-8 h^-1 mpc at 3.7 mjy, and r_0 &lt; 11-12 h^-1 mpc at 4.2mjy. although consistent with most previous estimates, these upper limits implythat the real r_0 is likely smaller. this casts doubts on the robustness ofclaims that smgs are characterized by significantly stronger spatialclustering, (and thus larger mass), than differently selected galaxies athigh-redshift. using monte carlo simulations we show that even stronglyclustered distributions of galaxies can appear unclustered when sampled withlimited sensitivity and coarse angular resolution common to currentsub-millimeter surveys. the simulations, however, also show that unclustereddistributions can appear strongly clustered under these circumstances. from thesimulations, we predict that at our survey depth, a mapped area of twodegrees^2 is needed to reconstruct the correlation function, assuming smallerbeam sizes of future surveys (e.g. the large millimeter telescope's 6" beamsize). at present, robust measures of the clustering strength of bright smgsappear to be below the reach of most observations.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.3800	multi-wavelength view of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forming  galaxies at z~2	this paper studies the properties of kiloparsec-scale clumps in star-forminggalaxies at z~2 through multi-wavelength broad band photometry. a sample of 40clumps is identified through auto-detection and visual inspection from 10galaxies with 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 in the hubble ultra deep field, where deep andhigh-resolution hst/wfc3 and acs images enable us to resolve structures of z~2galaxies down to kpc scale in the rest-frame uv and optical bands as well as todetect clumps toward the faint end. the physical properties of clumps aremeasured through fitting spatially resolved seven-band (bvizyjh) spectralenergy distribution to models. on average, the clumps are blue and have similarmedian rest-frame uv--optical color as the diffuse components of their hostgalaxies, but the clumps have large scatter in their colors. although the starformation rate (sfr)--stellar mass relation of galaxies is dominated by thediffuse components, clumps emerge as regions with enhanced specific sfrs,contributing individually ~10% and together ~50% of the sfr of the hostgalaxies. however, the contributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv/opticalluminosity and stellar mass are smaller, typically a few percent individuallyand ~20% together. on average, clumps are younger by 0.2 dex and denser by afactor of 8 than diffuse components. clump properties have obvious radialvariations in the sense that central clumps are redder, older, more extincted,denser, and less active on forming stars than outskirts clumps. our results arebroadly consistent with a widely held view that clumps are formed throughgravitational instability in gas-rich turbulent disks and would eventuallymigrate toward galactic centers and coalesce into bulges. roughly 40% of thegalaxies in our sample contain a massive clump that could be identified as aproto-bulge, which seems qualitatively consistent with such a bulge-formationscenario.

1110.3801	rest-frame uv--optically selected galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5: searching for  dusty star-forming and passively-evolving galaxies	a new set of color selection criteria (vjl) analogous with the bzk method isdesigned to select both star-forming galaxies (sfgs) and passively-evolvinggalaxies (pegs) at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 by using rest-frame uv--optical (v-j vs. j-l)colors. the criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar populationsynthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluatetheir efficiency and contamination. we apply the well-tested vjl criteria tothe hst/wfc3 early release science field and study the physical properties ofselected galaxies. the redshift distribution of selected sfgs peaks at z~2.7,slightly lower than that of lyman break galaxies at z~3. comparing the observedmid-infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellaremission, we find that our vjl method is effective at selecting massive dustysfgs that are missed by the lyman break technique. about half of the starformation in massive (m_{star}&gt;10^{10}m_{sun}) galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5 iscontributed by dusty (extinction e(b-v)&gt;0.4) sfgs, which however, only accountfor ~20% of the number density of massive sfgs. we also use the mid-infraredfluxes to clean our peg sample, and find that galaxy size can be used as asecondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty sfgs.the redshift distribution of the cleaned peg sample peaks at z~2.5. we find 6peg candidates at z&gt;3 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them fromdusty contamination. we conclude that at least part of our candidates are realpegs at z~3, implying that this type of galaxies began to form their stars atz&gt;5. we measure the integrated stellar mass density of pegs at z~2.5 and setconstraints on it at z&gt;3. we find that the integrated stellar mass densitygrows by at least about factor of 10 in 1 gyr at 3&lt;z&lt;5 and by another factor of10 in next 3.5 gyr (1&lt;z&lt;3).

1111.1233	how do star-forming galaxies at z&gt;3 assemble their masses?	we investigate how star-forming galaxies typically assemble their masses athigh redshift. using the deep multi-wavelength coverage of the goods dataset,we measure stellar mass of a large sample of star-forming galaxies at z~4 and5, and make a robust determination of stellar mass function (smf). we report abroad correlation between stellar mass and uv luminosity, such that moreuv-luminous galaxies are, on average, more massive. however, the correlationhas a substantial intrinsic scatter evidenced by a non-negligible number ofuv-faint but massive galaxies. furthermore, the low-mass end of the smf doesnot rise as steeply as the uv luminosity function (alpha_uvlf} -(1.7-1.8),alpha_smf -(1.3-1.4)) of the same galaxies. in a smooth formation scenariowhere star formation (sf) is sustained at the observed rates for a long time,these galaxies would have accumulated more mass (by a factor of ~3) thanobserved and therefore the smf would mirror more closely that of the uvlf. therelatively shallow slope of the smf is due to the fact that many of theuv-selected galaxies are not massive enough, and therefore are too faint intheir rest-frame optical bands, to be detected in the current observations. ourresults favor a episodic formation history in which sf in low-mass galaxiesvary significantly over time, a scenario favored by galaxy clustering. ourfindings for the uv-faint galaxies are in contrast with those found for moreuv-luminous galaxies, which exhibit tighter sfr-m_star correlations. thediscrepancy may suggest that galaxies at different luminosities may havedifferent evolutionary paths.

1112.6406	luminous and high stellar mass candidate galaxies at z ~ 8 discovered in  candels	one key goal of the hubble space telescope cosmic assembly near-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey is to track galaxy evolution back to z ~ 8. itstwo-tiered "wide and deep" strategy bridges significant gaps in existingnear-infrared surveys. here we report on z ~ 8 galaxy candidates selected asf105w-band dropouts in one of its deep fields, which covers 50.1 square arcminto 4 ks depth in each of three near-infrared bands in the great observatoriesorigins deep survey southern field. two of our candidates have j&lt;26.2 mag, andare &gt; 1 mag brighter than any previously known f105w-dropouts. we deriveconstraints on the bright-end of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functionof galaxies at z ~ 8, and show that the number density of such very brightobjects is higher than expected from the previous schechter luminosity functionestimates at this redshift. another two candidates are securely detected inspitzer infrared array camera images, which are the first such individualdetections at z ~ 8. their derived stellar masses are on the order of a few x10^9 m_sun, from which we obtain the first measurement of the high-mass end ofthe galaxy stellar mass function at z ~ 8. the high number density of veryluminous and very massive galaxies at z ~ 8, if real, could imply a largestellar-to-halo mass ratio and an efficient conversion of baryons to stars atsuch an early time.

1201.5642	on the detection of ionizing radiation arising from star-forming  galaxies at redshift z ~ 3-4 : looking for analogs of "stellar reionizers"	we use the spatially-resolved, multi-band photometry in the goods south fieldacquired by the candels project to constrain the nature of candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters at redshift z~3.7 identified using ultra-deep imagingbelow the lyman limit (1-sigma limit of ~30 ab in a 2" diameter aperture). in18 candidates, out of a sample of 19 with flux detected at &gt;3-sigma level, thelight centroid of the candidate lyc emission is offset from that of the lbg byup to 1.5". we fit the sed of the lyc candidates to spectral populationsynthesis models to measure photometric redshifts and the stellar populationparameters. we also discuss the differences in the uv colors between the lbgand the lyc candidates, and how to estimate the escape fraction of ionizingradiation (f_esc) in cases, like in most of our galaxies, where the lycemission is spatially offset from the host galaxy. in all but one case weconclude that the candidate lyc emission is most likely due to lower redshiftinterlopers. based on these findings, we argue that the majority of similarmeasurements reported in the literature need further investigation before itcan be firmly concluded that lyc emission is detected. our only surviving lyccandidate is a lbg at z=3.795, which shows the bluest (b-v) color among lbgs atsimilar redshift, a stellar mass of m~2 x 10^9 msun, weak interstellarabsorption lines and a flat uv spectral slope with no lya in emission. weestimate its f_esc to be in the range 25%-100%, depending on the dust andintergalactic attenuation.

1203.2611	smooth(er) stellar mass maps in candels: constraints on the longevity of  clumps in high-redshift star-forming galaxies	we perform a detailed analysis of the resolved colors and stellar populationsof a complete sample of 323 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, and 326star-forming galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 in the ers and candels-deep region ofgoods-south. galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10^10 msun and havespecific star formation rates above 1/t_h. we model the 7-band optical acs +near-ir wfc3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels,accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraintsavailable over a longer wavelength range. we analyze variations in rest-framecolor, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function ofgalactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measurestructural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. we find evidence forredder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nucleiof galaxies. big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are lessprominent or even invisible on the inferred stellar mass distributions.off-center clumps contribute up to ~20% to the integrated sfr, but only 7% orless to the integrated mass of all massive star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 and z~ 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function ofwavelength used to select the clumps. the stellar mass profiles tend to havesmaller sizes and m20 coefficients, and higher concentration and ginicoefficients than the light distribution. our results are consistent with aninside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100 - 200 myr) episodic localenhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk.alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clumpmigration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbitaltimescale.

1206.0735	candels: the contribution of the observed galaxy population to cosmic  reionization	we present measurements of the specific ultraviolet luminosity density from asample of 483 galaxies at 6&lt;z&lt;8. these galaxies were selected from new deepnear-infrared hst imaging from the candels, hudf09 and ers programs. incontrast to the majority of previous analyses, which assume that thedistribution of galaxy ultraviolet (uv) luminosities follows a schechterdistribution, and that the distribution continues to luminosities far below ourobservable limit, we investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxieswhich we can observe, free from these assumptions. we find that the observablepopulation of galaxies can sustain a fully reionized igm at z=6, if the averageionizing photon escape fraction (f_esc) is ~30%. a number of previous studieshave measured uv luminosity densities at these redshifts that vary by 5x, withmany concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by z=6 unless alarge population of galaxies fainter than the detection limit were invoked, orextremely high values of f_esc were present. the observed uv luminosity densityfrom our observed galaxy samples at z=7-8 is not sufficient to maintain a fullyreionized igm unless f_esc&gt;50%. combining our observations with constraints onthe emission rate of ionizing photons from ly-alpha forest observations at z=6,we can constrain f_esc&lt;34% (2-sigma) if the observed galaxies are the onlycontributors to reionization, or &lt;13% (2-sigma) if the luminosity functionextends to m_uv = -13. these escape fractions are sufficient to completereionization by z=6. these constraints imply that the volume ionized fractionof the igm becomes less than unity at z&gt;7, consistent with a number ofcomplementary reionization probes. if faint galaxies dominate reionization,future jwst observations will probe deep enough to see them, providing anindirect constraint on the ionizing photon escape fraction [abridged].

1206.5000	candels: the progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2	we combine high-resolution hst/wfc3 images with multi-wavelength photometryto track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (log(m*) &gt; 10)galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4 - 3 in two fields of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels). we detect compact,star-forming galaxies (csfgs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and starformation rates qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent,massive galaxies (cqgs) at z = 1.5 - 3. at z &gt; 2 most csfgs have specificstar-formation rates (ssfr = 10^-9 yr^-1) half that of typical, massive sfgs atthe same epoch, and host x-ray luminous agn 30 times (~30%) more frequently.these properties suggest that csfgs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergersor disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an agn, which,in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10^8 yr). thecsfgs are continuously being formed at z = 2 - 3 and fade to cqgs by z = 1.5.after this epoch, csfgs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cqgs.meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cqgs continue to enlarge to match local qgsin size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd(larger) sfgs as later arrivals to the red sequence. in summary, we propose twoevolutionary scenarios of qg formation: an early (z &gt; 2), fast-formation pathof rapidly-quenched csfgs that evolve into cqgs that later enlarge within thequiescent phase, and a slow, late-arrival (z &lt; 2) path for sfgs to form qgswithout passing through a compact state.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1310.3819	the progenitors of the compact early-type galaxies at high-redshift	we use goods and candels images to identify progenitors of massive (log m &gt;10 msun) compact "early-type" galaxies (etgs) at z~1.6. since merging andaccretion increase the size of the stellar component of galaxies, if theprogenitors are among known star-forming galaxies, these must be compactthemselves. we select candidate progenitors among compact lyman-break galaxiesat z~3 based on their mass, sfr and central stellar density and find that theseaccount for a large fraction of, and possibly all, compact etgs at z~1.6. wefind that the average far-uv sed of the candidates is redder than that of thenon-candidates, but the optical and mid-ir sed are the same, implying that theredder uv of the candidates is inconsistent with larger dust obscuration, andconsistent with more evolved (aging) star-formation. this is in line with otherevidence that compactness is a sensitive predictor of passivity amonghigh-redshift massive galaxies. we also find that the light distribution ofboth the compact etgs and their candidate progenitors does not show anyextended "halos" surrounding the compact "core", both in individual images andin stacks. we argue that this is generally inconsistent with the morphology ofmerger remnants, even if gas-rich, as predicted by n-body simulations. thissuggests that the compact etgs formed via highly dissipative, mostly gaseousaccretion of units whose stellar components are very small and undetected inthe hst images, with their stellar mass assembling in-situ, and that they havenot experienced any major merging until the epoch of observations at z~1.6.

1405.4869	rapid decline of lyman-alpha emission toward the reionization era	the observed deficit of strongly lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;6.5 isattributed to either increasing neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium(igm) and/or to the evolving galaxy properties. to investigate this, we haveperformed very deep near-ir spectroscopy of z&gt;7 galaxies using mosfire on thekeck-i telescope. we measure the lyman-alpha fraction at z~8 (combinedphotometric redshift peak at z=7.7) using two methods. first, we derivednly{\alpha}/ntot directly using extensive simulations to correct forincompleteness. second, we used a bayesian formalism (introduced by treu et al.2012) that compares the z&gt;7 galaxy spectra to models of the lyman-alphaequivalent width (wly{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. we explored two simpleevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where lyman-alpha is attenuated in allgalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolutionor a slowly increasing igm opacity), and patchy evolution where lyman-alpha isblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the igm being opaque alongonly some fraction of sightlines). the bayesian formalism places strongerconstraints compared with the direct method. combining our data with that inthe literature we find that at z~8 the lyman-alpha fraction has dropped by afactor &gt;3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy scenarioscompared to the z~6 values. furthermore, we find a tentative evidence that thedata favor the patchy scenario over smooth (with "positive" bayesian evidence),extending trends observed at z~7 to higher redshift. if this decrease is aresult of reionization as predicted by theory, then our data imply the volumeaveraged neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm to be &gt;0.3 suggesting that thereionization of the universe is in progress at z~8.

1407.0149	probing outflows in z= 1~2 galaxies through feii/feii* multiplets	we report on a study of the 2300-2600\aa feii/feii* multiplets in the rest-uvspectra of star-forming galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.6 as probes of galactic-scaleoutflows. we extracted a mass-limited sample of 97 galaxies at z~1.0-2.6 fromultra-deep spectra obtained during the gmass spetroscopic survey in the goodssouth field with the vlt and fors2. we obtain robust measures of the restequivalent width of the feii absorption lines down to a limit of w_r&gt;1.5 \aaand of the feii* emission lines to w_r&gt;0.5 \aa. whenever we can measure thesystemic redshift of the galaxies from the [oii] emission line, we find thatboth the feii and mgii absorption lines are blueshifted, indicative that bothspecies trace gaseous outflows. we also find, however, that the feii gas hasgenerally lower outflow velocity relative to that of mgii. we investigate thevariation of feii line profiles as a function of the radiative transferproperties of the lines, and find that transitions with higher oscillatorstrengths are more blueshifted in terms of both line centroids and line wings.we discuss the possibility that feii lines are suppressed by stellarabsorptions. the lower velocities of the feii lines relative to the mgiidoublet, as well as the absence of spatially extended feii* emission in 2dstacked spectra, suggest that most clouds responsible for the feii absorptionlie close (3~4 kpc) to the disks of galaxies. we show that the feii/feii*multiplets offer unique probes of the kinematic structure of galactic outflows.

1407.1834	the interstellar medium and feedback in the progenitors of the compact  passive galaxies at z~2	quenched galaxies at z&gt;2 are nearly all very compact relative to z~0,suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,rapid cessation of star-formation. we present restframe uv spectra oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors ofquenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes andhigh surface density of star-formation. we compare their uv properties to thoseof more extended lbgs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).we find that candidate progenitors have faster ism gas velocities and higherequivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocityspread among absorbing clouds. candidates deviate from the relationship betweenequivalent widths of lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in thattheir lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,possibly indicating that the neutral hi fraction is patchy such thatlyman-alpha photons can escape. we detect stronger civ p-cygni features(emission and absorption) and heii emission in candidates, indicative of largerpopulations of metal rich wolf-rayet stars compared to non-candidates. thefaster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and lyman-alpha propertiesof candidates are consistent with their ism being subject to more energeticfeedback than non-candidates. together with their larger metallicity (implyingmore evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, ifspeculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them asprogenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. we propose that massive, compact galaxiesundergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gasaccretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized lbgsat these early epochs.

1407.6012	the relation between sfr and stellar mass for galaxies at 3.5 $\le z\le$  6.5 in candels	distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formationrates (sfr) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxyformation. here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatterof the sfr-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ usingmulti-wavelength photometry in goods-s from the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and spitzer extended deep survey. wedescribe an updated, bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method thatincorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories thatare constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions(starburst and small magellanic cloud). from $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forminggalaxies in candels follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar massand sfr that follows sfr $\sim$ $m_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. this evolution requires a star formationhistory that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the sfrs ofindividual galaxies rise with time). the observed scatter in the sfr-stellarmass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{sfr}/\mathrm{m}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})&lt;0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log m_\star/\mathrm{m}_\odot &gt; 9$ dex.assuming that the sfr is tied to the net gas inflow rate (sfr $\sim$$\dot{m}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is alsosmaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass andredshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.we further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected onthe basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolutionin the sfr-stellar mass relation.

1408.2527	the mass evolution of the first galaxies: stellar mass functions and  star formation rates at $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$ in the candels goods-south field	we measure new estimates for the galaxy stellar mass function and starformation rates for samples of galaxies at $z \sim 4,~5,~6~\&amp;~7$ using data inthe candels goods south field. the deep near-infrared observations allow us toconstruct the stellar mass function at $z \geq 6$ directly for the first time.we estimate stellar masses for our sample by fitting the observed spectralenergy distributions with synthetic stellar populations, including nebular lineand continuum emission. the observed uv luminosity functions for the samplesare consistent with previous observations, however we find that the observed$m_{uv}$ - m$_{*}$ relation has a shallow slope more consistent with a constantmass to light ratio and a normalisation which evolves with redshift. ourstellar mass functions have steep low-mass slopes ($\alpha \approx -1.9$),steeper than previously observed at these redshifts and closer to that of theuv luminosity function. integrating our new mass functions, we find theobserved stellar mass density evolves from $\log_{10} \rho_{*} =6.64^{+0.58}_{-0.89}$ at $z \sim 7$ to $7.36\pm0.06$ $\text{m}_{\odot}\text{mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4$. finally, combining the measured uv continuumslopes ($\beta$) with their rest-frame uv luminosities, we calculate dustcorrected star-formation rates (sfr) for our sample. we find the specificstar-formation rate for a fixed stellar mass increases with redshift whilst theglobal sfr density falls rapidly over this period. our new sfr densityestimates are higher than previously observed at this redshift.

1408.3684	a study of massive and evolved galaxies at high redshift	we use data taken as part of hst/wfc3 observations of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) to identify massiveand evolved galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;4.5. this is performed using the strength of thebalmer break feature at rest-frame 3648a, which is a diagnostic of the age ofthe stellar population in galaxies. using wfc3 h-band selected catalog for thecandels goods-s field and deep multi-waveband photometry from optical (hst) tomid-infrared (spitzer) wavelengths, we identify a population of old and evolvedpost-starburst galaxies based on the strength of their balmer breaks (balmerbreak galaxies- bbgs). the galaxies are also selected to be bright inrest-frame near-ir wavelengths and hence, massive. we identify a total of 16bbgs. fitting the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the bbgs show that thecandidate galaxies have average estimated ages of ~800 myr and average stellarmasses of ~5x10^10 m_sun, consistent with being old and massive systems. two ofour bbg candidates are also identified by the criteria that is sensitive tostar forming galaxies (lbg selection). we find a number density of ~3.2x10^-5mpc^-3 for the bbgs corresponding to a mass density of ~2.0x10^6 m_sun/mpc^3 inthe redshift range covering the survey. given the old age and the passiveevolution, it is argued that some of these objects formed the bulk of theirmass only a few hundred million years after the big bang.

1409.5433	the herschel view of the dominant mode of galaxy growth from z=4 to the  present day	we present an analysis of the deepest herschel images in four majorextragalactic fields goods-north, goods-south, uds and cosmos obtained withinthe goods-herschel and candels-herschel key programs. the picture provided by10497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stackinganalysis of a mass-complete sample of 62361 star-forming galaxies from thecandels-hst h band-selected catalogs and from two deep ground-based ksband-selected catalogs in the goods-north and the cosmos-wide fields, in orderto obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of thestellar mass growth over the cosmic history. we show, for the first time, thatstacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of aphysical correlation and describe our method called "scatter stacking" that maybe easily generalized to other experiments. we demonstrate that galaxies of allmasses from z=4 to 0 follow a universal scaling law, the so-called mainsequence of star-forming galaxies. we find a universal close-to-linear slope ofthe logsfr-logm* relation with evidence for a flattening of the main sequenceat high masses (log(m*/msun) &gt; 10.5) that becomes less prominent withincreasing redshift and almost vanishes by z~2. this flattening may be due tothe parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies.within the main sequence, we measure a non varying sfr dispersion of 0.3 dex.the specific sfr (ssfr=sfr/m*) of star-forming galaxies is found tocontinuously increase from z=0 to 4. finally we discuss the implications of ourfindings on the cosmic sfr history and show that more than 2/3 of present-daystars must have formed in a regime dominated by the main sequence mode. as aconsequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant universe,galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation historyover the last 12.5 gyr.

1410.5439	the evolution of the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function  over the first two billion years	we present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet(uv) luminosity function at z=4-8. we use deep hubble space telescope imagingover the candels/goods fields, the hubble ultra deep field and the year 1hubble frontier field deep parallel observations. these surveys provides aneffective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us toperform a robust search for faint (m_uv=-18) and bright (m_uv &lt; -21) galaxies.we select candidate galaxies using a well-tested photometric redshift techniquewith careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446 galaxies at3.5&lt;z&lt;8.5, with &gt;1000 galaxies at z~6-8. we measure the luminosity functionusing a markov chain monte carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. atthe faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higherabundance of uv-bright galaxies at z&gt;6, with m* ~ -21 at z&gt;5, different thanthat inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. at z=8, a singlepower-law provides an equally good fit to the uv luminosity function, while atz=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. wecompare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in m* isconsistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-endof the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. we measure theevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dustattenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z&gt;4,consistent with observations at z&gt;9. our observations are consistent with areionization history that starts at z&gt;10, completes at z&gt;6, and reaches amidpoint (x_hii = 0.5) at 6.7&lt;z&lt;9.4. finally, our observations predict that theabundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies.

1410.7398	clumpy galaxies in candels. i. the definition of uv clumps and the  fraction of clumpy galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3	although giant clumps of stars are crucial to galaxy formation and evolution,the most basic demographics of clumps are still uncertain, mainly because thedefinition of clumps has not been thoroughly discussed. in this paper, we studythe basic demographics of clumps in star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 0.5&lt;z&lt;3,using our proposed physical definition that uv-bright clumps are discretestar-forming regions that individually contribute more than 8% of therest-frame uv light of their galaxies. clumps defined this way aresignificantly brighter than the hii regions of nearby large spiral galaxies,either individually or blended, when physical spatial resolution andcosmological dimming are considered. under this definition, we measure thefraction of sfgs that contain at least one off-center clump (fclumpy) and thecontributions of clumps to the rest-frame uv light and star formation rate ofsfgs in the candels/goods-s and uds fields, where our mass-complete sampleconsists of 3239 galaxies with axial ratio q&gt;0.5. the redshift evolution offclumpy changes with the stellar mass (m*) of the galaxies. low-mass(log(m*/msun)&lt;9.8) galaxies keep an almost constant fclumpy of about 60% fromz~3.0 to z~0.5. intermediate-mass and massive galaxies drop their fclumpy from55% at z~3.0 to 40% and 15%, respectively, at z~0.5. we find that (1) the trendof disk stabilization predicted by violent disk instability matches the fclumpytrend of massive galaxies; (2) minor mergers are a viable explanation of thefclumpy trend of intermediate-mass galaxies at z&lt;1.5, given a realisticobservability timescale; and (3) major mergers are unlikely responsible for thefclumpy trend in all masses at z&lt;1.5. the clump contribution to the rest-frameuv light of sfgs shows a broad peak around galaxies with log(m*/msun)~10.5 atall redshifts, possibly linked to the molecular gas fraction of the galaxies.(abridged)

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

astro-ph;0012249	clustering segregation with uv luminosity in lyman-break galaxies at z~3  and its implications	we report on the clustering properties of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3.the correlation length of flux-limited samples of lbgs depends on theirrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity at lambda ~1700 angstrom, with faintergalaxies being less strongly clustered in space. it decreases by a factor ~3over the range of limiting magnitudes that we have probed, namely 25&lt;r&lt;27,suggesting that fainter samples include galaxies with smaller mass. we findthat: 1) the clustering strength of lbgs follows, within the errors, the samescaling law with the volume density predicted for cold dark matter (cdm) halos;2) the scaling law predicted for the galaxies using the halos mass spectrum anda number of models for the relationship that maps the halos' mass into thegalaxies' uv luminosity depends only on how tightly mass and uv luminositycorrelate, but is otherwise insensitive to the details of the models. theseresults provide additional evidence that the strong spatial clustering of lbgsis due to galaxy biasing, supporting biased galaxy formation and gravitationalinstability as the primary mechanism for the formation of structure. we alsofind that 1) a scale invariant relationship between mass and uv luminosity(e.g. a power law) is not supported, suggesting that the properties of starformation of galaxies change along the mass spectrum of the observed lbgs; 2)the scatter of the uv luminosity of lbgs of given mass must be relatively smallfor massive lbgs, suggesting that the mass is an important parameter inregulating the activity of star formation in these systems, and that thefraction of massive halos at z~3 that are not observed in uv-selected surveysis not large.

astro-ph;0102456	the rest frame optical spectra of lyman break galaxies: star formation,  extinction, abundances, and kinematics	we present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of lyman breakgalaxies in the near-infrared aimed at detecting the emission lines of [o ii],[o iii], and hbeta from the h ii regions of star forming galaxies at z = 3.  from observations of 19 objects with the keck and vlt telescopes, we reachthe following main conclusions. contrary to expectations, the star formationrates deduced from the hbeta luminosity are on average no larger than thoseimplied by the stellar continuum at 1500 a; presumably any differentialextinction between rest-frame optical and uv is small compared with therelative uncertainties in the calibrations of these two star formation tracers.for the galaxies in our sample, the abundance of o can only be determined towithin one order of magnitude. even so, it seems well established that lbgs arethe most metal-enriched structures at z = 3, apart from qsos, with abundancesgreater than about 1/10 solar. they are also significantly overluminous fortheir metallicities; this is probably an indication that their mass-to-lightratios are small compared with present-day galaxies. at face value theirvelocity dispersions, sigma = 50 - 115 km/s imply virial masses of about10^{10} solar masses within half-light radii of 2.5 kpc. however, we are unableto establish if the widths of the emission lines do reflect the motions of theh ii regions within the gravitational potential of the galaxies, even though intwo cases we see hints of rotation curves. all 19 lbgs observed show evidencefor galactic-scale superwinds; such outflows are important for regulating starformation, distributing metals over large volumes, and allowing lyman continuumphotons to escape and ionize the igm.

astro-ph;0308386	the internal ultraviolet-to-optical color dispersion: quantifying the  morphological k-correction	we present a quantitative measure of the internal color dispersion withingalaxies, which quantifies differences in morphology as a function ofwavelength. we apply this statistic to a local galaxy sample with archivalimages at 1500 and 2500 angstroms from the ultraviolet imaging telescope, andground-based b-band observations to investigate how the color dispersionrelates to global galaxy properties. the intenal color dispersion generallycorrelates with transformations in galaxy morphology as a function ofwavelength, i.e., it quantifies the morphological k-correction. mid-type spiralgalaxies exhibit the highest dispersion in their internal colors, which stemsfrom differences in the bulge, disk, and spiral-arm components. irregulars andlate-type spirals show moderate internal color dispersion, which implies thatyoung stars generally dominate the colors. ellipticals, lenticulars, andearly-type spirals generally have low or negligible internal color dispersion,which indicates that the stars contributing to the uv-to-optical emission havea very homogeneous distribution. we discuss the application of the internalcolor dispersion to high-redshift galaxies in deep, hubble space telescopeimages. by simulating local galaxies at cosmological distances, many of thegalaxies have luminosities that are sufficiently bright at rest--frame opticalwavelengths to be detected within the limits of the currently deepestnear-infrared surveys even with no evolution. under assumptions that theluminosity and color evolution of the local galaxies conform with the measuredvalues of high-redshift objects, we show that galaxies' intrinsic internalcolor dispersion remains measurable out to z ~ 3.

astro-ph;0308420	near-infrared observations of bl lacertae host galaxies	multi-band near-infrared images of twelve bl lacertae objects were obtainedwith the 2.5m telescope at the las campanas observatory in order to determinethe properties of their underlying host galaxies. resolved emission was clearlydetected in eight of the lowest redshift targets (up to z~0.3), and was modeledwith a de vaucouleurs r^{1/4} surface brightness law. we find that themorphologies match the elliptical galaxy profiles well, and that the bl lacobjects reside in large and luminous, but otherwise normal hosts -- consistentwith previous studies done predominantly at optical wavelengths. the medianabsolute k-band magnitude of the galaxies in this study is -26.2, the averagehalf-light radius is 4.2 +/- 2.3 kpc, and their average integrated r-k color is2.7 +/- 0.3 mag. these are well within the range of values measured previouslyin the h-band by kotilainen et al. and scarpa et al. in a comparable number oftargets. taking their data together with our results, we find a best-fit k-bandkormendy relation of \mu_{e} = 4.3 log_{10} (r_{e}/kpc) + 14.2 mag arcsec^{-2},virtually identical to that obtained for normal ellipticals. finally, thenear-infrared colors determined for five galaxies (average j-k = 0.8 +/- 0.3mag) are the first such measurements for bl lac hosts, and match those expectedfrom old stellar populations at the bl lac redshifts.

astro-ph;0309071	cosmic variance in the great observatories origins deep survey	cosmic variance is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the volumedensity of extragalactic objects such as galaxies or quasars arising from theunderlying large-scale density fluctuations. this is often a significant sourceof uncertainty, especially in deep galaxy surveys, which tend to coverrelatively small areas. we present estimates of the relative cosmic variancefor one-point statistics (i.e. number densities) for typical scales and volumessampled by the great observatories origins deep survey (goods). we use twoapproaches: for objects with a known two-point correlation function that iswell-approximated by a power law, one can use the standard analytic formalismto calculate the cosmic variance (in excess of shot noise). we use thisapproach to estimate the cosmic variance for several populations that are beingstudied in the goods program: extremely red objects (ero) at z~1, and lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) at z~3 and z~4, using clustering information for similarpopulations in the literature. for populations with unknown clustering, one canuse predictions from cold dark matter theory to obtain a rough estimate of thevariance as a function of number density. we present a convenient plot whichallows one to use this approach to read off the cosmic variance for apopulation with a known mean redshift and estimated number density. we concludethat for the volumes sampled by goods, cosmic variance is a significant sourceof uncertainty for strongly clustered objects (~40-60% for eros) and lessserious for less clustered objects, ~10-20% for lbgs.

astro-ph;0310888	evolution in the colors of lyman-break galaxies from z~4 to z~3	the integrated colors of distant galaxies provide a means for interpretingthe properties of their stellar content. here, we use rest-frame uv-to-opticalcolors to constrain the spectral-energy distributions and stellar populationsof color-selected, b-dropout galaxies at z ~ 4 in the great observatoriesorigins deep survey. we combine the acs data with ground-based near-infraredimages, which extend the coverage of galaxies at z ~ 4 to the rest-frameb-band. we observe a color-magnitude trend in the rest-frame m(uv) - b versus bdiagram for the z ~ 4 galaxies that has a fairly well-defined "blue-envelope",and is strikingly similar to that of color-selected, u-dropout galaxies at z ~3. we also find that although the co-moving luminosity density at rest-frame uvwavelengths (1600 angstroms) is roughly comparable at z ~ 3 and z ~ 4, theluminosity density at rest-frame optical wavelengths increases by aboutone-third from z ~ 4 to z ~ 3. although the star-formation histories ofindividual galaxies may involve complex and stochastic events, the evolution inthe global luminosity density of the uv-bright galaxy population corresponds toan average star-formation history with a star-formation rate that is constantor increasing over these redshifts. this suggests that the evolution in theluminosity density corresponds to an increase in the stellar-mass density ofmore than 33%.

astro-ph;0402512	type ia supernova discoveries at z&gt;1 from the hubble space telescope:  evidence for past deceleration and constraints on dark energy evolution	we have discovered 16 type ia supernovae (sne ia) with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence forcosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration.these objects, discovered during the course of the goods acs treasury program,include 6 of the 7 highest-redshift sne ia known, all at z&gt;1.25, and populatethe hubble diagram in unexplored territory. the luminosity distances to theseand 170 previous sne ia are provided. a purely kinematic interpretation of thesn ia sample provides evidence at the &gt; 99% confidence level for a transitionfrom deceleration to acceleration or similarly, strong evidence for a cosmicjerk. using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between thetwo epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46 +/- 0.13. the data are consistentwith the cosmic concordance model of omega_m ~ 0.3, omega_lambda~0.7(chi^2_dof=1.06), and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dustas an alternative to dark energy. for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. when combined with external flat-universe constraints we find w=-1.02+ 0.13 - 0.19 (and $&lt;-0.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed staticequation of state of dark energy, p = w\rho c^2. joint constraints on both therecent equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, and its time evolution, dw/dz,are a factor of ~8 more precise than its first estimate and twice as precise asthose without the sne ia discovered with hst. our constraints are consistentwith the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant(i.e., w_0 = -1.0, dw/dz = 0), and are inconsistent with very rapid evolutionof dark energy. we address consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate ofthe universe.

astro-ph;0501088	the assembly of diversity in the morphologies and stellar populations of  high-redshift galaxies	we have studied the evolution in the morphologies, sizes, stellar-masses,colors, and internal color dispersion (icd) of galaxies at z=1 and 2.3, using anear-ir, flux-limited catalog for the hdf-n. at z=1 most luminous galaxies havemorphologies of early-to-mid hubble-types, and many show transformationsbetween their rest-frame uv-optical morphologies. galaxies at z=2.3 havecompact and irregular morphologies with no clearly evident hubble-sequencecandidates. the mean galaxy size grows from z=2.3 to 1 by 40%, and the densityof galaxies larger than 3 kpc increases by 7 times. at z=1, the size-luminositydistribution is broadly consistent with that of local galaxies, with passiveevolution. however, galaxies at z=2.3 are smaller than the large present-daygalaxies, and must continue to grow in size and stellar mass. we have measuredthe galaxies' uv-optical icd, which quantifies differences in morphology andthe relative amount of on-going star-formation. the mean and scatter ingalaxies' total colors and icd increase from z=2.3 to 1. at z=1 many galaxieswith large icd are spirals, with a few irregular systems. few z=2.3 galaxieshave high icd, and those that do are actively merging. we interpret this asevidence for the presence of older and more diverse stellar populations at z=1that are not generally present at z&gt;2. we conclude that the star-formationhistories of galaxies at z&gt;2 are dominated by discrete, recurrent bursts, whichquickly homogenize the galaxies' stellar content, and are possibly associatedwith mergers. the increase in the stellar-population diversification by z&lt;1.4implies that merger-induced starbursts occur less frequently than at higherredshifts, and more quiescent star-forming modes dominate. this transitioncoincides with the emergence of hubble-sequence galaxies.

astro-ph;9802318	the angular clustering of lyman-break galaxies at redshift z=3	we have measured the angular correlation function w(theta) for a sample of871 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z=3. fitting a power-law to a weightedaverage of w(theta) from 5 fields, we find the amplitude to be a_w=2arcsec^{\beta} and the slope \beta=0.9. the slope is the same as in the localand moderate redshift universe. a slope \beta=0.25 or shallower is ruled out bythe data at the 99.9% confidence level. because n(z) of lbgs is well determinedfrom 376 spectroscopic redshifts, the real-space correlation function can bederived from the angular one through the limber transform. this inversion israther insensitive to the still relatively large errors on a_w and \beta, andthe spatial correlation length is much more tightly constrained than either ofthese parameters. we estimate r_0=3.3 -0.6 +0.7 (2.1 -0.5 +0.4) h^{-1} mpc(comoving) for q_0=0.1 (0.5) at z=3.04 (h is in units of 100 km/s/mpc). thecorrelation length of lbgs at z=3 is comparable to that of present-day spiralgalaxies and is only about 50% smaller than that of the ellipticals; it is aslarge or larger than any measured in galaxy samples at 0.3&lt;z&lt;1. by comparingthe observed galaxy correlation length to that of the mass predicted from cdmtheory, we estimate a bias for lbgs of b\sim 1.5 (4.5) for q_0=0.1 (0.5), inagreement with our previous estimates based on preliminary spectroscopy. thestrong clustering and the large bias of the lbgs are consistent with biasedgalaxy formation theories and provide additional evidence that these systemsare associated with massive dark matter halos. the clustering of lbgs at z=3emphasizes that apparent evolution of galaxy clustering may be due as much tovariations in effective bias parameter among different samples as to evolutionin the mass distribution through gravitational instability.

astro-ph;9806219	infared observations of nebular emission lines from galaxies at z = 3	we present the first results from a program of near-infrared spectroscopyaimed at studying the familiar rest-frame optical emission lines from the h iiregions of lyman break galaxies at z = 3. by targeting redshifts which bringthe lines of interest into gaps between the strong oh sky emission, we havebeen successful in detecting balmer and [o iii] emission lines in all fivegalaxies observed so far with cgs4 on ukirt. for a salpeter imf and a h_0 = 70km/s/mpc, q_0 = 0.1 cosmology, the hbeta luminosities uncorrected for dustextinction imply star formation rates of 20 - 270 solar masses per year. on thebasis of the present limited sample it appears that an extinction of 1 - 2magnitudes at 1500 a may be typical of lyman break galaxies. this value isconsistent with recent estimates of dust obscuration in star forming galaxiesat z &lt; 1, and does not require a substantial revision of the broad picture ofstar formation over the hubble time proposed by madau et al. (1996). in fourout of five cases the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas is sigma =70 km/s, while in the fifth the line widths are nearly three times larger.virial masses in the range from 1 x 10^{10} to 5 x 10^{10} solar masses aresuggested, but both velocities and masses could be higher because ourobservations are only sensitive to the brightest cores of these systems wherethe line widths may not sample the full gravitational potential. the relativeredshifts of interstellar absorption, nebular emission, and lyman alphaemission lines differ by several hundred km/s and suggest that large-scaleoutflows may be a common characteristic of lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;9809060	hst observations of the host galaxies of bl lacertae objects	six bl lac objects from the complete 1 jy radio-selected sample of 34 objectswere observed in cycle 5 with the hst wfpc2 camera to an equivalent limitingflux of mu_i~26 mag/arcsec^2. here we report results for the second half ofthis sample, as well as new results for the first three objects, discussedpreviously by falomo et al. (1997). in addition, we have analyzed in the sameway hst images of three x-ray-selected bl lacs observed by jannuzi et al.(1997). the ensemble of 9 bl lac objects spans the redshift range from z=0.19to ~1. host galaxies are clearly detected in seven cases, while the other two,at z~0.258 (redshift highly uncertain) and z=0.997, are not resolved. the hstimages constitute a homogeneous data set with unprecedented morphologicalinformation between a few tenths of an arcsecond and several arcseconds fromthe nucleus, allowing us in 6 of the 7 detected host galaxies to rule outdefinitively a pure disk light profile. the host galaxies are luminousellipticals with an average absolute magnitude of m_i~-24.6 mag (withdispersion 0.7 mag), more than a magnitude brighter than l* and comparable tobrightest cluster galaxies. the morphologies are generally smooth and havesmall ellipticities (epsilon&lt;0.2). given such roundness, there is no obviousalignment with the more linear radio structures. in the six cases for which wehave hst wfpc2 images in two filters, the derived color profiles show no strongspatial gradients and are as expected for k-corrected passively evolvingelliptical galaxies. the host galaxies of the radio-selected and x-ray-selectedbl lacs for this very limited sample are comparable in both morphology andluminosity.

astro-ph;9908007	the ultraviolet spectrum of ms 1512-cb58: an insight into lyman break  galaxies	we present an intermediate resolution, high s/n spectrum of the z = 2.7268galaxy ms 1512-cb58, obtained with lris on the keck i telescope and coveringthe rest frame far-uv from 1150 to 1930 a. gravitational lensing by aforeground cluster boosts the flux from cb58 by a factor of about 30 andprovides the opportunity for a first quantitative study of the physicalproperties of star forming galaxies at high redshift. our main results are asfollows. the ultraviolet spectral properties of cb58 are remarkably similar tothose of nearby star forming galaxies. the p-cygni profiles of civ and nv arebest matched by continuous star formation with a salpeter imf extending beyond50 solar masses---we find no evidence for either a flatter imf (at the highmass end), or an imf deficient in the most massive stars. there are clues inour data that the metallicity of both the stars and the gas is a few timesbelow solar. our best estimate, approximately equal to 1/4 solar, is 3 timeshigher than the typical metallicity of damped lyman alpha systems at the sameredshift, consistent with the proposal that the galaxies which dominate the h iabsorption cross-section are generally forming stars at a slower rate than l*lyman break galaxies like cb58. the relative velocities of the stellar lines,interstellar absorption, and h ii emission indicate the existence oflarge-scale outflows in the interstellar medium of cb58, with a bulk outwardmotion of 200 km/s and a mass loss rate of approximately 60 solar masses peryear, roughly comparable to the star formation rate. such galactic winds maywell be the mechanism which self-regulates star formation, distributes metalsover large volumes and allows the escape of ionizing photons into the igm.

astro-ph;9909092	a search for the submillimetre counterparts to lyman break galaxies	we have carried out targetted sub-mm observations as part of a programme toexplore the connection between the rest-frame uv and far-ir properties ofstar-forming galaxies at high redshift, which is currently poorly understood.on the one hand the lyman break technique is very effective at selecting z~3galaxies. on the other hand `blank field' imaging in the sub-mm seems to turnup sources routinely, amongst which some are star forming galaxies at similarredshifts. already much work has been done searching for opticalidentifications of objects detected using the scuba instrument. here we havetaken the opposite approach, performing sub-mm photometry for a sample of lymanbreak galaxies whose uv properties imply high star formation rates.  the total signal from our lyman break sample is undetected in the sub-mm, atan rms level of 0.5 mjy, which implies that the population of lyman breakgalaxies does not constitute a large part of the recently detected blank-fieldsub-mm sources. however, our one detection suggests that with reasonable scubaintegrations we might expect to detect those few lbgs that are far-irbrightest.
