0901.1549	the canonical gamma-ray bursts: long, "fake"-"disguised" and "genuine"  short bursts	the gamma-ray bursts (grbs) offer the unprecedented opportunity to observefor the first time the blackholic energy extracted by the vacuum polarizationduring the process of gravitational collapse to a black hole leading to theformation of an electron-positron plasma. the uniqueness of the kerr-newmanblack hole implies that very different processes originating from thegravitational collapse a) of a single star in a binary system induced by thecompanion, or b) of two neutron stars, or c) of a neutron star and a whitedwarf, do lead to the same structure for the observed grb. the recent progressof the numerical integration of the relativistic boltzmann equations withcollision integrals including 2-body and 3-body interactions between theparticles offer a powerful conceptual tool in order to differentiate thetraditional "fireball" picture, an expanding hot cavity considered by cavalloand rees, as opposed to the "fireshell" model, composed of an internally coldshell of relativistically expanding electron-positron-baryon plasma. theanalysis of the fireshell naturally leads to a canonical grb composed of aproper-grb and an extended afterglow. by recalling the three interpretationalparadigms for grbs we show how the fireshell model leads to an understanding ofthe grb structure and to an alternative classification of short and long grbs.

0706.2572	the blackholic energy and the canonical gamma-ray burst	we outline the main results of our grb model, based on the threeinterpretation paradigms we proposed in july 2001, comparing and contrastingthem with the ones in the current literature. thanks to the observations byswift and by vlt, this analysis points to a "canonical grb" originating frommarkedly different astrophysical scenarios. the communality is that they areall emitted in the formation of a black hole with small or null angularmomentum. the following sequence appears to be canonical: the vacuumpolarization process creating an optically thick self acceleratingelectron-positron plasma; the engulfment of baryonic mass during the plasmaexpansion; the adiabatic expansion of the optically thick "fireshell" up to thetransparency; the interaction of the remaining accelerated baryons with theinterstellar medium (ism). this leads to the canonical grb composed of a propergrb (p-grb), emitted at the moment of transparency, followed by an extendedafterglow. the parameters are the plasma total energy, the fireshell baryonloading and the ism filamentary distribution around the source. in the limit ofno baryon loading the total energy is radiated in the p-grb. in this limit, thecanonical grbs explain as well the short grbs.

0706.3209	grb060218 and grbs associated with supernovae ib/c	we plan to fit the complete gamma- and x-ray light curves of the longduration grb060218, including the prompt emission, in order to clarify thenature of the progenitors and the astrophysical scenario of the class of grbsassociated to sne ib/c. the initial total energy of the electron-positronplasma e_{e^\pm}^{tot}=2.32\times 10^{50} erg has a particularly low valuesimilarly to the other grbs associated with sne. for the first time we observea baryon loading b=10^{-2} which coincides with the upper limit for thedynamical stability of the fireshell. the effective circumburst medium (cbm)density shows a radial dependence n_{cbm} \propto r^{-\alpha} with1.0&lt;\alpha&lt;1.7 and monotonically decreases from 1 to 10^{-6} particles/cm^3.such a behavior is interpreted as due to a fragmentation in the fireshell.analogies with the fragmented density and filling factor characterizing novaeare outlined. the fit presented is particularly significant in view of thecomplete data set available for grb060218 and of the fact that it fulfills theamati relation. we fit grb060218, usually considered as an x-ray flash (xrf),as a "canonical grb" within our theoretical model. the smallest possible blackhole, formed by the gravitational collapse of a neutron star in a binarysystem, is consistent with the especially low energetics of the class of grbsassociated with sne ib/c. we give the first evidence for a fragmentation in thefireshell. such a fragmentation is crucial in explaining both the unusuallylarge t_{90} and the consequently inferred abnormal low value of the cbmeffective density.

0910.0974	electron-positron pairs in physics and astrophysics: from heavy nuclei  to black holes	from the interaction of physics and astrophysics we are witnessing in theseyears a splendid synthesis of theoretical, experimental and observationalresults originating from three fundametal physical processes. they wereoriginally proposed by dirac, by breit and wheeler and by sauter, heisenberg,euler and schwinger. the vacuum polarization process in strong electromagneticfield, pioneered by sauter, heisenberg, euler and schwinger, introduced theconcept of critical electric field. it has been searched without success formore than forty years by heavy-ion collisions in many of the leading particleaccelerators worldwide. the novel situation today is that these same processescan be studied on a much more grandiose scale during the gravitational collapseleading to the formation of a black hole being observed in gamma ray bursts.this report is dedicated to the scientific race in act. the theoretical andexperimental work developed in earth-based laboratories is confronted with thetheoretical interpretation of space-based observations of phenomena originatingon cosmological scales. what has become clear in the last ten years is that allthe three above mentioned processes, duly extended in the general relativisticframework, are necessary for the understanding of the physics of thegravitational collapse to a black hole. vice versa, the natural arena wherethese processes can be observed in mutual interaction and on an unprecedentedscale, is indeed the realm of relativistic astrophysics.

0911.4627	on the self-consistent general relativistic equilibrium equations of  neutron stars	we address the existence of globally neutral neutron star configurations incontrast with the traditional ones constructed by imposing local neutrality.the equilibrium equations describing this system are the einstein-maxwellequations which must be solved self-consistently with the general relativisticthomas-fermi equation and $\beta$-equilibrium condition. to illustrate theapplication of this novel approach we adopt the baym, bethe, and pethick (1971)strong interaction model of the baryonic matter in the core and of thewhite-dwarf-like material of the crust. we illustrate the crucial role playedby the boundary conditions satisfied by the leptonic component of the matter atthe interface between the core and the crust. for every central density anentire new family of equilibrium configurations exists for selected values ofthe fermi energy of the electrons at the surface of the core. each suchconfiguration fulfills global charge neutrality and is characterized by anon-trivial electrodynamical structure. the electric field extends over a thinshell of thickness $\sim \hbar/(m_e c)$ between the core and the crust andbecomes largely overcritical in the limit of decreasing values of the crustmass.

1006.4842	grb 071227: an additional case of a disguised short burst	(shortened) [...] in the context of the fireshell model, [...] a new familyof disguised short bursts has been identified: long bursts with a protractedlow instantaneous luminosity due to a low density circumburst medium (cbm). inthe 15-150 kev energy band grb 071227 exhibits a short duration (about 1.8s)spike-like emission followed by a very soft extended tail up to one hundredseconds after the trigger. it is a faint (e_{iso}=5.8x10^{50}) nearby grb(z=0.383) that does not have an associated type ib/c bright supernova (sn). forthese reasons, grb 071227 has been classified as a short burst not fulfillingthe amati relation holding for long burst. we check the classification of grb071227 provided by the fireshell model. in particular, we test whether thisburst is another example of a disguised short burst, after grb 970228 and grb060614, and, for this reason, whether it fulfills the amati relation. wesimulate grb 071227 light curves in the swift bat 15-50 kev bandpass and in thexrt (0.3-10 kev) energy band within the fireshell model. we perform simulationsof the tail in the 15-50 kev bandpass, as well as of the first part of thex-ray afterglow. this infers that: e_{tot}^{e^\pm}=5.04x10^{51} erg,b=2.0x10^{-4}, e_{p-grb}/e_{aft}~0.25, and &lt;n_{cbm}&gt;=3.33 particles/cm^3. thesevalues are consistent with those of "long duration" grbs. we interpret theobserved energy of the first hard emission by identifying it with the p-grbemission. the remaining long soft tail indeed fulfills the amati relation.previously classified as a short burst, grb 071227 on the basis of our analysisperformed in the context of the fireshell scenario represents another exampleof a disguised short burst, after grb 970228 and grb 060614. furtherconfirmation of this result is that the soft tail of grb 071227 fulfills theamati relation.

0709.0651	grb970228 and a class of grbs with an initial spikelike emission	(shortened) the swift and hete-2 discovery of an afterglow associatedpossibly with short grbs opened the new problematic of their nature andclassification. this has been further enhanced by the grb060614 observation andby a re-analysis of the batse catalog leading to the identification of a newgrb class with "an occasional softer extended emission lasting tenths ofseconds after an initial spikelike emission". we plan: a) to fit this new classof "hybrid" sources within our "canonical grb" scenario, where all grbs aregenerated by a "common engine" (i.e. the gravitational collapse to a blackhole); b) to propose grb970228 as the prototype of the such a class. we analyzebepposax data on grb970228 in the 40-700 kev and 2-26 kev energy bands withinthe "fireshell" model. we find that grb970228 is a "canonical grb", like e.g.grb050315, with the main peculiarity of a particularly low circumburst medium(cbm) average density n_{cbm}~10^{-3} #/cm^3. we also simulate the light curvecorresponding to a rescaled cbm density profile with n_{cbm}=1 #/cm^3. fromsuch a comparison it follows that the total time-integrated luminosity is afaithful indicator of the grb nature, contrary to the peak luminosity which ismerely a function of the cbm density. we call attention on discriminating theshort grbs between the "genuine" and the "fake" ones. the "genuine" ones areintrinsically short, with baryon loading b \la 10^{-5}, as stated in ouroriginal classification. the "fake" ones, characterized by an initial spikelikeemission followed by an extended emission lasting tenths of seconds, have abaryon loading 10^{-4} \la b \leq 10^{-2}. they are observed as such only dueto an underdense cbm consistent with a galactic halo environment which deflatesthe afterglow intensity.

1101.5612	on the nature of grb 050509b: a disguised short grb	(shortened) context: grb grb 050509b, detected by the \emph{swift} satellite,is the first case where an x-ray afterglow has been observed associated with ashort gamma-ray burst (grb). within the fireshell model, the canonical grblight curve presents two different components: the proper-grb (p-grb) and theextended afterglow. [...] in particular, the traditionally called short grbscan be either "genuine" short grbs [...] or "disguised" short grbs [...]. aims:we verify whether grb 050509b can be classified as a "genuine" short or a"disguised" short grb, in the fireshell model. methods: we investigate twoalternative scenarios. in the first, we start from the assumption that this grbis a "genuine" short burst. in the second attempt, we assume that this grb is a"disguised" burst. results: if grb 050509b were a genuine short grb, thereshould initially be very hard emission which is ruled out by the observations.the analysis that assumes that this is a disguised short grb is compatible withthe observations. the theoretical model predicts a value of the extendedafterglow energy peak that is consistent with the amati relation. conclusions:grb 050509b cannot be classified as a "genuine" short grb. the observationaldata are consistent with a "disguised" short grb classification, i.e., a longburst with a weak extended afterglow "deflated" by the low density of the cbm.we expect that all short grbs with measured redshifts are disguised short grbsbecause of a selection effect: if there is enough energy in the afterglow tomeasure the redshift, then the proper grb must be less energetic than theafterglow. the amati relation is found to be fulfilled only by the extendedafterglow excluding the p-grb.

1111.2235	the luminosity evolution over the equitemporal surfaces in the prompt  emission of gamma-ray bursts	due to the ultrarelativistic velocity of the expanding "fireshell" (lorentzgamma factor \gamma \sim 10^2 - 10^3), photons emitted at the same time fromthe fireshell surface do not reach the observer at the same arrival time. ininterpreting gamma-ray bursts (grbs) it is crucial to determine the propertiesof the equitemporal surfaces (eqtss): the locus of points which are source ofradiation reaching the observer at the same arrival time. in the currentliterature this analysis is performed only in the latest phases of theafterglow. here we study the distribution of the grb bolometric luminosity overthe eqtss, with special attention to the prompt emission phase. we analyze aswell the temporal evolution of the eqts apparent size in the sky. we use theanalytic solutions of the equations of motion of the fireshell and thecorresponding analytic expressions of the eqtss which have been presented inrecent works and which are valid for both the fully radiative and the adiabaticdynamics. we find the novel result that at the beginning of the prompt emissionthe most luminous regions of the eqtss are the ones closest to the line ofsight. on the contrary, in the late prompt emission and in the early afterglowphases the most luminous eqts regions are the ones closest to the boundary ofthe visible region. this transition in the emitting region may lead to specificobservational signatures, i.e. an anomalous spectral evolution, in the risingpart or at the peak of the prompt emission. we find as well an expression forthe apparent radius of the eqts in the sky, valid in both the fully radiativeand the adiabatic regimes. such considerations are essential for thetheoretical interpretation of the prompt emission phase of grbs.

1112.3462	cooling of young neutron stars in grb associated to supernova	recent observations of the late ($t=10^8$--$10^9$ s) emission of supernovae(sne) associated to grbs (grb-sn) show a distinctive emission in the x-rayregime consistent with temperatures $10^7$--$10^8$ k. similar features havebeen also observed in the two type ic sne sn 2002ap and sn 1994i that are notassociated to grbs. we advance the possibility that the late x-ray emissionobserved in grb-sn and in isolated sn is associated to a hot neutron star (ns)just formed in the sn event, here defined as a neo-ns. we discuss the thermalevolution of neo-ns in the age regime that spans from $\sim 1$ minute (justafter the proto-ns phase) up to ages &lt;10-100 yr. we examine the key factorgoverning the neo-ns cooling emphasizing on the neutrino emission. aphenomenological heating source and new boundary conditions are introduced tomimic the high-temperature atmosphere of young nss. we match the neo-nsluminosity to the late x-ray emission of the grb-sn events urca-1 ingrb980425-sn1998bw, urca-2 in grb030329-sn2003dh, and urca-3 ingrb031203-sn2003lw. by calibrating our additional heating source at early timesto $\sim 10^{12}$--$10^{15}$ erg/g/s, we find a striking agreement of theluminosity obtained from the cooling of neo-nss with the late($t=10^{8}$--$10^{9}$ s) x-ray emission observed in grb-sn. it is thereforeappropriate to revise the boundary conditions used in the cooling theory ofnss, to match the proper conditions of the atmosphere at young ages. additionalheating processes that are still not studied within this context, such as e+e-pair creation by overcritical fields and nuclear fusion and fission energyrelease, might also take place under such conditions and deserve furtheranalysis. observation of grb-sn has shown the possibility of witnessing thethermal evolution of neo-nss. a new campaign of dedicated observations isrecommended both of grb-sn and of isolated type ic sn.

1202.6500	neutron star equilibrium configurations within a fully relativistic  theory with strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational interactions	we formulate the equations of equilibrium of neutron stars taking intoaccount strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational interactions withinthe framework of general relativity. the nuclear interactions are described bythe exchange of the sigma, omega, and rho virtual mesons. the equilibriumconditions are given by our recently developed theoretical framework based onthe einstein-maxwell-thomas-fermi equations along with the constancy of thegeneral relativistic fermi energies of particles, the "klein potentials",throughout the configuration. the equations are solved numerically in the caseof zero temperatures and for selected parametrization of the nuclear models.the solutions lead to a new structure of the star: a positively charged core atsupranuclear densities surrounded by an electronic distribution of thickness$\sim \hbar/(m_e c)$ of opposite charge, as well as a neutral crust at lowerdensities. inside the core there is a coulomb potential well of depth $\simm_\pi c^2/e$. the constancy of the klein potentials in the transition from thecore to the crust, impose the presence of an overcritical electric field $\sim(m_\pi/m_e)^2 e_c$, the critical field being $e_c=m^2_e c^3/(e \hbar)$. theelectron chemical potential and the density decrease, in the boundaryinterface, until values $\mu^{\rm crust}_e &lt; \mu^{\rm core}_e$ and $\rho_{\rmcrust}&lt;\rho_{\rm core}$. for each central density, an entire family ofcore-crust interface boundaries and, correspondingly, an entire family ofcrusts with different mass and thickness, exist. the configuration with$\rho_{\rm crust}=\rho_{\rm drip}\sim 4.3\times 10^{11}$ g/cm$^3$ separatesneutron stars with and without inner crust. we present here the novel neutronstar mass-radius for the case $\rho_{\rm crust}=\rho_{\rm drip}$ and compareand contrast it with the one obtained from the tolman-oppenheimer-volkofftreatment.

1204.2070	on general relativistic uniformly rotating white dwarfs	the properties of uniformly rotating white dwarfs (rwds) are analyzed withinthe framework of general relativity. hartle's formalism is applied to constructthe internal and external solutions to the einstein equations. the wd matter isdescribed by the relativistic feynman-metropolis-teller equation of state whichgeneralizes the salpeter's one by taking into account the finite size of thenuclei, the coulomb interactions as well as electroweak equilibrium in aself-consistent relativistic fashion. the mass $m$, radius $r$, angularmomentum $j$, eccentricity $\epsilon$, and quadrupole moment $q$ of rwds arecalculated as a function of the central density $\rho_c$ and rotation angularvelocity $\omega$. we construct the region of stability of rwds ($j$-$m$ plane)taking into account the mass-shedding limit, inverse $\beta$-decay instability,and the boundary established by the turning-points of constant $j$ sequenceswhich separates stable from secularly unstable configurations. we found theminimum rotation periods $\sim 0.3$, 0.5, 0.7 and 2.2 seconds and maximummasses $\sim 1.500$, 1.474, 1.467, 1.202 $m_\odot$ for $^{4}$he, $^{12}$c,$^{16}$o, and $^{56}$fe wds respectively. by using the turning-point method wefound that rwds can indeed be axisymmetrically unstable and we give the rangeof wd parameters where it occurs. we also construct constant rest-massevolution tracks of rwds at fixed chemical composition and show that, byloosing angular momentum, sub-chandrasekhar rwds (mass smaller than maximumstatic one) can experience both spin-up and spin-down epochs depending on theirinitial mass and rotation period while, super-chandrasekhar rwds (mass largerthan maximum static one), only spin-up.

1205.3512	electron-positron plasma in grbs and in cosmology	electron-positron plasma is believed to play imporant role both in the earlyuniverse and in sources of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we focus on analogy anddifference between physical conditions of electron-positron plasma in the earlyuniverse and in sources of grbs. we discuss a) dynamical differences, namelythermal acceleration of the outflow in grb sources vs cosmologicaldeceleration; b) nuclear composition differences as synthesis of light elementsin the early universe and possible destruction of heavy elements in grb plasma;c) different physical conditions during last scattering of photons byelectrons. only during the acceleration phase of the optically thickelectron-positron plasma comoving observer may find it similar to the earlyuniverse. this similarity breaks down during the coasting phase. reprocessingof nuclear abundances may likely take place in grb sources. heavy nuclearelements are then destroyed, resulting mainly in protons with small admixtureof helium. unlike the primordial plasma which recombines to form neutralhydrogen, and emits the cosmic microwave background radiation, grb plasma doesnot cool down enough to recombine.

1305.1974	surface tension of the core-crust interface of neutron stars with global  charge neutrality	it has been shown recently that taking into account strong, weak,electromagnetic, and gravitational interactions, and fulfilling the globalcharge neutrality of the system, a transition layer will happen between thecore and crust of neutron stars, at the nuclear saturation density. we userelativistic mean field theory together with the thomas-fermi approximation tostudy the detailed structure of this transition layer and calculate its surfaceand coulomb energy. we find that the surface tension is proportional to apower-law function of the baryon number density in the core bulk region. wealso analyze the influence of the electron component and the gravitationalfield on the structure of the transition layer and the value of the surfacetension to compare and contrast with known phenomenological results in nuclearphysics. based on the above results we study the instability againstbohr-wheeler surface deformations in the case of neutron stars obeying globalcharge neutrality. assuming the core-crust transition at nuclear density$\rho_{core}\approx 2.7 * 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$, we find that the instabilitysets the upper limit to the crust density, $\rho_{crust}^{crit}\approx 1.2 *10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$. this result implies a nonzero lower limit to the maximumelectric field of the core-crust transition surface and makes inaccessible alimit of quasilocal charge neutrality in the limit $\rho_{crust}=\rho_{core}$.the general framework presented here can be also applied to study the stabilityof sharp phase transitions in hybrid stars as well as in strange stars, bothbare and with outer crust. the results of this work open the way to a moregeneral analysis of the stability of these transition surfaces, accounting forother effects such as gravitational binding, centrifugal repulsion, magneticfield induced by rotating electric field, and therefore magnetic dipole-dipoleinteractions.

1402.3691	gamow's calculation of the neutron star's critical mass revised	it has at times been indicated that landau introduced neutron stars in hisclassic paper of 1932. this is clearly impossible because the discovery of theneutron by chadwick was submitted more than one month after landau's work.therefore, and according to his calculations, what landau really did was tostudy white dwarfs, and the critical mass he obtained clearly matched the valuederived by stoner and later by chandrasekhar. the birth of the concept of aneutron star is still today unclear. clearly, in 1934, the work of baade andzwicky pointed to neutron stars as originating from supernovae. oppenheimer in1939 is also well known to have introduced general relativity (gr) in the studyof neutron stars. the aim of this note is to point out that the crucial ideafor treating the neutron star has been advanced in newtonian theory by gamow.however, this pioneering work was plagued by mistakes. the critical mass heshould have obtained was $6.9\,m_\odot$, not the one he declared, namely, $1.5\m_\odot$. probably, he was taken to this result by the work of landau on whitedwarfs. we revise gamow's calculation of the critical mass regardingcalculational and conceptual aspects and discuss whether it is justified toconsider it the first neutron-star critical mass. we compare gamow's approachto other early and modern approaches to the problem.

1403.7303	did gamma ray burst induce cambrian explosion?	one longstanding mystery in bio-evolution since darwin's time is the originof the cambrian explosion that happened around 540 million years ago (mya),where an extremely rapid increase of species occurred. here we suggest that anearby grb event ~500 parsecs away, which should occur about once per 5 gy,might have triggered the cambrian explosion. due to a relatively lower crosssection and the conservation of photon number in compton scattering, asubstantial fraction of the grb photons can reach the sea level and wouldinduce dna mutations in organisms protected by a shallow layer of water orsoil, thus expediting the bio-diversification. this possibility of inducinggenetic mutations is unique among all candidate sources for major incidents inthe history of bio-evolution. a possible evidence would be the anomalousabundance of certain nuclear isotopes with long half-lives transmuted by thegrb photons in geological records from the cambrian period. our notion alsoimposes constraints on the evolution of exoplanet organisms and the migrationof panspermia.

1405.7505	are the most super-massive dark compact objects harbored at the center  of dark matter halos?	essay selected for honorable mention 2014 by the gravity research foundation.  we study an isothermal system of semi-degenerate self-gravitating fermions ingeneral relativity (gr). the most general solutions present mass densityprofiles with a central degenerate compact core governed by quantum statisticsfollowed by an extended plateau, and ending in a power law behaviour $r^{-2}$.by fixing the fermion mass $m$ in the kev regime, the different solutionsdepending on the free parameters of the model: the degeneracy and temperatureparameters at the center, are systematically constructed along theone-parameter sequences of equilibrium configurations up to the critical point,which is represented by the maximum in a central density ($\rho_0$) vs. coremass ($m_c$) diagram. we show that for fully degenerate cores, theoppenheimer-volkoff (ov) mass limit $m_{c}^{cr}\propto m_{pl}^3/m^2$ isobtained, while instead for low degenerate cores, the critical core massincreases showing the temperature effects in a non linear way. the main resultof this work is that when applying this theory to model the distribution ofdark matter in big elliptical galaxies from miliparsec distance-scales up to$10^2$ kpc, we do not find any critical core-halo configuration ofself-gravitating fermions, able to explain both the most super-massive darkobject at their center together with the dm halo simultaneously.

1409.1473	hypercritical accretion, induced gravitational collapse, and  binary-driven hypernovae	the induced gravitational collapse (igc) paradigm has been successfullyapplied to the explanation of the concomitance of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) withsupernovae (sne) ic. the progenitor is a tight binary system composed by acarbon-oxygen (co) core and a neutron star (ns) companion. the explosion of thesn leads to hypercritical accretion onto the ns companion which reaches thecritical mass, hence inducing its gravitational collapse to a black hole (bh)with consequent emission of the grb. the first estimates of this process werebased on a simplified model of the binary parameters and thebondi-hoyle-lyttleton accretion rate. we present here the first full numericalsimulations of the igc phenomenon. we simulate the core-collapse and snexplosion of co stars to obtain the density and ejection velocity of the snejecta. we follow the hydrodynamic evolution of the accreting material fallinginto the bondi-hoyle surface of the ns all the way up to its incorporation tothe ns surface. the simulations go up to bh formation when the ns reaches thecritical mass. for appropriate binary parameters the igc occurs in shorttimescales (100-1000s) owing to the combined effective action of the photontrapping and the neutrino cooling near the ns surface. we also show that theigc scenario leads to a natural explanation for why grbs are associated only tosn ic with totally absent or very little helium.

1411.2621	on the magnetic field of pulsars with realistic neutron stars  configurations	we have recently developed a neutron star model fulfilling global and notlocal charge neutrality, both in the static and in the uniformly rotatingcases. the model is described by the coupled einstein-maxwell-thomas- fermi(emtf) equations, in which all fundamental interactions are accounted for inthe framework of general relativity and relativistic mean field theory. uniformrotation is introduced following the hartle's formalism. we show that the useof realistic parameters of rotating neutron stars obtained from numericalintegration of the self-consistent axisymmetric general relativistic equationsof equilibrium leads to values of the magnetic field and radiation efficiencyof pulsars very different from estimates based on fiducial parameters assuminga neutron star mass, m = 1.4 msun, radius r = 10 km, and moment of inertia, i =10^45 g cm^2. in addition, we compare and contrast the magnetic field inferredfrom the traditional newtonian rotating magnetic dipole model with respect tothe one obtained from its general relativistic analog which takes into dueaccount the effect of the finite size of the source. we apply theseconsiderations to the specific high-magnetic field pulsars class and show that,indeed, all these sources can be described as canonical pulsars driven by therotational energy of the neutron star, and with magnetic fields lower than thequantum critical field for any value of the neutron star mass.

1411.5316	thermal evolution of neutron stars with global and local neutrality	globally neutral neutron stars, obtained from the solution of the calledeinstein-maxwell-thomas-fermi equations that account for all the fundamentalinteractions, have been recently introduced. these configurations have a moregeneral character than the ones obtained with the traditionaltolman-oppenheimer-volkoff, which impose the condition of local chargeneutrality. the resulting configurations have a less massive and thinner crust,leading to a new mass-radius relation. signatures of this new structure of theneutron star on the thermal evolution might be a potential test for thistheory. we compute the cooling curves by integrating numerically the energybalance and transport equations in general relativity, for globally neutralneutron stars with crusts of different masses and sizes, according to thistheory for different core-crust transition interfaces. we compare and contrastour study with known results for local charge neutrality. we found a newbehavior for the relaxation time, depending upon the density at the base of thecrust, $\rho_{\rm crust}$. in particular, we find that the traditional increaseof the relaxation time with the crust thickness holds only for configurationswhose density of the base of the crust is greater than $\approx 5\times10^{13}$ g cm$^{-3}$. the reason for this is that neutron star crusts with verythin or absent inner crust have some neutrino emission process blocked whichkeep the crust hotter for longer times. therefore, accurate observations of thethermal relaxation phase of neutron stars might give crucial information on thecore-crust transition which may aid us in probing the innercomposition/structure of these objects.

1506.05926	fast rotating neutron stars with realistic nuclear matter equation of  state	we construct equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating neutron starsfor selected relativistic mean-field nuclear matter equations of state (eos).we compute in particular the gravitational mass ($m$), equatorial ($r_{\rmeq}$) and polar ($r_{\rm pol}$) radii, eccentricity, angular momentum ($j$),moment of inertia ($i$) and quadrupole moment ($m_2$) of neutron stars stableagainst mass-shedding and secular axisymmetric instability. by constructing theconstant frequency sequence $f=716$ hz of the fastest observed pulsar, psrj1748-2446ad, and constraining it to be within the stability region, we obtaina lower mass bound for the pulsar, $m_{\rm min}=[1.2$-$1.4] m_\odot$, for theeos employed. moreover we give a fitting formula relating the baryonic mass($m_b$) and gravitational mass of non-rotating neutron stars,$m_b/m_\odot=m/m_\odot+(13/200)(m/m_\odot)^2$ [or$m/m_\odot=m_b/m_\odot-(1/20)(m_b/m_\odot)^2$], which is independent on theeos. we also obtain a fitting formula, although not eos independent, relatingthe gravitational mass and the angular momentum of neutron stars along thesecular axisymmetric instability line for each eos. we compute the maximumvalue of the dimensionless angular momentum, $a/m\equiv c j/(g m^2)$ (or "kerrparameter"), $(a/m)_{\rm max}\approx 0.7$, found to be also independent on theeos. we compare and contrast then the quadrupole moment of rotating neutronstars with the one predicted by the kerr exterior solution for the same valuesof mass and angular momentum. finally we show that, although the massquadrupole moment of realistic neutron stars never reaches the kerr value, thelatter is closely approached from above at the maximum mass value, asphysically expected from the no-hair theorem. in particular the stiffer the eosis, the closer the kerr solution is approached.

astro-ph;0209072	irreducible mass and energetics of an electromagnetic black hole	the mass-energy formula for a black hole endowed with electromagneticstructure (embh) is clarified for the nonrotating case. the irreducible mass$m_{\mathrm{irr}}$ is found to be independent of the electromagnetic field andexplicitly expressable as a function of the rest mass, the gravitational energyand the kinetic energy of the collapsing matter at the horizon. theelectromagnetic energy is distributed throughout the entire region extendingfrom the horizon of the embh to infinity. we discuss two conceptually differentmechanisms of energy extraction occurring respectively in an embh withelectromagnetic fields smaller and larger than the critical field for vacuumpolarization. for a subcritical embh the energy extraction mechanism involves asequence of discrete elementary processes implying the decay of a particle intotwo oppositely charged particles. for a supercritical embh an alternativemechanism is at work involving an electron-positron plasma created by vacuumpolarization. the energetics of these mechanisms as well as the definition ofthe spatial regions in which thay can occur are given. the physicalimplementations of these ideas are outlined for ultrahigh energy cosmic raysuhecr) and gamma ray bursts (grbs).

astro-ph;0212376	energy extraction from gravitational collapse to static black holes	the mass--energy formula of black holes implies that up to 50% of the energycan be extracted from a static black hole. such a result is reexamined usingthe recently established analytic formulas for the collapse of a shell andexpression for the irreducible mass of a static black hole. it is shown thatthe efficiency of energy extraction process during the formation of the blackhole is linked in an essential way to the gravitational binding energy, theformation of the horizon and the reduction of the kinetic energy of implosion.here a maximum efficiency of 50% in the extraction of the mass energy is shownto be generally attainable in the collapse of a spherically symmetric shell:surprisingly this result holds as well in the two limiting cases of theschwarzschild and extreme reissner-nordstr\"{o}m space-times. moreover, theanalytic expression recently found for the implosion of a spherical shell ontoan already formed black hole leads to a new exact analytic expression for theenergy extraction which results in an efficiency strictly less than 100% forany physical implementable process. there appears to be no incompatibilitybetween general relativity and thermodynamics at this classical level.

astro-ph;0503476	the blackholic energy: long and short gamma-ray bursts (new perspectives  in physics and astrophysics from the theoretical understanding of gamma-ray  bursts, ii)	[...] we turn then to the theoretical developments in the short grbs: wefirst report some progress in the understanding the dynamical phase ofcollapse, the mass-energy formula and the extraction of blackholic energy whichhave been motivated by the analysis of the short grbs. in this context progresshas also been accomplished on establishing an absolute lower limit to theirreducible mass of the black hole as well as on some critical considerationsabout the relations of general relativity and the second law of thermodynamics.we recall how this last issue has been one of the most debated in theoreticalphysics in the past thirty years due to the work of bekenstein and hawking.following these conceptual progresses we analyze the vacuum polarizationprocess around an overcritical collapsing shell. we evidence the existence of aseparatrix and a dyadosphere trapping surface in the dynamics of theelectron-positron plasma generated during the process of gravitationalcollapse. we then analyze, using recent progress in the solution of thevlasov-boltzmann-maxwell system, the oscillation regime in the createdelectron-positron plasma and their rapid convergence to a thermalized spectrum.we conclude by making precise predictions for the spectra, the energy fluxesand characteristic time-scales of the radiation for short-bursts. if theprecise luminosity variation and spectral hardening of the radiation we havepredicted will be confirmed by observations of short-bursts, these systems willplay a major role as standard candles in cosmology. these considerations willalso be relevant for the analysis of the long-bursts when the baryonic mattercontribution will be taken into account.

astro-ph;0509079	joint constraints on the lepton asymmetry of the universe and neutrino  mass from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe	we use the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) data on the spectrumof cosmic microwave background anisotropies to put constraints on the presentamount of lepton asymmetry l, parameterized by the dimensionless chemicalpotential (also called degeneracy parameter) xi and on the effective number ofrelativistic particle species. we assume a flat cosmological model with threethermally distributed neutrino species having all the same mass and chemicalpotential, plus an additional amount of effectively massless exotic particlespecies. the extra energy density associated to these species is parameterizedthrough an effective number of additional species deltan_oth$. we find that0&lt;|xi|&lt;1.1 and correspondingly 0&lt;|l|&lt;0.9 at 2sigma, so that wmap data alonecannot firmly rule out scenarios with a large lepton number; moreover, a smallpreference for this kind of scenarios is actually found. we also discuss theeffect of the asymmetry on the estimation of other parameters and in particularof the neutrino mass. in the case of perfect lepton symmetry, we obtain thestandard results. when the amount of asymmetry is left free, we find \sum m_nu&lt; 3.6 ev at 2sigma. finally we study how the determination of |l| is affectedby the assumptions on deltan_oth. we find that lower values of the extra energydensity allow for larger values of the lepton asymmetry, effectively rulingout, at 2sigma level, lepton symmetric models with deltan_oth=0.

astro-ph;9810182	the dyadosphere of black holes and gamma-ray bursts	the "dyadosphere" has been defined (ruffini, preparata et al.) as the regionoutside the horizon of a black hole endowed with an electromagnetic field(abbreviated to embh for "electromagnetic black hole") where theelectromagnetic field exceeds the critical value, predicted by heisenberg &amp;euler for $e^+ e^-$ pair production. in a very short time ($\simo(\hbar/(mc^2))$), a very large number of pairs is created there. we here givelimits on the embh parameters leading to a dyadosphere for $10m_{\odot}$ and$10^5m_{\odot}$ embh's, and give as well the pair densities as functions of theradial coordinate. we here assume that the pairs reach thermodynamicequilibrium with a photon gas and estimate the average energy per pair as afunction of the embh mass. these data give the initial conditions for theanalysis of an enormous pair-electromagnetic-pulse or "p.e.m. pulse" whichnaturally leads to relativistic expansion. basic energy requirements for gammaray bursts (grb), including grb971214 recently observed at $z=3.4$, can beaccounted for by processes occurring in the dyadosphere. in this letter we donot address the problem of forming either the embh or the dyadosphere: weestablish some inequalities which must be satisfied during their formationprocess.

astro-ph;9907030	on the pair electromagnetic pulse of a black hole with electromagnetic  structure	we study the relativistically expanding electron-positron pair plasma formedby the process of vacuum polarization around an electromagnetic black hole(embh). such processes can occur for embh's with mass all the way up to $6\cdot10^5m_\odot$. beginning with a idealized model of a reissner-nordstrom embhwith charge to mass ratio $\xi=0.1$, numerical hydrodynamic calculations aremade to model the expansion of the pair-electromagnetic pulse (pem pulse) tothe point that the system is transparent to photons. three idealized specialrelativistic models have been compared and contrasted with the results of thenumerically integrated general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. one of thethree models has been validated: a pem pulse of constant thickness in thelaboratory frame is shown to be in excellent agreement with results of thegeneral relativistic hydrodynamic code. it is remarkable that this precisemodel, starting from the fundamental parameters of the embh, leads uniquely tothe explicit evaluation of the parameters of the pem pulse, including theenergy spectrum and the astrophysically unprecedented large lorentz factors (upto $6\cdot 10^3$ for a $10^3 m_{\odot}$ embh). the observed photon energy atthe peak of the photon spectrum at the moment of photon decoupling is shown torange from 0.1 mev to 4 mev as a function of the embh mass. correspondingly thetotal energy in photons is in the range of $10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ ergs,consistent with observed gamma-ray bursts. in these computations we neglect thepresence of baryonic matter which will be the subject of forthcomingpublications.

0810.4855	grb060614: a "fake" short grb from a merging binary system	(shortened) context: [...] grb060614 is the first nearby long duration grbclearly not associated to a bright ib/c supernova. moreover, its duration(t_{90} ~ 100s) makes it hardly classifiable as a short grb. it presents strongsimilarities with grb970228, the prototype of the new class of "fake" shortgrbs that appear to originate from the coalescence of binary neutron stars orwhite dwarfs spiraled out into the galactic halo. aims: within the "canonical"grb scenario based on the "fireshell" model, we test if grb060614 can be a"fake" or "disguised" short grb. [...] methods: we fit grb060614 light curvesin swift's bat (15-150kev) and xrt (0.2-10kev) energy bands. within thefireshell model, light curves are formed by two well defined and differentcomponents: the proper-grb (p-grb), emitted at the fireshell transparency, andthe extended afterglow, due to the interaction between the leftover acceleratedbaryonic and leptonic shell and the cbm. results: we determine the two freeparameters describing the grb source within the fireshell model. [...] a smallaverage cbm density [...] is inferred, typical of galactic halos. the firstspikelike emission is identified with the p-grb and the following prolongedemission with the extended afterglow peak.[...] conclusions: the anomalousgrb060614 finds a natural interpretation within our canonical grb scenario: itis a "disguised" short grb. [...] this result points to an old binary system,likely formed by a white dwarf and a neutron star, as the progenitor ofgrb060614 and well justify the absence of an associated sn ib/c. particularlyimportant for further studies of the final merging process are the temporalstructures in the p-grb down to 0.1s.

gr-qc;0012080	gravitating macroscopic media in general relativity	the problem of construction of a continuous (macroscopic) matter model for agiven point-like (microscopic) matter distribution in general relativity isformulated. the existing approaches are briefly reviewed and a physical analogywith the similar problem in classical macroscopic electrodynamics is pointedout. the procedure by szekeres in the linearized general relativity onminkowski background to construct a tensor of gravitational quadruplepolarization by applying kaufman's method of molecular moments for derivationof the polarization tensor in macroscopic electrodynamics and to derive anaveraged field operator by utilizing an analogy between the linearized bianchiidentities and maxwell equations, is analyzed. it is shown that the procedurehas some inconsistencies, in particular, (1) it has only provided the termslinear in perturbations for the averaged field operator which do not contributeinto the dynamics of the averaged field, and (2) the analogy betweenelectromagnetism and gravitation does break upon averaging. a macroscopicgravity approach in the perturbation theory up to the second order on aparticular background space-time taken to be a smooth weak gravitational fieldis applied to write down a system of macroscopic field equations: isaacson'sequations with a source incorporating the quadruple gravitational polarizationtensor, isaacson's energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves andenergy-momentum tensor of gravitational molecules and corresponding equationsof motion. a suitable set of material relations which relate all the tensors isproposed.

gr-qc;0609041	charged massive particle at rest in the field of a reissner-nordstr\"om  black hole	the interaction of a reissner-nordstr\"om black hole and a charged massiveparticle is studied in the framework of perturbation theory. the particlebackreaction is taken into account, studying the effect of general staticperturbations of the hole following the approach of zerilli. the solutions ofthe combined einstein-maxwell equations for both perturbed gravitational andelectromagnetic fields at first order of the perturbation are exactlyreconstructed by summing all multipoles, and are given explicit closed formexpressions. the existence of a singularity-free solution of theeinstein-maxwell system requires that the charge to mass ratios of the blackhole and of the particle satisfy an equilibrium condition which is in generaldependent on the separation between the two bodies. if the black hole isundercritically charged (i.e. its charge to mass ratio is less than one), theparticle must be overcritically charged, in the sense that the particle musthave a charge to mass ratio greater than one. if the charge to mass ratios ofthe black hole and of the particle are both equal to one (so that they are bothcritically charged, or "extreme"), the equilibrium can exist for any separationdistance, and the solution we find coincides with the linearization in thepresent context of the well known majumdar-papapetrou solution for two extremereissner-nordstr\"om black holes. in addition to these singularity-freesolutions, we also analyze the corresponding solution for the problem of amassive particle at rest near a schwarzschild black hole, exhibiting a strutsingularity on the axis between the two bodies. the relations between ourperturbative solutions and the corresponding exact two-body solutions belongingto the weyl class are also discussed.
