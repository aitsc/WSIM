Adaptive retrofit fault-tolerant flight controller design An adaptive retrofit fault-tolerant control algorithm against actuator faults suitable for flight control applications is developed in this paper which is based on the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) approach and adaptive approach. The algorithm is relatively simple and easy to implement, and assure that the control objective will be achieved despite the presence of the unknown loss of effectiveness and bounded disturbance of actuators. The adaptive retrofit fault-tolerant controller is composed of the normal controller and the additional controller which is added into the normal one in order to reduce the fault effect on the system. Performance of the resulting closed-loop system is demonstrated through the numerical simulations of the F-16 aircraft.
