0704.0009	the spitzer c2d survey of large, nearby, insterstellar clouds. ix. the  serpens yso population as observed with irac and mips	we discuss the results from the combined irac and mips c2d spitzer legacyobservations of the serpens star-forming region. in particular we present a setof criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, yso's, from theextensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. we then discussthe properties of the resulting high confidence set of yso's. we find 235 suchobjects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both irac and mips. anadditional set of 51 lower confidence yso's outside this area is identifiedfrom the mips data combined with 2mass photometry. we describe two sets ofresults, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties withthose of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modelingof the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. these objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks. we find that the luminosity function of yso's in serpens extendsdown to at least a few x .001 lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.the lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish yso's fromextra-galactic sources more than by the lack of yso's at very low luminosities.a spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved yso's aremore highly clustered than the later stages and that the backgroundextra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation functionas seen in other extra-galactic studies. we also present a table of matchesbetween several previous infrared and x-ray studies of the serpens ysopopulation and our spitzer data set.

0903.0636	far-infrared observations of the very low-luminosity embedded source  l1521f-irs in the taurus star-forming region	we investigate the environment of the very low-luminosity object l1521f irsusing data from the taurus spitzer legacy survey. the mips 160 micron imageshows both extended emission from the taurus cloud as well as emission frommultiple cold cores over a 1 x 2 deg region. analysis shows that the cloud dusttemperature is 14.2 +- 0.4 k and the extinction ratio is a_160/a_k = 0.010 +-0.001 up to a_v ~ 4 mag. we find kappa_160 = 0.23 +- 0.046 cm^2/g for thespecific opacity of the gas-dust mixture. therefore, for dust in the tauruscloud we find the 160 um opacity is significantly higher than that measured forthe diffuse ism, but not too different from dense cores, even at modestextinction values. furthermore, the 160 um image shows features that do notappear in the iras 100 um image. we identify six regions as cold cores, i.e.colder than 14.2 k, all of which have counterparts in extinction maps or c18omaps. we compare the effects of l1521f irs on its natal core and find there isno evidence for dust heating at 160 or 100 um by the embedded source. from theinfrared luminosity l_tir = 0.024 lo we find l_bol = 0.034 - 0.046l_o, thusconfirming the source's low-luminosity. comparison of l1521f irs withtheoretical simulations for the very early phases of star formation appears torule out the first core collapse phase. the evolutionary state appears similarto or younger than the class 0 phase, and the estimated mass is likely to besubstellar.

0908.2810	the spatially resolved star formation law from integral field  spectroscopy: virus-p observations of ngc 5194	we investigate the relation between the star formation rate surface density(sigma_sfr) and the mass surface density of gas (sigma_gas) in ngc 5194.virus-p integral field spectroscopy is used to measure h-alpha, h-beta[nii]6548,6584, and [sii]6717,6731 emission line fluxes for 735 regions ~170 pcin diameter, and derive extinction corrected sigma_sfrs. hi 21cm and co mapsare used to measure the hi and h_2 gas surface density for each region. wepresent a new method for fitting the star formation law (sfl), which includesthe intrinsic scatter in the relation as a free parameter, allows the inclusionof non-detections, and is free of the systematics involved in performing linearcorrelations over incomplete data in logarithmic space. we use the[sii]/h-alpha ratio to separate the h-alpha flux contribution from the diffuseionized gas (dig). after removing the dig, we measure a slope n=0.82+/-0.05,and an intrinsic scatter epsilon=0.43+/-0.02 dex for the molecular gas sfl. wealso measure a typical depletion timescale tau~2 gyr, in good agreement withbigiel et al. (2008). the hi density shows no correlation with the sfr, and thetotal gas sfl closely follows the molecular gas sfl. we assess the validity ofcorrections applied in narrow-band h-alpha measurements to overcome issuesrelated to continuum subtraction, underlying photospheric absorption, andcontamination by the [nii] doublet. the disagreement with the super-linearmolecular sfl measured by kennicutt et al. (2007) is due to differences in thefitting method. our results support a low and close to constant star formationefficiency (sfe = 1/tau) in the molecular ism. the data shows excellentagreement with the model of krumholz et al (2009). the large intrinsic scattermay imply the existence of other important parameters setting the sfr.

0912.2804	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores: jet and molecular outflow  associated with a yso in core a of l1251	a long infrared jet has been discovered by the spitzer c2d legacy program incore a of l1251. it is associated with a very embedded class 0 object with anaccretion luminosity of about 0.9 lsun derived by radiative transfer modelfitting to the observed sed. comparing the observed irac colors along theinfrared jet with those calculated from a model of an admixture of gas with apower-law temperature distribution indicates that the jet is possibly createdby a paraboloidal bow shock propagating into the ambient medium of n(h_2)=10^5cm^{-3}. in addition, the variation of the power-law index along the jetsuggests that the portion of hot gas decreases with distance from the jetengine. the molecular outflow in this region has been mapped for the first timeusing co data. from the calculated outflow momentum flux, a very strong lowerlimit to the average accretion luminosity is 3.6 sin i/cos^3 i lsun, indicativeof a decrease in the accretion rate with time.

0912.3819	fragmentation and evolution of molecular clouds. ii: the effect of dust  heating	we investigate the effect of heating by luminosity sources in a simulation ofclustered star formation. our heating method involves a simplified continuumradiative transfer method that calculates the dust temperature. the gastemperature is set by the dust temperature. we present the results of foursimulations, two simulations assume an isothermal equation of state and the twoother simulations include dust heating. we investigate two mass regimes, i.e.,84 msun and 671 msun, using these two different energetics algorithms. the massfunctions for the isothermal simulations and simulations which include dustheating are drastically different. in the isothermal simulation, we do not formany objects with masses above 1 msun. however, the simulation with dustheating, while missing some of the low-mass objects, forms high-mass objects(~20 msun) which have a distribution similar to the salpeter imf. the envelopedensity profiles around the stars formed in our simulation match observedvalues around isolated, low-mass star-forming cores. we find the accretionrates to be highly variable and, on average, increasing with final stellarmass. by including radiative feedback from stars in a cluster-scale simulation,we have determined that it is a very important effect which drastically affectsthe mass function and yields important insights into the formation of massivestars.

0912.5229	evolutionary signatures in the formation of low-mass protostars. ii.  towards reconciling models and observations	a long-standing problem in low-mass star formation is the "luminosityproblem," whereby protostars are underluminous compared to the accretionluminosity expected both from theoretical collapse calculations and argumentsbased on the minimum accretion rate necessary to form a star within theembedded phase duration. motivated by this luminosity problem, we present a setof evolutionary models describing the collapse of low-mass, dense cores intoprotostars, using the young &amp; evans (2005) model as our starting point. wecalculate the radiative transfer of the collapsing cores throughout the fullduration of the collapse in two dimensions. from the resulting spectral energydistributions, we calculate standard observational signatures to directlycompare to observations. we incorporate several modifications and additions tothe original young &amp; evans model in an effort to better match observations withmodel predictions. we find that scattering, 2-d geometry, mass-loss, andoutflow cavities all affect the model predictions, as expected, but noneresolve the luminosity problem. a cycle of episodic mass accretion, however,can resolve this problem and bring the model predictions into better agreementwith observations. standard assumptions about the interplay between massaccretion and mass loss in our model give star formation efficienciesconsistent with recent observations that compare the core mass function (cmf)and stellar initial mass function (imf). the combination of outflow cavitiesand episodic mass accretion reduce the connection between observational classand physical stage to the point where neither of the two common observationalsignatures (bolometric temperature and ratio of bolometric to submillimeterluminosity) can be considered reliable indicators of physical stage.

1001.4825	the nature of transition circumstellar disks i. the ophiuchus molecular  cloud	we have obtained millimeter wavelength photometry, high-resolution opticalspectroscopy and adaptive optics near-infrared imaging for a sample of 26spitzer-selected transition circumstellar disks. all of our targets are locatedin the ophiuchus molecular cloud (d ~125 pc) and have spectral energydistributions (seds) suggesting the presence of inner opacity holes. we usethese ground-based data to estimate the disk mass, multiplicity, and accretionrate for each object in our sample in order to investigate the mechanismspotentially responsible for their inner holes. we find that transition disksare a heterogeneous group of objects, with disk masses ranging from &lt; 0.6 to 40m_jup and accretion rates ranging from &lt;1e-11 1e-7 m_solar/yr, but most tend tohave much lower masses and accretion rates than "full disks" (i.e., diskswithout opacity holes). eight of our targets have stellar companions: 6 of themare binaries and the other 2 are triple systems. in four cases, the stellarcompanions are close enough to suspect they are responsible for the inferredinner holes. we find that 9 of our 26 targets have low disk mass (&lt; 2.5 m_jup)and negligible accretion (&lt; 1e-11) m_solar/yr, and are thus consistent withphotoevaporating (or photoevaporated) disks. four of these 9 non-accretingobjects have fractional disk luminosities &lt; 1e-3 and could already be in adebris disk stage. seventeen of our transition disks are accreting. thirteen ofthese accreting objects are consistent with grain growth. the remaining 4accreting objects have seds suggesting the presence of sharp inner holes, andthus are excellent candidates for harboring giant planets.

1005.2225	the c2d spitzer spectroscopic survey of ices around low-mass young  stellar objects. iv. nh3 and ch3oh	nh3 and ch3oh are key molecules in astrochemical networks leading to theformation of more complex n- and o-bearing molecules, such as ch3cn andhcooch3. despite a number of recent studies, little is known about theirabundances in the solid state. (...) in this work, we investigate the ~ 8-10micron region in the spitzer irs (infrared spectrograph) spectra of 41 low-massyoung stellar objects (ysos). these data are part of a survey of interstellarices in a sample of low-mass ysos studied in earlier papers in this series. weused both an empirical and a local continuum method to correct for thecontribution from the 10 micron silicate absorption in the recorded spectra. inaddition, we conducted a systematic laboratory study of nh3- andch3oh-containing ices to help interpret the astronomical spectra. we clearlydetect a feature at ~9 micron in 24 low-mass ysos. within the uncertainty incontinuum determination, we identify this feature with the nh3 nu_2 umbrellamode, and derive abundances with respect to water between ~2 and 15%.simultaneously, we also revisited the case of ch3oh ice by studying the nu_4c-o stretch mode of this molecule at ~9.7 micron in 16 objects, yieldingabundances consistent with those derived by boogert et al. 2008 (hereafterpaper i) based on a simultaneous 9.75 and 3.53 micron data analysis. our studyindicates that nh3 is present primarily in h2o-rich ices, but that in somecases, such ices are insufficient to explain the observed narrow fwhm. thelaboratory data point to ch3oh being in an almost pure methanol ice, or mixedmainly with co or co2, consistent with its formation through hydrogenation ongrains. finally, we use our derived nh3 abundances in combination withpreviously published abundances of other solid n-bearing species to find thatup to 10-20 % of nitrogen is locked up in known ices.

[s i] isobserved uniquely toward truly embedded sources and not toward disks. on theother hand hot (tex&gt;700 k) h2, observed primarily through the s(4) line, and[ne ii] emission is seen mostly in the compact component. [fe ii] and [si ii]lines are observed in both spatial components. hot h2o emission is found in thecompact component of some sources. the observed emission on &gt;=1000 au scales ischaracteristic of pdr emission and likely originates in the outflow cavities inthe remnant envelope created by the stellar wind and jets from the embeddedyoung stars. weak shocks along the outflow wall can also contribute. thecompact emission is likely of mixed origin, comprised of optically thickcircumstellar disk and/or jet/outflow emission from the protostellar object.

1008.2428	a spitzer c2d legacy survey to identify and characterize disks with  inner dust holes	understanding how disks dissipate is essential to studies of planetformation. however, identifying exactly how dust and gas dissipates iscomplicated due to difficulty in finding objects clearly in the transition oflosing their surrounding material. we use spitzer irs spectra to examine 35photometrically-selected candidate cold disks (disks with large inner dustholes). the infrared spectra are supplemented with optical spectra to determinestellar and accretion properties and 1.3mm photometry to measure disk masses.based on detailed sed modeling, we identify 15 new cold disks. the remaining 20objects have irs spectra that are consistent with disks without holes, disksthat are observed close to edge-on, or stars with background emission. based onthese results, we determine reliable criteria for identifying disks with innerholes from spitzer photometry and examine criteria already in the literature.applying these criteria to the c2d surveyed star-forming regions gives afrequency of such objects of at least 4% and most likely of order 12% of theyso population identified by spitzer.  we also examine the properties of these new cold disks in combination withcold disks from the literature. hole sizes in this sample are generally smallerthan for previously discovered disks and reflect a distribution in betteragreement with exoplanet orbit radii. we find correlations between hole sizeand both disk and stellar masses. silicate features, including crystallinefeatures, are present in the overwhelming majority of the sample although 10micron feature strength above the continuum declines for holes with radiilarger than ~7 au. in contrast, pahs are only detected in 2 out of 15 sources.only a quarter of the cold disk sample shows no signs of accretion, making itunlikely that photoevaporation is the dominant hole forming process in mostcases.

(2006, apj, 648, 491;paper i). the single-dish data of l1251b described here show very complexkinematics including infall, rotation and outflow motions, and theinterferometer data reveal these in greater detail. interferometer data of n2h+1-0 suggest a very rapidly rotating flattened envelope between two youngstellar objects, irs1 and irs2. also, interferometer data of co 2-1 resolve theoutflow associated with l1251b seen in single-dish maps into a few narrow andcompact components. furthermore, the high resolution data support recenttheoretical studies of molecular depletions and enhancements that accompany theformation of protostars within dense cores. beyond l1251b, single-dish data arealso presented of a dense core located ~150" to the east that, in paper i, wasdetected at 850 micron but has no associated point sources at near- andmid-infrared wavelengths. the relative brightness between molecules, which havedifferent chemical timescales, suggests it is less chemically evolved thanl1251b. this core may be a site for future star formation, however, since lineprofiles of hco+, cs, and hcn show asymmetry with a stronger blue peak, whichis interpreted as an infall signature.

1009.1621	the star formation rate and gas surface density relation in the milky  way: implications for extragalactic studies	we investigate the relation between star formation rate (sfr) and gas surfacedensities in galactic star forming regions using a sample of ysos and massiveclumps. our yso sample consists of objects located in 20 molecular clouds fromthe spitzer cores to disks and gould's belt surveys. we estimate the gassurface density (sigma_gas) from av maps and yso sfr surface densities(sigma_sfr) from the number of ysos, assuming a mean mass and lifetime. we alsodivide the clouds into contour levels of av, counting only the youngest class iand flat sed ysos. for a sample of massive star forming clumps, we derive sfrsfrom the infrared luminosity and use hcn gas maps to estimate sigma_gas. wefind that galactic clouds lie above the extragalactic relations (e.g.,kennicutt-schmidt law) by factors up to 17. cloud regions with high sigma_gaslie above extragalactic relations up to a factor of 54 and overlap with massiveclumps. we use 12co and 13co gas maps of the perseus and ophiuchus clouds toestimate sigma_gas and compare to sigma_gas from av maps. we find that 13co,underestimates the av-based mass by factors of 4-5. 12co may underestimate thetotal gas mass at sigma_gas &gt; 200 msun pc^-2 by &gt; 30%;however, this does notexplain the large discrepancy between galactic and extragalactic relations. wefind evidence for a threshold of star formation (sigma_th) at 129+-14 msunpc^-2. at sigma_gas &gt; sigma_th, the galactic relation is linear. a possiblereason for the difference between galactic and extragalactic relations is thatall the co-emitting gas, including sigma_gas below sigma_th, is measured inextragalactic studies. if the kennicutt-schmidt relation (sigma_sfrsigma_gas^1.4) and a linear relation between dense gas and star formation isassumed, the fraction of dense star forming gas (f_dense) increases assigma_gas^0.4. when sigma_gas reaches ~300sigma_th, f_dense is 1.

1011.0932	the bolocam galactic plane survey iv: 1.1 and 0.35 mm dust continuum  emission in the galactic center region	the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) data for a six square degree regionof the galactic plane containing the galactic center is analyzed and comparedto infrared and radio continuum data. the bgps 1.1 mm emission consists ofclumps interconnected by a network of fainter filaments surrounding cavities, afew of which are filled with diffuse near-ir emission indicating the presenceof warm dust or with radio continuum characteristic of hii regions or supernovaremnants. new 350 {\mu}m images of the environments of the two brightestregions, sgr a and b, are presented. sgr b2 is the brightest mm-emitting clumpin the central molecular zone and may be forming the closest analog to a superstar cluster in the galaxy. the central molecular zone (cmz) contains thehighest concentration of mm and sub-mm emitting dense clumps in the galaxy.most 1.1 mm features at positive longitudes are seen in silhouette against the3.6 to 24 {\mu}m background observed by the spitzer space telescope. however,only a few clumps at negative longitudes are seen in absorption, confirming thehypothesis that positive longitude clumps in the cmz tend to be on thenear-side of the galactic center, consistent with the suspected orientation ofthe central bar in our galaxy. some 1.1 mm cloud surfaces are seen in emissionat 8 {\mu}m, presumably due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). a~0.2\degree (~30 pc) diameter cavity and infrared bubble between l \approx0.0\degree and 0.2\degree surrounds the arches and quintuplet clusters and sgra. the bubble contains several clumpy dust filaments that point toward sgra\ast; its potential role in their formation is explored.

[fe i] is detected at ~10^-5-10^-4 l_sun, butno [s i] or [fe ii] is detected down to ~10^{-6} l_sun. the [fe i] detectionsindicate the presence of gas-rich disks with masses of &gt;~0.1 m_j. no h_2 0-0s(0) and s(1) disk emission is detected, except for s(1) toward one source.these data give upper limits on the warm (t~100-200k) gas mass of a few jovianmasses, consistent with recent t tauri disk models which include gas heating bystellar radiation. compact disk emission of hot (t&gt;~500k) gas is observedthrough the h_2 0-0 s(2) and/or s(3) lines toward ~8% of our sources. the linefluxes are, however, higher by more than an order of magnitude than thosepredicted by recent disk models, even when x-ray and excess uv radiation areincluded. similarly the [ne ii]/h_2 0-0 s(2) ratios for these sources are lowerthan predicted, consistent with the presence of an additional hot molecular gascomponent not included in current disk models. oblique shocks of stellar windsinteracting with the disk can explain many aspects of the hot gas emission, butare inconsistent with the non-detection of [s i] and [fe ii] lines.

1101.1067	the spitzer c2d survey of nearby dense cores xi : infrared and  submillimeter observations of cb130	we present new observations of the cb130 region, composed of three separatecores. using the \textit{spitzer space telescope} we detected a class 0 and aclass ii object in one of these, cb130-1. the observed photometric data from\textit{spitzer} and ground-based telescopes are used to establish the physicalparameters of the class 0 object. sed fitting with a radiative transfer modelshows that the luminosity of the class 0 object is 0.14 $-$ 0.16 l$_{\odot}$,which is a low luminosity for a protostellar object. in order to constrain thechemical characteristics of the core having the low luminosity object, wecompare our molecular line observations to models of lines including abundancevariations. we tested both ad hoc step function abundance models and a seriesof self-consistent chemical evolution models. in the chemical evolution models,we consider a continuous accretion model and an episodic accretion model toexplore how variable luminosity affects the chemistry. the step functionabundance models can match observed lines reasonably well. the best fittingchemical evolution model requires episodic accretion and the formation ofco$_2$ ice from co ice during the low luminosity periods. this process removesc from the gas phase, providing a much improved fit to the observed gas-phasemolecular lines and the co$_2$ ice absorption feature. based on the chemicalmodel result, the low luminosity of cb130-1 is explained better as a quiescentstage between episodic accretion bursts rather than being at the firsthydrostatic core stage.

1102.1032	a mid-infrared census of star formation activity in bolocam galactic  plane survey sources	we present the results of a search for mid-infrared signs of star formationactivity in the 1.1 mm sources in the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps). wehave correlated the bgps catalog with available mid-ir galactic plane catalogsbased on the spitzer space telescope glimpse legacy survey and the midcoursespace experiment (msx) galactic plane survey. we find that 44% (3,712 of 8,358)of the bgps sources contain at least one mid-ir source, including 2,457 of5,067 (49%) within the area where all surveys overlap (10 deg &lt; l &lt; 65 deg).accounting for chance alignments between the bgps and mid-ir sources, weconservatively estimate that 20% of the bpgs sources within the area where allsurveys overlap show signs of active star formation. we separate the bgpssources into four groups based on their probability of star formation activity.extended green objects (egos) and red msx sources (rms) make up the highestprobability group, while the lowest probability group is comprised of"starless" bgps sources which were not matched to any mid-ir sources. the mean1.1 mm flux of each group increases with increasing probability of active starformation. we also find that the "starless" bgps sources are the most compact,while the sources with the highest probability of star formation activity areon average more extended with large skirts of emission. a subsample of 280 bgpssources with known distances demonstrates that mass and mean h_2 column densityalso increase with probability of star formation activity.

1107.5825	the spitzer ice legacy: ice evolution from cores to protostars	ices regulate much of the chemistry during star formation and account for upto 80% of the available oxygen and carbon. in this paper, we use the spitzerc2d ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores andhigh-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present acoherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass starformation. the median ice composition h2o:co:co2:ch3oh:nh3:ch4:xcn is100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-massprotostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. in the low-masssample, the ice abundances with respect to h2o of ch4, nh3, and the componentof co2 mixed with h2o typically vary by &lt;25%, indicative of co-formation withh2o. in contrast, some co and co2 ice components, xcn and ch3oh vary by factors2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. the xcn band correlates with co,consistent with its ocn- identification. the origin(s) of the different levelsof ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories towarddifferent types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping,analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. based onthe analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation ofatoms, which results in a h2o-dominated ice. at later prestellar times, cofreezes out and variations in co freeze-out levels and the subsequent co-basedchemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. the lastimportant ice evolution stage is thermal and uv processing around protostars,resulting in co desorption, ice segregation and formation of complex organicmolecules. the distribution of cometary ice abundances are consistent with withthe idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin.

1107.5826	ices in starless and starforming cores	icy grain mantles are commonly observed through infrared spectroscopy towarddense clouds, cloud cores, protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks. upto 80% of the available oxygen, carbon and nitrogen are found in such ices; themost common ice constituents - h2o, co2 and co - are second in abundance onlyto h2 in many star forming regions. in addition to being a molecular reservoir,ice chemistry is responsible for much of the chemical evolution from h2o tocomplex, prebiotic molecules. combining the existing iso, spitzer, vlt and keckice data results in a large sample of ice sources (\sime80) that span allstages of star formation and a large range of protostellar luminosities(&lt;0.1-105 l\odot). here we summarize the different techniques that have beenapplied to mine this ice data set on information on typical ice compositions indifferent environments and what this implies about how ices form and evolveduring star and planet formation. the focus is on how to maximize the use ofempirical constraints from ice observations, followed by the application ofinformation from experiments and models. this strategy is used to identify icebands and to constrain which ices form early during cloud formation, which formlater in the prestellar core and which require protostellar heat and/or uvradiation to form. the utility of statistical tests, survival analysis and icemaps is highlighted; the latter directly reveals that the prestellar iceformation takes place in two phases, associated with h2o and co ice formation,respectively, and that most protostellar ice variation can be explained bydifferences in the prestellar co ice formation stage. finally, specialattention is paid to the difficulty of observing complex ices directly and howgas observations, experiments and models help in constraining this icechemistry stage.

(2011) recently reported the presence of a low-mass object candidate withinthe gap of the t cha disk, giving credence to the suspected planetary origin ofthis gap. here we present the herschel photometry (70, 160, 250, 350, and 500micron) of t cha from the "dust, ice, and gas in time" (digit) key program,which bridges the wavelength range between existing spitzer and millimeter dataand provide important constraints on the outer disk properties of thisextraordinary system. we model the entire optical to millimeter wavelengthspectral energy distribution (sed) of t cha (19 data points between 0.36 and3300 micron without any major gaps in wavelength coverage). t cha shows a steepspectral slope in the far-ir, which we find clearly favors models with outerdisks containing little or no dust beyond 40 au. the full sed can be modeledequally well with either an outer disk that is very compact (only a few auwide) or a much larger one that has a very steep surface density profile. thatis, t cha's outer disk seems to be either very small or very tenuous. bothscenarios suggest a highly unusual outer disk and have important but differentimplications for the nature of t cha. spatially resolved images are needed todistinguish between the two scenarios.

1208.5797	co2 ice toward low-luminosity, embedded protostars: evidence for  episodic mass accretion via chemical history	we present spitzer irs spectroscopy of co2 ice bending mode spectra at 15.2micrometer toward 19 young stellar objects with luminosity lower than 1 lsun (3with luminosity lower than 0.1 lsun). ice on dust grain surfaces can encode thehistory of heating because pure co2 ice forms only at elevated temperature, t &gt;20 k, and thus around protostars of higher luminosity. current internalluminosities of ysos with l &lt; 1 lsun do not provide the conditions needed toproduce pure co2 ice at radii where typical envelopes begin. the presence ofdetectable amounts of pure co2 ice would signify a higher past luminosity. manyof the spectra require a contribution from a pure, crystalline co2 component,traced by the presence of a characteristic band splitting in the 15.2micrometer bending mode. about half of the sources (9 out of 19) in the lowluminosity sample have evidence for pure co2 ice, and six of these havesignificant double-peaked features, which are very strong evidence of pure co2ice. the presence of the pure co2 ice component indicates that the dusttemperature, and hence luminosity of the central star/accretion disk system,must have been higher in the past. an episodic accretion scenario, in whichmixed co-co2 ice is converted to pure co2 ice during each high luminosityphase, explains the presence of pure co2 ice, the total amount of co2 ice, andthe observed residual c18o gas.

0711.4616	the c2d spitzer spectroscopic survey of ices around low-mass young  stellar objects ii: co2	this paper presents spitzer-irs spectroscopy of the co2 15.2 micron bendingmode toward a sample of 50 embedded low-mass stars in nearby star-formingclouds, taken mostly from the ``cores to disks (c2d)'' legacy program. theaverage abundance of solid co2 relative to water in low-mass protostellarenvelopes is 0.32 +/- 0.02, significantly higher than that found in quiescentmolecular clouds and in massive star forming regions. it is found that adecomposition of all the observed co2 bending mode profiles requires a minimumof five unique components. roughly 2/3 of the co2 ice is found in a water-richenvironment, while most of the remaining 1/3 is found in a co environment.ground-based observations of solid co toward a large subset of the c2d sampleare used to further constrain the co2:co component and suggest a model in whichlow-density clouds form the co2:h2o component and higher density clouds formthe co2:co ice during and after the freeze-out of gas-phase co. it is suggestedthat the subsequent evolution of the co2 and co profiles toward low-massprotostars, in particular the appearance of the splitting of the co2 bendingmode due to pure, crystalline co2, is first caused by distillation of theco2:co component through evaporation of co due to thermal processing to ~20-30k in the inner regions of infalling envelopes. the formation of pure co2 viasegregation from the h2o rich mantle may contribute to the band splitting athigher levels of thermal processing (&gt;50 k), but is harder to reconcile withthe physical structure of protostellar envelopes around low-luminosity objects.

1211.4510	the herschel digit survey of weak-line t tauri stars: implications for  disk evolution and dissipation	as part of the "dust, ice, and gas in time (digit)" herschel open time keyprogram, we present herschel photometry (at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 micron)of 31 weak-line t tauri star (wtts) candidates in order to investigate theevolutionary status of their circumstellar disks. thirteen stars in our samplehad circumstellar disks previously known from infrared observations at shorterwavelengths, while eighteen of them had no previous evidence for a disk. wedetect a total of 15 disks as all previously known disks are detected at one ormore herschel wavelengths and two additional disks are identified for the firsttime. the spectral energy distributions (seds) of our targets seem to trace thedissipation of the primordial disk and the transition to the debris diskregime. seven of the 15 disks appear to be optically thick primordial disks,including two objects with seds indistinguishable from those of typicalclassical t tauri stars, four objects that have significant deficit of excessemission at all ir wavelengths, and one "pre-transitional" object with a knowngap in the disk. despite their previous wtts classification, we find that theseven targets in our sample with optically thick disks show evidence foraccretion. the remaining eight disks have weaker ir excesses similar to thoseof optically thin debris disks. six of them are warm and show significant 24micron spitzer excesses, while the last two are newly identified colddebris-like disks with photospheric 24 micron fluxes, but significant excessemission at longer wavelengths. the herschel photometry also places strongconstraints on the non-detections, where systems with f70/f70,star &gt; 5 - 15 andl,disk/l,star &gt; 1xe-3 to 1xe-4 can be ruled out. we present preliminary modelsfor both the optically thick and optically thin disks and discuss our resultsin the context of the evolution and dissipation of circumstellar disks.

1301.4416	the luminosities of protostars in the spitzer c2d and gould belt legacy  clouds	motivated by the long-standing "luminosity problem" in low-mass starformation whereby protostars are underluminous compared to theoreticalexpectations, we identify 230 protostars in 18 molecular clouds observed by twospitzer space telescope legacy surveys of nearby star-forming regions. wecompile complete spectral energy distributions, calculate lbol for each source,and study the protostellar luminosity distribution. this distribution extendsover three orders of magnitude, from 0.01 lsun - 69 lsun, and has a mean andmedian of 4.3 lsun and 1.3 lsun, respectively. the distributions are verysimilar for class 0 and class i sources except for an excess of low luminosity(lbol &lt; 0.5 lsun) class i sources compared to class 0. 100 out of the 230protostars (43%) lack any available data in the far-infrared and submillimeter(70 um &lt; wavelength &lt; 850 um) and have lbol underestimated by factors of 2.5 onaverage, and up to factors of 8-10 in extreme cases. correcting theseunderestimates for each source individually once additional data becomesavailable will likely increase both the mean and median of the sample by 35% -40%. we discuss and compare our results to several recent theoretical studiesof protostellar luminosities and show that our new results do not invalidatethe conclusions of any of these studies. as these studies demonstrate thatthere is more than one plausible accretion scenario that can matchobservations, future attention is clearly needed. the better statisticsprovided by our increased dataset should aid such future work.

1303.1107	an old disk that can still form a planetary system	from the masses of planets orbiting our sun, and relative elementalabundances, it is estimated that at birth our solar system required a minimumdisk mass of ~0.01 solar masses within ~100 au of the star. the mainconstituent, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not emit from the disk massreservoir, so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emissionand lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide emission generally probesthe disk surface, while the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requiresknowledge of the grain properties and gas-to-dust mass ratio, which likelydiffer from their interstellar values. thus, mass estimates vary by orders ofmagnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3--10 myr) star tw hya, withestimates ranging from 0.0005 to 0.06 solar masses. here we report thedetection the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride, hd,toward tw hya. hd is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows thedistribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the totalmass. the hd detection, combined with existing observations and detailedmodels, implies a disk mass &gt;0.05 solar masses, enough to form a planetarysystem like our own.

1304.4597	the bolocam galactic plane survey. viii. a mid-infrared kinematic  distance discrimination method	we present a new distance estimation method for dust-continuum-identifiedmolecular cloud clumps. recent (sub-)millimeter galactic plane surveys havecataloged tens of thousands of these objects, but detailed study of theirphysical properties requires robust distance determinations. we derive bayesiandistance probability density functions (dpdfs) for 770 objects from the bolocamgalactic plane survey in the longitude range 7.5 &lt; l &lt; 65. the dpdf formalismis based on kinematic distances, and uses external data sets to place priordistance probabilities to resolve the kinematic distance ambiguity (kda) forobjects in the inner galaxy. we present priors related to the mid-infraredabsorption of dust in dense molecular regions and the galactic distribution ofmolecular gas. by assuming a numerical model of galactic mid-infrared emissionand simple radiative transfer, we match the morphology of millimeter thermaldust emission with mid-infrared absorption to compute a prior dpdf for distancediscrimination. selecting objects first from (sub-)millimeter source catalogsavoids a bias towards the darkest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) and extends therange of heliocentric distance and contrast range probed by mid-infraredextinction. we derive well-constrained kda resolutions for 618 molecular cloudclumps, with approximately 15% placed at or beyond the tangent distance.objects sufficiently dark to be cataloged as irdcs are generally placed at thenear kinematic distance. distance comparisons with galactic ring survey kdaresolutions yield a 92% agreement, and a galactic face-on view reveals sectionsof the sagittarius and scutum-centaurus arms. this kda-resolution method forlarge catalogs of sources through the combination of (sub-)millimeter andmid-infrared observations of molecular cloud clumps is generally applicable toother dust-continuum galactic plane surveys.

1304.7389	embedded protostars in the dust, ice, and gas in time (digit) key  program: continuum seds, and an inventory of characteristic far-infrared  lines from pacs spectroscopy	we present 50-210 um spectral scans of 30 class 0/i protostellar sources,obtained with herschel-pacs, and 0.5-1000 um seds, as part of the dust, ice,and gas in time (digit) key program. some sources exhibit up to 75 h2o linesranging in excitation energy from 100-2000 k, 12 transitions of oh, and corotational lines ranging from j=14-13 up to j=40-39. [o i] is detected in allbut one source in the entire sample; among the sources with detectable [o i]are two very low luminosity objects (vellos). the mean 63/145 um [o i] fluxratio is 17.2 +/- 9.2. the [o i] 63 um line correlates with lbol, but not withthe time-averaged outflow rate derived from low-j co maps. [c ii] emission isin general not local to the source. the sample lbol increased by 1.25 (1.06)and tbol decreased to 0.96 (0.96) of mean (median) values with the inclusion ofthe herschel data. most co rotational diagrams are characterized by twooptically thin components (&lt;n&gt; = (0.70 +/- 1.12) x 10^49 total particles). n_cocorrelates strongly with lbol, but neither trot nor n_co(warm)/n_co(hot)correlates with lbol, suggesting that the total excited gas is related to thecurrent source luminosity, but that the excitation is primarily determined bythe physics of the interaction (e.g., uv- heating/shocks). rotationaltemperatures for h2o (&lt;trot&gt; = 194 +/- 85 k) and oh (&lt;trot&gt; = 183 +/- 117 k)are generally lower than for co, and much of the scatter in the observationsabout the best fit is attributed to differences in excitation conditions andoptical depths amongst the detected lines.

1308.1578	digit survey of far-infrared lines from protoplanetary disks i	[abridged] we present far-infrared spectroscopic observations of pms starstaken with herschel/pacs as part of the digit key project. the sample includes22 herbig aebe and 8 t tauri sources. multiple atomic fine structure andmolecular lines are detected at the source position: [oi], [cii], co, oh, h_2o,ch^+. the most common feature is the [oi] 63micron line detected in almost allof the sources followed by oh. in contrast with co, oh is detected toward bothherbig aebe groups (flared and non-flared sources). an isothermal lte slabmodel fit to the oh lines indicates column densities of 10^13 &lt; n_oh &lt; 10^16cm^-2, emitting radii 15 &lt; r &lt; 100 au and excitation temperatures 100 &lt; t_ex &lt;400 k. the oh emission thus comes from a warm layer in the disk at intermediatestellar distances. warm h_2o emission is detected through multiple lines towardthe t tauri systems as 205, dg tau, s cra and rno 90 and three herbig aebesystems hd 104237, hd 142527, hd 163296 (through line stacking). overall,herbig aebe sources have higher oh/h_2o abundance ratios across the disk thando t tauri disks, from near- to far-infrared wavelengths. far-infrared ch^+emission is detected toward hd 100546 and hd 97048. the slab model suggestsmoderate excitation (t_ex ~ 100 k) and compact (r ~ 60 au) emission in the caseof hd 100546. the [cii] emission is spatially extended in all sources where theline is detected. this suggests that not all [cii] emission is associated withthe disk and that there is a substantial contribution from diffuse materialaround the young stars. the flux ratios of the atomic fine structure lines areconsistent with a disk origin for the oxygen lines for most of the sources.

1311.7657	warm gas towards young stellar objects in corona australis -  herschel/pacs observations from the digit key programme	the effects of external irradiation on the chemistry and physics in theprotostellar envelope around low-mass young stellar objects are poorlyunderstood. the corona australis star-forming region contains the r cra darkcloud, comprising several low-mass protostellar cores irradiated by anintermediate-mass young star. we study the effects on the warm gas and dust ina group of low-mass young stellar objects from the irradiation by the youngluminous herbig be star r cra. herschel/pacs far-infrared datacubes of twolow-mass star-forming regions in the r cra dark cloud are presented. thedistribution of co, oh, h2o, [c ii], [o i], and continuum emission isinvestigated. we have developed a deconvolution algorithm which we use todeconvolve the maps, separating the point-source emission from the extendedemission. we also construct rotational diagrams of the molecular species. bydeconvolution of the herschel data, we find large-scale (several thousand au)dust continuum and spectral line emission not associated with the pointsources. similar rotational temperatures are found for the warm co ($282\pm4$k), hot co ($890\pm84$ k), oh ($79\pm4$ k), and h2o ($197\pm7$ k) emission,respectively, in the point sources and the extended emission. the rotationaltemperatures are also similar to what is found in other more isolated cores.the extended dust continuum emission is found in two ridges similar in extentand temperature to molecular mm emission, indicative of external heating fromthe herbig be star r cra. our results show that a nearby luminous star does notincrease the molecular excitation temperatures in the warm gas around a youngstellar object (yso). however, the emission from photodissociation products ofh2o, such as oh and o, is enhanced in the warm gas associated with theseprotostars and their surroundings compared to similar objects not sufferingfrom external irradiation.

1312.5365	the star formation rate of molecular clouds	we review recent advances in the analytical and numerical modeling of thestar formation rate in molecular clouds and discuss the available observationalconstraints. we focus on molecular clouds as the fundamental star formationsites, rather than on the larger-scale processes that form the clouds and settheir properties. molecular clouds are shaped into a complex filamentarystructure by supersonic turbulence, with only a small fraction of the cloudmass channeled into collapsing protostars over a free-fall time of the system.in recent years, the physics of supersonic turbulence has been widely exploredwith computer simulations, leading to statistical models of this fragmentationprocess, and to the prediction of the star formation rate as a function offundamental physical parameters of molecular clouds, such as the virialparameter, the rms mach number, the compressive fraction of the turbulencedriver, and the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. infrared space telescopes,as well as ground-based observatories have provided unprecedented probes of thefilamentary structure of molecular clouds and the location of forming starswithin them.

0802.4351	the young population of the chamaeleon ii dark cloud	we discuss the results of the optical spectroscopic follow-up of pre-mainsequence (pms) objects and candidates selected in the chamaeleon ii dark cloudbased on data from the spitzer legacy survey "from molecular cores to planetforming disks" (c2d) and from previous surveys. our sample includes bothobjects with infrared excess selected according to c2d criteria and referred toas young stellar objects and other cloud members and candidates selected fromcomplementary optical and near-infrared data. we characterize the sample ofobjects by deriving their physical parameters. the vast majority of objectshave masses &lt; 1 solar mass and ages &lt; 6 myr. several of the pms objects andcandidates lie very close to or below the hydrogen-burning limit. a firstestimate of the slope of the initial mass function in cha ii is consistent withthat of other t associations. the star formation efficiency in the cloud (1-4%)is consistent with our own estimates for taurus and lupus, but significantlylower than for cha i. this might mean that different star-formation activitiesin the chamaeleon clouds may reflect a different history of star formation. wealso find that the cha ii cloud is turning some 8 solar masses into stars everymyr, which is less than the star formation rate in the other c2d clouds.however, the star formation rate is not steady and evidence is found that thestar formation in cha ii might have occurred very rapidly. the h_alpha emissionof the cha ii pms objects, as well as possible correlations between theirstellar and disk properties, are also investigated.

0803.1504	the spitzer c2d survey of large, nearby, interstellar clouds. xi. lupus  observed with irac and mips	we present c2d spitzer/irac observations of the lupus i, iii and iv darkclouds and discuss them in combination with optical and near-infrared and c2dmips data. with the spitzer data, the new sample contains 159 stars, 4 timeslarger than the previous one. it is dominated by low- and very-low mass starsand it is complete down to m $\approx$ 0.1m$_\odot$. we find 30-40 % binarieswith separations between 100 to 2000 au with no apparent effect in the diskproperties of the members. a large majority of the objects are class ii orclass iii objects, with only 20 (12%) of class i or flat spectrum sources. thedisk sample is complete down to ``debris''-like systems in stars as small as m$\approx$ 0.2 m$_\odot$ and includes sub-stellar objects with larger irexcesses. the disk fraction in lupus is 70 -- 80%, consistent with an age of 1-- 2 myr. however, the young population contains 20% optically thick accretiondisks and 40% relatively less flared disks. a growing variety of inner diskstructures is found for larger inner disk clearings for equal disk masses.lupus iii is the most centrally populated and rich, followed by lupus i with afilamentary structure and by lupus iv, where a very high density core withlittle star-formation activity has been found. we estimate star formation ratesin lupus of 2 -- 10 m$_\odot$ myr$^{-1}$ and star formation efficiencies of afew percent, apparently correlated with the associated cloud masses.

1407.3033	herschel key program, "dust, ice, and gas in time" (digit): the origin  of molecular and atomic emission in low-mass protostars in taurus	six low-mass embedded sources (l1489, l1551-irs5, tmr1, tmc1-a, l1527, andtmc1) in taurus have been observed with herschel-pacs to cover the fullspectrum from 50 to 210 $\mu$m as part of the herschel key program, "dust, ice,and gas in time (digit)". the relatively low intensity of the interstellarradiation field surrounding taurus minimizes contamination of the [c ii]emission associated with the sources by diffuse emission from the cloudsurface, allowing study of the [c ii] emission from the source. in severalsources, the [c ii] emission is distributed along the outflow, as is the [o i]emission. the atomic line luminosities correlate well with each other, as dothe molecular lines, but the atomic and molecular lines correlate poorly. therelative contribution of co to the total gas cooling is constant at $\sim$30 %,while the cooling fraction by h$_2$o varies from source to source, suggestingdifferent shock properties resulting in different photodissociation levels ofh$_2$o. the gas with a power-law temperature distribution with a moderatelyhigh density can reproduce the observed co fluxes, indicative of co close tolte. however, h$_2$o is mostly subthermally excited. l1551-irs5 is the mostluminous source ($l_{\rm bol}=24.5$ l$_\odot$) and the [o i] 63.1 $\mu$m lineaccounts for more than 70 % of its fir line luminosity, suggesting completephotodissociation of h$_2$o by a j-shock. in l1551-irs5, the central velocityshifts of the [o i] line, which exceed the wavelength calibration uncertainty($\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$) of pacs, are consistent with the known red- andblue-shifted outflow direction.

1409.5468	the star formation relation for regions in the galactic plane: the  effect of spatial resolution	we examined the relations between molecular gas surface density and starformation rate surface density in a 11 square degree region of the galacticplane. dust continuum at 1.1 mm from the bolocam galactic plane survey and 22micron emission from the wise all-sky survey were used as tracers of moleculargas and star formation rate, respectively, across galactic longitude of 31.5 &gt;l &gt; 20.5 and galactic latitude of 0.5 &gt; b &gt; -0.5. the relation was studied overa range of resolutions from 33 arcsecond to 20 arcminute by convolving imagesto larger scales. the pixel-by-pixel correlation between 1.1 mm and 22 micronincreases rapidly at small scales and levels off at the scale of 5 - 8arcminute. we studied the star formation relation based on pixel-by-pixelanalysis and 1.1 mm and 22 micron peaks analysis. the star formation relationwas found to be nearly linear with no significant changes in the form of therelation across all spatial scales and lie above the extragalactic relationfrom kennicutt (1998). the average gas depletion time is approximately 200 myrand does not change significantly at different scales, but the scatter in thedepletion time decreases as the scale increases.

1411.2591	the bolocam galactic plane survey. xii. distance catalog expansion using  kinematic isolation of dense molecular cloud structures with 13co(1-0)	we present an expanded distance catalog for 1,710 molecular cloud structuresidentified in the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) version 2, representinga nearly threefold increase over the previous bgps distance catalog. weadditionally present a new method for incorporating extant data sets into ourbayesian distance probability density function (dpdf) methodology. to augmentthe dense-gas tracers (e.g., hco+(3-2), nh3(1,1)) used to derive line-of-sightvelocities for kinematic distances, we utilize the galactic ring survey13co(1-0) data to morphologically extract velocities for bgps sources. theoutline of a bgps source is used to select a region of the grs 13co data, alongwith a reference region to subtract enveloping diffuse emission, to produce aline profile of 13co matched to the bgps source. for objects with a hco+(3-2)velocity, \approx 95% of the new 13co(1-0) velocities agree with that of thedense gas. a new prior dpdf for kinematic distance ambiguity (kda) resolution,based on a validated formalism for associating molecular cloud structures withknown objects from the literature, is presented. we demonstrate this priorusing catalogs of masers with trigonometric parallaxes and hii regions withrobust kda resolutions. the distance catalog presented here containswell-constrained distance estimates for 20% of bgps v2 sources, with typicaldistance uncertainties \lesssim 0.5 kpc. approximately 75% of thewell-constrained sources lie within 6 kpc of the sun, concentrated in thescutum-centarus arm. galactocentric positions of objects additionally trace outportions of the sagittarius, perseus, and outer arms in the first and secondgalactic quadrants, and we also find evidence for significant regions ofinterarm dense gas.

1412.6445	the gould belt very large array survey iv: the taurus-auriga complex	we present a multi-epoch radio study of the taurus-auriga star-formingcomplex made with the karl g. jansky very large array at frequencies of 4.5 ghzand 7.5 ghz. we detect a total of 610 sources, 59 of which are related to youngstellar objects and 18 to field stars. the properties of 56\% of the youngstars are compatible with non-thermal radio emission. we also show that theradio emission of more evolved young stellar objects tends to be morenon-thermal in origin and, in general, that their radio properties arecompatible with those found in other star forming regions. by comparing ourresults with previously reported x-ray observations, we notice that youngstellar objects in taurus-auriga follow a g\"{u}del-benz relation with$\kappa$=0.03, as we previously suggested for other regions of star formation.in general, young stellar objects in taurus-auriga and in all the previousstudied regions seem to follow this relation with a dispersion of $\sim1$ dex.finally, we propose that most of the remaining sources are related withextragalactic objects but provide a list of 46 unidentified radio sources whoseradio properties are compatible with a yso nature.

1503.02934	infrared and radio observations of a small group of protostellar objects  in the molecular core, l1251-c	we present a multi-wavelength observational study of a low-mass star-formingregion, l1251-c, with observational results at wavelengths from thenear-infrared to the millimeter. spitzer space telescope observations confirmedthat iras 22343+7501 is a small group of protostellar objects. the extendedemission to east-west direction with its intensity peak at the center of l1251ahas been detected at 350 and 850 micron with the cso and jcmt telescopes,tracing dense envelope materials around l1251a. the single-dish data from thekvn and trao telescopes show inconsistencies between the intensity peaks ofseveral molecular line emission and that of the continuum emission, suggestingcomplex distributions of molecular abundances around l1251a. the smainterferometer data, however, show intensity peaks of co 2-1 and 13co 2-1located at the position of irs 1, which is both the brightest source in iracimage and the weakest source in the 1.3 mm dust continuum map. irs 1 is thestrongest candidate for the driving source of the newly detected compact co 2-1outflow. over the whole region (14' by 14') of l125l-c, 3 class i and 16 classii sources have been detected, including three ysos in l1251a. a comparisonwith the average projected distance among 19 ysos in l1251-c and that among 3ysos in l1251a suggests l1251-c is an example of low-mass cluster formation,where protostellar objects are forming in a small group.

(2009), we classifysources as stage 0+i or bona fide protostars and find that 84% of detectedsources meet the criteria. we recommend a timescale for the evolution of stage0+i (embedded protostars) of 0.54 myr. we find significant correlations ofhco$^{+}$ integrated intensity with ${\alpha}$ and $t_{bol}$ but not with$l_{bol}$. the detection fraction increases smoothly as a function of${\alpha}$ and $l_{bol}$, while decreasing smoothly with $t_{bol}$. using thestage 0+i sources tightens the relation between protostars and high extinctionregions of the cloud; 89% of stage i sources lie in regions with $a_{v}$ &gt;8mag. class 0+i and flat sed ysos that are not detected in hco$^{+}$ have, onaverage, a factor of ~2 higher $t_{bol}$ and a factor of ~5 lower $l_{bol}$than ysos with hco$^{+}$ detections. we find less yso contamination, defined asthe number of undetected ysos divided by the total number surveyed, for sourceswith $t_{bol}\lesssim$ 600 k and $l_{bol} \gtrsim$ 1 $l_{\odot}$. thecontamination percentage is &gt;90% at $a_{v}$&lt; 4 mag and decreases as $a_{v}$increases.

1504.01388	the bolocam galactic plane survey. xiii. physical properties and mass  functions of dense molecular cloud structures	we use the distance probability density function (dpdf) formalism ofellsworth-bowers et al. (2013, 2015) to derive physical properties for thecollection of 1,710 bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps) version 2 sources withwell-constrained distance estimates. to account for malmquist bias, we estimatethat the present sample of bgps sources is 90% complete above 400 $m_\odot$ and50% complete above 70 $m_\odot$. the mass distributions for the entire sampleand astrophysically motivated subsets are generally fitted well by a lognormalfunction, with approximately power-law distributions at high mass. power-lawbehavior emerges more clearly when the sample population is narrowed inheliocentric distance (power-law index $\alpha = 2.0\pm0.1$ for sources nearerthan 6.5 kpc and $\alpha = 1.9\pm0.1$ for objects between 2 kpc and 10 kpc).the high-mass power-law indices are generally $1.85 \leq \alpha \leq 2.05$ forvarious subsamples of sources, intermediate between that of giant molecularclouds and the stellar initial mass function. the fit to the entire sampleyields a high-mass power-law $\hat{\alpha} = 1.94_{-0.10}^{+0.34}$. physicalproperties of bgps sources are consistent with large molecular cloud clumps orsmall molecular clouds, but the fractal nature of the dense interstellar mediummakes difficult the mapping of observational categories to the dominantphysical processes driving the observed structure. the face-on map of thegalactic disk's mass surface density based on bgps dense molecular cloudstructures reveals the high-mass star-forming regions w43, w49, and w51 asprominent mass concentrations in the first quadrant. furthermore, we present a0.25-kpc resolution map of the dense gas mass fraction across the galactic diskthat peaks around 5%.

1505.00847	evidence for decay of turbulence by mhd shocks in molecular clouds via  co emission	we utilize observations of sub-millimeter rotational transitions of co from aherschel cycle 2 open time program ("cops", pi: j. green) to identifypreviously predicted turbulent dissipation by magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) shocksin molecular clouds. we find evidence of the shocks expected for dissipation ofmhd turbulence in material not associated with any protostar. two models fitabout equally well: model 1 has a density of 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$, a shockvelocity of 3 km s$^{-1}$, and a magnetic field strength of 4 ${\mu}$g; model 2has a density of 10$^{3.5}$ cm$^{-3}$, a shock velocity of $2$ km s$^{-1}$, anda magnetic field strength of 8 $\mu$g. timescales for decay of turbulence inthis region are comparable to crossing times. transitions of co up to $j$ of 8,observed close to active sites of star formation, but not within outflows, cantrace turbulent dissipation of shocks stirred by formation processes. althoughthe transitions are difficult to detect at individual positions, ourherschel-spire survey of protostars provides a grid of spatially-distributedspectra within molecular clouds. we averaged all spatial positions away fromknown outflows near seven protostars. we find significant agreement withpredictions of models of turbulent dissipation in slightly denser (10$^{3.5}$cm$^{-3}$) material with a stronger magnetic field (24 $\mu$g) than in thegeneral molecular cloud.

0805.1075	the mass distribution and lifetime of prestellar cores in perseus,  serpens, and ophiuchus	we present an unbiased census of starless cores in perseus, serpens, andophiuchus, assembled by comparing large-scale bolocam 1.1 mm continuum emissionmaps with spitzer c2d surveys. we use the c2d catalogs to separate 108 starlessfrom 92 protostellar cores in the 1.1 mm core samples from enoch et al. (2006),young et al. (2006), and enoch et al. (2007). a comparison of these populationsreveals the initial conditions of the starless cores. starless cores in perseushave similar masses but larger sizes and lower densities on average thanprotostellar cores, with sizes that suggest density profiles substantiallyflatter than r^-2. by contrast, starless cores in serpens are compact and havelower masses than protostellar cores; future star formation will likely resultin lower mass objects than the currently forming protostars. comparison todynamical masses estimated from the nh_3 survey of perseus cores by rosolowskyet al. (2007) suggests that most of the starless cores are likely to begravitationally bound, and thus prestellar. the combined prestellar core massdistribution includes 108 cores and has a slope of -2.3+/-0.4 for m&gt;0.8 msun.this slope is consistent with recent measurements of the stellar initial massfunction, providing further evidence that stellar masses are directly linked tothe core formation process. we place a lower limit on the core-to-starefficiency of 25%. there are approximately equal numbers of prestellar andprotostellar cores in each cloud, thus the dense prestellar core lifetime mustbe similar to the lifetime of embedded protostars, or 4.5x10^5 years, with atotal uncertainty of a factor of two. such a short lifetime suggests a dynamic,rather than quasi-static, core evolution scenario, at least at the relativelyhigh mean densities (n&gt;2x10^4 cm^-3) to which we are sensitive.

1512.00020	infrared emission from tidal disruption events --- probing the pc-scale  dust content around galactic nuclei	recent uv-optical surveys have been successful in finding tidal disruptionevents (tdes), in which a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive blackhole (bh). these tdes release a huge amount of radiation energy ~ 10^51-52 erginto the circum-nuclear medium. if the medium is dusty, most of the radiationenergy will be absorbed by dust grains within ~ 1 pc from the bh andre-radiated in the infrared. we calculate the dust emission lightcurve from a1-d radiative transfer model, taking into account the time-dependent heating,cooling and sublimation of dust grains. we show that the dust emission peaks at3-10 microns and has typical luminosities ~ 10^42-43 erg/s (with sky coveringfactor of dusty clouds ranging from 0.1-1). this is detectable by currentgeneration of telescopes. in the near future, james webb space telescope willbe able to perform photometric and spectroscopic measurements, in whichsilicate or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) features may be found.  observations at rest-frame wavelength &gt; 2 microns have only been reportedfrom two tde candidates, sdss j0952+2143 and swift j1644+57. althoughconsistent with the dust emission from tdes, the mid-infrared fluxes of the twoevents may be from other sources. long-term monitoring is needed to draw a firmconclusion. we also point out two nearby tde candidates (assasn-14ae and -14li)where the dust emission may be currently detectable. the dust infrared emissioncan give a snapshot of the pc-scale dust content around weakly- or non-activegalactic nuclei, which is hard to probe otherwise.

astro-ph;0006183	tracing the mass during low-mass star formation. i. submillimeter  continuum observations	we have obtained 850 and 450 micron continuum maps of 21 low mass cores withsed's ranging from pre-protostellar to class i (18k &lt; tbol &lt; 370k), using scubaat the jcmt. in this paper we present the maps, radial intensity profiles, andphotometry. pre-protostellar cores do not have power-law intensity profiles,whereas the intensity profiles of class 0 and class i sources can be fittedwith power laws over a large range of radii. a substantial number of sourceshave companion sources within a few arcminutes (2 out of 5 pre-protostellarcores, 9 out of 16 class 0/i sources). the mean separation between sources is10800 au. the median separation is 18000 au including sources withoutcompanions as a lower limit. the mean value of the spectral index between 450and 850 microns is 2.8 +- 0.4, with ppcs having slightly lower spectral indices(2.5 +- 0.4). the mean mass of the sample, based on the dust emission in a 120arcsecond aperture, is 1.1 +- 0.9 solar masses. for the sources fitted bypower-law intensity distributions (i_nu(b)/i_nu(0) = (b/b_0) ^ m), the meanvalue of m is 1.52 +- 0.45 for class 0 and i sources at 850 microns and 1.44 +-0.25 at 450 microns. based on a simple analysis, assuming the emission is inthe rayleigh-jeans limit and that t_d(r) ~ r ^ {-0.4}, these values of mtranslate into power-law density distributions (n ~ r ^ {-p}) with p ~ 2.1.however, we show that this result may be changed by more careful considerationof effects such as beam size and shape, finite outer radii, more realistict_d(r), and failure of the rayleigh-jeans approximation.

astro-ph;0204024	tracing the mass during low-mass star formation. iii. models of the  submillimeter dust continuum emission from class 0 protostars	seven class 0 sources mapped with scuba at 850 and 450 micron are modeledusing a one dimensional radiative transfer code. the modeling takes intoaccount heating from an internal protostar, heating from the isrf, realisticbeam effects, and chopping to model the normalized intensity profile andspectral energy distribution. power law density models, n(r) ~ r^{-p}, fit allof the sources; best fit values are mostly p = 1.8 +/- 0.1, but two sourceswith aspherical emission contours have lower values (p ~ 1.1). including allsources, &lt;p&gt; = 1.63 +/- 0.33. based on studies of the sensitivity of thebest-fit p to variations in other input parameters, uncertainties in p for anenvelope model are \delta p = +/- 0.2. if an unresolved source (e.g., a disk)contributes 70% of the flux at the peak, p is lowered in this extreme case and\delta p = ^{+0.2}_{-0.6}. the models allow a determination of the internalluminosity (&lt;l_{int}&gt; = 4.0 \lsun) of the central protostar as well as acharacteristic dust temperature for mass determination (&lt;t_{iso}&gt; = 13.8 +/-2.4 k). we find that heating from the isrf strongly affects the shape of thedust temperature profile and the normalized intensity profile, but does notcontribute strongly to the overall bolometric luminosity of class 0 sources.there is little evidence for variation in the dust opacity as a function ofdistance from the central source. the data are well-fitted by dust opacitiesfor coagulated dust grains with ice mantles (ossenkopf &amp; henning 1994). thedensity profile from an inside-out collapse model (shu 1977) does not fit thedata well, unless the infall radius is set so small as to make the densitynearly a power-law.

astro-ph;0408091	evolution of chemistry and molecular line profile during protostellar  collapse	understanding the chemical evolution in star-forming cores is a necessarypre-condition to correctly assess physical conditions when using molecularemission. we follow the evolution of chemistry and molecular line profilesthrough the entire star formation process, including a self-consistenttreatment of dynamics, dust continuum radiative transfer, gas energetics,chemistry, molecular excitation, and line radiative transfer. in particular,the chemical code follows a gas parcel as it falls toward the center, passingthrough regimes of density, dust temperature, and gas temperature that arechanging both because of the motion of the parcel and the evolving luminosityof the central source. we combine a sequence of bonnor-ebert spheres and theinside-out collapse model to describe dynamics from the pre-protostellar stageto later stages. the overall structures of abundance profiles show complexbehavior that can be understood as interactions between freeze-out andevaporation of molecules. we find that the presence or absence of gas-phase cohas a tremendous effect on the less abundant species. in addition, the ambientradiation field and the grain properties have important effects on the chemicalevolution, and the variations in abundance have strong effects on the predictedemission line profiles. multi-transition and multi-position ob servations arenecessary to constrain the parameters and interpret observations correctly interms of physical conditions. good spatial and spectral resolution is alsoimportant in distinguishing evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0501676	constraining the structure of the non-spherical preprotostellar core  l1544	a series of self-consistent, three-dimensional continuum radiative transfermodels are constructed of the pre-protostellar core l1544, with the resultscompared with existing scuba and iso data. the source is well-fit by a prolatespheroid, having an ellipsoidal power-law density distribution of index m ~ 2(1.75 &lt; m &lt; 2.25) in to at least r ~ 1600au. for r&lt;1600 au, the data areconsistent with either an extension of the power law to smaller radii, or aflattened (bonner-ebert like) density distribtion. we can further constrain theoptical depth along the short axis at 1300um to be ~ 5e-3, the centralluminosity to be l &lt; 1e-3 solar luminosities, the long axis diameter d ~ 0.1pc, the axis ratio to be q ~ 2, and the external isrf to be similar to thatdefined by mathis, mezger, &amp; panagia (1983) to within 50 per cent. the outerdiameter and axis ratio may each be somewhat larger due to potential on-sourcechopping in the observations, and the projection of the long axis onto theplane of the sky. while these results are similar to those inferred directlyfrom observations or spherical modeling due to the source transparency atsubmillimeter wavelengths, we infer a smaller size, lower mass, and higheroptical depth / column density, exposed to a stronger external radiation fieldthan previously assumed. finally, we find that both the spectral energydistribution (sed) and surface brightness distribution are necessary toconstrain the source properties in this way.

astro-ph;0509036	evidence for j and h-band excess in classical t tauri stars and the  implications for disk structure and estimated ages	we argue that classical t tauri stars (ctts) possess significant non-photospheric excess in the j and h bands. we first show that normalizing thespectral energy distributions (seds) of ctts to the j-band leads to a poor fitof the optical fluxes, while normalizing the seds to the ic-band produces abetter fit to the optical bands and in many cases reveals the presence of aconsiderable excess at j and h. nir spectroscopic veiling measurements from theliterature support this result. we find that j and h-band excesses correlatewell with the k-band excess, and that the j-k and h-k colors of the excessemission are consistent with that of a black body at the dust sublimationtemperature (~ 1500-2000 k). we propose that this near-ir excess originates ata hot inner rim, analogous to those suggested to explain the near-ir bump inthe seds of herbig ae/be stars. to test our hypothesis, we use the modelpresented by dullemond et al. (2001) to fit the photometry data between 0.5 umand 24 um of 10 ctts associated with the chamaeleon ii molecular cloud. themodels that best fit the data are those where the inner radius of the disk islarger than expected for a rim in thermal equilibrium with the photosphericradiation field alone. in particular, we find that large inner rims arenecessary to account for the mid infrared fluxes (3.6-8.0 um) obtained by thespitzer space telescope. finally, we argue that deriving the stellarluminosities of ctts by making bolometric corrections to the j-band fluxessystematically overestimates these luminosities. the overestimated luminositiestranslate into underestimated ages when the stars are placed in the h-rdiagram. thus, the results presented herein have important implications for thedissipation timescale of inner accretion disks.

astro-ph;0511424	connecting dense gas tracers of star formation in our galaxy to high-z  star formation	observations have revealed prodigious amounts of star formation in starburstgalaxies as traced by dust and molecular emission, even at large redshifts.recent work shows that for both nearby spiral galaxies and distant starbursts,the global star formation rate, as indicated by the infrared luminosity, has atight and almost linear correlation with the amount of dense gas as traced bythe luminosity of hcn. our surveys of galactic dense cores in hcn 1-0 emissionshow that this correlation continues to a much smaller scale, with nearly thesame ratio of infrared luminosity to hcn luminosity found over 7-8 orders ofmagnitude in l_ir, with a lower cutoff around 10^{4.5} l_sun of infraredluminosity. the linear correlation suggests that we may understand distant starformation in terms of the known properties of local star-forming regions. boththe correlation and the luminosity cutoff can be explained if the basic unit ofstar formation in galaxies is a dense core, similar to those studied in ourgalaxy.

(2007). lastly,from our chi-squared maps we identify a region in perseus where the iracextinction law is anomalously high considering its column density. a steepernear-infrared extinction law than the one we have assumed may partially explainthe irac extinction law in this region.

astro-ph;9702171	new protostellar collapse candidates: an hco+ survey of the class 0  sources	we have observed 23 class 0 sources in the hco+ j=4-3 and 3-2 lines. the meanbolometric temperature of the 16 sources with well-determined values is 44 kand the mean luminosity is 5.7 l_sun, excluding two sources of considerablyhigher luminosity. nine sources, including three sources previously suggestedto be collapsing, have the correct (blue) spectral line asymmetry for infall inboth lines. three sources have the opposite (red) asymmetry in both lines, andone source, l1157, has a red asymmetry in hco+ j=4-3 and a blue asymmetry inj=3-2. the rest have no significant or consistent asymmetry. the h13co+ j=4-3and 3-2 lines were also observed to find the velocity of the ambient gas, andsources with an interesting line asymmetry were mapped. a monte carlo code wasused to produce an evolutionary sequence of collapsing cloud models of the hco+j=4-3 and 3-2 lines and to compare various diagnostics of the resulting lineprofiles. the same code was used to compare infall models to the observationsin one source, l1527. the results were consistent with previous collapsemodels. based on integrated intensity maps of the line peaks and wings, as wellas the velocity of the h13co+ line, we select six of the nine sources with ablue line asymmetry as good candidates for protostellar collapse. furtherevidence is needed to establish that infall is taking place. the hco+ spectraare not conclusive because bipolar outflows produce strong emission, which canconfuse the issue in any individual source. however, the predominance of blueasymmetries over red asymmetries is not naturally explained in outflow models,whereas it is expected in collapse models.

0809.4012	properties of the youngest protostars in perseus, serpens, and ophiuchus	we present an unbiased census of deeply embedded protostars in perseus,serpens, and ophiuchus, assembled by combining large-scale 1.1 mm bolocamcontinuum and spitzer legacy surveys. we identify protostellar candidates basedon their mid-infrared properties, correlate their positions with 1.1 mm corepositions, and construct well-sampled seds using our extensive wavelengthcoverage (lam=1.25-1100 micron). source classification based on the bolometrictemperature yields a total of 39 class 0 and 89 class i sources in the threecloud sample. we compare to protostellar evolutionary models using thebolometric temperature-luminosity diagram, finding a population of lowluminosity class i sources that are inconsistent with constant or monotonicallydecreasing mass accretion rates. this result argues strongly for episodicaccretion during the class i phase, with more than 50% of sources in a``sub-shu'' (dm/dt &lt; 1e-6 msun/yr) accretion state. average spectra arecompared to protostellar radiative transfer models, which match the observedspectra fairly well in stage 0, but predict too much near-ir and too littlemid-ir flux in stage i. finally, the relative number of class 0 and class isources are used to estimate the lifetime of the class 0 phase; the three cloudaverage yields a class 0 lifetime of 1.7e5 yr, ruling out an extremely rapidearly accretion phase. correcting photometry for extinction results in asomewhat shorter lifetime (1.1e5 yr). in ophiuchus, however, we find very fewclass 0 sources (n(class0)/n(classi)=0.1-0.2), similar to previous studies ofthat cloud. the observations suggest a consistent picture of nearly constantaverage accretion rate through the entire embedded phase, with accretionbecoming episodic by at least the class i stage, and possibly earlier.

0811.1059	the spitzer c2d legacy results: star formation rates and efficiencies;  evolution and lifetimes	(abridged) the c2d spitzer legacy project obtained images and photometry withboth irac and mips instruments for five large, nearby molecular clouds. thispaper combines information drawn from studies of individual clouds into acombined and updated statistical analysis of star formation rates andefficiencies, numbers and lifetimes for sed classes, and clustering properties.current star formation efficiencies range from 3% to 6%. taken together, thefive clouds are producing about 260 solar masses of stars per myr. the starformation surface density is more than an order of magnitude larger than wouldbe predicted from the kennicutt relation used in extragalactic studies.measured against the dense gas probed by the maps of dust continuum emission,the efficiencies are much higher, and the current stock of dense cores would beexhausted in 1.8 myr on average. the derived lifetime for the class i phase is0.44 to 0.54 myr, considerably longer than some estimates. similarly, thelifetime for the class 0 sed class, 0.10 to 0.16 myr, is longer than earlyestimates. the great majority (90%) of young stars lie within loose clusterswith at least 35 members and a stellar density of 1 solar mass per cubic pc.accretion at the sound speed from an isothermal sphere over the lifetimederived for the class i phase could build a star of about 0.25 solar masses,given an efficiency of 0.3. our data confirm and aggravate the "luminosityproblem" for protostars. our results strongly suggest that accretion is timevariable, with prolonged periods of very low accretion. based on a very simplemodel and this sample of sources, half the mass of a star would be accretedduring only 7% of the class i lifetime, as represented by the eight mostluminous objects.
