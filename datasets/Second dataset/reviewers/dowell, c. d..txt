0905.1240	structure of the outer layers of cool standard stars	context: among late-type red giants, an interesting change occurs in thestructure of the outer atmospheric layers as one moves to later spectral typesin the hertzsprung-russell diagram: a chromosphere is always present, but thecoronal emission diminishes and a cool massive wind steps in.  aims: where most studies have focussed on short-wavelength observations, thisarticle explores the influence of the chromosphere and the wind onlong-wavelength photometric measurements.  methods: the observational spectral energy distributions are compared withthe theoretical predictions of the marcs atmosphere models for a sample of 9 k-and m-giants. the discrepancies found are explained using basic models for fluxemission originating from a chromosphere or an ionized wind.  results: for 7 out of 9 sample stars, a clear flux excess is detected at(sub)millimeter and/or centimeter wavelengths. the precise start of the excessdepends upon the star under consideration. the flux at wavelengths shorter thanabout 1 mm is most likely dominated by an optically thick chromosphere, wherean optically thick ionized wind is the main flux contributor at longerwavelengths.  conclusions: although the optical to mid-infrared spectrum of the studied k-and m-giants is well represented by a radiative equilibrium atmospheric model,the presence of a chromosphere and/or ionized stellar wind at higher altitudesdominates the spectrum in the (sub)millimeter and centimeter wavelength ranges.the presence of a flux excess also has implications on the role of these starsas fiducial spectrophotometric calibrators in the (sub)millimeter andcentimeter wavelength range.

0906.1181	measurement of cosmic microwave background polarization power spectra  from two years of bicep data	background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization (bicep) is abolometric polarimeter designed to measure the inflationary b-mode polarizationof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) at degree angular scales. during threeseasons of observing at the south pole (2006 through 2008), bicep mapped ~2% ofthe sky chosen to be uniquely clean of polarized foreground emission. here wepresent initial results derived from a subset of the data acquired during thefirst two years. we present maps of temperature, stokes q and u, e and b modes,and associated angular power spectra. we demonstrate that the polarization dataare self-consistent by performing a series of jackknife tests. we studypotential systematic errors in detail and show that they are sub-dominant tothe statistical errors. we measure the e-mode angular power spectrum with highprecision at 21 &lt; ell &lt; 335, detecting for the first time the peak expected atell ~ 140. the measured e-mode spectrum is consistent with expectations from alcdm model, and the b-mode spectrum is consistent with zero. thetensor-to-scalar ratio derived from the b-mode spectrum is r = 0.03+0.31-0.26,or r &lt; 0.72 at 95% confidence, the first meaningful constraint on theinflationary gravitational wave background to come directly from cmb b-modepolarization.

0906.4069	characterization of the bicep telescope for high-precision cosmic  microwave background polarimetry	the bicep experiment was designed specifically to search for the signature ofinflationary gravitational waves in the polarization of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). using a novel small-aperture refractor and 49 pairs ofpolarization-sensitive bolometers, bicep has completed 3 years of successfulobservations at the south pole beginning in 2006 february. to constrain theamplitude of the inflationary b-mode polarization, which is expected to be atleast 7 orders of magnitude fainter than the 3 k cmb intensity, precise controlof systematic effects is essential. this paper describes the characterizationof potential systematic errors for the bicep experiment, supplementing acompanion paper on the initial cosmological results. using the analysispipelines for the experiment, we have simulated the impact of systematic errorson the b-mode polarization measurement. guided by these simulations, we haveestablished benchmarks for the characterization of critical instrumentalproperties including bolometer relative gains, beam mismatch, polarizationorientation, telescope pointing, sidelobes, thermal stability, and timestreamnoise model. a comparison of the benchmarks with the measured values shows thatwe have characterized the instrument adequately to ensure that systematicerrors do not limit bicep's 2-year results, and identifies which futurerefinements are likely necessary to probe inflationary b-mode polarization downto levels below a tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.1.

0907.3730	statistical assessment of shapes and magnetic field orientations in  molecular clouds through polarization observations	we present a novel statistical analysis aimed at deriving the intrinsicshapes and magnetic field orientations of molecular clouds using dust emissionand polarization observations by the hertz polarimeter. our observables are theaspect ratio of the projected plane-of-the-sky cloud image, and the anglebetween the mean direction of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magneticfield and the short axis of the cloud image. to overcome projection effects dueto the unknown orientation of the line-of-sight, we combine observations from24 clouds, assuming that line-of-sight orientations are random and all areequally probable. through a weighted least-squares analysis, we find that thebest-fit intrinsic cloud shape describing our sample is an oblate disk withonly small degrees of triaxiality. the best-fit intrinsic magnetic fieldorientation is close to the direction of the shortest cloud axis, with small(~24 deg) deviations toward the long/middle cloud axes. however, due to thesmall number of observed clouds, the power of our analysis to rejectalternative configurations is limited.

0907.3786	simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of sgr a* during 2007 april  1-11	we report the detection of variable emission from sgr a* in almost allwavelength bands (i.e. centimeter, millimeter, submillimeter, near-ir andx-rays) during a multi-wavelength observing campaign. three new moderate flaresare detected simultaneously in both near-ir and x-ray bands. the ratio of x-rayto near-ir flux in the flares is consistent with inverse compton scattering ofnear-ir photons by submillimeter emitting relativistic particles which followscaling relations obtained from size measurements of sgr a*. we also find thatthe flare statistics in near-ir wavelengths is consistent with the probabilityof flare emission being inversely proportional to the flux. at millimeterwavelengths, the presence of flare emission at 43 ghz (7mm) using vlba withmilli-arcsecond spatial resolution indicates the first direct evidence thathourly time scale flares are localized within the inner 30$\times$70schwarzschild radii of sgr a*. we also show several cross correlation plotsbetween near-ir, millimeter and submillimeter light curves that collectivelydemonstrate the presence of time delays between the peaks of emission up tothree hours. the evidence for time delays at millimeter and submillimeterwavelengths are consistent with the source of emission being optically thickinitially followed by a transition to an optically thin regime. in particular,there is an intriguing correlation between the optically thin near-ir and x-rayflare and optically thick radio flare at 43 ghz that occurred on 2007 april 4.this would be the first evidence of a radio flare emission at 43 ghz delayedwith respect to the near-ir and x-ray flare emission.

1004.0819	far-infrared properties of spitzer-selected luminous starbursts	we present sharc-2 350 micron data on 20 luminous z ~ 2 starbursts withs(1.2mm) &gt; 2 mjy from the spitzer-selected samples of lonsdale et al. andfiolet et al. all the sources were detected, with s(350um) &gt; 25 mjy for 18 ofthem. with the data, we determine precise dust temperatures and luminositiesfor these galaxies using both single-temperature fits and models with power-lawmass--temperature distributions. we derive appropriate formulae to use whenoptical depths are non-negligible. our models provide an excellent fit to the6um--2mm measurements of local starbursts. we find characteristicsingle-component temperatures t1 ~ 35.5+-2.2 k and integrated infrared (ir)luminosities around 10^(12.9+-0.1) lsun for the swire-selected sources.molecular gas masses are estimated at 4 x 10^(10) msun, assumingkappa(850um)=0.15 m^2/kg and a submillimeter-selected galaxy (smg)-likegas-to-dust mass ratio. the best-fit models imply &gt;~2 kpc emission scales. wealso note a tight correlation between rest-frame 1.4 ghz radio and irluminosities confirming star formation as the predominant power source. thefar-ir properties of our sample are indistinguishable from the purelysubmillimeter-selected populations from current surveys. we therefore concludethat our original selection criteria, based on mid-ir colors and 24 um fluxdensities, provides an effective means for the study of smgs at z ~ 1.5--2.5.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3820	the herschel lensing survey (hls): overview	the herschel lensing survey (hls) will conduct deep pacs and spire imaging of~40 massive clusters of galaxies. the strong gravitational lensing power ofthese clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, whichsets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the universe with herschel.here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major resultsfrom our science demonstration phase (sdp) observations of the bullet cluster(z=0.297). the sdp data are rich, allowing us to study not only the backgroundhigh-redshift galaxies (e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z=2.8and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. our preliminaryanalysis shows a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energydistributions (seds), indicating that we have much to learn with herschel aboutthe properties of galaxy seds. we have also detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect increment with the spire data. the success of this sdp programdemonstrates the great potential of the herschel lensing survey to produceexciting results in a variety of science areas.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1010.1308	occultation of the quiescent emission from sgr a* by ir flares	we have investigated the nature of flare emission from sgr a* duringmulti-wavelength observations of this source that took place in 2004, 2005 and2006. we present evidence for dimming of submm and radio flux during the peakof near-ir flares. this suggests that the variability of sgr a* across itswavelength spectrum is phenomenologically related. the model explaining thisnew behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically coolingplasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the backgroundquiescent emission from sgr a*. when a flare is launched, the plasma blob ismost compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emissionin radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. absorption in the observedlight curve of sgr a* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects oflower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescentbrightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. this implies thatplasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow orfurther out in the flow. the depth of the absorption being larger in submm thanin radio wavelengths implies that the intrinsic size of the quiescent emissionincreases with increasing wavelength which is consistent with previous sizemeasurements of sgr a*. lastly, we believe that occultation of the quiescentemission of sgr a* at radio/submm by ir flares can be used as a powerful toolto identify flare activity at its earliest phase of its evolution.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1103.0289	a millimeter-wave galactic plane survey with the bicep polarimeter	in addition to its potential to probe the inflationary cosmological paradigm,millimeter-wave polarimetry is a powerful tool for studying the milky waygalaxy's composition and magnetic field structure. towards this end, presentedhere are stokes i, q, and u maps of the galactic plane from the millimeter-wavepolarimeter bicep covering the galactic longitude range 260 - 340 degrees inthree atmospheric transmission windows centered on 100, 150, and 220 ghz. themaps sample an optical depth 1 &lt; av &lt; 30, and are consistent with previouscharacterizations of the galactic millimeter-wave frequency spectrum and thelarge-scale magnetic field structure permeating the interstellar medium.polarized emission is detected over the entire region within two degrees of thegalactic plane and indicates that the large-scale magnetic field is orientedparallel to the plane of the galaxy. an observed trend of decreasingpolarization fraction with increasing total intensity rules out the simplestmodel of a constant galactic magnetic field throughout the galaxy. includingwmap data in the analysis, the degree-scale frequency spectrum of galacticpolarization fraction is plotted between 23 and 220 ghz for the first time. agenerally increasing trend of polarization fraction with electromagneticfrequency is found, which varies from 0.5%-1.5%at frequencies below 50 ghz to2.5%-3.5%above 90 ghz. the bicep and wmap data are fit to a two-component(synchrotron and dust) model showing that the higher frequency bicep data arenecessary to tightly constrain the amplitude and spectral index of galacticdust. furthermore, the dust amplitude predicted by this two-component fit isconsistent with model predictions of dust emission in the bicep bands.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

(2010). we confirm both self-consistency of the polarization dataand consistency with the two-year results. we measure the angular power spectraat 21 &lt;= l &lt;= 335 and find that the ee spectrum is consistent with lambda colddark matter (lcdm) cosmology, with the first acoustic peak of the ee spectrumnow detected at 15sigma. the bb spectrum remains consistent with zero. fromb-modes only, we constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r = 0.03+0.27-0.23, orr &lt; 0.70 at 95% confidence level.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1312.7877	self-calibration of bicep1 three-year data and constraints on  astrophysical polarization rotation	cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarimeters aspire to measure the faint$b$-mode signature predicted to arise from inflationary gravitational waves.they also have the potential to constrain cosmic birefringence which wouldproduce non-zero expectation values for the cmb's $tb$ and $eb$ spectra.however, instrumental systematic effects can also cause these $tb$ and $eb$correlations to be non-zero. in particular, an overall miscalibration of thepolarization orientation of the detectors produces $tb$ and $eb$ spectra whichare degenerate with isotropic cosmological birefringence, while alsointroducing a small but predictable bias on the $bb$ spectrum. the \bicepthree-year spectra, which use our standard calibration of detector polarizationangles from a dielectric sheet, are consistent with a polarization rotation of$\alpha = -2.77^\circ \pm 0.86^\circ \text{(statistical)} \pm 1.3^\circ\text{(systematic)}$. we revise the estimate of systematic error on thepolarization rotation angle from the two-year analysis by comparing multiplecalibration methods. we investigate the polarization rotation for the \bicep100 ghz and 150 ghz bands separately to investigate theoretical models thatproduce frequency-dependent cosmic birefringence. we find no evidence in thedata supporting either these models or faraday rotation of the cmb polarizationby the milky way galaxy's magnetic field. if we assume that there is no cosmicbirefringence, we can use the $tb$ and $eb$ spectra to calibrate detectorpolarization orientations, thus reducing bias of the cosmological $b$-modespectrum from leaked $e$-modes due to possible polarization orientationmiscalibration. after applying this "self-calibration" process, we find thatthe upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreases slightly, from $r&lt;0.70$to $r&lt;0.65$ at $95\%$ confidence.

1403.3985	bicep2 i: detection of b-mode polarization at degree angular scales	(abridged for arxiv) we report results from the bicep2 experiment, a cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) polarimeter specifically designed to search for thesignal of inflationary gravitational waves in the b-mode power spectrum around$\ell\sim80$. the telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refractingoptical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transitionedge sensor 150 ghz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of$\approx300\mu\mathrm{k}_\mathrm{cmb}\sqrt{s}$. bicep2 observed from the southpole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. a low-foreground region of sky withan effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nk deg instokes $q$ and $u$. we find an excess of $b$-mode power over the baselensed-lcdm expectation in the range $30&lt; \ell&lt; 150$, inconsistent with thenull hypothesis at a significance of $&gt; 5\sigma$. through jackknife tests andsimulations we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than theobserved excess. we also examine a number of available models of polarized dustemission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power$\sim(5-10)\times$ smaller than the observed excess signal. however, thesemodels are not sufficiently constrained to exclude the possibility of dustemission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. cross correlatingbicep2 against 100 ghz maps from the bicep1 experiment, the excess signal isconfirmed and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of thecmb, disfavoring dust at $1.7\sigma$. the observed $b$-mode power spectrum iswell fit by a lensed-lcdm + tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalarratio $r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0\sigma$.accounting for the contribution of foreground dust will shift this valuedownward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.

1407.1882	blastbus electronics: general-purpose readout and control for  balloon-borne experiments	we present the second generation blastbus electronics. the primary purposesof this system are detector readout, attitude control, and cryogenichousekeeping, for balloon-borne telescopes. readout of neutron transmutationdoped germanium (ntd-ge) bolometers requires low noise and parallel acquisitionof hundreds of analog signals. controlling a telescope's attitude requires thecapability to interface to a wide variety of sensors and motors, and to usethem together in a fast, closed loop. to achieve these different goals, theblastbus system employs a flexible motherboard-daughterboard architecture. theprogrammable motherboard features a digital signal processor (dsp) andfield-programmable gate array (fpga), as well as slots for threedaughterboards. the daughterboards provide the interface to the outside world,with versions for analog to digital conversion, and optoisolated digitalinput/output. with the versatility afforded by this design, the blastbus alsofinds uses in cryogenic, thermometry, and power systems. for accurate timingcontrol to tie everything together, the system operates in a fully synchronousmanner. blastbus electronics have been successfully deployed to the south pole,and flown on stratospheric balloons.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.00643	bicep2 / keck array v: measurements of b-mode polarization at degree  angular scales and 150 ghz by the keck array	the keck array is a system of cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarimeters,each similar to the bicep2 experiment. in this paper we report results from the2012 and 2013 observing seasons, during which the keck array consisted of fivereceivers all operating in the same (150 ghz) frequency band and observingfield as bicep2. we again find an excess of b-mode power over thelensed-$\lambda$cdm expectation of $&gt; 5 \sigma$ in the range $30 &lt; \ell &lt; 150$and confirm that this is not due to systematics using jackknife tests andsimulations based on detailed calibration measurements. in map difference andspectral difference tests these new data are shown to be consistent withbicep2. finally, we combine the maps from the two experiments to produce finalq and u maps which have a depth of 57 nk deg (3.4 $\mu$k arcmin) over aneffective area of 400 deg$^2$ for an equivalent survey weight of 250,000$\mu$k$^{-2}$. the final bb band powers have noise uncertainty a factor of 2.3times better than the previous results, and a significance of detection ofexcess power of $&gt; 6\sigma$.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0501140	image of fomalhaut dust ring at 350 microns: relative column density map  shows pericenter-apocenter asymmetry	we have imaged the circumstellar disk of fomalhaut at 350 microns wavelength,using sharc ii at the caltech submillimeter observatory. the spatial resolutionof the raw images (9 arcsec) has been enhanced by a factor of three using thehires deconvolution procedure. we find that at this wavelength and signal tonoise ratio (~ 12), the observed morphology is that of a simple inclined ring(i ~ 70 deg), with little or no other apparent structure; this is the firstobservation that shows clearly the ring morphology of the disk. we havecombined our 350 micron data with spitzer space telescope images at 24, 70, and160 microns in order to estimate the 2-dimensional spatial variation ofrelative column density ("tau map") using our diskfit procedure. the tau map isbased on the following physical assumptions: (1) the wavelength variation ofopacity is the same throughout the disk, (2) the radial variation of dusttemperature is dictated by the energy balance of individual grains in thestellar radiation field, and (3) the vertical scale height of the disk followsa power-law radial variation. the results confirm the ring-like morphology, butalso show that the geometric center is displaced from the star by about 8 auand that the ring has an apocentric enhancement of approximately 14% inintegrated column density. if we interpret the displacement in terms ofelliptical orbital motion due to gravitational perturbation by an unseenplanet, then the implied forced eccentricity is ~ 0.06; dynamical modeling thenpredicts an apocentric density enhancement consistent with that inferred fromthe tau map.

astro-ph;0510787	a multi-wavelength study of sgr a*: the role of near-ir flares in  production of x-ray, soft $\gamma$-ray and sub-millimeter emission	(abridged) we describe highlights of the results of two observing campaignsin 2004 to investigate the correlation of flare activity in sgr a* in differentwavelength regimes, using a total of nine ground and space-based telescopes. wereport the detection of several new near-ir flares during the campaign based on{\it hst} observations. the level of near-ir flare activity can be as low as$\sim0.15$ mjy at 1.6 $\mu$m and continuous up to about 40% of the totalobserving time. using the nicmos instrument on the {\it hst}, the {\itxmm-newton} and cso observatories, we also detect simultaneous bright x-ray andnear-ir flare in which we observe for the first time correlated substructuresas well as simultaneous submillimeter and near-ir flaring. x-ray emission isarising from the population of near-ir-synchrotron-emitting relativisticparticles which scatter submillimeter seed photons within the inner 10schwarzschild radii of sgr a* up to x-ray energies. in addition, using theinverse compton scattering picture, we explain the high energy 20-120 kevemission from the direction toward sgr a*, and the lack of one-to-one x-raycounterparts to near-ir flares, by the variation of the magnetic field and thespectral index distributions of this population of nonthermal particles. inthis picture, the evidence for the variability of submillimeter emission duringa near-ir flare is produced by the low-energy component of the population ofparticles emitting synchrotron near-ir emission. based on the measurements ofthe duration of flares in near-ir and submillimeter wavelengths, we argue thatthe cooling could be due to adiabatic expansion with the implication that flareactivity may drive an outflow.

astro-ph;0604591	sharc-2 350 micron observations of distant submillimeter selected  galaxies	we present 350 micron observations of 15 chapman et al. submillimetergalaxies (smgs) with radio counterparts and optical redshifts. we detect 12 andobtain sensitive upper limits for three, providing direct, precise measurementsof their far-infrared luminosities and characteristic dust temperatures. withthese, we verify the linear radio--far-infrared correlation at redshifts of z ~1--3 and luminosities of 10^11--10^13 l_sun, with a power-law index of1.02+-0.12 and rms scatter of 0.12 dex. however, either the correlationconstant q or the dust emissivity index beta is lower than measured locally.the best fitting q ~ 2.14 is consistent with smgs being predominantly starbustgalaxies, without significant agn contribution, at far-infrared wavelengths.gas-to-dust mass ratios are estimated at 54+-13 (kappa_850 / 0.15 m^2 kg^-1),depending on the absoption efficiency kappa, with intrinsic dispersion ~40%around the mean value. dust temperatures consistent with 34.6+-3 k(beta/1.5)^-0.71, at z ~ 1.5--3.5, suggest that far-infrared photometricredshifts may be viable, and perhaps accurate to 10% &lt; dz/(1+z), for up to 80%of the smg population in this range, if the above temperature characterizes thefull range of smgs. however, observed temperature evolution of t_d ~ (1+z) isalso plausible and could result from selection effects. from the observedluminosity-temperature (l-t) relation, l ~ t_obs^(2.82+-0.29), we derivescaling relations for dust mass versus dust temperature, and we identifyexpressions to inter-relate the observed quantities. these suggest thatmeasurements at a single wavelength, in the far-infrared, submillimeter orradio wave bands, might constrain dust temperatures and far-infraredluminosities for most smgs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5--4.

(2005). wehave combined our submillimeter images with spitzer data at 70 microns toproduce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth (relative column density).these "tau maps" suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially inthree symmetrically-located concentrations. if so, then this structure could beunderstood in terms of the wyatt (2003) model in which planetesimals aretrapped in the mean motion resonances of a neptune-mass planet at 65 au,provided allowance is made for the spatial distribution of dust grains todiffer from that of the parent planetesimals. the peaks of the tau maps are, infact, located near the expected positions corresponding to the 4:3 resonance.if this identification is confirmed by future observations, it would resolve anambiguity with regard to the location of the planet.
