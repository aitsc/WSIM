0902.1802	intracluster medium entropy profiles for a chandra archival sample of  galaxy clusters	we present radial entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (icm) for acollection of 239 clusters taken from the chandra x-ray observatory's dataarchive. entropy is of great interest because it controls icm global propertiesand records the thermal history of a cluster. entropy is therefore a usefulquantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment andinvestigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. we find that most icmentropy profiles are well-fit by a model which is a power-law at large radiiand approaches a constant value at small radii: k(r) = k0 + k100(r/100 kpc),where k0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best fittingpower-law found at larger radii. we also show that the k0 distributions of boththe full archival sample and the primary hiflugcs sample of reiprich (2001) arebimodal with a distinct gap between k0 ~ 30 - 50 kev cm^2 and population peaksat k0 ~ 15 kev cm^2 and k0 ~ 150 kev cm^2. the effects of psf smearing andangular resolution on best-fit k0 values are investigated using mock chandraobservations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. we find that neitherof these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening wemeasure at small radii. the influence of profile curvature and number of radialbins on best-fit k0 is also considered, and we find no indication k0 issignificantly impacted by either. for completeness, we include previouslyunpublished optical spectroscopy of halpha and [n ii] emission lines discussedin cavagnolo et al. (2008a). all data and results associated with this work arepublicly available via the project web site.

1004.0529	star formation and uv colors of the brightest cluster galaxies in the  representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey	we present uv broadband photometry and optical emission-line measurements fora sample of 32 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in clusters of therepresentative xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess) with z =0.06-0.18. the rexcess clusters, chosen to study scaling relations in clustersof galaxies, have x-ray measurements of high quality. the trends of starformation and bcg colors with bcg and host properties can be investigated withthis sample. the uv photometry comes from the xmm optical monitor, supplementedby existing archival galex photometry. we detected h\alpha and forbidden lineemission in 7 (22%) of these bcgs, in optical spectra. all of the emission-linebcgs occupy clusters classified as cool cores, for an emission-line incidencerate of 70% for bcgs in cool core clusters. significant correlations betweenthe h\alpha equivalent widths, excess uv production in the bcg, and thepresence of dense, x-ray bright intracluster gas with a short cooling time areseen, including the fact that all of the h\alpha emitters inhabit systems withshort central cooling times and high central icm densities. estimates of thestar formation rates based on h\alpha and uv excesses are consistent with eachother in these 7 systems, ranging from 0.1-8 solar masses per year. theincidence of emission-line bcgs in the rexcess sample is intermediate, somewhatlower than in other x-ray selected samples (-35%), and somewhat higher than butstatistically consistent with optically selected, slightly lower redshift bcgsamples (-10-15%). the uv-optical colors (uvw1-r-4.7\pm0.3) of rexcess bcgswithout strong optical emission lines are consistent with those predicted fromtemplates and observations of ellipticals dominated by old stellar populations.we see no trend in uv-optical colors with optical luminosity, r-k color, x-raytemperature, redshift, or offset between x-ray centroid and x-ray peak (&lt;w&gt;).

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1006.3796	hst fuv observations of brightest cluster galaxies: the role of star  formation in cooling flows and bcg evolution	quillen et al. and o'dea et al. carried out a spitzer study of a sample of 62brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) from the rosat brightest cluster samplechosen based on their elevated h-alpha flux. we present hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys (acs) far ultraviolet (fuv) images of the ly-alphaand continuum emission of the luminous emission-line nebulae in 7 bcgs found tohave an infrared excess. we confirm that the bcgs are actively forming starssuggesting that the ir excess seen in these bcgs is indeed associated with starformation. the fuv continuum emission extends over a region of ~7-28 kpc(largest linear size) and even larger in ly-alpha. the young stellar populationrequired by the fuv observations would produce a significant fraction of theionizing photons required to power the emission line nebulae. star formationrates estimated from the fuv continuum range from ~3 to ~14 times lower thanthose estimated from the ir, however both the balmer decrement in the centralfew arcseconds and detection of co in most of these galaxies imply that thereare regions of high extinction that could have absorbed much of the fuvcontinuum. analysis of archival vla observations reveals compact radio sourcesin all 7 bcgs and kpc scale jets in abell 1835 and rxj 2129+00. the fourgalaxies with archival deep chandra observations exhibit asymmetric x-rayemission, the peaks of which are offset from the center of the bcgs by ~10 kpcon average. a low feedback state for the agn could allow increased condensationof the hot gas into the center of the galaxy and the feeding of star formation.

1010.0650	agn driven weather and multiphase gas in the core of the ngc 5044 galaxy  group	a deep chandra observation of the x-ray bright group, ngc 5044, shows thatthe central region of this group has been strongly perturbed by repeated agnoutbursts. these recent agn outbursts have produced many small x-ray cavities,cool filaments and cold fronts. we find a correlation between the coolest x-rayemitting gas and the morphology of the ha filaments. the ha filaments areoriented in the direction of the x-ray cavities, suggesting that the warm gasresponsible for the halpha emission originated near the center of ngc 5044 andwas dredged up behind the buoyant, agn-inflated x-ray cavities. a detailedspectroscopic analysis shows that the central region of ngc 5044 containsspatially varying amounts of multiphase gas. the regions with the mostinhomogeneous gas temperature distribution tend to correlate with the extended235 mhz and 610 mhz radio emission detected by the gmrt. this may result fromgas entrainment within the radio emitting plasma or mixing of differenttemperature gas in the regions surrounding the radio emitting plasma by agninduced turbulence. accounting for the effects of multiphase gas, we find thatthe abundance of heavy elements is fairly uniform within the central 100 kpc,with abundances of 60-80% solar for all elements except oxygen, which has asignificantly sub-solar abundance. in the absence of continued agn outbursts,the gas in the center of ngc 5044 should attain a more homogeneous distributionof gas temperature through the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy and heatconduction in approximately 10e8 yr. the presence of multiphase gas in ngc 5044indicates that the time between recent agn outbursts has been less thanapproximately 10e8 yr.

1011.0549	the mass-l_x relation for moderate luminosity x-ray clusters	we present measurements of the masses of a sample of 25 moderate x-rayluminosity clusters of galaxies from the 160 square degree rosat survey. themasses were obtained from a weak lensing analysis of deep f814w images obtainedusing the advanced camera for surveys (acs). we present an accurate empiricalcorrection for the effect of charge transfer (in)efficiency on the shapes offaint galaxies. a significant lensing signal is detected around most of theclusters. the lensing mass correlates tightly with the cluster richness. wemeasured the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between m_2500 and l_xand find the best fit power law slope and normalisation to be alpha=0.68+-0.07and m_x=(1.2+-0.12)10^14m_sun (for l_x=2x10^44 erg/s). these results agree wellwith a number of recent studies, but the normalisation is lower compared to thestudy of rykoff et al. (2008b). one explanation for this difference may be thefact that (sub)structures projected along the line-of-sight boost both thegalaxy counts and the lensing mass. such superpositions lead to an increasedmass at a given l_x when clusters are binned by richness.

1103.1410	pahs, ionized gas, and molecular hydrogen in brightest cluster galaxies  of cool core clusters of galaxies	we present measurements of 5-25 {\mu}m emission features of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) with strong optical emission lines in a sample of 9 cool-coreclusters of galaxies observed with the infrared spectrograph on board thespitzer space telescope. these systems provide a view of dusty molecular gasand star formation, surrounded by dense, x-ray emitting intracluster gas. pastwork has shown that bcgs in cool-core clusters may host powerful radio sources,luminous optical emission line systems, and excess uv, while bcgs in otherclusters never show this activity. in this sample, we detect polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), extremely luminous, rotationally-excitedmolecular hydrogen line emission, forbidden line emission from ionized gas ([neii] and [ne iii]), and infrared continuum emission from warm dust and coolstars. we show here that these bcgs exhibit more luminous forbidden neon and h2rotational line emission than star-forming galaxies with similar total infraredluminosities, as well as somewhat higher ratios of 70 {\mu}m / 24 {\mu}mluminosities. our analysis suggests that while star formation processesdominate the heating of the dust and pahs, a heating process consistent withsuprathermal electron heating from the hot gas, distinct from star formation,is heating the molecular gas and contributing to the heating of the ionized gasin the galaxies. the survival of pahs and dust suggests that dusty gas issomehow shielded from significant interaction with the x-ray gas.

1106.3328	cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): an overview	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) is a 524-orbitmulti-cycle treasury program to use the gravitational lensing properties of 25galaxy clusters to accurately constrain their mass distributions. the survey,described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree ofconcentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of cdm. theclash cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples ofspace-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimizedlensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores.specifically, twenty clash clusters are solely x-ray selected. the x-rayselected clusters are massive (kt &gt; 5 kev; 5 - 30 x 10^14 m_solar) and, in mostcases, dynamically relaxed. five additional clusters are included for theirlensing strength (einstein radii &gt; 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to furtherquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution darkmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnifiedhigh-redshift (z &gt; 7) galaxies. the high magnification, in some cases, providesangular resolutions unobtainable with any current uvoir facility and can yieldz &gt; 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. a total of 16broadband filters, spanning the near-uv to near-ir, are employed for each20-orbit campaign on each cluster. these data are used to measure precise(sigma_phz &lt; 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discoveredmultiply-lensed images per cluster. observations of each cluster are spreadover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for type iasupernovae at z &gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the darkenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch whenthe universe is matter dominated.

1108.2068	the fate of stellar mass loss in central cluster galaxies	star formation within the central galaxies of galaxy clusters is ofteninterpreted as being fueled by cooling of the hot intracluster medium. however,the star-forming gas is dusty, and spitzer spectra show that the dustproperties are similar to those in more normal star-forming environments, inwhich the dust has come from the winds of dying stars. here we consider whetherthe primary source of the star-forming gas in central cluster galaxies could benormal stellar mass loss. we show that the overall stellar mass-loss rate in alarge central galaxy (~4-8 solar masses per year) is at least as large as theobserved star-formation rates in all but the most extreme cases and must beincluded in any assessment of the gas-mass budget of a central cluster galaxy.we also present arguments suggesting that the gas shed by stars in galaxyclusters with high core pressures and short central cooling times may remaincool and distinct from its hot surroundings, thereby preserving the dust withinit.

1108.2757	herschel observations of the centaurus cluster - the dynamics of cold  gas in a cool core	brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in the cores of galaxy clusters havedistinctly different properties from other low redshift massive ellipticals.the majority of the bcgs in cool-core clusters show signs of active starformation. we present observations of ngc 4696, the bcg of the centaurus galaxycluster, at far-infrared (fir) wavelengths with the herschel space telescope.using the pacs spectrometer, we detect the two strongest coolants of theinterstellar medium, cii at 157.74 micron and oi at 63.18 micron, and inaddition nii at 121.90 micron. the cii emission is extended over a region of 7kpc with a similar spatial morphology and kinematics to the optical h-alphaemission. this has the profound implication that the optical hydrogenrecombination line, h-alpha, the optical forbidden lines, nii 6583 angstrom,the soft x-ray filaments and the far-infrared cii line all have the same energysource. we also detect dust emission using the pacs and spire photometers atall six wavebands. we perform a detailed spectral energy distribution fittingusing a two-component modified black-body function and find a cold 19 k dustcomponent with mass 1.6x10^6 solar mass and a warm 46 k dust component withmass 4.0x10^3 solar mass. the total fir luminosity between 8 micron and 1000micron is 7.5x10^8 solar luminosity, which using kennicutt relation yields alow star formation rate of 0.13 solar mass per yr. this value is consistentwith values derived from other tracers, such as ultraviolet emission. combiningthe spectroscopic and photometric results together with optical h-alpha, wemodel emitting clouds consisting of photodissociation regions (pdrs) adjacentto ionized regions. we show that in addition to old and young stellarpopulations, there is another source of energy, such as cosmic rays, shocks orreconnection diffusion, required to excite the h-alpha and cii filaments.

1201.3373	infrared and ultraviolet star formation in brightest cluster galaxies in  the accept sample	we present ir and uv photometry for a sample of brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs). the bcgs are from a heterogeneous but uniformly characterized sample,the archive of chandra cluster entropy profile tables (accept), of x-ray galaxyclusters from the chandra x-ray telescope archive with published gastemperature, density, and entropy profiles. we use archival galex, spitzer, and2mass observations to assemble spectral energy distributions (seds) and colorsfor bcgs. we find that while the seds of some bcgs follow the expectation ofred, dust-free old stellar populations, many exhibit signatures of recent starformation in the form of excess uv or mid-ir emission, or both. we establish amean near-uv to 2mass k color of 6.59 \pm 0.34 for quiescent bcgs. we use thismean color to quantify the uv excess associated with star formation in theactive bcgs. we use fits to a template of an evolved stellar population andlibrary of starburst models and mid-ir star formation relations to estimate theobscured star formation rates. many of the bcgs in x-ray clusters with lowcentral gas entropy exhibit enhanced uv (38%) and mid-ir emission (43%), abovethat expected from an old stellar population. these excesses are consistentwith on-going star formation activity in the bcg, star formation that appearsto be enabled by the presence of high density, x-ray emitting gas in the thecore of the cluster of galaxies. this hot, x-ray emitting gas may provide theenhanced ambient pressure and some of the fuel to trigger the star formation.this result is consistent with previous works that showed that bcgs in clusterswith low central gas entropy host h{\alpha} emission-line nebulae and radiosources, while clusters with high central gas entropy exhibit none of thesefeatures. uv and mid-ir measurements combined provide a complete picture ofunobscured and obscured star formation occurring in these systems.

1204.2305	a highly magnified candidate for a young galaxy seen when the universe  was 500 myrs old	the early universe at redshift z\sim6-11 marks the reionization of theintergalactic medium, following the formation of the first generation of stars.however, those young galaxies at a cosmic age of \lesssim 500 million years(myr, at z \gtrsim 10) remain largely unexplored as they are at or beyond thesensitivity limits of current large telescopes. gravitational lensing by galaxyclusters enables the detection of high-redshift galaxies that are fainter thanwhat otherwise could be found in the deepest images of the sky. we report thediscovery of an object found in the multi-band observations of the clustermacs1149+22 that has a high probability of being a gravitationally magnifiedobject from the early universe. the object is firmly detected (12 sigma) in thetwo reddest bands of hst/wfc3, and not detected below 1.2 {\mu}m, matching thecharacteristics of z\sim9 objects. we derive a robust photometric redshift of z= 9.6 \pm 0.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of 490 \pm 15myr (i.e., 3.6% ofthe age of the universe). the large number of bands used to derive the redshiftestimate make it one of the most accurate estimates ever obtained for such adistant object. the significant magnification by cluster lensing (a factor of\sim15) allows us to analyze the object's ultra-violet and optical luminosityin its rest-frame, thus enabling us to constrain on its stellar mass,star-formation rate and age. if the galaxy is indeed at such a large redshift,then its age is less than 200 myr (at the 95% confidence level), implying aformation redshift of zf \lesssim 14. the object is the first z&gt;9 candidatethat is bright enough for detailed spectroscopic studies with jwst,demonstrating the unique potential of galaxy cluster fields for finding highlymagnified, intrinsically faint galaxies at the highest redshifts.

1205.3839	a brightest cluster galaxy with an extremely large flat core	hubble space telescope images of the galaxy cluster abell 2261, obtained aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble, show that thebrightest galaxy in the cluster, a2261-bcg, has the largest core yet detectedin any galaxy. the cusp radius of a2261-bcg is 3.2 kpc, twice as big as thenext largest core known, and ~3x bigger than those typically seen in the mostluminous bcgs. the morphology of the core in a2261-bcg is also unusual, havinga flat or even slightly-depressed interior surface brightness profile, ratherthan the typical shallow cusp. this implies that the galaxy has a core withconstant or even centrally decreasing stellar density. interpretation of thecore as an end product of the "scouring" action of a binary supermassive blackhole implies a total black hole mass ~1e+10 m_sun from the extrapolation ofmost relationships between core structure and black hole mass. the core falls1-sigma above the cusp-radius versus galaxy luminosity relation. its large sizein real terms, and the extremely large black hole mass required to generate it,raise the possibility that the core has been enlarged by additional processes,such as the ejection of the black holes that originally generated the core. theflat central stellar density profile is consistent with this hypothesis. thecore is also displaced by 0.7 kpc from the center of the surrounding envelope,consistent with a local dynamical perturbation of the core.

1206.1525	a giant metrewave radio telescope/chandra view of iras 09104+4109: a  type 2 qso in a cooling flow	iras 09104+4109 is a rare example of a dust enshrouded type 2 qso in thecentre of a cool-core galaxy cluster. previous observations of this z=0.44system showed that as well as powering the hyper-luminous infrared emission ofthe cluster-central galaxy, the qso is associated with a double-lobed radiosource. however, the steep radio spectral index and misalignment between thejets and ionised optical emission suggested that the orientation of the qso hadrecently changed. we use a combination of new, multi-band giant metrewave radiotelescope observations and archival radio data to confirm that the jets are nolonger powered by the qso, and estimate their age to be 120-160 myr. this is inagreement with the ~70-200 myr age previously estimated for star-formation inthe galaxy. previously unpublished very long baseline array data reveal a 200pc scale double radio source in the galaxy core which is more closely alignedwith the current qso axis and may represent a more recent period of jetactivity. these results suggest that the realignment of the qso, the cessationof jet activity, and the onset of rapid star-formation may have been caused bya gas-rich galaxy merger. a chandra x-ray observation confirms the presence ofcavities associated with the radio jets, and we estimate the energy required toinflate them to be ~7.7x10^60 erg. the mechanical power of the jets issufficient to balance radiative cooling in the cluster, provided they areefficiently coupled to the intra-cluster medium (icm). we find no evidence ofdirect radiative heating and conclude that the qso either lacks the radiativeluminosity to heat the icm, or that it requires longer than 100-200 myr tosignificantly impact its environment.

1211.3663	clash: three strongly lensed images of a candidate z ~ 11 galaxy	we present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with aphotometric redshift z = 10.7 +0.6 / -0.4 (95% confidence limits; with z &lt; 9.5galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2-sigma). this j-dropout lyman breakgalaxy, named macs0647-jd, was discovered as part of the cluster lensing andsupernova survey with hubble (clash). we observe three magnified images of thisgalaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy clustermacsj0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. the images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude ab (~0.15 ujy) in thewfc3/ir f160w filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at &gt;~ 12-sigma.all three images are also confidently detected at &gt;~ 6-sigma in f140w (~1.2 -1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength hst filters (~0.2 -1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in spitzer/irac 3.6um and 4.5um imaging(~3.2 - 5.0 um). we rule out a broad range of possible lower redshiftinterlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected abayesian photometric redshift prior. given clash observations of 17 high massclusters to date, our discoveries of macs0647-jd at z ~ 10.8 and macs1149-jd1at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated fromlower redshifts. this would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could havereionized the universe. however given the significant uncertainties based ononly two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop off in number countsat z &gt;~ 10 suggested by field searches.

1303.1819	the x-ray properties of optically selected clusters of galaxies	we present the results of chandra and suzaku x-ray observations of ninemoderate-redshift (0.16 &lt; z &lt; 0.42) clusters discovered via the red-sequencecluster survey (rcs). surface brightness profiles are fitted to beta models,gas masses are determined, integrated spectra are extracted within r2500, andx-ray temperatures and luminosities are inferred. the lx-tx relationshipexpected from self-similar evolution is tested by comparing this sample to ourprevious x-ray investigation of nine high-redshift (0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0) opticallyselected clusters. we find that optically selected clusters are systematicallyless luminous than x-ray selected clusters of similar x-ray temperature at bothmoderate and high-z. we are unable to constrain evolution in the lx-tx relationwith these data, but find it consistent with no evolution, within relativelylarge uncertainties. to investigate selection effects, we compare the x-rayproperties of our sample to those of clusters in the representative x-rayselected rexcess sample, also determined within r2500. we find that while rcscluster x-ray properties span the entire range of those of massive clustersselected by other methods, their average x-ray properties are most similar tothose of dynamically disturbed x-ray selected clusters. this similaritysuggests that the true cluster distribution might contain a higher fraction ofdisturbed objects than are typically detected in x-ray selected surveys.

1304.1223	clash: complete lensing analysis of the largest cosmic lens macs  j0717.5+3745 and surrounding structures	the galaxy cluster macs j0717.5+3745 (z=0.55) is the largest known cosmiclens, with complex internal structures seen in deep x-ray, sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect and dynamical observations. we perform a combined weak and stronglensing analysis with wide-field bvri'z' subaru/suprime-cam observations and16-band hubble space telescope observations taken as part of the clusterlensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). we find consistent weakdistortion and magnification measurements of background galaxies, and combinethese signals to construct an optimally estimated radial mass profile of thecluster and its surrounding large-scale structure out to 5 mpc/h. we findconsistency between strong-lensing and weak-lensing in the region where theseindependent data overlap, &lt;500 kpc/h. the two-dimensional weak-lensing mapreveals a clear filamentary structure traced by distinct mass halos. we modelthe lensing shear field with 9 halos, including the main cluster, correspondingto mass peaks detected above 2.5\sigma_\kappa. the total mass of the cluster asdetermined by the different methods is m_{vir}=(2.8\pm0.4) \times 10^15 m_sun.although this is the most massive cluster known at z&gt;0.5, in terms of extremevalue statistics we conclude that the mass of macs j0717.5+3745 by itself isnot in serious tension with lambdacdm, representing only a ~2{\sigma} departureabove the maximum simulated halo mass at this redshift.

1306.5240	galaxy halo truncation and giant arc surface brightness reconstruction  in the cluster macsj1206.2-0847	in this work we analyze the mass distribution of macsj1206.2-0847, especiallyfocusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. the cluster appearsrelaxed in its x-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intraclusterlight which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scaleinteractions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. the clusterlenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at $z=1.033$into a giant arc and its counterimage. the multiple image positions and thesurface brightness distribution (sfb) of the arc which is bent around severalcluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. we modelthe cluster mass distribution with a nfw profile and the galaxy halos with twoparameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assumingscalings with their observed nir--light. we match the multiple image positionsat an r.m.s. level of $0.85\arcsec$ and can reconstruct the sfb distribution ofthe arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this clustermodel. the length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrainedis about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamicaland field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weaklensing results on the other hand. the velocity dispersion and halo size of agalaxy with $m_{\rm 160w,ab}=19.2$ or $m_{\rm b,vega}=-20.7$ are $\sigma=150\rm kms^{-1}$ and $r\approx 26\pm 6 \rm kpc$, indicating that the halos of thecluster galaxies are tidally stripped. we also reconstruct the unlensed source(which is smaller by a factor of $\sim5.8$ in area), demonstrating the increaseof morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy haslikely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.

1308.1675	the contribution of halos with different mass ratios to the overall  growth of cluster-sized halos	we provide a new observational test for a key prediction of the \lambda cdmcosmological model: the contributions of mergers with differenthalo-to-main-cluster mass ratios to cluster-sized halo growth. we perform thistest by dynamically analyzing seven galaxy clusters, spanning the redshiftrange $0.13 &lt; z_c &lt; 0.45$ and caustic mass range $0.4-1.5$ $10^{15}h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$, with an average of 293 spectroscopically-confirmedbound galaxies to each cluster. the large radial coverage (a few virial radii),which covers the whole infall region, with a high number of spectroscopicallyidentified galaxies enables this new study. for each cluster, we identify boundgalaxies. out of these galaxies, we identify infalling and accreted halos andestimate their masses and their dynamical states. using the estimated masses,we derive the contribution of different mass ratios to cluster-sized halogrowth. for mass ratios between ~0.2 and ~0.7, we find a ~1 $\sigma$ agreementwith \lambda cdm expectations based on the millennium simulations i and ii. atlow mass ratios, $\lesssim 0.2$, our derived contribution is underestimatedsince the detection efficiency decreases at low masses, $\sim 2 \times 10^{14}$$h_{0.73}^{-1}$ m$_{\odot}$. at large mass ratios, $\gtrsim 0.7$, we do notdetect halos probably because our sample, which was chosen to be quite x-rayrelaxed, is biased against large mass ratios. therefore, at large mass ratios,the derived contribution is also underestimated.

1311.2831	polarization diagnostics for cool core cluster emission lines	the nature of the interaction between low-excitation gas filaments at ~10^4k, seen in optical line emission, and diffuse x-ray emitting coronal gas at~10^7 k in the centers of galaxy clusters remains a puzzle. the presence of astrong, empirical correlation between the two gas phases is indicative of afundamental relationship between them, though as yet of undetermined cause. thecooler filaments, originally thought to have condensed from the hot gas, couldalso arise from a merger or the disturbance of cool circumnuclear gas bynuclear activity. here, we have searched for intrinsic line emissionpolarization in cool core galaxy clusters as a diagnostic of fundamentaltransport processes. drawing on developments in solar astrophysics, directenergetic particle impact induced polarization holds the promise todefinitively determine the role of collisional processes such as thermalconduction in the ism physics of galaxy clusters, while providing insight intoother highly anisotropic excitation mechanisms such as shocks, intenseradiation fields and suprathermal particles. under certain physical conditions,theoretical calculations predict of order ten percent polarization. ourobservations of the filaments in four nearby cool core clusters place stringentupper limits (&lt;0.1%) on the presence of emission line polarization, requiringthat if thermal conduction is operative, the thermal gradients are not in thesaturated regime. this limit is consistent with theoretical models of thethermal structure of filament interfaces.

1312.0943	three gravitationally lensed supernovae behind clash galaxy clusters	we report observations of three gravitationally lensed supernovae (sne) inthe cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash) multi-cycletreasury program. these objects, sn clo12car (z = 1.28), sn cln12did (z =0.85), and sn cla11tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters,macsj1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), rxj1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and abell 383 (z =0.187), respectively. each sn was detected in hubble space telescope (hst)optical and infrared images. based on photometric classification, we find thatsne clo12car and cln12did are likely to be type ia supernovae (sne ia), whilethe classification of sn cla11tib is inconclusive. using multi-colorlight-curve fits to determine a standardized sn ia luminosity distance, weinfer that sn clo12car was approximately 1.0 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than fieldsne ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lensmagnification. similarly, sn cln12did is approximately 0.2 +/- 0.2 mag brighterthan field sne ia. we derive independent estimates of the predictedmagnification from clash strong+weak lensing maps of the clusters: 0.83 +/-0.16 mag for sn clo12car, 0.28 +/- 0.08 mag for sn cln12did, and 0.43 +/- 0.11mag for sn cla11tib. the two sne ia provide a new test of the cluster lensmodel predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the sn iabrightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. our resultsherald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed sne ia(from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution inclusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolutemagnifications.

1401.5800	clash-vlt: constraints on the dark matter equation of state from  accurate measurements of galaxy cluster mass profiles	a pressureless scenario for the dark matter (dm) fluid is a widely adoptedhypothesis, despite the absence of a direct observational evidence. accordingto general relativity, the total mass-energy content of a system shapes thegravitational potential well, but different test particles perceive thispotential in different ways depending on their properties. cluster galaxyvelocities, being $\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereasphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potentialplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. we exploitthis phenomenon to constrain the equation of state (eos) parameter of thefluid, primarily dm, contained in galaxy clusters. we use the complementaryinformation provided by the kinematic and lensing mass profiles of the galaxycluster macs 1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$, as obtained in an extensive imaging andspectroscopic campaign within the clash survey. the unprecedented high qualityof our data-set and the properties of this cluster are well suited to determinethe eos parameter of the cluster fluid. since baryons contribute at most $15\%$to the total mass in clusters and their pressure is negligible, the eosparameter we derive describes the behavior of the dm fluid. we obtain the moststringent constraint on the dm eos parameter to date,$w=(p_r+2\,p_t)/(3\,c^2\rho)=0.00\pm0.15\mathrm{(stat)}\pm0.08\mathrm{(syst)}$,averaged over the radial range $0.5\,\mathrm{mpc}\leq$$r$$\leq$$r_{200}$, where$p_r$ and $p_t$ are the radial and tangential pressure, and $\rho$ is thedensity. we plan to further improve our constraint by applying the sameprocedure to all clusters from the ongoing clash-vlt program.

1404.1375	clash: weak-lensing shear-and-magnification analysis of 20 galaxy  clusters	we present a joint shear-and-magnification weak-lensing analysis of a sampleof 16 x-ray-regular and 4 high-magnification galaxy clusters at 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.69selected from the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). ouranalysis uses wide-field multi-color imaging, taken primarily with suprime-camon the subaru telescope. from a stacked shear-only analysis of thex-ray-selected subsample, we detect the ensemble-averaged lensing signal with atotal signal-to-noise ratio of ~25 in the radial range of 200 to 3500kpc/h. thestacked tangential-shear signal is well described by a family of standarddensity profiles predicted for dark-matter-dominated halos in gravitationalequilibrium, namely the navarro-frenk-white (nfw), truncated variants of nfw,and einasto models. for the nfw model, we measure a mean concentration of$c_{200c}=4.01^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ at $m_{200c}=1.34^{+0.10}_{-0.09}10^{15}m_{\odot}$. we show this is in excellent agreement with lambdacold-dark-matter (lcdm) predictions when the clash x-ray selection function andprojection effects are taken into account. the best-fit einasto shape parameteris $\alpha_e=0.191^{+0.071}_{-0.068}$, which is consistent with thenfw-equivalent einasto parameter of $\sim 0.18$. we reconstruct projected massdensity profiles of all clash clusters from a joint likelihood analysis ofshear-and-magnification data, and measure cluster masses at severalcharacteristic radii. we also derive an ensemble-averaged total projected massprofile of the x-ray-selected subsample by stacking their individual massprofiles. the stacked total mass profile, constrained by theshear+magnification data, is shown to be consistent with our shear-basedhalo-model predictions including the effects of surrounding large-scalestructure as a two-halo term, establishing further consistency in the contextof the lcdm model.

1405.7876	clash-x: a comparison of lensing and x-ray techniques for measuring the  mass profiles of galaxy clusters	we present profiles of temperature (tx), gas mass, and hydrostatic massestimated from new and archival x-ray observations of clash clusters. wecompare measurements derived from xmm and chandra observations with one anotherand compare both to gravitational lensing mass profiles derived with clash hstand ground-based lensing data. radial profiles of chandra and xmm electrondensity and enclosed gas mass are nearly identical, indicating that differencesin hydrostatic masses inferred from x-ray observations arise from differencesin tx measurements. encouragingly, cluster txs are consistent with one anotherat ~100-200 kpc radii but xmm tx systematically decline relative to chandra txat larger radii. the angular dependence of the discrepancy suggests additionalinvestigation on systematics such as the xmm point spread function correction,vignetting and off-axis responses. we present the clash-x mass-profilecomparisons in the form of cosmology-independent and redshift-independentcircular-velocity profiles. ratios of chandra hse mass profiles to clashlensing profiles show no obvious radial dependence in the 0.3-0.8 mpc range.however, the mean mass biases inferred from the wl and sawlens data aredifferent. e.g., the weighted-mean value at 0.5 mpc is &lt;b&gt; = 0.12 for the wlcomparison and &lt;b&gt; = -0.11 for the sawlens comparison. the ratios of xmm hsemass profiles to clash lensing profiles show a pronounced radial dependence inthe 0.3-1.0 mpc range, with a weighted mean mass bias of value rising to&lt;b&gt;~0.3 at ~1 mpc for the wl comparison and &lt;b&gt; of 0.25 for sawlens comparison.the enclosed gas mass profiles from both chandra and xmm rise to a value 1/8times the total-mass profiles inferred from lensing at 0.5 mpc and remainconstant outside of that radius, suggesting that [8xmgas] profiles may be anexcellent proxy for total-mass profiles at &gt;0.5 mpc in massive galaxy clusters.

0803.1772	an infrared survey of brightest cluster galaxies. ii: why are some  brightest cluster galaxies forming stars?	quillen et al.(2007) presented an imaging survey with the {\it spitzer spacetelescope} of 62 brightest cluster galaxies with optical line emission locatedin the cores of x-ray luminous clusters. they found that at least half of thesesources have signs of excess infrared emission. here we discuss the nature ofthe ir emission and its implications for cool core clusters. the strength ofthe mid-ir excess emission correlates with the luminosity of the opticalemission lines. excluding the four systems dominated by an agn, the excessmid-infrared emission in the remaining brightest cluster galaxies is likelyrelated to star formation. the mass of molecular gas (estimated from coobservations) is correlated with the ir luminosity as found for normal starforming galaxies. the gas depletion time scale is about 1 gyr. the physicalextent of the infrared excess is consistent with that of the optical emissionline nebulae. this supports the hypothesis that the star formation occurs inmolecular gas associated with the emission line nebulae and with evidence thatthe emission line nebulae are mainly powered by ongoing star formation. we finda correlation between mass deposition rates (${\dot m}_x$) estimated from thex-ray emission and the star formation rate estimated from the infraredluminosity. the star formation rates are 1/10 to 1/100 of the mass depositionrates suggesting that the re-heating of the icm is generally very effective inreducing the amount of mass cooling from the hot phase but not eliminating itcompletely.

1409.1590	scaling relations and x-ray properties of moderate-luminosity galaxy  clusters from 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 with xmm-newton	we present new x-ray temperatures and improved x-ray luminosity estimates for15 new and archival xmm-newton observations of galaxy clusters at intermediateredshift with mass and luminosities near the galaxy group/cluster division(m2500 &lt; $2.4\times 10^{14} h_{70}^{-1} m_\odot$, l &lt; $2\times 10^{44}$ erg$s^{-1}$, 0.3&lt; z &lt; 0.6). these clusters have weak-lensing mass measurementsbased on hubble space telescope observations of clusters representative of anx-ray selected sample (the rosat 160sd survey). the angular resolution ofxmm-newton allows us to disentangle the emission of these galaxy clusters fromnearby point sources, which significantly contaminated previous x-rayluminosity estimates for six of the fifteen clusters. we extend cluster scalingrelations between x-ray luminosity, temperature, and weak-lensing mass forlow-mass, x-ray-selected clusters out to redshift $\approx$0.45. theserelations are important for cosmology and the astrophysics of feedback ingalaxy groups and clusters. our joint analysis with a sample of 50 clusters ina similar redshift range but with larger masses (m500 &lt; $21.9 \times 10^{14}m_\odot$, $0.15 \leq z \leq 0.55$) from the canadian cluster comparison projectfinds that within r2500, $m \propto l^{0.44 +/- 0.05}$, $t \propto l^{0.23 +/-0.02}$, and $m \propto t^{1.9 +/- 0.2}$. the estimated intrinsic scatter in them-l relation for the combined sample is reduced to ${\sigma}_{log(m|l)}=0.10$,from ${\sigma}_{log(m|l)}=0.26$ with the original rosat measurements. we alsofind an intrinsic scatter for the t-l relation, ${\sigma}_{log(t|l)}=0.07 +/-0.01$.

0803.3858	bandpass dependence of x-ray temperatures in galaxy clusters	we explore the band dependence of the inferred x-ray temperature of theintracluster medium (icm) for 192 well-observed galaxy clusters selected fromthe chandra data archive. if the hot icm is nearly isothermal in the projectedregion of interest, the x-ray temperature inferred from a broad-band (0.7-7.0kev) spectrum should be identical to the x-ray temperature inferred from ahard-band (2.0-7.0 kev) spectrum. however, if unresolved cool lumps of gas arecontributing soft x-ray emission, the temperature of a best-fitsingle-component thermal model will be cooler for the broad-band spectrum thanfor the hard-band spectrum. using this difference as a diagnostic, the ratio ofbest-fitting hard-band and broad-band temperatures may indicate the presence ofcooler gas even when the x-ray spectrum itself may not have sufficientsignal-to-noise to resolve multiple temperature components. to test thispossible diagnostic, we extract x-ray spectra from core-excised annular regionsfor each cluster in our archival sample. we compare the x-ray temperaturesinferred from single-temperature fits when the energy range of the fit is0.7-7.0 kev (broad) and when the energy range is 2.0/(1+z)-7.0 kev (hard). wefind that the hard-band temperature is significantly higher, on average, thanthe broad-band temperature. upon further exploration, we find this temperatureratio is enhanced preferentially for clusters which are known merging systems.in addition, cool-core clusters tend to have best-fit hard-band temperaturesthat are in closer agreement with their best-fit broad-band temperatures. weshow, using simulated spectra, that this diagnostic is sensitive to secondarycool components (tx = 0.5-3.0 kev) with emission measures &gt;10-30% of theprimary hot component.

1412.7909	clash: extreme emission line galaxies and their implication on selection  of high-redshift galaxies	we utilize the clash (cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble)observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies(eelgs). the selections are carried out in two central bands: f105w (y105) andf125w (j125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by thepresence of [o iii] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79,respectively. the multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalentwidths of emission lines. thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame[o iii] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. our samples includea number of eelgs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, andthe extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies.these eelgs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshiftgalaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxieswhen the s/n ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. we predictthat the fraction of eelgs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannotbe neglected.

1503.02660	cooling, agn feedback and star formation in simulated cool-core galaxy  clusters	numerical simulations of active galactic nuclei (agn) feedback in cool-coregalaxy clusters have successfully avoided classical cooling flows, but oftenproduce too much cold gas. we perform adaptive mesh simulations that includemomentum-driven agn feedback, self-gravity, star formation and stellarfeedback, focusing on the interplay between cooling, agn heating and starformation in an isolated cool-core cluster. cold clumps triggered by agn jetsand turbulence form filamentary structures tens of kpc long. this cold gasfeeds both star formation and the supermassive black hole (smbh), triggering anagn outburst that increases the entropy of the icm and reduces its coolingrate. within 1-2 gyr, star formation completely consumes the cold gas, leadingto a brief shutoff of the agn. the icm quickly cools and redevelops multiphasegas, followed by another cycle of star formation/agn outburst. within 6.5 gyr,we observe three such cycles. there is good agreement between our simulatedcluster and the observations of cool-core clusters. icm cooling is dynamicallybalanced by agn heating, and a cool-core appearance is preserved. the minimumcooling time to free-fall time ratio typically varies between a few and$\gtrsim 20$. the star formation rate (sfr) covers a wide range, from 0 to afew hundred $\rm m_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$, with an average of $\sim 40 \,\rmm_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$. the instantaneous smbh accretion rate shows largevariations on short timescales, but the average value correlates well with thesfr. simulations without stellar feedback or self-gravity produce qualitativelysimilar results, but a lower smbh feedback efficiency (0.1% compared to 1%)results in too many stars.

1504.00598	ultraviolet morphologies and star-formation rates of clash brightest  cluster galaxies	brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) are usually quiescent, but many exhibitstar formation. here we exploit the opportunity provided by rest-frame uvimaging of galaxy clusters in the clash (cluster lensing and supernovae withhubble) multi-cycle treasury project to reveal the diversity of uv morphologiesin bcgs and to compare them with recent simulations of the cool, star-forminggas structures produced by precipitation-driven feedback. all of the clash bcgsare detected in the rest-frame uv (280 nm), regardless of their star-formationactivity, because evolved stellar populations produce a modest amount of uvlight that traces the relatively smooth, symmetric, and centrally peakedstellar distribution seen in the near infrared. ultraviolet morphologies amongthe bcgs with strong uv excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongatedclumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from thesmooth profiles of the uv-quiet bcgs. these structures, which are similar tothose seen in the few star-forming bcgs observed in the uv at low redshift, aresuggestive of bi-polar streams of clumpy star formation, but not of spiral armsor large, kpc-scale disks. based on the number of streams and lack of culpritcompanion galaxies, these streams are unlikely to have arisen from multiplecollisions with gas-rich galaxies. these star-forming uv structures aremorphologically similar to the cold-gas structures produced in simulations ofprecipitation-driven agn feedback in which jets uplift low-entropy gas togreater altitudes, causing it to condense. unobscured star-formation ratesestimated from clash uv images using the kennicutt relation range up to 80solar masses per year in the most extended and highly structured systems. thecircumgalactic gas-entropy threshold for star formation in clash bcgs atz~0.2-0.5 is indistinguishable from that for clusters at z &lt; 0.2.

1505.03533	far ultraviolet morphology of star forming filaments in cool core  brightest cluster galaxies	we present a multiwavelength morphological analysis of star forming cloudsand filaments in the central ($&lt; 50$ kpc) regions of 16 low redshift ($z&lt;0.3$)cool core brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). new hubble space telescope (hst)imaging of far ultraviolet continuum emission from young ($\sim 10$ myr),massive ($&gt; 5$ \msol) stars reveals filamentary and clumpy morphologies, whichwe quantify by means of structural indices. the fuv data are compared withx-ray, ly$\alpha$, narrowband h$\alpha$, broadband optical/ir, and radio maps,providing a high spatial resolution atlas of star formation locales relative tothe ambient hot ($\sim10^{7-8}$ k) and warm ionised ($\sim 10^4$ k) gas phases,as well as the old stellar population and radio-bright agn outflows. nearlyhalf of the sample possesses kpc-scale filaments that, in projection, extendtoward and around radio lobes and/or x-ray cavities. these filaments may havebeen uplifted by the propagating jet or buoyant x-ray bubble, or may haveformed {\it in situ} by cloud collapse at the interface of a radio lobe orrapid cooling in a cavity's compressed shell. the morphological diversity ofnearly the entire fuv sample is reproduced by recent hydrodynamical simulationsin which the agn powers a self-regulating rain of thermally unstable starforming clouds that precipitate from the hot atmosphere. in this model,precipitation triggers where the cooling-to- freefall time ratio is$t_{\mathrm{cool}}/t_{\mathrm{ff}}\sim 10$. this condition is roughly met atthe maxmial projected fuv radius for more than half of our sample, andclustering about this ratio is stronger for sources with higher star formationrates.

1509.00487	star formation activity in clash brightest cluster galaxies	the clash x-ray selected sample of 20 galaxy clusters contains ten brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs) that exhibit significant ($&gt;$5 $\sigma$)extinction-corrected star formation rates (sfrs). star formation activity isinferred from photometric estimates of uv and h$\alpha$+[\ion{n}{2}] emissionin knots and filaments detected in clash hst acs and wfc3 observations.uv-derived sfrs in these bcgs span two orders of magnitude, including two witha sfr $\gtrsim$ 100 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. these measurements are supplementedwith [\ion{o}{2}], [\ion{o}{3}], and h$\beta$ fluxes measured from spectraobtained with the soar telescope. we confirm that photoionization from ongoingstar formation powers the line emission nebulae in these bcgs, although in manybcgs there is also evidence of a liner-like contribution to the line emission.coupling these data with chandra x-ray measurements, we infer that the starformation occurs exclusively in low-entropy cluster cores and exhibits acorrelation with gas properties related to cooling. we also perform an in-depthstudy of the starburst history of the bcg in the cluster rxj1532.9+3021, andcreate 2d maps of stellar properties on scales down to $\sim$350 pc. these mapsreveal evidence for an ongoing burst occurring in elongated filaments,generally on $\sim$ 0.5-1.0 gyr timescales, although some filaments areconsistent with much younger ($\lesssim$ 100 myr) burst timescales and may becorrelated with recent activity from the agn. the relationship between bcg sfrsand the surrounding icm gas properties provide new support for the process offeedback-regulated cooling in galaxy clusters and is consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

0806.0850	substructure and scatter in the mass-temperature relations of simulated  clusters	galaxy clusters exhibit regular scaling relations among their bulkproperties. these relations establish vital links between halo mass and clusterobservables. precision cosmology studies that depend on these links benefitfrom a better understanding of scatter in the mass-observable scalingrelations. here we study the role of merger processes in introducing scatterinto the $m$-$t_{\rm x}$ relation, using a sample of 121 galaxy clusterssimulated with radiative cooling and supernova feedback, along with threestatistics previously proposed to measure x-ray surface brightnesssubstructure. these are the centroid variation ($w$), the axial ratio ($\eta$),and the power ratios ($p_{20}$ and $p_{30}$). we find that in this set ofsimulated clusters, each substructure measure is correlated with a cluster'sdepartures $\delta \ln t_{\rm x}$ and $\delta \ln m$ from the mean $m$-$t_{\rmx}$ relation, both for emission-weighted temperatures $t_{\rm ew}$ and forspectroscopic-like temperatures $t_{\rm sl}$, in the sense that clusters withmore substructure tend to be cooler at a given halo mass. in all cases, athree-parameter fit to the $m$-$t_{\rm x}$ relation that includes substructureinformation has less scatter than a two-parameter fit to the basic $m$-$t_{\rmx}$ relation.

astro-ph;0007062	hst observations of vibrationally-excited molecular hydrogen in cluster  cooling flow nebulae	we report new hst nicmos and wfpc2 imaging of emission-line nebulae in thecentral galaxies of 3 clusters of galaxies purported to host massive coolingflows, ngc1275, a2597, and pks0745. the spectral signature of vibrationally-excited molecular hydrogen (vemh) has been seen in every galaxy searched so farin a cluster cooling flow with an optical emission line nebula. we havediscovered that the vemh gas extends several kpc from the centers of a2597 andpks0745, while the vibrationally-excited molecular hydrogen in ngc1275 appearsto be mostly confined to its nucleus, with some extended emission &lt;1 kpc fromthe center. the vemh in a2597 and pks0745-191 seems to be nearly co-spatialwith the optical emission-line filaments in those systems. candidates forheating the nebulae are x-ray irradiation by the icm, uv fluorescence by youngstars, and shocks. uv heating by young stars provides the most satisfactoryexplanation for the h2 emission in a2597 and pks0745; x-ray irradiation isenergetically unlikely and strong shocks (v&gt;40 km/s) are ruled out by the highh2/h-alpha ratios. if uv heating is the main energy input, a few billion solarmasses of molecular gas is present in a2597 and pks0745. uv irradiation modelspredict a significant amount of 1-2 micron emission from higher excitation h2transitions and moderate far infrared luminosities (~1e44/h^2 erg/s) for a2597and pks0745. even in the context of uv fluorescence models, the total amount ofh2 gas and star formation inferred from these observations is too small toaccount for the cooling flow rates and longevities inferred from the x-rays. wenote an interesting new constraint on cooling flow models: the radio sources donot provide a significant amount of shock heating, and therefore cannotcounterbalance the cooling of the x-ray gas in the cluster cores.

astro-ph;0508587	two clusters with radio-quiet cooling cores	radio lobes inflated by active galactic nuclei at the centers of clusters area promising candidate for halting condensation in clusters with short centralcooling times because they are common in such clusters. in order to test theagn-heating hypothesis, we obtained chandra observations of two clusters withshort central cooling times yet no evidence for agn activity: abell 1650 andabell 2244. the cores of these clusters indeed appear systematically differentfrom cores with more prominent radio emission. they do not have significantcentral temperature gradients, and their central entropy levels are markedlyhigher than in clusters with stronger radio emission, corresponding to centralcooling times ~ 1 gigayear. also, there is no evidence for fossil x-raycavities produced by an earlier episode of agn heating. we suggest that either(1) the central gas has not yet cooled to the point at which feedback isnecessary to prevent it from condensing, possibly because it is conductivelystabilized, or (2) the gas experienced a major heating event $\gtrsim 1$ gyr inthe past and has not required feedback since then. the fact that these clusterswith no evident feedback have higher central entropy and therefore longercentral cooling times than clusters with obvious agn feedback strongly suggeststhat agns supply the feedback necessary to suppress condensation in clusterswith short central cooling times.

astro-ph;0509176	an observationally motivated framework for agn heating of cluster cores	the cooling-flow problem is a long-standing puzzle that has receivedconsiderable recent attention, in part because the mechanism that quenchescooling flows in galaxy clusters is likely to be the same mechanism thatsharply truncates the high end of the galaxy luminosity function. most of therecent models for halting cooling in clusters have focused on agn heating, butthe actual heating mechanism has remained mysterious. here we present aframework for agn heating derived from a chandra survey of gas entropy profileswithin cluster cores. this set of observations strongly suggests that the innerparts of cluster cores are shock-heated every ~10^8 years by intermittent agnoutbursts, driven by a kinetic power output of ~ 10^45 erg/sec and lasting atleast 10^7 years. beyond ~30 kpc these shocks decay to sound waves, releasingbuoyant bubbles that heat the core's outer parts. between heating episodes,cooling causes the core to relax toward an asymptotic pure-cooling profile. thedensity distribution in this asymptotic profile is sufficiently peaked that theagn shock does not cause a core entropy inversion, allowing the cluster core toretain a strong iron abundance gradient, as observed.

astro-ph;0511401	entropy profiles in the cores of cooling flow clusters of galaxies	the x-ray properties of a relaxed cluster of galaxies are determinedprimarily by its gravitational potential well and the entropy distribution ofits intracluster gas. that entropy distribution reflects both the accretionhistory of the cluster and the feedback processes which limit the condensationof intracluster gas. here we present chandra observations of the core entropyprofiles of nine classic "cooling-flow" clusters that appear relaxed andcontain intracluster gas with a cooling time less than a hubble time. we showthat those entropy profiles are remarkably similar, despite the fact that theclusters range over a factor of three in temperature. they typically have anentropy level of ~ 130 kev cm^2 at 100 kpc that declines to a plateau ~10 kevcm^2 at \lesssim 10 kpc. between these radii, the entropy profiles are \proptor^alpha with alpha ~ 1.0 - 1.3. the non-zero central entropy levels in theseclusters correspond to a cooling time ~10^8 yr, suggesting that episodicheating on this timescale maintains the central entropy profile in aquasi-steady state.
