0906.3285	the fundamental plane of accretion onto black holes with dynamical  masses	black hole accretion and jet production are areas of intensive study inastrophysics. recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, x-rayluminosity, and black hole mass. with the assumption that radio and x-rayluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,respectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jetproduction is implied. in an effort to refine these links and enhance theirpower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes withdirect, dynamical mass-measurements. this approach not only eliminatessystematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, butalso effectively restricts the range of distances considered to avolume-limited sample. further, we have exclusively used archival data from thechandra x-ray observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. we find log(l_r) =(4.80 +/- 0.24) + (0.78 +/- 0.27) log(m_bh) + (0.67 +/- 0.12) log(l_x), inbroad agreement with prior efforts. owing to the nature of our sample, theplane can be turned into an effective mass predictor. when the full sample isconsidered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-knownm-sigma relation. if obscured agn are excluded, the plane is potentially abetter predictor than other scaling measures.

0910.1843	faint-end quasar luminosity functions from cosmological hydrodynamic  simulations	we investigate the predictions for the faint-end quasar luminosity function(qlf) and its evolution using fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulations whichself-consistently follow star formation, black hole growth and associatedfeedback processes. we find remarkably good agreement between predicted andobserved faint end of the optical and x-ray qlfs (the bright end is notaccessible in our simulated volumes) at z &lt; 2. at higher redshifts oursimulations tend to overestimate the qlf at the faintest luminosities. we showthat although the low (high) luminosity ranges of the faint-end qlf aredominated by low (high) mass black holes, a wide range of black hole massesstill contributes to any given luminosity range. this is consistent with thecomplex lightcurves of black holes resulting from the detailed hydrodynamicsfollowed in the simulations. consistent with the results on the qlfs, we findgood agreement for the evolution of the comoving number density (in optical,soft and hard x-ray bands) of agn for luminosities above 10^43 erg/s. however,the luminosity density evolution from the simulation appears to imply a peak athigher redshift than constrained from hard x-ray data (but not in optical). ourpredicted excess at the faintest fluxes at z &gt;= 2 does not lead to anoverestimate to the total x-ray background and its contribution is at most afactor of two larger than the unresolved fraction of the 2-8 kev background.even though this could be explained by some yet undetected, perhaps heavilyobscured faint quasar population, we show that our predictions for the faintsources at high redshifts (which are dominated by the low mass black holes) inthe simulations are likely affected by resolution effects.

0910.5233	hydrogen self shielding in a quasar proximity zone	we calculate the distribution of hi within 750 proper kpc/h of a quasar, lbol= 1.62e13 lsun, powered by an smbh, mbh = 4.47e8 msun, at z = 3. our numericalmodel includes a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that tracks the selfconsistent growth and thermal feedback of black holes calculated using gadget-3as well as a detailed post-processing ray tracing treatment of the non-uniformionizing radiation field calculated using sphray, which naturally accounts forthe self shielding of optically thick systems. we show that the correcttreatment of self shielding introduces a flattening feature into the neutralcolumn density distribution around log nhi = 20 and that regions with thelowest neutral fractions are not those with the highest density gas. forcomparison, we solve a ricatti equation which determines the equilibriumhydrogen ionization fractions in the presence of a radiation field that fallsoff as 1/r^2 with regions above a given gas density threshold completelyshielded from ionizing radiation. we demonstrate that these semi analyticmodels cannot reproduce the hi field calculated using sphray. we conclude bycomparing our models of this single proximity zone to observations by hennawiand prochaska of the absorption spectra of background quasars which arecoincident on the sky with foreground quasars in their quasars probing quasars(qpq) series of papers. compared to the qpq sample, we find a factor of 3 feweroptically thick (log nhi &gt; 17.2) systems around our quasar, however the darkmatter halo that hosts our simulated quasar, mhalo = 5.25e12 msun, is lessmassive than the typical qpq host halo by a factor of four. allowing for alinear scaling between halo mass, baryonic overdensity and number of absorbers,we estimate the typical host halo mass in the qpq sample as 1.92e13 msun.

0707.3141	the nature of co emission from z~6 quasars	we investigate the nature of co emission from z~6 quasars by combiningnon-lte radiative transfer calculations with merger-driven models of z~6 quasarformation that arise naturally in lcdm cosmological simulations. we considerfour model quasars formed in 10^12-10^13 m_sun halos from different merginghistories. our main results follow. owing to massive starbursts and funnelingof dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies, the co is highlyexcited and the flux density peaks between j=5-8. the co morphology of z~6quasars often exhibits multiple emission peaks which arise from h2concentrations which have not yet fully coalesced. quasars at z~6 display alarge range of sightline dependent line widths such that the lines arenarrowest when the rotating h2 gas associated with the quasar is viewed face-on(when l_b is largest), and broadest when the gas is seen edge-on (when l_b islowest). thus for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selectedfor optical luminosity are preferentially face-on which may result in detectedco line widths narrower than the median. the sightline averaged line width isreflective of the circular velocity (v_c) of the host halo, and ranges fromsigma~300-650 km/s. for optically selected qsos, 10-25% (halo-mass dependant)of sightlines have narrow line widths compatible with the sole co detection atz&gt;6, j1148+5251. when accounting for both the temporal evolution of co linewidths, as well as the redshift evolution of halo v_c, these modelsself-consistently account for the co line widths of both z~2 sub-mm galaxiesand qso's. finally, the dynamical mass derived from the sightline averaged linewidths provides a good estimate of the total mass, and allows for a stellarbulge and smbh consistent with the local m_bh-m_bulge relation.

1005.1653	quasar clustering in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations: evidence for  mergers	we examine the clustering properties of a population of quasars drawn fromfully hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that directly follow black holegrowth. we find that the black hole correlation function is best described bytwo distinct components: contributions from bh pairs occupying the same darkmatter halo ('1-halo term') which dominate at scales below 300 kpc/h, andcontributions from bhs occupying separate halos ('2-halo term') which dominateat larger scales. from the 2-halo bh term we find a typical host halo mass forfaint-end quasars (those probed in our simulation volumes) ranging from 10^11to a few 10^12 solar masses from z=5 to z=1 respectively (consistent with themean halo host mass). the bh correlation function shows a luminosity dependenceas a function of redshift, though weak enough to be consistent withobservational constraints. at small scales, the high resolution of oursimulations allows us to probe the 1-halo clustering in detail, finding thatthe 1-halo term follows an approximate power law, lacking the characteristicdecrease in slope at small scales found in 1-halo terms for galaxies and darkmatter. we show that this difference is a direct result of a boost in thesmall-scale quasar bias caused by galaxies hosting multiple quasars (1-subhaloterm) following a merger event, typically between a large central subgroup anda smaller, satellite subgroup hosting a relatively small black hole. we showthat our predicted small-scale excess caused by such mergers is in goodagreement with both the slope and amplitude indicated by recent small-scalemeasurements. finally, we note the excess to be a strong function of halo mass,such that the observed excess is well matched by the multiple black holes ofintermediate mass (10^7-10^8 solar masses) found in hosts of 4-8*10^11 solarmasses, a range well probed by our simulations.

1010.0903	instabilities in the gamma ray burst central engine. what makes the jet  variable?	both types of long and short gamma ray bursts involve a stage of ahyper-eddington accretion of hot and dense plasma torus onto a newly born blackhole. the prompt gamma ray emission originates in jets at some distance fromthis 'central engine' and in most events is rapidly variable, having a form ofspikes and subpulses. this indicates at the variable nature of the engineitself, for which a plausible mechanism is an internal instability in theaccreting flow. we solve numerically the structure and evolution of theneutrino-cooled torus. we take into account the detailed treatment of themicrophysics in the nuclear equation of state that includes the neutrinotrapping effect. the models are calculated for both schwarzschild and kerrblack holes. we find that for sufficiently large accretion rates (&gt; 10 msun/sfor non-rotating black hole, and &gt;1 msun/s for rotating black hole, dependingon its spin), the inner regions of the disk become opaque, while the heliumnuclei are being photodissociated. the sudden change of pressure in this regionleads to the development of a viscous and thermal instability, and the neutrinopressure acts similarly to the radiation pressure in sub-eddington disks. inthe case of rapidly rotating black holes, the instability is enhanced andappears for much lower accretion rates. we also find the important and possiblyfurther destabilizing role of the energy transfer from the rotating black holeto the torus via the magnetic coupling.

1012.1880	detecting neutral hydrogen in emission at redshift z ~ 1	we use a large n-body simulation to examine the detectability of hi inemission at redshift z ~ 1, and the constraints imposed by current observationson the neutral hydrogen mass function of galaxies at this epoch. we considerthree different models for populating dark matter halos with hi, designed toencompass uncertainties at this redshift. these models are consistent withrecent observations of the detection of hi in emission at z ~ 0.8. whilstdetection of 21 cm emission from individual halos requires extremely longintegrations with existing radio interferometers, such as the giant meter radiotelescope (gmrt), we show that the stacked 21 cm signal from a large number ofhalos can be easily detected. however, the stacking procedure requires accurateredshifts of galaxies. we show that radio observations of the field of thedeep2 spectroscopic galaxy redshift survey should allow detection of the himass function at the 5-12 sigma level in the mass range 10^(11.4) m_sun/h &lt;m_halo &lt; 10^(12.5)m_sun/h, with a moderate amount of observation time. assuminga larger noise level that corresponds to an upper bound for the expected noisefor the gmrt, the detection significance for the hi mass function is still atthe 1.7-3 sigma level. we find that optically undetected satellite galaxiesenhance the hi emission profile of the parent halo, leading to broader wings aswell as a higher peak signal in the stacked profile of a large number of halos.we show that it is in principle possible to discern the contribution ofundetected satellites to the total hi signal, even though cosmic variancelimitation make this challenging for some of our models.

1102.1437	the halo occupation distribution of black holes: dependence on mass	we investigate the halo occupation distribution (hod) of black holes within ahydrodynamic cosmological simulation that directly follows black hole growth.similar to the hod of galaxies/subhalos, we find that the black hole occupationnumber can be described by the form n_bh proportional to 1+ (m_host)^alphawhere alpha evolves mildly with redshift indicating that a given mass halo(m_host) at low redshift tends to host fewer bhs than at high redshift (asexpected as a result of galaxy and bh mergers). we further divide theoccupation number into contributions from black holes residing in central andsatellite galaxies within a halo. the distribution of m_bh within halos tendsto consist of a single massive bh (distributed about a peak mass stronglycorrelated with m_host), and a collection of relatively low-mass secondary bhs,with weaker correlation with m_host. we also examine the spatial distributionof bhs within their host halos, and find they typically follow a power-lawradial distribution (i.e. much more centrally concentrated than the subhalodistribution). finally, we characterize the host mass for which bh growth isfeedback dominated (e.g. star formation quenched). we show that halos withm_host &gt; 3 * 10^12 m_sun have primary bhs that are feedback dominated by z~3with lower mass halos becoming increasingly more affected at lower redshift.

1104.3550	the halo occupation distribution of active galactic nuclei	using a fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that self-consistentlyincorporates the growth and feedback of supermassive black holes and thephysics of galaxy formation, we examine the effects of environmental factors(e.g., local gas density, black hole feedback) on the halo occupationdistribution of low luminosity active galactic nuclei (agn). we decompose themean occupation function into central and satellite contribution and computethe conditional luminosity functions (clf). the clf of the central agn followsa log-normal distribution with the mean increasing and scatter decreasing withincreasing redshifts. we analyze the light curves of individual agn and showthat the peak luminosity of the agn has a tighter correlation with halo masscompared to instantaneous luminosity. we also compute the clf of satellite agnat a given central agn luminosity. we do not see any significant correlationbetween the number of satellites with the luminosity of the central agn at afixed halo mass. we also show that for a sample of agn with luminosity above10^42 ergs/s the mean occupation function can be modeled as a softened stepfunction for central agn and a power law for the satellite population. theradial distribution of agn inside halos follows a power law at all redshiftswith a mean index of -2.33 +/- 0.08. incorporating the environmental dependenceof supermassive black hole accretion and feedback, our formalism provides atheoretical tool for interpreting current and future measurements of agnclustering.

0710.0384	the role of galactic winds on molecular gas emission from galaxy mergers	we assess the impact of starburst and agn feedback-driven winds on the coemission from galaxy mergers, and, in particular, search for signatures ofthese winds in the simulated co morphologies and emission line profiles. we doso by combining a 3d non-lte molecular line radiative transfer code withsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations of galaxy mergers thatinclude prescriptions for star formation, black hole growth, a multiphaseinterstellar medium (ism), and the winds associated with star formation andblack hole growth. our main results are: (1) galactic winds can drive outflowsof masses ~10^8-10^9 msun which may be imaged via co emission line mapping. (2)agn feedback-driven winds are able to drive imageable co outflows for longerperiods of time than starburst-driven winds owing to the greater amount ofenergy imparted to the ism by agn feedback compared to star formation. (3)galactic winds can control the spatial extent of the co emission in post-mergergalaxies, and may serve as a physical motivation for the sub-kiloparsec scaleco emission radii observed in local advanced mergers. (4) secondary emissionpeaks at velocities greater than the circular velocity are seen in the coemission lines in all models. in models with winds, these high velocity peaksare seen to preferentially correspond to outflowing gas entrained in winds,which is not the case in the model without winds. the high velocity peaks seenin models without winds are typically confined to velocity offsets (from thesystemic) &lt; 1.7 times the circular velocity, whereas the models with agnfeedback-driven winds can drive high velocity peaks to ~2.5 times the circularvelocity.

1107.1253	cold flows and the first quasars	observations of the most distant bright quasars imply that billion solar masssupermassive black holes (smbh) have to be assembled within the first eighthundred million years. under our standard galaxy formation scenario such fastgrowth implies large gas densities providing sustained accretion at critical orsupercritical rates onto an initial black hole seed. it has been a longstanding question whether and how such high black hole accretion rates can beachieved and sustained at the centers of early galaxies. here we use our newcosmological hydrodynamic simulation (massiveblack) covering a volume (0.75\gpc)^3 appropriate for studying the rare first quasars to show that steadyhigh density cold gas flows responsible for assembling the first galaxiesproduce the high gas densities that lead to sustained critical accretion ratesand hence rapid growth commensurate with the existence of ~10^9 solar massblack holes as early as z~7. we find that under these conditions quasarfeedback is not effective at stopping the cold gas from penetrating the centralregions and hence cannot quench the accretion until the host galaxy reachesm_halo &gt; 10^{12} solar masses. this cold-flow driven scenario for the formationof quasars implies that they should be ubiquitous in galaxies in the earlyuniverse and that major (proto)galaxy mergers are not a requirement forefficient fuel supply and growth, particularly for the earliest smbhs.

1107.1254	early black holes in cosmological simulations: luminosity functions and  clustering behaviour	we examine predictions for the quasar luminosity functions (qlf) and quasarclustering at high redshift (z &gt; 4.75) using massiveblack, our new hydrodynamiccosmological simulation which includes a self-consistent model for black holegrowth and feedback. we show that the model reproduces the sloan qlf withinobservational constraints at z &gt;= 5. we find that the high-z qlf is consistentwith a redshift-independent occupation distribution of bhs among dark matterhalos (which we provide) such that the evolution of the qlf follows that of thehalo mass function. the sole exception is the bright-end at z=6 and 7, wherebhs in high-mass halos tend to be unusually bright due to extended periods ofeddington growth caused by high density cold flows into the halo center. wefurther use these luminosity functions to make predictions for the numberdensity of quasars in upcoming surveys, predicting there should be ~119+-28(~87+-28) quasars detectable in the f125w band of the wide (deep) fields of thecosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) fromz=5-6, ~19+-7 (~18+-9) from z=6-7, and ~1.7+-1.5 (~1.5+-1.5) from z=7-8. wealso investigate quasar clustering, finding that the correlation length isfully consistent with current constraints for sloan quasars (r_0~17 h^{-1} mpcat z=4 for quasars above m_i = 20.2), and grows slowly with redshift up to z=6(r_0~22 h^{-1} mpc). finally, we note that the quasar clustering strengthdepends weakly on luminosity for low l_bh, but gets stronger at higher l_bh asthe bhs are found in higher mass halos.

1109.4169	dark matter halo occupation: environment and clustering	we use a large dark matter simulation of a lambdacdm model to investigate theclustering and environmental dependence of the number of substructures in ahalo. focusing on redshift z=1, we find that the halo occupation distributionis sensitive at the tens of percent level to the surrounding density and to alesser extent to asymmetry of the surrounding density distribution. we computethe autocorrelation function of halos as a function of occupation, building onthe finding of wechsler et al. (2006) and gao and white (2007) that halos (atfixed mass) with more substructure are more clustered. we compute the relativebias as a function of occupation number at fixed mass, finding a strongrelationship. at fixed mass, halos in the top 5% of occupation can have anautocorrelation function ~ 1.5-2 times higher than the mean. we also computethe bias as a function of halo mass, for fixed halo occupation. we find thatfor group and cluster sized halos, when the number of subhalos is held fixed,there is a strong anticorrelation between bias and halo mass. such arelationship represents an additional challenge to the halo model.

1201.5383	growth of early supermassive black holes and the high-redshift eddington  ratio distribution	using a new large-scale (~ 0.75 gpc)^3 hydrodynamic cosmological simulationwe investigate the growth rate of supermassive black holes in the earlyuniverse (z &gt; 4.75). remarkably, we find a clear peak in the typical eddingtonratio at black hole masses of 4-8 * 10^7 solar masses (typically found in halosof ~7 * 10^11 to 10^12 solar masses), independent of redshift and indicativethat most of bh growth occurs in the cold-flow dominated regime. black holegrowth is by and large regulated by the evolution of gas density. the typicaleddington ratio at a given mass scales simply as cosmological density (1+z)^3and the peak is caused by the competition between increased gas densityavailable in more massive hosts, and a decrease due to strong agn feedback thatdeprives the black hole of sufficient gas to fuel further rapid growth in thehigh mass end. in addition to evolution in the mean eddington ratio, we showthat the distribution of eddington ratio among both mass-selected andluminosity-selected samples is approximately log-normal. we combine thesefindings into a single log-normal fitting formula for the distribution ofeddington ratios as a function of (m_bh,z). this formula can be used inanalytic and semi analytic models for evolving black hole populations,predicting black hole masses of observed quasars, and, in conjunction with theobserved distribution of eddington ratios, can be used to constrain the blackhole mass function.

0710.5574	effects of quasar feedback in galaxy groups	we study the effect of quasar feedback on distributions of baryons andproperties of intracluster medium in galaxy groups using high-resolutionnumerical simulations. we use the entropy-conserving gadget code that includesgas cooling and star formation, modified to include a physically-based model ofquasar feedback. for a sample of ten galaxy group-sized dark matter halos withmasses in the range of 1 to $5\times 10^{13} m_{\odot}/h$, star formation issuppressed by more than 50% in the inner regions due to the additional pressuresupport by quasar feedback, while gas is driven from the inner region towardsthe outer region of the halos. as a result, the average gas density is 50%lower in the inner region and 10% higher in the outer region in the simulation,compared to a similar simulation with no quasar feedback. gas pressure islowered by about 40% in the inner region and higher in the outer region, whiletemperature and entropy are enhanced in the inner region by about 20-40%. thetotal group gas fraction in the two simulations generally differs by less than10%. we also find a small change of the total thermal sunyaev-zeldovichdistortion, leading to 10% changes in the microwave angular power spectrum atangular scales below two arcminutes.

1208.6544	growth and anisotropy of ionization fronts near high redshift quasars in  the massiveblack simulation	we use radiative transfer to study the growth of ionized regions around thebrightest, z=8 quasars in a large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation thatincludes black hole growth and feedback (the massiveblack simulation). we findthat in the presence of the quasar s the comoving hii bubble radii reach 10mpc/h after 20 my while with the stellar component alone the hii bubbles aresmaller by at least an order of magnitude. our calculations show that severalfeatures are not captured within an analytical growth model of stromgrenspheres. the x-ray photons from hard quasar spectra drive a smooth transitionfrom fully neutral to partially neutral in the ionization front. however thetransition from partially neutral to fully ionized is significantly morecomplex. we measure the distance to the edge of bubbles as a function of angleand use the standard deviation of these distances as a diagnostic of theisotropy of ionized regions. we find that the overlapping of nearby ionizedregions from clustered halos not only increases the anisotropy, but also is themain mechanism which allows the outer radius to grow. we therefore predict thatquasar ionized bubbles at this early stage in the reionization process shouldbe both significantly larger and more irregularly shaped than bubbles aroundstar forming galaxies. before the star formation rate increases and theuniverse fully reionizes, quasar bubbles will form the most striking andrecognizable features in 21cm maps.

1302.1387	interpreting the observed uv continuum slopes of high-redshift galaxies	the observed uv continuum slope of star forming galaxies is strongly affectedby the presence of dust. its observation is then a potentially valuablediagnostic of dust attenuation, particularly at high-redshift where otherdiagnostics are currently inaccesible. interpreting the observed uv continuumslope in the context of dust attenuation is often achieved assuming theempirically calibrated meurer et al. (1999) relation. implicit in this relationis the assumption of an intrinsic uv continuum slope ($\beta=-2.23$). however,results from numerical simulations suggest that the intrinsic uv continuumslopes of high-redshift star forming galaxies are bluer than this, and moreovervary with redshift. using values of the intrinsic slope predicted by numericalmodels of galaxy formation combined with a calzetti et al. (2000) reddening lawwe infer uv attenuations ($a_{1500}$) $0.35-0.5\,{\rm mag}$ ($a_{v}$:$0.14-0.2\,{\rm mag}$ assuming calzetti et al. 2000) greater than simplyassuming the meurer relation. this has significant implications for theinferred amount of dust attenuation at very-high ($z\approx 7$) redshift givencurrent observational constraints on $\beta$, combined with the meurerrelation, suggest dust attenuation to be virtually zero in all but the mostluminous systems.

1308.6146	theoretical predictions for the effect of nebular emission on the broad  band photometry of high-redshift galaxies	by combining optical and near-ir observations from the hubble space telescopewith nir photometry from the spitzer space telescope it is possible to measurethe rest-frame uv-optical colours of galaxies at z=4-8. the uv-optical spectralenergy distribution of star formation dominated galaxies is the result ofseveral different factors. these include the joint distribution of stellarmasses, ages, and metallicities, and the subsequent reprocessing by dust andgas in the ism. using a large cosmological hydrodynamical simulation weinvestigate the predicted spectral energy distributions of galaxies athigh-redshift with a particular emphasis on assessing the potentialcontribution of nebular emission. we find that the average pure stellaruv-optical colour correlates with both luminosity and redshift such thatgalaxies at lower-redshift and higher-luminosity are typically redder. assumingthe escape fraction of ionising photons is close to zero, the effect of nebularemission is to redden the uv-optical 1500-v_w colour by, on average, 0.4 mag atz=8 declining to 0.25 mag at z=4. young and low-metallicity stellarpopulations, which typically have bluer pure stellar uv-optical colours,produce larger ionising luminosities and are thus more strongly affected by thereddening effects of nebular emission. this causes the distribution of 1500-v_wcolours to narrow and the trends with luminosity and redshift to weaken. thestrong effect of nebular emission leaves observed-frame colours criticallysensitive to the source redshift. for example, increasing the redshift by 0.1can result in observed frame colours changing by up to ~0.6. these predictionsreinforce the need to include nebular emission when modelling the spectralenergy distributions of galaxies at high-redshift and also highlight thedifficultly in interpreting the observed colours of individual galaxies withoutprecise redshifts.

1402.0888	the massiveblack-ii simulation: the evolution of halos and galaxies to  z~0	(abridged for arxiv)we investigate the properties of halos, galaxies andblackholes to z=0 in the high resolution hydrodynamical simulationmassiveblack-ii (mbii) which evolves a lcdm cosmology in a comoving volumevbox=100(mpc/h)^3. mbii is the highest resolution simulation of this size whichincludes a self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion andassociated feedback. we provide a simulation browser web application whichenables interactive search and tagging of halos, subhalos and their propertiesand publicly release our galaxy catalogs. our analysis of the halo massfunction (mf) in mbii reveals that baryons have strong effects, with changes inthe halo abundance of 20-35% below the knee of the mf (mhalo &lt; 10^13.2 msun/hat z=0) when compared to fits based on dark matter only simulations. we providea fitting function for the halo mf out to redshift z=11 and discuss how theonset of non-universality in the mf limits the accuracy of our fit. we studythe halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular theevolution and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonableagreement with observational data. the shape of the cosmic spectral energydistribution predicted by mbii is consistent with observations, but lower inamplitude. the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) function is broadlyconsistent with observations at z&gt;=2. at z&lt;2, the population of passive lowmass (for m*&lt;10^9 msun) galaxies in mbii makes the gsmf too steep compared toobservations whereas at the high mass end (m*&gt;10^11 msun) galaxies hostingbright agns make significant contributions to the gsmf. the quasar bolometricluminosity function is also largely consistent with observations. we notehowever that more efficient agn feedback (beyond simple thermal coupling usedhere) is likely necessary for the largest, rarest objects/clusters at lowredshifts.

1408.1696	the role of compton heating in radiation-regulated accretion on to black  holes	we investigate the role of compton heating in radiation-regulated accretionon to black holes from a neutral dense medium using 1d radiation-hydrodynamicsimulations. we focus on the relative effects of compton-heating andphoto-heating as a function of the spectral slope {\alpha}, assuming apower-law spectrum in the energy range of 13.6 ev--100 kev. while comptonheating is dominant only close to the black hole, it can reduce the accretionrate to 0.1 % ($l \propto \dot{m}^2$ model)--0.01 % ($l \propto \dot{m}$ model)of the bondi accretion rate when the bh radiation is hard ({\alpha} ~ 1), where$l$ and $\dot{m}$ are the luminosity and accretion rate normalised by eddingtonrates, respectively. the oscillatory behaviour otherwise typically seen insimulations with {\alpha} &gt; 1, become suppressed when {\alpha} ~ 1 only for the$l \propto \dot{m}$ model. the relative importance of the compton heating overphoto-heating decreases and the oscillatory behaviour becomes stronger as thespectrum softens. when the spectrum is soft ({\alpha} &gt; 1.5), photo-heatingprevails regardless of models making the effect of compton heating negligible.on the scale of the ionization front, where the gas supply into the str\"omgrensphere from large scale is regulated, photo-heating dominates. our simulationsshow consistent results with the advection-dominated accretion flow ($l \propto\dot{m}^2$) where the accretion is inefficient and the spectrum is hard({\alpha} ~ 1).

1412.4133	scaling relations between black holes and their host galaxies: comparing  theoretical and observational measurements, and the impact of selection  effects	we use the high-resolution simulation massiveblackii to examine scalingrelations between black hole mass (mbh) and host galaxy properties (sigma, m*,and lv), finding good agreement with observational data, especially at thehigh-mass end. the simulations have less intrinsic scatter than observations,and the mbh-lv correlation has the largest scatter, suggesting it may the theleast fundamental of the three relations. we find gaussian scatter about allthree relations, except among the highest mass galaxies, which host moremassive black holes. below z~2 the slopes for the full population remainroughly z-independent, and only steepen by 50% by z~4. the normalization of thesigma, lv relations evolve by 0.3, 0.43 dex, while the mbh correlation does notevolve to at least z~2. testing for selection biases, we find samples selectedby mbh or m* have steeper slopes than randomly selected samples. if unaccountedfor, such a selection function would find faster evolution than inferred from arandomly selected sample, as objects at the highend of the relation tend toevolve more rapidly. we find a potential bias among high-lbh subsamples(tending to reside in higher mass galaxies), but these bright-agn exhibit nointrinsic bias relative to fainter ones in equivalent-mass hosts, nor is therea significant difference between active- and inactive-samples. finally wecharacterize the evolution of individual black holes along the scaling planes.below the local relation, black holes grow faster than their host (72% of blackholes 0.3 dex below the mean relation have a mbh-m* trajectory steeper than thelocal relation), while those above have shallower trajectories (only 14% aresteeper than local). black holes tend to grow faster than their hosts untilsurpassing the local relation, at which point their growth is suppressed whiletheir hosts continue to grow, returning them to the mean relation.

1504.06618	the formation of milky way-mass disk galaxies in the first 500 million  years of a cold dark matter universe	whether among the myriad tiny proto-galaxies there exists a population withsimilarities to present day galaxies is an open question. we show, usingbluetides, the first hydrodynamic simulation large enough to resolve therelevant scales, that the first massive galaxies to form are %in fact predictedto have extensive rotationally-supported disks. although their morphologyresembles in some ways milky-way types seen at much lower redshifts, thesehigh-redshift galaxies are smaller, denser, and richer in gas than their lowredshift counterparts. from a kinematic analysis of a statistical sample of 216galaxies at redshift $z=8-10$ we have found that disk galaxies make up 70\% ofthe population of galaxies with stellar mass $10^{10} m_\odot$ or greater. colddark matter cosmology therefore makes specific predictions for the populationof large galaxies 500 million years after the big bang. we argue thatwide-field satellite telescopes (e.g. wfirst) will in the near future discoverthese first massive disk galaxies. the simplicity of their structure andformation history should make possible new tests of cosmology.

0705.2238	a unified model for agn feedback in cosmological simulations of  structure formation	we discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associatedfeedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations ofstructure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmicpopulation of galaxies and active galactic nuclei. our model assumes that seedblack holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos.we then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other blackholes in the course of cosmic time. for black holes that are active, wedistinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black holeaccretion rate itself. black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to bein a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling asmall fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. for blackholes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedbackoccurs in mechanical form, where agn-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseousenvironment. using our new model, we carry out treesph cosmological simulationson the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, bothfor isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. we demonstrate that our modelproduces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broadagreement with observational constraints. we find that the black holessignificantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing theirstar formation history, their amount of cold gas, and their colours. also, theproperties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massiveblack holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicityand entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows.

astro-ph;0010345	hydrodynamic simulation of the cosmological x-ray background	(abridged) we use a hydrodynamic simulation of a lambdacdm model to predictthe extragalactic x-ray background (xrb), focussing on emission from theintergalactic medium (igm). we also include x-rays from point sourcesassociated with galaxies in the simulation, and make maps of the angulardistribution of the emission. we find that filaments in the maps are notevident, being diluted by projection. in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, the meanintensity of radiation from intergalactic and cluster gas is 2.3*10^-12ergdeg^-2cm^-2s^-1, 35% of the total soft band emission. this is compatible atthe ~1 sigma level with estimates of the unresolved soft background from rosatand {\it chandra}. only 4% of the hard (2-10 kev) emission is associated withthe igm. relative to agn flux, the igm component peaks at a lower redshift(median z~0.45) so its clustering makes an important contribution to that ofthe total xrb. the angular correlations on 0.1-10 arcmin scales aresignificant, with an amplitude roughly consistent with an extrapolation ofrecent rosat results to small scales. a cross-correlation of the xrb againstnearby galaxies taken from a simulated redshift survey also yields a strongsignal from the igm. although some recent papers have argued that the expectedsoft band intensity from gas in galaxy, group, and cluster halos would exceedxrb limits unless much of the gas is expelled by supernova feedback, we obtainreasonable compatibility with current observations in a simulation thatincorporates cooling, star formation, and only modest feedback. a prediction ofour model is that the unresolved portion of the soft xrb will remain mostlyunresolved.

astro-ph;0207319	neutrino trapping and accretion models for gamma-ray bursts	many models of gamma ray bursts invoke a central engine consisting of a blackhole of a few solar masses accreting matter from a disk at a rate of a fractionto a few solar masses per second. popham et al. and narayan et al. have shownthat, for mdot &gt;~ 0.1 msun/s, accretion proceeds via neutrino cooling andneutrinos can carry away a significant amount of energy from the inner regionsof the disks. we improve on these calculations by including a simpleprescription for neutrino transfer and neutrino opacities in such regions. wefind that the flows become optically thick to neutrinos inside a radiusr~6-40r_s for mdot in the range of 0.1 -10 msun/s, where r_s is the black holeschwarzchild radius. most of the neutrino emission comes from outside thisregion and, the neutrino luminosity stays roughly constant at a value l_{\nu} ~10^{53} erg/s. we show that, for mdot &gt; 1 msun/s, neutrinos are sufficientlytrapped that energy advection becomes the dominant cooling mechanism in theflow. these results imply that neutrino annihilation in hyperaccreting blackholes is an inefficient mechanism for liberating large amounts of energy.extraction of rotational energy by magnetic processes remains the most viablemechanism.

astro-ph;0301586	black hole growth and activity in a lambdacdm universe	(abridged) the observed properties of supermassive black holes suggest afundamental link between their assembly and the formation of their hostspheroids. we model the growth and activity of black holes in galaxies usinglambdacdm cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by following the evolution ofthe baryonic mass component in galaxy potential wells. we find that theobserved steep relation between black hole mass and spheroid velocitydispersion, m_bh propto \sigma^4, is reproduced if the gas mass in bulges islinearly proportional to the black hole mass. in this model, black hole growthsaturates because of the competition with star-formation and feedback, both ofwhich determine the gas fraction available for accretion. unless otherprocesses also operate, we predict that the m_bh-sigma$ relation is not set inprimordial structures but is fully established at low redshifts, $z \approxlt2$, and is shallower at earlier times. we find that that central black holemasses are related to their dark matter halos simply via m_bh ~ m_dm^4/3. weassume that galaxies undergo a quasar phase with a typical lifetime, t_q ~2\times 10^7 yr and show that star-formation regulated depletion of gas inspheroids can explain the decrease of the quasar population at redshift z&lt;3 inthe optical blue band. however, with the simplest assumption of a redshiftindependent quasar lifetime, the model overpredicts optical quasar numbers athigh redshifts although it yields the observed evolution of number density ofx-ray quasars over the redshift range 1 &lt; z&lt; 6. finally, we find that themajority of black hole mass is assembled in galaxies by z ~ 3 and that theblack hole accretion rate density peaks in rough correspondence to the starformation rate density at z ~ 4-5.

astro-ph;0305261	a fundamental plane of black hole activity	we examine the disc--jet connection in stellar mass and supermassive blackholes by investigating the properties of their compact emission in the x-rayand radio bands. we compile a sample of ~100 active galactic nuclei withmeasured mass, 5 ghz core emission, and 2-10 kev luminosity, together with 8galactic black holes with a total of ~50 simultaneous observations in the radioand x-ray bands. using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio(l_{r}) and the x-ray (l_{x}) luminosity and the black hole mass (m). we findthat the radio luminosity is correlated with {\em both} m and l_{x}, at ahighly significant level. in particular, we show that the sources define a``fundamental plane'' in the three-dimensional (log l_{r},log l_{x},log m)space, given by log l_{r}=(0.60^{+0.11}_{-0.11}) log l_{x}+(0.78^{+0.11}_{-0.09}) log m + 7.33^{+4.05}_{-4.07}, with a substantialscatter of \sigma_{r}=0.88. we compare our results to the theoretical relationsbetween radio flux, black hole mass, and accretion rate derived by heinz andsunyaev (2003). such relations depend only on the assumed accretion model andon the observed radio spectral index. therefore, we are able to show that thex-ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of theeddington rate is unlikely to be produced by radiatively efficient accretion,and is marginally consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from thejet. on the other hand, models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows seemto agree well with the data.

astro-ph;0409436	black holes in galaxy mergers: the formation of red elliptical galaxies	we use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations inducedby star formation and active galactic nuclei (agn) during major mergers ofspiral galaxies. our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation,and supernova feedback. moreover, we include a treatment of accretion ontosupermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. weassume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting blackhole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism thatregulates its growth. the encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggersnuclear gas inflow which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black holeaccretion. comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that agnfeedback can quench star formation and accretion on a shorttimescale,particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drivepowerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. the color evolution ofthe remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central blackholes. without agn, gas-rich mergers lead to ellipticals which remain blueowing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 gyrs have elapsed. incontrast, mergers with black holes produce ellipticals that redden much faster,an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly completetermination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r ~ 2.3 inless than one gyr. agn feedback may thus be required to explain the populationof extremely red massive early type-galaxies, and it appears to be an importantdriver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in thelocal universe.

astro-ph;0411108	modeling feedback from stars and black holes in galaxy mergers	we describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation andblack hole accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. atpresent, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations ongalactic scales. our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grainedrepresentations of the properties of the interstellar medium and black holeaccretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of theseeffects can be included on resolved scales. we illustrate our method using amultiphase description of star-forming gas. feedback from star formationpressurises highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state. weshow that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much largergas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. we extend the model byincluding a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive black holes ingalaxies. assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometricluminosity of accreting black holes to the surrounding gas, we show how thisfeedback regulates the growth of black holes. in gas-rich mergers of galaxies,we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central agn activity whenthe tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. once anaccreting supermassive black hole has grown to a critical size, feedbackterminates its further growth, and expels gas from the central region in apowerful quasar-driven wind. our simulation methodology is therefore able toaddress the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation, and black holeaccretion during the formation of galaxies.

astro-ph;0502199	energy input from quasars regulates the growth and activity of black  holes and their host galaxies	in the early universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes asmassive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. supermassive black holes arefound at the centers of most galaxies today, where their masses are related tothe velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the massof the central bulge of the galaxy. this suggests a link between the growth ofthe black holes and the host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for anumber of years. but the origin of the observed relation between black holemass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution ofgalaxies have remained unclear. here we report simulations that simultaneouslyfollow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxycollisions. we find that in addition to generating a burst of star formation, amerger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole andthereby power the quasar. the energy released by the quasar expels enough gasto quench both star formation and further black hole growth. this determinesthe lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explainsthe relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocitydispersion.

astro-ph;0503369	a merger-driven scenario for cosmological disk galaxy formation	(abridged) the violent hierarchical nature of the lcdm cosmology posesserious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. to help resolve theseissues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmologicalformation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standardmodel based on dissipational collapse.in this picture, large gaseous disks maybe produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that aregas-dominated, i.e. m_gas/(m_gas +m_star &gt; 0.5 at the height of the merger.pressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar mediumprevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and ifenough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a diskgalaxy. we perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study howsupernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,progenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact theformation of remnant disks. we find that disks can build angular momentumthrough mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in themerger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with starformation. disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that aregas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergerstypically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (&gt;80%). we also show thatthe formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is notrestricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. we suggest that thehierarchical nature of the lcdm cosmology and the physics of the interstellargas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentumof disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.

astro-ph;0504190	black holes in galaxy mergers: evolution of quasars	based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a modelin which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassiveblack holes in galaxies. nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collisiontriggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the durationof the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas anddust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and uvwavelengths. eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas andexpels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. between buried and deadphases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminousquasar. because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution ofobscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of thisphase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposedluminosity threshold. we determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as afunction of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10myr for bright quasars in the optical b-band, in good agreement with empiricalestimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 myr,naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. however,observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the ir and hard x-ray bandsas attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. weobtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which thequasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agreesremarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution fromthe sdss for appropriate luminosity thresholds.

astro-ph;0703773	how rapidly do supermassive black hole "seeds" grow at early times?	we investigate the physical conditions for the growth of intermediate massseed black holes assumed to have formed from remnants of the first generationof massive stars. we follow the collapse of high-sigma halos with tvir &gt; 1e4 kusing cosmological, smooth-particle hydrodynamic (sph) simulations in thestandard lcdm model. during collapse of the parent halo the seed holes areincorporated through mergers into larger systems and accrete mass from thesurrounding gas. we include a self-consistent treatment of star formation,black hole accretion and associated feedback processes. even under optimisticassumptions for the seed black hole mass and for efficient merger rates, wefind that seed holes in halos m&lt;1e10 msun never reach the conditions forcritical eddington growth. most of the black hole growth in this regime isdetermined by the initial mass and the merger rates. critical accretion ratesare reached, albeit only after a significant delay, at the time of collapsez~7) for 3-4 sigma halos of m~1e11 msun. our results imply m_bh = 5e6 msun(m_halo/1e11 msun)^0.78 at the time of collapse. the required conditions ofeddington growth to explain the build-up of supermassive black holes (~1e9msun), as implied by sloan quasars at z&gt;6, are therefore hard to meet in such ascenario. without a 'jump-start' these conditions may be only achieved inextremely rare halos with m_halo &gt; 1e13 msun that collapsed before z~6. thesub-eddington regime in which black holes holes accrete at early time implies asmall contribution to the reionization by miniquasar but still sufficient tocause appreciable heating of the igm at z&lt;15-18.

astro-ph;9904123	low luminosity states of the black hole candidate gx 339-4. i. asca and  simultaneous radio/rxte observations	we discuss a series of observations of the black hole candidate gx 339-4 inlow luminosity, spectrally hard states. we present spectral analysis of threeseparate archival advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics (asca) datasets and eight separate rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) data sets. three ofthe rxte observations were strictly simultaneous with 843 mhz and 8.3-9.1 ghzradio observations. all of these observations have (3-9 kev) flux approximately&lt; 10^{-9} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. the asca data show evidence for an 6.4 kev feline with equivalent width 40 ev, as well as evidence for a soft excess that iswell-modeled by a power law plus a multicolor blackbody spectrum with peaktemperature 150-200 ev. the rxte data sets also show evidence of an fe linewith equivalent widths 20-140 ev. reflection models show a hardening of therxte spectra with decreasing x-ray flux; however, these models do not exhibitevidence of a correlation between the photon index of the incident power lawflux and the solid angle subtended by the reflector. `sphere+disk'comptonization models and advection dominated accretion flow (adaf) models alsoprovide reasonable descriptions of the rxte data. the former models yieldcoronal temperatures in the range 20-50 kev and optical depths of \tau ~ 3. themodel fits to the x-ray data, however, do not simultaneously explain theobserved radio properties. the most likely source of the radio flux issynchrotron emission from an extended outflow of size greater than o(10^7gm/c^2).

cond-mat;0112311	stress transmission in granular matter	the transmission of forces through a disordered granular system is studied bymeans of a geometrical-topological approach that reduces the granular packinginto a set of layers. this layered structure constitutes the skeleton throughwhich the force chains set up. given the granular packing, and the region wherethe force is applied, such a skeleton is uniquely defined. within thisframework, we write an equation for the transmission of the vertical forcesthat can be solved recursively layer by layer. we find that a special class ofanalytical solutions for this equation are l\'evi-stable distributions. wediscuss the link between criticality and fragility and we show how thedisordered packing naturally induces the formation of force-chains and arches.we point out that critical regimes, with power law distributions, areassociated with the roughness of the topological layers. whereas, fragility isassociated with local changes in the force network induced by local granularrearrangements or by changes in the applied force. the results are comparedwith recent experimental observations in particulate matter and with computersimulations.
