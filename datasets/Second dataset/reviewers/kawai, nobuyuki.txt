1001.2989	suzaku and optical spectroscopic observations of ss 433 in the 2006  april multiwavelength campaign	we report results of the 2006 april multi-wavelengths campaign of ss 433,focusing on x-ray data observed with suzaku at two orbital phases (in- andout-of- eclipse) and simultaneous optical spectroscopic observations. byanalyzing the fe25 k_alpha lines originating from the jets, we detect rapidvariability of the doppler shifts, dz/dt ~ 0.019/0.33 day^-1, which is largerthan those expected from the precession and/or nodding motion. this phenomenonprobably corresponding to "jitter" motions observed for the first time inx-rays, for which significant variability both in the jet angle and intrinsicspeed is required. from the time lag of optical doppler curves from those ofx-rays, we estimate the distance of the optical jets from the base to be ~(3-4)\times 10^14 cm. based on the radiatively cooling jet model, we determine theinnermost temperature of the jets to be t_0 = 13 +/- 2 kev and 16 +/- 3 kev(the average of the blue and red jets) for the out-of-eclipse and in-eclipsephase, respectively, from the line intensity ratio of fe25 k_alpha and fe26k_alpha. while the broad band continuum spectra over the 5--40 kev band ineclipse is consistent with a multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission expectedfrom the jets, and its reflection component from cold matter, theout-of-eclipse spectrum is harder than the jet emission with the basetemperature determined above, implying the presence of an additional hardcomponent.

0707.3867	low/hard state spectra of gro j1655-40 observed with suzaku	the galactic black-hole binary gro j1655$-$40 was observed with suzaku on2005 september 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the x-ray imagingspectrometer (xis) and 20 ks with the hard x-ray detector (hxd). the source wasdetected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 kev, with anintensity of $\sim$50 mcrab at 20 kev. at a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300kev luminosity is $ \sim 5.1 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 0.7$ % of theeddington luminosity for a 6 $m_{\odot}$ black hole). the source was in atypical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photonindex of $\sim 1.6$. during the observation, the source intensity graduallydecreased by 25% at energies above $\sim 3$ kev, and by 35% below 2 kev. this,together with the soft x-ray spectra taken with the xis, suggests the presenceof an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from acool ($\sim 0.2$ kev) disk. the hard x-ray spectra obtained with the hxd reveala high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\sim 200$ kev.since the spectral photon index above 10 kev is harder by $\sim 0.4$ than thatobserved in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher thanthose of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 kev spectrum cannot bereproduced by a single thermal comptonization model, even consideringreflection effects. instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can besuccessfully explained by invoking two thermal-comptonization components withdifferent $y$-parameters. in contrast to the high/soft state spectra of thisobject in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalentwidths of 60--100 ev, the present xis spectra bear no such features beyond anupper-limit equivalent width of 25 ev.

1007.0801	maxi gsc observations of a spectral state transition in the black hole  candidate xte j1752-223	we present the first results on the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 fromthe gas slit camera (gsc) on-board the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) onthe international space station. including the onset of the outburst reportedby the proportional counter array on-board the rossi x-ray timing explorer on2009 october 23, the maxi/gsc has been monitoring this source approximately 10times per day with a high sensitivity in the 2-20 kev band. xte j1752-223 wasinitially in the low/hard state during the first 3 months. an anti-correlatedbehavior between the 2-4 kev and 4-20 kev bands were observed around january20, 2010, indicating that the source exhibited the spectral transition to thehigh/soft state. a transient radio jet may have been ejected when the sourcewas in the intermediate state where the spectrum was roughly explained by apower-law with a photon index of 2.5-3.0. the unusually long period in theinitial low/hard state implies a slow variation in the mass accretion rate, andthe dramatic soft x-ray increase may be explained by a sudden appearance of theaccretion disk component with a relatively low innermost temperature (0.4-0.7kev). such a low temperature might suggest that the maximum accretion rate wasjust above the critical gas evaporation rate required for the state transition.

1009.0341	suzaku observation of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1841-045	we report the results of a suzaku observation of the anomalous x-ray pulsar(axp) 1e 1841-045 at a center of the supernova remnant kes 73. we confirmedthat the energy-dependent spectral models obtained by the previous separateobservations were also satisfied over a wide energy range from 0.4 to ~70 kev,simultaneously. here, the models below ~10 kev were a combination of blackbody(bb) and power-law (pl) functions or of two bbs wit h different temperatures at0.6 - 7.0 kev (morii et al. 2003), and that above ~20 kev was a pl function(kuiper hermsen mendez 2004). the combination bb + pl + pl was found to bestrepresent the phase-averaged spectrum. phase-resolved spectroscopy indicatedthe existence of two emission regions, one with a thermal and the other with anon-thermal nature. the combination bb + bb + pl was also found to representthe phase-averaged spectrum well. however, we found that this model isphysically unacceptable due to an excessively large area of the emission regionof the blackbody. nonetheless, we found that the temperatures and radii of thetwo blackbody components showed moderate correlations in the phase-resolvedspectra. the fact that the same correlations have been observed between thephase-averaged spectra of various magnetars (nakagawa et al. 2009) suggeststhat a self-similar function can approximate the intrinsic energy spectra ofmagnetars below ~10 kev.

1010.1003	bright x-ray flares from the bl lac object mrk 421, detected with maxi  in 2010 january and february	strong x-ray flares from the blazar mrk 421 were detected in 2010 january andfebruary through the 7 month monitoring with the maxi gsc. the maximum 2 -- 10kev flux in the january and february flares was measured as 120 +- 10 mcrab and164 +- 17 mcrab respectively; the latter is the highest among those reportedfrom the object. a comparison of the maxi and swift bat data suggests a convexx-ray spectrum with an approximated photon index of about 2. this spectrum isconsistent with a picture that maxi is observing near the synchrotron peakfrequency. the source exhibited a spectral variation during these flares,slightly different from those in the previous observations, in which thepositive correlation between the flux and hardness was widely reported. byequating the halving decay timescale in the january flare, $t_{\rm d} \sim 2.5\times 10^{4}$ s, to the synchrotron cooling time, the magnetic field wasevaluated as b = 0.045 g $(\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, where $\delta$ is the jetbeaming factor. assuming that the light crossing time of the emission region isshorter than the doubling rise time, $t_{\rm r} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{4}$ s,the region size was roughly estimated as $ r &lt; 6 \times 10^{15}$ cm$(\delta/10)$. these are consistent with the values previously reported. forthe february flare, the rise time, $t_{\rm r} &lt; 1.3 \times 10^{5}$ s, gives aloose upper limit on the size as $ r &lt; 4 \times 10^{16}$ cm $(\delta/10)$,although the longer decay time $t_{\rm d} \sim 1.4 \times 10^{5}$ s, indicatesb = 0.015 g $(\delta/10)^{-1/3}$, which is weaker than the previous results.this could be reconciled by invoking a scenario that this flare is asuperposition of unresolved events with a shorter timescale.

0708.3968	spectral evolution of grb 060904a observed with swift and suzaku --  possibility of inefficient electron acceleration	we observed an x-ray afterglow of grb 060904a with the swift and suzakusatellites. we found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phaseand the decline phase of an x-ray flare in the bat and xrt data. the observedspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\gamma= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundredseconds in the prompt tail. this is one of the steepest x-ray spectra everobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron accelerationand synchrotron radiation. then, we applied an alternative spectral fittingusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (bpec) model. it is valid toconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotronfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. sincethe spectral cutoff appears in the soft x-ray band, we conclude the electronacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of grb 060904a. thesecutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tailphase to the shallow decay one. after that, typical afterglow spectra with thephoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both xrt andsuzaku/xis up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. we could successfullytrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energyand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\propto t^{-3} \simt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. this factindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completelydifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. therefore we conclude theemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.

0709.1278	pogolite - a high sensitivity balloon-borne soft gamma-ray polarimeter	we describe a new balloon-borne instrument (pogolite) capable of detecting10% polarisation from 200mcrab point-like sources between 25 and 80kev in one 6hour flight. polarisation measurements in the soft gamma-ray band are expectedto provide a powerful probe into high-energy emission mechanisms as well as thedistribution of magnetic fields, radiation fields and interstellar matter. atpresent, only exploratory polarisation measurements have been carried out inthe soft gamma-ray band. reduction of the large background produced bycosmic-ray particles has been the biggest challenge. pogolite uses comptonscattering and photo-absorption in an array of 217 well-type phoswich detectorcells made of plastic and bgo scintillators surrounded by a bgo anticoincidenceshield and a thick polyethylene neutron shield. the narrow fov (1.25msr)obtained with well-type phoswich detector technology and the use of thickbackground shields enhance the detected s/n ratio. event selections based onrecorded phototube waveforms and compton kinematics reduce the background tothat expected for a 40-100mcrab source between 25 and 50kev. a 6 hourobservation on the crab will differentiate between the polar cap/slot gap,outer gap, and caustic models with greater than 5 sigma; and also cleanlyidentify the compton reflection component in the cygnus x-1 hard state. thefirst flight is planned for 2010 and long-duration flights from sweden tonorthern canada are foreseen thereafter.

1101.2379	unraveling the nature of unidentified high galactic latitude fermi/lat  gamma-ray sources with suzaku	we report on the results of deep x-ray follow-up observations of fourunidentified fermi/lat gamma-ray sources at high galactic latitudes usingsuzaku. the studied objects were detected with high significance during thefirst 3 months of fermi/lat operation, and subsequently better localized in thefermi/lat 1 year catalog (1fgl). possible associations with pulsars and activegalaxies have subsequently been discussed, and our observations provide animportant contribution to this debate. in particular, an x-ray point source wasfound within the 95% confidence error circle of 1fgl j1231.1-1410. x-rayspectrum is well-fitted by a blackbody with an additional power-law. thissupports the recently claimed identification of this source with a millisecondpulsar (msp) psr j1231-1411. concerning 1fgl j1311.7-3429, two x-ray sourceswere found within the lat error circle. even though the x-ray spectral andvariability properties were accessed, their nature and relationship with thegamma-ray source remain uncertain. we found several weak x-ray sources in thefield of 1fgl j1333.2+5056, one coinciding with class j1333+5057. we argue theavailable data are consistent with the association between these two objects.finally, we have detected an x-ray source in the vicinity of 1fgl j2017.3+0603.this object was recently suggested to be associated with a newly discovered msppsr j2017+0603, because of the spatial-coincidence and the gamma-ray pulsedetection. we have only detected the x-ray counterpart of the class j2017+0603,while we determined an x-ray flux upper limit at the pulsar position. all inall, our studies indicate while a significant fraction of unidentified highgalactic latitude gamma-ray sources is related to the pulsar and blazarphenomena, associations with other classes of astrophysical objects are stillvalid options.

(2)107p/wilson-harrington is not a tumbler. the sidereal rotation period is 0.2979day. the shape is nearly spherical but slightly hexagonal with a short axismode (sam) of l1:l2:l3 = 1.5:1.5:1.0. the pole orientation is around {\lambda}= 330{\deg}, {\beta} = -27{\deg}. in addition, the model includes thepossibility of binary hosting. for both models, the sense of rotation isretrograde. furthermore, multiband photometry indicates that the taxonomy classof 107p/wilson-harrington is c-type. no clear rotational color variations areconfirmed on the surface.

1109.1378	a spectral study of the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 in the  high/soft state with maxi, suzaku and swift	we report on the x-ray spectral analysis of the black hole candidate xte\j1752--223 in the 2009--2010 outburst, utilizing data obtained with themaxi/gas slit camera (gsc), the swift/xrt, and suzaku, which workcomplementarily. as already reported by nakahira et al. (2010) maxi monitoredthe source continuously throughout the entire outburst for about eight months.all the maxi/gsc energy spectra in the high/soft state lasting for 2 months arewell represented by a multi-color disk plus power-law model. the innermost disktemperature changed from $\sim$0.7 kev to $\sim$0.4 kev and the disk fluxdecreased by an order of magnitude. nevertheless, the innermost radius isconstant at $\sim$41 $d_{3.5}(\cos{\it i})^{-1/2}$ km, where $d_{3.5}$ is thesource distance in units of 3.5 kpc and $i$ the inclination. the multi-colordisk parameters obtained with the maxi/gsc are consistent with those with theswift/xrt and suzaku. the suzaku data also suggests a possibility that the diskemission is slightly comptonized, which could account for broad iron-k featuresreported previously. assuming that the obtained innermost radius represents theinnermost stable circular orbit for a non-rotating black hole, we estimate themass of the black hole to be 5.51$\pm$0.28 $m_{\odot}$ $d_{3.5}(\cos{\iti})^{-1/2}$, where the correction for the stress-free inner boundary conditionand color hardening factor of 1.7 are taken into account. if the inclination isless than 49$^{\circ}$ as suggested from the radio monitoring of transient jetsand the soft-to-hard transition in 2010 april occurred at 1--4% of eddigntonluminosity, the fitting of the suzaku spectra with a relativisticaccretion-disk model derives constraints on the mass and the distance to be3.1--55 $m_{\odot}$ and 2.3--22 {\rm kpc}, respectively. this confirms that thecompact object in xte j1752--223 is a black hole.

1109.6069	long-term monitoring of the black hole binary gx 339-4 in the high/soft  state during the 2010 outburst with maxi/gsc	we present the results of monitoring the galactic black hole candidate gx339-4 with the monitor of all-sky x-ray image (maxi) / gas slit camera (gsc) inthe high/soft state during the outburst in 2010. all the spectra throughout the8-month period are well reproduced with a model consisting of multi-color disk(mcd) emission and its comptonization component, whose fraction is &lt;= 25% inthe total flux. in spite of the flux variability over a factor of 3, theinnermost disk radius is constant at r_in = 61 +/- 2 km for the inclinationangle of i = 46 deg and the distance of d=8 kpc. this r_in value is consistentwith those of the past measurements with tenma in the high/soft state. assumingthat the disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit of a non-spinningblack hole, we estimate the black hole mass to be m = 6.8 +/- 0.2 m_sun for i =46 deg and d = 8 kpc, which is consistent with that estimated from the suzakuobservation of the previous low/hard state. further combined with the massfunction, we obtain the mass constraint of 4.3 m_sun &lt; m &lt; 13.3 m_sun for theallowed range of d = 6-15 kpc and i &lt; 60 deg. we also discuss the spinparameter of the black hole in gx 339-4 by applying relativistic accretion diskmodels to the swift/xrt data.

1305.4943	recurrent outbursts and jet ejections expected in swift j1644+57:  limit-cycle activities in a supermassive black hole	the tidal disruption event by a supermassive black hole in swift j1644+57 cantrigger limit-cycle oscillations between a supercritically accreting x-raybright state and a subcritically accreting x-ray dim state. time evolution ofthe debris gas around a black hole with mass $m=10^{6} {\mo}$ is studied byperforming axisymmetric, two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations. weassumed the $\alpha$-prescription of viscosity, in which the viscous stress isproportional to the total pressure. the mass supply rate from the outerboundary is assumed to be ${\dot m}_{\rm supply}=100l_{\rm edd}/c^2$, where$l_{\rm edd}$ is the eddington luminosity, and $c$ is the light speed. sincethe mass accretion rate decreases inward by outflows driven by radiationpressure, the state transition from a supercritically accreting slim disk stateto a subcritically accreting shakura-sunyaev disk starts from the inner diskand propagates outward in a timescale of a day. the sudden drop of the x-rayflux observed in swift j1644+57 in august 2012 can be explained by thistransition. as long as ${\dot m}_{\rm supply}$ exceeds the threshold for theexistence of a radiation pressure dominant disk, accumulation of the accretinggas in the subcritically accreting region triggers the transition from a gaspressure dominant shakura-sunyaev disk to a slim disk. this transition takesplace at $t {\sim}~50/({\alpha}/0.1)$ days after the x-ray darkening. we expectthat if $\alpha &gt; 0.01$, x-ray emission with luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{44}$ ${\rmerg}{\cdot}{\rm s}^{-1}$ and jet ejection will revive in swift j1644+57 in2013--2014.

1406.3912	maxi observations of grbs	monitor of all-sky image (maxi) gas slit camera (gsc) detects gamma-raybursts (grbs) including the bursts with soft spectra, such as x-ray flashes(xrfs). maxi/gsc is sensitive to the energy range from 2 to 30 kev. this energyrange is lower than other currently operating instruments which is capable ofdetecting grbs. since the beginning of the maxi operation on august 15, 2009,gsc observed 35 grbs up to the middle of 2013. one third of them are alsoobserved by other satellites. the rest of them show a trend to have softspectra and low fluxes. because of the contribution of those xrfs, the maxi grbrate is about three times higher than those expected from the batse log n - logp distribution. when we compare it to the observational results of thewide-field x-ray monitor on the high energy transient explorer 2, which coversthe the same energy range to that of maxi/gsc, we find a possibility that manyof maxi bursts are xrfs with epeak lower than 20 kev. we discuss the source ofsoft grbs observed only by maxi. the maxi log n - log s distribution suggeststhat the maxi xrfs distribute in closer distance than hard grbs. since thedistributions of the hardness of galactic stellar flares and x-ray burstsoverlap with those of maxi grbs, we discuss a possibility of a confusion ofthose galactic transients with the maxi grb samples.

1409.1309	discovery of dramatic optical variability in sdss j1100+4421: a peculiar  radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy?	we present our discovery of dramatic variability in sdss j1100+4421 by thehigh-cadence transient survey kiso supernova survey (kiss). the sourcebrightened in the optical by at least a factor of three within about half aday. spectroscopic observations suggest that this object is likely anarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) at z=0.840, however with unusually strongnarrow emission lines. the estimated black hole mass of ~ 10^7 msun impliesbolometric nuclear luminosity close to the eddington limit. sdss j1100+4421 isalso extremely radio-loud, with a radio loudness parameter of r ~ 4 x 10^2 - 3x 10^3, which implies the presence of relativistic jets. rapid andlarge-amplitude optical variability of the target, reminiscent of that found ina few radio- and gamma-ray loud nls1s, is therefore produced most likely in ablazar-like core. the 1.4 ghz radio image of the source shows an extendedstructure with a linear size of about 100 kpc. if sdss j1100+4421 is a genuinenls1, as suggested here, this radio structure would then be the largest everdiscovered in this type of active galaxies.

1411.3357	the redshift and metallicity of the host galaxy of dark grb 080325 at  z=1.78	we present near-infrared spectroscopy of the host galaxy of dark grb 080325using subaru/moircs. the obtained spectrum provides a clear detection ofh$\alpha$ emission and marginal [nii]$\lambda$6584. the host is a massive(m$_{*}\sim10^{11}$m$_{\odot}$), dusty ($a_{v}\sim 1.2$) star-forming galaxy atz=1.78. the star formation rate calculated from the h$\alpha$ luminosity(35.6-47.0 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is typical among grb host galaxies (andstar-forming galaxies generally) at z $&gt;$1; however, the specific starformation rate is lower than normal star-forming galaxies at redshift $\sim$1.6, in contrast to the high specific star formation rates measured for many ofother grb hosts. the metallicity of the host is estimated to be12+log(o/h)$_{\rm kk04}$$=$8.88. we emphasize that this is one of the mostmassive distant host galaxies for which metallcity is measured withemission-line diagnostics. the metallicity is fairly high among grb hosts.however, this is still lower than the metallicity of normal star-forminggalaxies of the same mass at z$\sim$1.6. the metallicity offset from normalstar-forming galaxies is close to a typical value of other grb hosts andindicates that grb host galaxies are uniformly biased toward low metalicityover a wide range of redshift and stellar mass. the low-metallicity nature ofthe grb 080325 host is likely not attributable to the fundamental metallicityrelation of star-forming galaxies beacuse it is a metal-poor outlier from therelation and has a low ssfr. thus we conclude that metallicity is important tothe mechanism that produced this grb.

1508.05067	high precision analyses of lyman alpha damping wing of gamma-ray bursts  in the reionization era: on the controversial results from grb 130606a at z =  5.91	the unprecedentedly bright afterglow of swift grb 130606a at z = 5.91 gave usa unique opportunity to probe the reionization era by high precision analysesof the redward damping wing of ly alpha absorption, but the reportedconstraints on the neutral hydrogen fraction (f_hi) in intergalactic medium(igm) derived from spectra taken by different telescopes are in contradiction.here we examine the origin of this discrepancy by analyzing the spectrum takenby vlt with our own analysis code previously used to fit the subaru spectrum.though the vlt team reported no evidence for igm hi using the vlt spectrum, weconfirmed our previous result of preferring non-zero igm hi (the best-fit f_hi~ 0.06, when igm hi extends to the grb redshift). the fit residuals of the vltspectrum by the model without igm hi show the same systematic trend as thesubaru spectrum. we consider that the likely origin of the discrepancy betweenthe two teams is the difference of the wavelength ranges adopted in thefittings; our wavelength range is wider than that of the vlt team, and also weavoided the shortest wavelength range of deep ly alpha absorption (lambda_obs &lt;8426 a), because this region is dominated by hi in the host galaxy and thesystematic uncertainty about host hi velocity distribution is large. we alsostudy the sensitivity of these results to the adopted ly alpha cross sectionformulae, ranging from the classical lorentzian function to the most recent onetaking into account fully quantum mechanical scattering. it is found that thepreference for non-zero igm hi is robust against the choice of the crosssection formulae, but it is quantitatively not negligible and hence one shouldbe careful in future analyses.

1512.08797	monitoring observations of the jupiter-family comet 17p/holmes during  2014 perihelion passage	we performed a monitoring observation of a jupiter-family comet, 17p/holmes,during its 2014 perihelion passage to investigate its secular change inactivity. the comet has drawn the attention of astronomers since its historicoutburst in 2007, and this occasion was its first perihelion passage sincethen. we analyzed the obtained data using aperture photometry package andderived the afrho parameter, a proxy for the dust production rate. we foundthat afrho showed asymmetric properties with respect to the perihelion passage:it increased moderately from 100 cm at the heliocentric distance r_h=2.6-3.1 auto a maximal value of 185 cm at r_h = 2.2 au (near the perihelion) during theinbound orbit, while dropping rapidly to 35 cm at r_h = 3.2 au during theoutbound orbit. we applied a model for characterizing dust production rates asa function of r_h and found that the fractional active area of the cometarynucleus had dropped from 20%-40% in 2008-2011 (around the aphelion) to0.1%-0.3% in 2014-2015 (around the perihelion). this result suggests that adust mantle would have developed rapidly in only one orbital revolution aroundthe sun. although a minor eruption was observed on ut 2015 january 26 at r_h =3.0 au, the areas excavated by the 2007 outburst would be covered with a layerof dust (&lt;~ 10 cm depth) which would be enough to insulate the subsurface iceand to keep the nucleus in a state of low activity.

astro-ph;0105022	characteristic x-ray variability of tev blazars: probing the link  between the jet and the central engine	we have studied the rapid x-ray variability of three extragalactic tevgamma-ray sources; mrk 421, mrk 501 and pks 2155-304. analyzing the x-ray lightcurves obtained from asca and/or rxte observations between 1993 and 1998, wehave investigated the variability in the time domain from 10^3 to 10^8 sec. forall three sources, both the power spectrum density (psd) and the structurefunction (sf) show a roll-over with a time-scale of the order of 1 day orlonger, which may be interpreted as the typical time-scale of successive flareevents. although the exact shape of turn-over is not well constrained and thelow-frequency (long time-scale) behavior is still unclear, the high-frequency(short time-scale) behavior is clearly resolved. we found that, on time-scalesshorter than 1 day, there is only small power in the variability, as indicatedby a steep power spectrum density of f^{-2~-3}. this is very different fromother types of mass-accreting black-hole systems for which the short time-scalevariability is well characterized by a fractal, flickering-noise psd(f^{-1~-2}). the steep psd index and the characteristic time-scale of flaresimply that the x-ray emitting site in the jet is of limited spatial extent; d &gt;10^{17} cm distant from the base of the jet, which corresponds to &gt; 100schwarzschild radii for 10^{7-10} m_solar black-hole systems.

astro-ph;0512154	implications for the cosmic reionization from the optical afterglow  spectrum of the gamma-ray burst 050904 at z = 6.3	the gamma-ray burst (grb) 050904 at z = 6.3 provides the first opportunity ofprobing the intergalactic medium (igm) by grbs at the epoch of thereionization. here we present a spectral modeling analysis of the opticalafterglow spectrum taken by the subaru telescope, aiming to constrain thereionization history. the spectrum shows a clear damping wing at wavelengthsredward of the lyman break, and the wing shape can be fit either by a damped lyalpha system with a column density of log (n_hi/cm^{-2}) ~ 21.6 at a redshiftclose to the detected metal absorption lines (z_metal = 6.295), or by almostneutral igm extending to a slightly higher redshift of z_{igm,u} ~ 6.36. in thelatter case, the difference from z_metal may be explained by acceleration ofmetal absorbing shells by the activities of the grb or its progenitor. however,we exclude this possibility by using the light transmission feature around thely beta resonance, leading to a firm upper limit of z_{igm,u} &lt; 6.314. we thenshow an evidence that the igm was largely ionized already at z=6.3, with thebest-fit neutral fraction of igm, x_hi = n_hi/n_h = 0.00, and upper limits ofx_hi &lt; 0.17 and 0.60 at 68 and 95% c.l., respectively. this is the first directand quantitative upper limit on x_hi at z &gt; 6. various systematic uncertaintiesare examined, but none of them appears large enough to change this conclusion.to get further information on the reionization, it is important to increase thesample size of z &gt;~ 6 grbs, in order to find grbs with low column densities(log n_hi &lt;~ 20) within their host galaxies, and for statistical studies of lyalpha line emission from host galaxies.
