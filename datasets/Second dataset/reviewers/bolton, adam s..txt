0902.3219	strong gravitational lensing probes of the particle nature of dark  matter	there is a vast menagerie of plausible candidates for the constituents ofdark matter, both within and beyond extensions of the standard model ofparticle physics. each of these candidates may have scattering (and other)cross section properties that are consistent with the dark matter abundance,bbn, and the most scales in the matter power spectrum; but which may havevastly different behavior at sub-galactic "cutoff" scales, below which darkmatter density fluctuations are smoothed out. the only way to quantitativelymeasure the power spectrum behavior at sub-galactic scales at distances beyondthe local universe, and indeed over cosmic time, is through probes available inmultiply imaged strong gravitational lenses. gravitational potentialperturbations by dark matter substructure encode information in the observedrelative magnifications, positions, and time delays in a strong lens. each ofthese is sensitive to a different moment of the substructure mass function andto different effective mass ranges of the substructure. the time delayperturbations, in particular, are proving to be largely immune to thedegeneracies and systematic uncertainties that have impacted exploitation ofstrong lenses for such studies. there is great potential for a coordinatedtheoretical and observational effort to enable a sophisticated exploitation ofstrong gravitational lenses as direct probes of dark matter properties. thisopportunity motivates this white paper, and drives the need for: a) strongsupport of the theoretical work necessary to understand all astrophysicalconsequences for different dark matter candidates; and b) tailoredobservational campaigns, and even a fully dedicated mission, to obtain therequisite data.

0907.4992	galaxy-scale strong lensing tests of gravity and geometric cosmology:  constraints and systematic limitations	galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses with measured stellar velocitydispersions allow a test of the weak-field metric on kiloparsec scales and ageometric measurement of the cosmological distance-redshift relation, providedthat the mass-dynamical structure of the lensing galaxies can be independentlyconstrained to a sufficient degree. we combine data on 53 galaxy-scale stronglenses from the sloan lens acs survey with a well-motivated fiducial set oflens-galaxy parameters to find (1) a constraint on the post-newtonian parametergamma = 1.01 +/- 0.05 and (2) a determination of omega_lambda = 0.75 +/- 0.17under the assumption of a flat universe. these constraints assume that theunderlying observations and priors are free of systematic error. we evaluatethe sensitivity of these results to systematic uncertainties in (1) totalmass-profile shape, (2) velocity anisotropy, (3) light-profile shape, and (4)stellar velocity dispersion. based on these sensitivities, we conclude thatwhile such strong-lens samples can in principle provide an important tool fortesting general relativity and cosmology, they are unlikely to yield precisionmeasurements of gamma and omega_lambda unless the properties of the lensinggalaxies are independently constrained with substantially greater accuracy thanat present.

0908.1621	dry mergers and the formation of early-type galaxies: constraints from  lensing and dynamics	dissipationless (gas-free or "dry") mergers have been suggested to play amajor role in the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies, particularlyin growing their mass and size without altering their stellar populations. weperform a new test of the dry merger hypothesis by comparing n-body simulationsof realistic systems to empirical constraints provided by recent studies oflens early-type galaxies. we find that major and minor dry mergers: i) preservethe nearly isothermal structure of early-type galaxies within the observedscatter; ii) do not change more than the observed scatter the ratio betweentotal mass m and "virial" mass r_e*sigma/2g (where r_e is the half-light radiusand sigma the projected velocity dispersion); iii) increase strongly galaxysizes [as m^(0.85+/-0.17)] and weakly velocity dispersions [as m^(0.06+/-0.08)]with mass, thus moving galaxies away from the local observed m-r_e and m-sigmarelations; iv) introduce substantial scatter in the m-r_e and m-sigmarelations. our findings imply that, unless there is a high degree of finetuning of the mix of progenitors and types of interactions, present-day massiveearly-type galaxies cannot have assembled more than ~50% of their mass, andincreased their size by more than a factor ~1.8, via dry merging.

0911.2689	spectro-perfectionism: an algorithmic framework for photon noise-limited  extraction of optical fiber spectroscopy	we describe a new algorithm for the "perfect" extraction of one-dimensionalspectra from two-dimensional (2d) digital images of optical fiberspectrographs, based on accurate 2d forward modeling of the raw pixel data. thealgorithm is correct for arbitrarily complicated 2d point-spread functions(psfs), as compared to the traditional optimal extraction algorithm, which isonly correct for a limited class of separable psfs. the algorithm results instatistically independent extracted samples in the 1d spectrum, and preservesthe full native resolution of the 2d spectrograph without degradation. both thestatistical errors and the 1d resolution of the extracted spectrum areaccurately determined, allowing a correct chi-squared comparison of any modelspectrum with the data. using a model psf similar to that found in the redchannel of the sloan digital sky survey spectrograph, we compare theperformance of our algorithm to that of cross-section based optimal extraction,and also demonstrate that our method allows coaddition and foregroundestimation to be carried out as an integral part of the extraction step. thiswork demonstrates the feasibility of current- and next-generation multi-fiberspectrographs for faint galaxy surveys even in the presence of strong night-skyforegrounds. we describe the handling of subtleties arising from fiber-to-fibercrosstalk, discuss some of the likely challenges in deploying our method to theanalysis of a full-scale survey, and note that our algorithm could begeneralized into an optimal method for the rectification and combination ofastronomical imaging data.

1002.1083	the non-evolving internal structure of early-type galaxies: the case  study sdss j0728+3835 at z = 0.206	we study the internal dynamical structure of the early-type lens galaxy sdssj0728+3835 at z = 0.206. the analysis is based on two-dimensional kinematicmaps extending out to 1.7 effective radii obtained from keck spectroscopy, onlensing geometry and on stellar mass estimates obtained from multiband hubblespace telescope imaging. the data are modelled under the assumptions of axialsymmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function (df), by applyingthe combined gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics code cauldron, andyielding high-quality constraints for an early-type galaxy at cosmologicalredshifts. modelling the total density profile as a power-law of the formrho_tot ~ 1/r^{gamma}, we find that it is nearly isothermal (logarithmic slopegamma = 2.08^{+0.04}_{-0.02}), and quite flattened (axial ratio q =0.60^{+0.08}_{-0.03}). the galaxy is mildly anisotropic (delta = 0.08 +/- 0.02)and shows a fair amount of rotational support, in particular towards the outerregions. we determine a dark matter fraction lower limit of 28 per cent withinthe effective radius. the stellar contribution to the total mass distributionis close to maximal for a chabrier initial mass function (imf), whereas for asalpeter imf the stellar mass exceeds the total mass within the galaxy innerregions. we find that the combination of a nfw dark matter halo with themaximally rescaled luminous profile provides a remarkably good fit to the totalmass distribution over a broad radial range. our results confirm and expand thefindings of the slacs survey for early-type galaxies of comparable velocitydispersion (sigma_sdss = 214 +/- 11 km/s). the internal structure of j0728 isconsistent with that of local early-type galaxies of comparable velocitydispersion as measured by the sauron project, suggesting lack of evolution inthe past two billion years.

1102.2261	two-dimensional kinematics of slacs lenses: iii. mass structure and  dynamics of early-type lens galaxies beyond z ~ 0.1	we combine in a self-consistent way the constraints from both gravitationallensing and stellar kinematics to perform a detailed investigation of theinternal mass distribution, amount of dark matter, and dynamical structure ofthe 16 early-type lens galaxies from the slacs survey, at z = 0.08 - 0.33, forwhich both hst/acs and nicmos high-resolution imaging and vlt vimos ifuspectroscopy are available. based on this data set, we analyze the innerregions of the galaxies, i.e. typically within one (3d) effective radius r_e,under the assumption of axial symmetry and by constructing dynamical modelssupported by two-integral stellar dfs. for all systems, the total mass densitydistribution is found to be well approximated by a simple power-law: thisprofile is on average slightly super-isothermal, with a logarithmic slope&lt;gamma'&gt; = 2.074^{+0.043}_{-0.041} (68% cl) and an intrinsic scatter0.144^{+0.055}_{-0.014}, and is fairly round, with an average axial ratio &lt;q&gt; =0.77+/-0.04. the lower limit for the dark matter fraction (fdm) inside r_eranges, in individual systems, from nearly zero to almost a half, with a medianvalue of 12%. by including stellar masses derived from sps models with asalpeter imf, we obtain an average fdm = 31%. the fdm rises to 61% if, instead,a chabrier imf is assumed. for both imfs, the dark matter fraction increaseswith the total mass of the galaxy (3-sigma correlation). based on the intrinsicangular momentum parameter calculated from our models, we find that thegalaxies can be divided into two dynamically distinct groups, which are shownto correspond to the usual classes of the slow and fast rotators. overall, theslacs systems are structurally and dynamically very similar to their nearbycounterparts, indicating that the inner regions of early-type galaxies haveundergone little, if any, evolution since redshift z ~ 0.35.

1104.2608	the sloan lens acs survey. xi. beyond hubble resolution: size,  luminosity and stellar mass of compact lensed galaxies at intermediate  redshift	we exploit the strong lensing effect to explore the properties ofintrinsically faint and compact galaxies at intermediate redshift, at thehighest possible resolution at optical wavelengths. our sample consists of 46strongly-lensed emission line galaxies discovered by the sloan lens acs (slacs)survey. the galaxies have been imaged at high resolution with hst in threebands (v_hst, i_814 and h_160), allowing us to infer their size, luminosity,and stellar mass using stellar population synthesis models. lens modeling isperformed using a new fast and robust code, klens, which we test extensively onreal and synthetic non-lensed galaxies, and also on simulated galaxiesmultiply-imaged by slacs- like galaxy-scale lenses. our tests show that ourmeasurements of galaxy size, flux, and sersic index are robust and accurate,even for objects intrinsically smaller than the hst point spread function. themedian magnification is 8.8, with a long tail that extends to magnificationsabove 40. modeling the slacs sources reveals a population of galaxies withcolors and sersic indices (median n ~ 1) consistent with the objects detectedin the field with hst in the gems survey, but that are (typically) ~ 2magnitudes fainter and ~ 5 times smaller in apparent size. the closest analogare ultracompact emission line galaxies identified by hst grism surveys. thelowest mass galaxies in our sample are comparable to the brightest milky waysatellites in stellar mass (10^7 solar masses) and have well-determined halflight radii of 0."05 (~0.3 kpc).

1108.4719	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z=0.6: i. a new method for  physical parameter estimation	we use principal component analysis (pca) to estimate stellar masses, meanstellar ages, star formation histories (sfhs), dust extinctions and stellarvelocity dispersions for ~290,000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than$10^{11}msun and redshifts in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss). we find the fraction of galaxies with active starformation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens abovea stellar mass of 10^{11.5}msun at z~0.6. this is in striking contrast toz~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declinesmonotonically with stellar mass. at stellar masses of 10^{12}msun, therefore,the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to thepresent-day reaches a factor of ~10. when we stack the spectra of the mostmassive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [oiii]emission is produced by agns. the black holes in these galaxies are accretingon average at ~0.01 the eddington rate. to obtain these results, we use thestellar population synthesis models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to generate alibrary of model spectra with a broad range of sfhs, metallicities, dustextinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. the pca is run on this library toidentify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range3700-5500a. we demonstrate that linear combinations of these components canrecover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the4000a break strength and hda, with greatly improved s/n. this method is able torecover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellarage, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low s/n bossspectra. we examine the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the inputparameters in our model library and the different stellar population synthesismodels.

1111.4215	evidence for dark matter contraction and a salpeter imf in a massive  early-type galaxy	stars and dark matter account for most of the mass of early-type galaxies,but uncertainties in the stellar population and the dark matter profile make itchallenging to distinguish between the two components. nevertheless, preciseobservations of stellar and dark matter are extremely valuable for testing themany models of structure formation and evolution. we present a measurement ofthe stellar mass and inner slope of the dark matter halo of a massiveearly-type galaxy at $z=0.222$. the galaxy is the foreground deflector of thedouble einstein ring gravitational lens system sdssj0946+1006, also known asthe "jackpot". by combining the tools of lensing and dynamics, we firstconstrain the mean slope of the total mass density profile($\rho_{\rm{tot}}\propto r^{-\gamma'}$) within the radius of the outer ring tobe $\gamma' = 1.98\pm0.02\pm0.01$. then we obtain a bulge-halo decomposition,assuming a power-law form for the dark matter halo. our analysis yields$\gamma_{\rm{dm}} = 1.7\pm0.2$ for the inner slope of the dark matter profile,in agreement with theoretical findings on the distribution of dark matter inellipticals, and a stellar mass from lensing and dynamics $m_*^{\rm{ld}} =5.5_{-1.3}^{+0.4}\times10^{11}m_\sun$. by comparing this measurement withstellar masses inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting we find thata salpeter imf provides a good description of the stellar population of thelens while the probability of the imf being heavier than chabrier is 95%. ourdata suggest that growth by accretion of small systems from a compact rednugget is a plausible formation scenario for this object.

1201.1677	the swells survey. iii. disfavouring "heavy" initial mass functions for  spiral lens galaxies	we present gravitational lens models for 20 strong gravitational lens systemsobserved as part of the sloan wfc edge-on late-type lens survey (swells)project. fifteen of the lenses are taken from paper i while five are newlydiscovered systems. the systems are galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foregrounddeflector has an inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, fromlate-type spiral to lenticular. for each system, we compare the total massinside the critical curve inferred from gravitational lens modelling to thestellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis (sps) models, computingthe stellar mass fraction f* = m(sps)/m(lens). we find that, for the lower massswells systems, adoption of a salpeter stellar initial mass function (imf)leads to estimates of f* that exceed 1. this is unphysical, and provides strongevidence against the salpeter imf being valid for these systems. taking thelower mass end of the swells sample sigma(sie) &lt; 230 km/s, we find that the imfis lighter (in terms of stellar mass-to-light ratio) than salpeter with 98%probability, and consistent with the chabrier imf and imfs between the two.this result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies based onindependent techniques. in combination with recent studies of massiveearly-type galaxies that have favoured a heavier salpeter-like imf, this resultstrengthens the evidence against a universal stellar imf.

1201.2988	the boss emission-line lens survey. ii. investigating mass-density  profile evolution in the slacs+bells strong gravitational lens sample	we present an analysis of the evolution of the central mass-density profileof massive elliptical galaxies from the slacs and bells strong gravitationallens samples over the redshift interval z ~ 0.1-0.6, based on the combinationof strong-lensing aperture mass and stellar velocity-dispersion constraints. wefind a significant trend towards steeper mass profiles (parameterized by thepower-law density model with rho ~ r^[-gamma]) at later cosmic times, withmagnitude d&lt;gamma&gt;/dz = -0.60 +/- 0.15. we show that the combined lens-galaxysample is consistent with a non-evolving distribution of stellar velocitydispersions. considering possible additional dependence of &lt;gamma&gt; onlens-galaxy stellar mass, effective radius, and sersic index, we find marginalevidence for shallower mass profiles at higher masses and larger sizes, butwith a significance that is sub-dominant to the redshift dependence. using theresults of published monte carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys, weverify that our mass-profile evolution result cannot be explained by lensingselection biases as a function of redshift. interpreted as a true evolutionarysignal, our result suggests that major dry mergers involving off-axistrajectories play a significant role in the evolution of the averagemass-density structure of massive early-type galaxies over the past 6 gyr. wealso consider an alternative non-evolutionary hypothesis based on variations inthe strong-lensing measurement aperture with redshift, which would imply thedetection of an "inflection zone" marking the transition between thebaryon-dominated and dark-matter halo-dominated regions of the lens galaxies.further observations of the combined slacs+bells sample can constrain thispicture more precisely, and enable a more detailed investigation of themultivariate dependences of galaxy mass structure across cosmic time.

1202.5090	quantifying the biases of spectroscopically selected gravitational  lenses	spectroscopic selection has been the most productive technique for theselection of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens systems with knownredshifts. statistically significant samples of strong lenses provide apowerful method for measuring the mass-density parameters of the lensingpopulation, but results can only be generalized to the parent population if thelensing selection biases are sufficiently understood. we perform controlledmonte carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys in order to quantify thebias of lenses relative to parent galaxies in velocity dispersion, mass axisratio, and mass density profile. for parameters typical of the slacs and bellssurveys, we find: (1) no significant mass axis ratio detection bias of lensesrelative to parent galaxies; (2) a very small detection bias toward shallowmass density profiles, which is likely negligible compared to other sources ofuncertainty in this parameter; (3) a detection bias towards smaller einsteinradius for systems drawn from parent populations with group- and cluster-scalelensing masses; and (4) a lens-modeling bias towards larger velocitydispersions for systems drawn from parent samples with sub-arcsecond meaneinstein radii. this last finding indicates that the incorporation ofvelocity-dispersion upper limits of \textit{non-lenses} is an importantingredient for unbiased analyses of spectroscopically selected lens samples. ingeneral we find that the completeness of spectroscopic lens surveys in theplane of einstein radius and mass-density profile power-law index is quiteuniform, up to a sharp drop in the region of large einstein radius and steepmass density profile, and hence that such surveys are ideally suited to thestudy of massive field galaxies.

1203.6499	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: analysis of potential systematics	we analyze the density field of galaxies observed by the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) included inthe sdss data release nine (dr9). dr9 includes spectroscopic redshifts for over400,000 galaxies spread over a footprint of 3,275 deg^2. we identify,characterize, and mitigate the impact of sources of systematic uncertainty onlarge-scale clustering measurements, both for angular moments of theredshift-space correlation function and the spherically averaged powerspectrum, p(k), in order to ensure that robust cosmological constraints will beobtained from these data. a correlation between the projected density of starsand the higher redshift (0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) galaxy sample (the `cmass' sample) dueto imaging systematics imparts a systematic error that is larger than thestatistical error of the clustering measurements at scales s &gt; 120h^-1mpc or k&lt; 0.01hmpc^-1. we find that these errors can be ameliorated by weightinggalaxies based on their surface brightness and the local stellar density. weuse mock galaxy catalogs that simulate the cmass selection function todetermine that randomly selecting galaxy redshifts in order to simulate theradial selection function of a random sample imparts the least systematic erroron correlation function measurements and that this systematic error isnegligible for the spherically averaged correlation function. the methods werecommend for the calculation of clustering measurements using the cmass sampleare adopted in companion papers that locate the position of the baryon acousticoscillation feature (anderson et al. 2012), constrain cosmological models usingthe full shape of the correlation function (sanchez et al. 2012), and measurethe rate of structure growth (reid et al. 2012).

1207.4321	investigating emission line galaxy surveys with the sloan digital sky  survey telescope	the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in the power spectrum ofgalaxies provides a standard ruler to probe the accelerated expansion of theuniverse. the current surveys covering a comoving volume sufficient to unveilthe bao scale are limited to redshift $z \lesssim 0.7$. in this paper, we studyseveral galaxy selection schemes aiming at building an emission-line-galaxy(elg) sample in the redshift range $0.6&lt;z&lt;1.7$, that would be suitable forfuture bao studies using the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)spectrograph on the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) telescope. we explore twodifferent colour selections using both the sdss and the canada france hawaitelescope legacy survey (cfht-ls) photometry in the u, g, r, and i bands andevaluate their performance selecting luminous elg. from about 2,000 elg, weidentified a selection scheme that has a 75 percent redshift measurementefficiency. this result confirms the feasibility of massive elg surveys usingthe boss spectrograph on the sdss telescope for a bao detection at redshift$z\sim1$, in particular the proposed eboss experiment, which plans to use thesdss telescope to combine the use of the bao ruler with redshift spacedistortions using emission line galaxies and quasars in the redshift$0.6&lt;z&lt;2.2$.

1207.6114	stellar masses of sdss-iii boss galaxies at z~0.5 and constraints to  galaxy formation models	we calculate stellar masses for massive luminous galaxies at redshift 0.2-0.7using the first two years of data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energydistributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies areused to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. accurateboss spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. we find that thedistribution of stellar masses in boss is narrow (delta log m~0.5 dex) andpeaks at about logm ~ 11.3 (for a kroupa initial stellar mass function), andthat the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, inagreement with the intended boss target selection. the galaxy masses probed byboss extend over ~10^{12} m, providing unprecedented measurements of thehigh-mass end of the galaxy mass function. we find that the galaxy numberdensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} m agrees with previous determinations. we perform acomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the bosstarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. the abundanceof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the boss data, butthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. moreover, no evolution withredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance ofmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. additionally, bossdata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in thelocal universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. on the otherhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span anarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. we argue that thelack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly dueto metallicity, which is too low in the models.

1207.7326	spectral classification and redshift measurement for the sdss-iii baryon  oscillation spectroscopic survey	(abridged) we describe the automated spectral classification, redshiftdetermination, and parameter measurement pipeline in use for the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii) as of data release 9, encompassing 831,000 moderate-resolutionoptical spectra. we give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe thechanges to the pipeline that have been implemented for boss relative toprevious sdss-i/ii versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasarredshift templates. for the color-selected cmass sample of massive galaxies atredshift 0.4 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 0.8 targeted by boss for the purposes of large-scalecosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classificationsuccess rate of 98.7% and confirms 95.4% of unique cmass targets as galaxies(with the balance being mostly m stars). based on visual inspections of asubset of boss galaxies, we find that ~0.2% of confidently reported cmasssample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and ~0.4% of all cmassspectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentiallyrecoverable. the boss pipeline confirms that ~51.5% of the quasar targets havequasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars. statistical (asopposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise aretypically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significanttail to a few hundreds of km/s for quasars. we test the accuracy of thesestatistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding themunderestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2for quasars. we assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, s/n, and otherfactors on galaxy redshift success. finally, we document known issues, anddescribe directions of ongoing development.

[...] we consider whetherthis configuration can be used to constrain cosmological parameters exploitingangular distance ratios entering the lens equations. constraints forsdssj0946+1006, are uninteresting due to the sub-optimal lens and sourceredshifts. we then consider the perturbing effect of the mass associated withring 1 building a double lens plane compound lens model. this introduces minorchanges to the mass of the main lens and allows to estimate the mass of ring 1$(\sigma_{sie,s1}=94\pm30\kms)$. we examine the prospects of doing cosmographywith a sample of 50 double lenses, expected from future space based surveyssuch as dune or jdem. taking full account of the model uncertainties, such asample could be used to measure $\omega_m$ and $w$ with 10% accuracy, for aflat cosmology.

1407.2240	the sloan lens acs survey. xii. extending strong lensing to lower masses	we present observational results from a new hubble space telescope (hst)snapshot program to extend the methods of the sloan lens acs (slacs) survey tolower lens-galaxy masses. we discover 40 new galaxy-scale strong lenses, whichwe supplement with 58 previously discovered slacs lenses. in addition, wedetermine the posterior pdfs of the einstein radius for 33 galaxies (18 new and15 from legacy slacs data) based on single lensed images. we find aless-than-unity slope of $0.64\pm0.06$ for the $\log_{10}{\sigma}_*$-$\log_{10} {\sigma}_{\rm sie}$ relation, which corresponds to a6-$\sigma$ evidence that the total mass-density profile of early-type galaxiesvaries systematically in the sense of being shallower at higher lens-galaxyvelocity dispersions. the trend is only significant when single-image systemsare considered, highlighting the importance of including both "lenses" and"non-lenses" for an unbiased treatment of the lens population when extending tolower mass ranges. by scaling simple stellar population models to the hsti-band data, we identify a strong trend of increasing dark-matter fraction athigher velocity dispersions, which can be alternatively interpreted as a trendin the stellar initial mass function (imf) normalization. consistent withprevious findings and the suggestion of a non-universal imf, we find that asalpeter imf is ruled out for galaxies with velocity dispersion less than $180$km/s. considered together, our mass-profile and dark-matter-fraction trendswith increasing galaxy mass could both be explained by an increasing relativecontribution on kiloparsec scales from a dark-matter halo with a spatialprofile more extended than that of the stellar component.

0803.2234	lensing probabilities for spectroscopically selected galaxy-galaxy  strong lenses	spectroscopic galaxy-galaxy lens searches are presently the most prolificmethod of identifying strong lens systems in large data sets. we study theprobabilities associated with these lens searches, namely the probability ofidentifying a candidate with rogue [oii] emission lines in a galaxy's spectrum,and the probability that the candidate will show features of strong lensing infollow-up photometric observations. we include selection effects unique tospectroscopic data, and apply them to the sloan lens acs (slacs) survey (boltonet al. 2006). the most significant selection effect is the finite size of thespectroscopic fiber which selects against large separation lenses and resultsin a non-monotonic dependence of the rogue line probability on velocitydispersion. for example, with the 3 arcsec diameter sdss fiber and 2 arcsecfwhm seeing, we find that the probability that a given lrg has a rogue [oii]line in its spectrum decreases with velocity dispersion from 150 km/s to 300km/s and then increases up to 400 km/s for a given source size. the totalprobability for observing a rogue line in a single survey spectrum is~0.9-3.0%, and the total lensing rate is ~0.5-1.3%. the range is due touncertainties in the physical size of [oii] emission regions, and in theevolution of the [oii] luminosity function. our estimates are a factor of ~5higher than the results of the slacs survey, a discrepancy which we attributeto the slacs requirement that multiple rogue lines be observed simultaneously.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1501.00963	the eleventh and twelfth data releases of the sloan digital sky survey:  final data from sdss-iii	the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii) took datafrom 2008 to 2014 using the original sdss wide-field imager, the original andan upgraded multi-object fiber-fed optical spectrograph, a new near-infraredhigh-resolution spectrograph, and a novel optical interferometer. all the datafrom sdss-iii are now made public. in particular, this paper describes datarelease 11 (dr11) including all data acquired through 2013 july, and datarelease 12 (dr12) adding data acquired through 2014 july (including all dataincluded in previous data releases), marking the end of sdss-iii observing.relative to our previous public release (dr10), dr12 adds one million newspectra of galaxies and quasars from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) over an additional 3000 sq. deg of sky, more than triples thenumber of h-band spectra of stars as part of the apache point observatory (apo)galactic evolution experiment (apogee), and includes repeated accurate radialvelocity measurements of 5500 stars from the multi-object apo radial velocityexoplanet large-area survey (marvels). the apogee outputs now include measuredabundances of 15 different elements for each star. in total, sdss-iii added2350 sq. deg of ugriz imaging; 155,520 spectra of 138,099 stars as part of thesloan exploration of galactic understanding and evolution 2 (segue-2) survey;2,497,484 boss spectra of 1,372,737 galaxies, 294,512 quasars, and 247,216stars over 9376 sq. deg; 618,080 apogee spectra of 156,593 stars; and 197,040marvels spectra of 5,513 stars. since its first light in 1998, sdss has imagedover 1/3 of the celestial sphere in five bands and obtained over five millionastronomical spectra.

1505.03866	a steep slope and small scatter for the high-mass end of the l-$\sigma$  relation at $z\sim0.55$	we measure the intrinsic relation between velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) andluminosity ($l$) for massive, luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at redshift $z \sim0.55$. we achieve unprecedented precision by using a sample of 600,000 galaxieswith spectra from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) of thethird sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iii), covering a range of stellar masses$m_* \gtrsim 10^{11} m_{\odot}$. we deconvolve the effects of photometricerrors, limited spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio, and red--blue galaxyconfusion using a novel hierarchical bayesian formalism that is generallyapplicable to any combination of photometric and spectroscopic observables. foran l-$\sigma$ relation of the form $l \propto \sigma^{\beta}$, we find $\beta =7.8 \pm 1.1$ for $\sigma$ corrected to the effective radius, and a very smallintrinsic scatter of $s = 0.047 \pm 0.004$ in $\log_{10} \sigma$ at fixed $l$.no significant redshift evolution is found for these parameters. the evolutionof the zero-point within the redshift range considered is consistent with thepassive evolution of a galaxy population that formed at redshift $z=2-3$,assuming single stellar populations. an analysis of previously reported resultsseems to indicate that the passively-evolved high-mass l-$\sigma$ relation at$z\sim0.55$ is consistent with the one measured at $z=0.1$. our results, incombination with those presented in montero-dorta et al. (2014), provide adetailed description of the high-mass end of the red sequence (rs) at$z\sim0.55$. this characterization, in the light of previous literature,suggest that the high-mass rs distribution corresponds to the "core" ellipticalpopulation.

0805.1931	the sloan lens acs survey. v. the full acs strong-lens sample	we present the definitive data for the full sample of 131 stronggravitational lens candidates observed with the advanced camera for surveys(acs) aboard the hubble space telescope by the sloan lens acs (slacs) survey.all targets were selected for higher-redshift emission lines and lower-redshiftcontinuum in a single sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectrum. the foregroundgalaxies are primarily of early-type morphology, with redshifts fromapproximately 0.05 to 0.5 and velocity dispersions from 160 km/s to 400 km/s;the faint background emission-line galaxies have redshifts ranging from about0.2 to 1.2. we confirm 70 systems showing clear evidence of multiple imaging ofthe background galaxy by the foreground galaxy, as well as an additional 19systems with probable multiple imaging. for 63 clear lensing systems, wepresent singular isothermal ellipsoid and light-traces-mass gravitational lensmodels fitted to the acs imaging data. these strong-lensing mass measurementsare supplemented by magnitudes and effective radii measured from acssurface-brightness photometry and redshifts and velocity dispersions measuredfrom sdss spectroscopy. these data constitute a unique resource for thequantitative study of the inter-relations between mass, light, and kinematicsin massive early-type galaxies. we show that the slacs lens sample isstatistically consistent with being drawn at random from a parent sample ofsdss galaxies with comparable spectroscopic parameters and effective radii,suggesting that the results of slacs analyses can be generalized to the massiveearly-type population.

0805.1932	the sloan lens acs survey. vii. elliptical galaxy scaling laws from  direct observational mass measurements	we use a sample of 53 massive early-type strong gravitational lens galaxieswith well-measured redshifts (ranging from z=0.06 to 0.36) and stellar velocitydispersions (between 175 and 400 km/s) from the sloan lens acs (slacs) surveyto derive numerous empirical scaling relations. the ratio between centralstellar velocity dispersion and isothermal lens-model velocity dispersion isnearly unity within errors. the slacs lenses define a fundamental plane (fp)that is consistent with the fp of the general population of early-typegalaxies. we measure the relationship between strong-lensing mass m_lens withinone-half effective radius (r_e/2) and the dimensional mass variable m_dim =g^-1 sigma_e2^2 r_e/2 to be log_10 [m_lens/10^11 m_sun] = (1.03 +/- 0.04)log_10 [m_dim/10^11 m_sun] + (0.54 +/- 0.02) (where sigma_e2 is the projectedstellar velocity dispersion within r_e/2). the near-unity slope indicates thatthe mass-dynamical structure of massive elliptical galaxies is independent ofmass, and that the "tilt" of the slacs fp is due entirely to variation in total(luminous plus dark) mass-to-light ratio with mass. our results imply thatdynamical masses serve as a good proxies for true masses in massive ellipticalgalaxies. regarding the slacs lenses as a homologous population, we find thatthe average enclosed 2d mass profile goes as log_10 [m(&lt;r)/m_dim] = (1.10 +/-0.09) log_10 [r/r_e] + (0.85 +/- 0.03), consistent with an isothermal (flatrotation curve) model when de-projected into 3d. this measurement isinconsistent with the slope of the average projected aperture luminosityprofile at a confidence level greater than 99.9%, implying a minimumdark-matter fraction of f_dm = 0.38 +/- 0.07 within one effective radius.(abridged)
