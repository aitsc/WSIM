0901.4783	an x-ray/optical study of the complex dynamics of the core of the  massive intermediate-redshift cluster macsj0717.5+3745	using chandra, we investigate the spatial temperature distribution of theintracluster medium (icm) within 700 kpc of the center of the massive mergingcluster macsj0717.5+3745 at z=0.55. combining the x-ray evidence withinformation about the distribution and velocities of the cluster galaxies nearthe core provides us with a snapshot of the three-dimensional geometry anddynamics of one of the most complex cluster studied to date. we findmacsj0717.5+3745 to be an active triple merger with icm temperatures exceeding20 kev. although radial velocity information and x-ray/optical offsets indicatethat all three mergers proceed along distinctly different directions, thepartial alignment of the merger axes points to a common origin in thelarge-scale filament south-east of the cluster core. clear decrements in theicm temperature observed near two of these subclusters identify the respectivex-ray surface brightness peaks as remnants of cool cores; the compactness andlow temperature of 5.7 kev of one of these features suggest that the respectivemerger, a high-velocity collision at 3,000 km/s, is still in its very earlystages. looking beyond the triple merger, we find the large-scale filament tonot only provide a spatial as well as temporal arrow for the interpretation ofthe dynamics of the merger events near the cluster core; we also findtantalizing, if circumstantial, evidence for direct, large-scale heating of theicm by contiguous infall of low-density gas from the filament.

0909.3098	the observed growth of massive galaxy clusters i: statistical methods  and cosmological constraints	(abridged) this is the first of a series of papers in which we derivesimultaneous constraints on cosmological parameters and x-ray scaling relationsusing observations of the growth of massive, x-ray flux-selected galaxyclusters. our data set consists of 238 clusters drawn from the rosat all-skysurvey, and incorporates extensive follow-up observations using the chandrax-ray observatory. here we describe and implement a new statistical frameworkrequired to self-consistently produce simultaneous constraints on cosmology andscaling relations from such data, and present results on models of dark energy.in spatially flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state, w, thecluster data yield omega_m=0.23 +- 0.04, sigma_8=0.82 +- 0.05, and w=-1.01 +-0.20, marginalizing over conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties.these constraints agree well and are competitive with independent data in theform of cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies, type ia supernovae(snia), cluster gas mass fractions (fgas), baryon acoustic oscillations (bao),galaxy redshift surveys, and cosmic shear. the combination of our data withcurrent cmb, snia, fgas, and bao data yields omega_m=0.27 +- 0.02, sigma_8=0.79+- 0.03, and w=-0.96 +- 0.06 for flat, constant w models. for evolving wmodels, marginalizing over transition redshifts in the range 0.05-1, weconstrain the equation of state at late and early times to be respectivelyw_0=-0.88 +- 0.21 and w_et=-1.05 +0.20 -0.36. the combined data provideconstraints equivalent to a detf fom of 15.5. our results highlight the powerof x-ray studies to constrain cosmology. however, the new statistical frameworkwe apply to this task is equally applicable to cluster studies at otherwavelengths.

(2009a), we simultaneously and self-consistently model the growthof x-ray luminous clusters and their observable-mass scaling relations,accounting for survey biases, parameter degeneracies and systematicuncertainties. we combine the cluster growth data with gas mass fraction, snia,bao and cmb data. this combination leads to a tight correlation between gammaand sigma_8. consistency with gr requires gamma~0.55. under the assumption ofself-similar evolution and constant scatter in the scaling relations, and for aflat lcdm model, we measure gamma(sigma_8/0.8)^6.8=0.55+0.13-0.10, with0.79&lt;sigma_8&lt;0.89. relaxing the assumptions on the scaling relations byintroducing two additional parameters to model possible evolution in thenormalization and scatter of the luminosity-mass relation, we obtain consistentconstraints on gamma that are only ~20% weaker than those above. allowing thedark energy equation of state, w, to take any constant value, we simultaneouslyconstrain the growth and expansion histories, and find no evidence fordepartures from either gr or lcdm. our results represent the most robustconsistency test of gr on cosmological scales to date.

1004.2048	the lensing efficiencies of macs x-ray selected versus rcs optically  selected galaxy clusters	the statistics of strongly lensed arcs in samples of galaxy clusters provideinformation on cluster structure that is complementary to that from individualclusters. however, samples of clusters that have been analyzed to date havebeen either small, heterogeneous, or observed with limited angular resolution.we measure the lensed-arc statistics of 97 clusters imaged at high angularresolution with the hubble space telescope, identifying lensed arcs using twoautomated arc detection algorithms. the sample includes similar numbers ofx-ray selected (macs) and optically selected (rcs) clusters, and spans clusterredshifts in the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1. we compile a catalogue of 42 arcs in thex-ray selected subsample and 7 arcs in the optical subsample. all but five ofthese arcs are reported here for the first time. at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.7, the x-rayselected clusters have a significantly higher mean frequency of arcs, 1.2+/-0.2per cluster, versus 0.2+/-0.1 in the optical sample. the strikingly differentlensing efficiencies indicate that x-ray clusters trace much larger massconcentrations, despite the similar optical luminosities of the x-ray andoptical clusters. the mass difference is supported also by the lower spacedensity of the x-ray clusters, and by the small einstein radii of the few arcsin the optical sample. higher-order effects, such as differences inconcentration or substructure, may also contribute.

1006.3757	the type ia supernova rate in redshift 0.5--0.9 galaxy clusters	supernova (sn) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichmentand sn physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep,metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star-formation histories. wehave carried out a survey for supernovae (sne) in galaxy clusters, at aredshift range 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9, using the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on thehubble space telescope. we reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that werepreviously imaged by acs, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster, inwhich we discovered five likely cluster sne, six possible cluster sne ia, twohostless sn candidates, and several background and foreground events. keckspectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. weconducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellarluminosities of the clusters using subaru images. we derive a cluster sn rateof 0.35 snub +0.17/-0.12 (statistical) \pm0.13 (classification) \pm0.01(systematic) [where snub = sne (100 yr 10^10 l_b_sun)^-1] and 0.112 snum+0.055/-0.039 (statistical) \pm0.042 (classification) \pm0.005 (systematic)[where snum = sne (100 yr 10^10 m_sun)^-1]. as in previous measurements ofcluster sn rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics.the sn rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the sn rate in clusters atlower redshifts (to within the uncertainties), and shows that there is, atmost, only a slight increase of cluster sn rate with increasing redshift. thelow and fairly constant sn ia rate out to z~1 implies that the bulk of the ironmass in clusters was already in place by z~1. the recently observed doubling ofiron abundances in the intracluster medium between z=1 and 0, if real, islikely the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than newproduction of iron.

1010.0253	extreme agn feedback and cool core destruction in the x-ray luminous  galaxy cluster macs j1931.8-2634	we report on a deep, multiwavelength study of the galaxy cluster macsj1931.8-2634 using chandra x-ray, subaru optical, and vla 1.4 ghz radio data.this cluster (z=0.352) harbors one of the most x-ray luminous cool cores yetdiscovered, with an equivalent mass cooling rate within the central 50 kpc isapproximately 700 solar masses/yr. unique features observed in the central coreof macsj1931.8-2634 hint to a wealth of past activity that has greatlydisrupted the original cool core. we observe a spiral of relatively cool,dense, x-ray emitting gas connected to the cool core, as well as highlyelongated intracluster light (icl) surrounding the cd galaxy. extended radioemission is observed surrounding the central agn, elongated in the east-westdirection, spatially coincident with x-ray cavities. the power input requiredto inflate these `bubbles' is estimated from both the x-ray and radio emissionto reside between 4 and 14e45 erg/s, putting it among the most powerful jetsever observed. this combination of a powerful agn outburst and bulk motion ofthe cool core have resulted in two x-ray bright ridges to form to the north andsouth of the central agn at a distance of approximately 25 kpc. the northernridge has spectral characteristics typical of cool cores and is consistent withbeing a remnant of the cool core after it was disrupted by the agn and bulkmotions. it is also the site of h-alpha filaments and young stars. the x-rayspectroscopic cooling rate associated with this ridge is approximately 165solar masses/yr, which agrees with the estimate of the star formation rate frombroad-band optical imaging (170 solar masses/yr). macs j1931.8-2634 appears toharbor one of most profoundly disrupted low entropy cores observed in acluster, and offers new insights into the survivability of cool cores in thecontext of hierarchical structure formation.

1102.5092	discovery of a possibly old galaxy at $z=6.027$, multiply imaged by the  massive cluster abell 383	we report the discovery of a unique $z=6.027$ galaxy, multiply imaged by thecluster abell 383 and detected in new hubble space telescope acs and wfc3imaging, as well as in warm spitzer observations. this galaxy was selected as apair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by themeasurement of a strong lyman-alpha line in both images using keck/deimos.combining hubble and spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination byline emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong balmerbreak of 1.5 magnitudes. taking into account the magnification factor of11.4+/-1.9 (2.65+/-0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed ab magnitudefor the source is 27.2+/-0.05 in the h band, corresponding to a 0.4 l* galaxy,and 25.7+/-0.08 at 3.6 um. the uv slope is consistent with beta~2.0, and fromthe rest-frame uv continuum we measure a current star formation rate of2.4+/-1.1 msol/yr. the unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc,from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of ~10 msol/yr/kpc2. thelyman-alpha emission is found to be extended over ~3" along the slit,corresponding to ~5 kpc in the source plane. this can be explained by thepresence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-formingregion. finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution using 7 photometricdata points with simple sed models, we derive the following properties: verylittle reddening, an inferred stellar mass of m*=6e9 msol, and an inferred ageof ~800 myrs (corresponding to a redshift of formation of ~18). thestar-formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than atthe time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction ofgalaxies at z~6 which have already faded in rest-frame uv wavelengths.

1209.2492	the three-dimensional geometry and merger history of the massive galaxy  cluster macs j0358.8-2955	we present results of a combined x-ray/optical analysis of the dynamics ofthe massive cluster macs j0358.8-2955 (z=0.428) based on observations with thechandra x-ray observatory, the hubble space telescope, and the keck-i telescopeon mauna kea. macs j0358.8-2955 is found to be one of the most x-ray luminousclusters known at z&gt;0.3, featuring l_x(&lt;r_500) = 4.24*10^45 erg/s, kt = (9.55+0.58/-0.37) kev, m^{3d}_{gas}(&lt;r_500) = (9.18+/-1.45)*10^13 m_sun, andm^{3d}_{tot}(&lt;r_500) = (1.12+/-0.18)*10^15 m_sun. the system's high velocitydispersion of (1440 +130/-110) km/s (890 km/s when the correct relativisticequation is used), however, is inflated by infall along the line of sight, asthe result of a complex merger of at least three sub-clusters. one collisionproceeds close to head-on, while the second features a significant impactparameter. the temperature variations in the intra-cluster gas, two tentativecold fronts, the radial velocities measured for cluster galaxies, and the smalloffsets between collisional and non-collisional cluster components all suggestthat both merger events are observed close to core passage and along axes thatare greatly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky. a strong-lensinganalysis of the system anchored upon three triple-image systems (two of whichhave spectroscopic redshifts) yields independent constraints on the massdistribution. for a gas fraction of 8.2%, the resulting strong-lensing massprofile is in good agreement with our x-ray estimates, and the details of themass distribution are fully consistent with our interpretation of thethree-dimensional merger history of this complex system.

1312.6135	jellyfish: evidence of extreme ram-pressure stripping in massive galaxy  clusters	ram-pressure stripping by the gaseous intra-cluster medium has been proposedas the dominant physical mechanism driving the rapid evolution of galaxies indense environments. detailed studies of this process have, however, largelybeen limited to relatively modest examples affecting only the outermost gaslayers of galaxies in nearby and/or low-mass galaxy clusters. we here presentresults from our search for extreme cases of gas-galaxy interactions in muchmore massive, x-ray selected clusters at $z&gt;0.3$. using hubble space telescopesnapshots in the f606w and f814w passbands, we have discovered dramaticevidence of ram-pressure stripping in which copious amounts of gas are firstshock compressed and then removed from galaxies falling into the cluster.vigorous starbursts triggered by this process across the galaxy-gas interfaceand in the debris trail cause these galaxies to temporarily become some of thebrightest cluster members in the f606w passband, capable of outshining even thebrightest cluster galaxy. based on the spatial distribution and orientation ofsystems viewed nearly edge-on in our survey, we speculate that infall at largeimpact parameter gives rise to particularly long-lasting stripping events. oursample of six spectacular examples identified in clusters from the massivecluster survey, all featuring $m_{\rm f606w}&lt;-$21 mag, doubles the number ofsuch systems presently known at $z&gt;0.2$ and facilitates detailed quantitativestudies of the most violent galaxy evolution in clusters.

1402.2670	robust weak-lensing mass calibration of planck galaxy clusters	in light of the tension in cosmological constraints reported by the planckteam between their sz-selected cluster counts and cosmic microwave background(cmb) temperature anisotropies, we compare the planck cluster mass estimateswith robust, weak-lensing mass measurements from the weighing the giants (wtg)project. for the 22 clusters in common between the planck cosmology sample andwtg, we find an overall mass ratio of $\left&lt; m_{planck}/m_{\rm wtg} \right&gt; =0.688 \pm 0.072$. extending the sample to clusters not used in the planckcosmology analysis yields a consistent value of $\left&lt; m_{planck}/m_{\rm wtg}\right&gt; = 0.698 \pm 0.062$ from 38 clusters in common. identifying theweak-lensing masses as proxies for the true cluster mass (on average), theseratios are $\sim 1.6\sigma$ lower than the default mass bias of 0.8 assumed inthe planck cluster analysis. adopting the wtg weak-lensing-based masscalibration would substantially reduce the tension found between the planckcluster count cosmology results and those from cmb temperature anisotropies,thereby dispensing of the need for "new physics" such as uncomfortably largeneutrino masses (in the context of the measured planck temperature anisotropiesand other data). we also find modest evidence (at 95 per cent confidence) for amass dependence of the calibration ratio and discuss its potential origin inlight of systematic uncertainties in the temperature calibration of the x-raymeasurements used to calibrate the planck cluster masses. our results exemplifythe critical role that robust absolute mass calibration plays in clustercosmology, and the invaluable role of accurate weak-lensing mass measurementsin this regard.

1407.4516	weighing the giants iv: cosmology and neutrino mass	we employ robust weak gravitational lensing measurements to improvecosmological constraints from measurements of the galaxy cluster mass functionand its evolution, using x-ray selected clusters detected in the rosat all-skysurvey. our lensing analysis constrains the absolute mass scale of suchclusters at the 8 per cent level, including both statistical and systematicuncertainties. combining it with the survey data and x-ray follow-upobservations, we find a tight constraint on a combination of the mean matterdensity and late-time normalization of the matter power spectrum,$\sigma_8(\omega_m/0.3)^{0.17}=0.81\pm0.03$, with marginalized, one-dimensionalconstraints of $\omega_m=0.26\pm0.03$ and $\sigma_8=0.83\pm0.04$. for these twoparameters, this represents a factor of two improvement in precision withrespect to previous work, primarily due to the reduced systematic uncertaintyin the absolute mass calibration provided by the lensing analysis. our newresults are in good agreement with constraints from cosmic microwave background(cmb) data, both wmap and planck (plus wmap polarization), under the assumptionof a flat $\lambda$cdm cosmology with minimal neutrino mass. consequently, wefind no evidence for non-minimal neutrino mass from the combination of clusterdata with cmb, supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements,regardless of which all-sky cmb data set is used (and independent of the recentclaimed detection of b-modes on degree scales). we also present improvedconstraints on models of dark energy (both constant and evolving),modifications of gravity, and primordial non-gaussianity. assuming flatness,the constraints for a constant dark energy equation of state from the clusterdata alone are at the 15 per cent level, improving to $\sim 6$ per cent whenthe cluster data are combined with other leading probes.

astro-ph;0008315	an hst lensing survey of x-ray luminous galaxy clusters: i. a383	we analyse the mass distribution in the core of a383 (z=0.188), one of 12x-ray luminous clusters at z~0.2 selected for a comprehensive and unbiasedstudy of the mass distribution in massive clusters. deep hst imaging reveals awide variety of gravitationally lensed features in a383, including a giant arcformed from the strongly-lensed images of 2 background galaxies, 2 radial arcs,several multiply-imaged arcs and numerous arclets. based upon the constraintsfrom the various lensed features, we construct a detailed mass model for thecentral regions of the cluster, taking into account both the cluster-scalepotential and perturbations from individual cluster galaxies. keck spectroscopyof one component of the giant arc identifies it as a star-forming galaxy atz=1.01 and provides an accurate measurement of the cluster mass within theradius of the giant arc (65kpc) of (3.5+/-0.1)*10^13 mo. using the weak shearmeasured from our hst observations we extend our mass model to determine a massof (1.8+/-0.2)*10^14 mo within a radius of 250kpc. on smaller scales we employthe radial arcs as probes of the shape of the mass distribution in the clustercore (r&lt;20kpc), and find that the mass profile is more peaked than a single nfwprofile. the optical and x-ray properties of a383 indicate the presence of acentral cooling flow, for which we derive a mass deposition rate of &gt;200 mo/yr.we also use the x-ray emission from a383 to obtain independent estimates of thetotal mass within projected radii of 65 and 250kpc: (4.0+/-1.4)*10^13 mo and(1.2+/-0.5)*10^14 mo, which are consistent with the lensing measurements.[abridged]

astro-ph;0109465	a hubble space telescope lensing survey of x-ray luminous galaxy  clusters: ii. a search for gravitationally lensed eros	we present the results of a survey for extremely red objects (eros) in thefields of ten galaxy cluster lenses at z~0.2, combining high-resolution hubblespace telescope imaging with deep k-band imaging from ukirt. we detect 60 eroswith r-k&gt;=5.3, of which 26 have r-k&gt;=6.0 in a total image plane survey area of49arcmin^2 down to k=20.6. we use detailed models of the cluster lenses toquantify the lens amplification and thus correct the observed number counts andsurvey area for the effects of gravitational lensing. after making thesecorrections, we estimate surface densities at k&lt;=21.6 of 2.5+/-0.4 and1.2+/-0.3 arcmin^-2 for eros with r-k&gt;=5.3 and 6.0 respectively. these eronumber counts agree with previous shallower surveys at k&lt;~19 and flattensignificantly at magnitudes fainter than k~19-20. this flattening may be due toa transition from an ero population dominated by evolved galaxies at z~1-2(k&lt;~19.5) to one dominated by dusty starburst galaxies at z&gt;1 (k&gt;~19.5). wealso compare our results with various model predictions, including a model thatattempts to explain eros in terms of a single population of elliptical galaxiesformed at high redshift. we find that a formation epoch of z_f~2.5 for thispopulation matches the observed surface density of r-k&gt;=5.3 eros quite well,and the r-k&gt;=6.0 sample less well. more sophisticated models, includingsemi-analytic prescriptions, under-predict the ero surface density byapproximately an order of magnitude, suggesting that these models produceinsufficient stars and/or dust at high redshift.

astro-ph;0311205	a unique small-scale gravitational arc in abell 1201	we present a snapshot hubble space telescope (hst) image of the galaxycluster a1201 (z=0.169), revealing a tangential arc 2arcsec from the brightestcluster galaxy (bcg). keck-esi spectroscopy confirms that the arc isgravitational in nature and that the source galaxy lies at z=0.451. weconstruct a model of the gravitational potential of the cluster that faithfullyreproduces the observed arc morphology. despite the relaxed appearance of thecluster in the hst frame, the best fit ellipticity of the total matterdistribution is epsilon_total&gt;0.5, in contrast to the light distribution of thebcg epsilon_bcg=0.23+/-0.03 on 2'' scales. further deep optical observationsand pointed x-ray spectro-imaging observations with chandra are required todetermine whether this elongation is due to a single elongated dark matterhalo, or a more complex distribution of matter in the cluster core. we comparethe arc with a sample drawn from the published literature, and confirm that itis unique among tangential systems in the small physical scales that it probes(6kpc). in anticipation of a more thorough investigation of this cluster acrossa broad range of physical scales, we use our fiducial lens model to estimatethe projected mass and mass-to-light ratio of the cluster within a radius of6kpc, obtaining: m=(5.9^+0.9_-0.7)x10^11 m_o, m/l_v=9.4^+2.4_-2.1(m/l)_o.overall our results confirm the importance of hst snapshot surveys foridentifying rare lensing constraints on cluster mass distributions. incombination with follow--up optical and x-ray observations, the arc in a1201should help to increase our understanding of the physics of cluster cores.

astro-ph;0403275	the dipole anisotropy of the first all-sky x-ray cluster sample	we combine the recently published ciza galaxy cluster catalogue with thexbacs cluster sample to produce the first all-sky catalogue of x-ray clustersin order to examine the origins of the local group's peculiar velocity withoutthe use of reconstruction methods to fill the traditional zone of avoidance.the advantages of this approach are (i) x-ray emitting clusters tend to tracethe deepest potential wells and therefore have the greatest effect on thedynamics of the local group and (ii) our all-sky sample provides data fornearly a quarter of the sky that is largely incomplete in optical clustercatalogues. we find that the direction of the local group's peculiar velocityis well aligned with the cmb as early as the great attractor region 40 h^-1 mpcaway, but that the amplitude of its dipole motion is largely set between 140and 160 h^-1 mpc. unlike previous studies using galaxy samples, we find thatwithout virgo included, roughly ~70% of our dipole signal comes from massconcentrations at large distances (&gt;60 h^-1 mpc) and does not flatten,indicating isotropy in the cluster distribution, until at least 160 h^-1 mpc.we also present a detailed discussion of our dipole profile, linking observedfeatures to the structures and superclusters that produce them. we find thatmost of the dipole signal can be attributed to the shapley superclustercentered at about 150 h^-1 mpc and a handful of very massive individualclusters, some of which are newly discovered and lie well in the zone ofavoidance.

astro-ph;0403588	a hubble space telescope lensing survey of x-ray luminous galaxy  clusters: iv. mass, structure and thermodynamics of cluster cores at z=0.2	we present a comprehensive space-based study of ten x-ray luminous galaxyclusters (l_x&gt;=8e44erg/s[0.1-2.4kev]) at z=0.2. hubble space telescopeobservations reveal numerous gravitationally-lensed arcs for which we presentfour new spectroscopic redshifts, bringing the total to thirteen confirmed arcsin this cluster sample. we combine the multiple-image systems with theweakly-sheared background galaxies to model the total mass distribution in thecluster cores (r&lt;=500kpc). these models are complemented by high-resolutionx-ray data from chandra and used to develop quantitative criteria to classifythe clusters as relaxed or unrelaxed. formally, (30+/-20)% of the clusters forma homogeneous sub-sample of relaxed clusters; the remaining (70+/-20)% areunrelaxed and are a much more diverse population. most of the clusterstherefore appear to be experiencing a cluster-cluster merger, or relaxing aftersuch an event. we also study the normalization and scatter of scaling relationsbetween cluster mass, luminosity and temperature. the scatter in theserelations is dominated by the unrelaxed clusters and is typically sigma~0.4.most notably, we detect 2-3 times more scatter in the mass-temperature relationthan theoretical simulations and models predict. the observed scatter is alsoasymmetric - the unrelaxed systems are systematically 40% hotter than therelaxed clusters at 2.5 sigma significance. this structural segregation shouldbe a major concern for experiments designed to constrain cosmologicalparameters using galaxy clusters. overall our results are consistent with ascenario of cluster-cluster merger induced boosts to cluster x-ray luminositiesand temperatures.

astro-ph;0503204	the origin of the spatial distribution of x-ray luminous agn in massive  galaxy clusters	we study the spatial distribution of a 95% complete sample of 508 x-ray pointsources (xps) detected in the 0.5-2.0 kev band in chandra acis-i observationsof 51 massive galaxy clusters found in the macs survey. covering the redshiftrange z=0.3-0.7, our cluster sample is statistically complete and comprises allmacs clusters with x-ray luminosities in excess of 4.5 x 10^44 erg/s (0.1-2.4kev, h_0=0.7, lcdm). also studied are 20 control fields that do not containclusters. we find the xps surface density, computed in the cluster restframe,to exhibit a pronounced excess within 3.5 mpc of the cluster centers. theexcess, believed to be caused by agn in the cluster, is significant at the 8.0sigma confidence level compared to the xps density observed at the field edges.no significant central excess is found in the control fields. to investigatethe physical origin of the agn excess, we study the radial agn density profilefor a subset of 24 virialized clusters. we find a pronounced central spike(r&lt;0.5 mpc), followed by a depletion region at about 1.5 mpc, and a broadsecondary excess centered at approximately the virial radius of the hostclusters (~2.5 mpc). we present evidence that the central agn excess reflectsincreased nuclear activity triggered by close encounters between infallinggalaxies and the giant cd-type elliptical occupying the very cluster center. bycontrast, the secondary excess at the cluster-field interface is likely due toblack holes being fueled by galaxy mergers. in-depth spectroscopic andphotometric follow-up observations of the optical counterparts of the xps in asubset of our sample are being conducted to confirm this picture.

astro-ph;0510106	on the origin of the local group's peculiar velocity	we aim to settle the debate regarding the fraction of the local group'speculiar velocity that is induced by structures beyond the great attractor bycalculating the dipole anisotropy of the largest, all-sky, truly x-ray selectedcluster sample compiled to date. the sample is the combination of the reflexcatalog in the southern hemisphere, the ebcs sample in the north, and the cizasurvey in the galactic plane. the composite reflex+ebcs+ciza sample overcomesmany of the problems inherent to previous galaxy and cluster catalogs whichlimited their effectiveness in determining the origin of the local group'smotion. from the dipole anisotropy present in the cluster distribution wedetermine that 44% of the local group's peculiar velocity is due to infall intothe ga region, while 56% is in the form of a large-scale flow induced by moredistant overdensities between 130 and 180 h^-1 mpc away. in agreement withprevious analyses, we find that the shapley supercluster is the singleoverdensity most responsible for the increase in the dipole amplitude beyond130 h^-1 mpc, generating 30.4% of the large-scale contribution. we find thatnumerous groupings and loose associations of clusters at roughly the samedistance as the shapley region induce a significant acceleration on the localgroup. these include the well known horologium-reticulum concentration, as wellas newly noted associations centered on abell 3667 and abell 3391 and a stringof ciza clusters near c1410 which may trace an extension of the shapley complexinto the zone of avoidance. we also note that the large-scale anisotropymeasured in the cluster distribution near 150 h^-1 mpc may be due to anobserved underdensity of clusters in the northern hemisphere near thisdistance.

astro-ph;0511768	an analytic investigation of the scatter in the integrated x-ray  properties of galaxy groups and clusters	(abridged) we revisit the scaling relationships between the dark matter massand observed x-ray luminosity and temperature of galaxy clusters and groups inthe local universe. specifically, we compare recent observations with analyticmodels of the intracluster medium in which the gas entropy distribution hasbeen shifted by a variable amount, k0, to investigate the origin of the scatterin these scaling relations, and its influence on the luminosity and temperaturefunctions. we find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch(which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) areinsufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation.instead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately50 kev sq.cm to 700 kev sq.cm, is required to match the data. this range islikely related to the variance in heating and/or cooling efficiency from haloto halo. we demonstrate that these models are consistent with the observedtemperature and luminosity functions of clusters, if scatter in themass-luminosity relation is accounted for. finally, we present predictions forthe redshift evolution of these scaling relations and luminosity/temperaturefunctions. comparison with recent data at z&lt;0.7 shows reasonable agreement witha model that assumes a median entropy floor of k0=200 kev sq.cm. whenobservations are extended to group scales (kt &lt; 1 kev), this evolution willhave the potential to discriminate between an entropy floor that is independentof redshift (for example, in a preheating scenario) and one that depends on thecooling time of the halo.

astro-ph;0512321	mapping large-scale structures behind the galactic plane: the second  ciza subsample	we present the latest results of the clusters in the zone of avoidance (ciza)survey, which is mapping the large-scale matter distribution behind the milkyway by performing the first systematic search for x-ray luminous galaxyclusters at low galactic latitudes. the survey's approach, which uses x-rayemission to locate cluster candidates, overcomes the problems faced byoptically selected cluster surveys which have traditionally avoided this regionof the sky due to the severe extinction present along the galactic plane. wehere present the second flux-limited ciza cluster catalog containing 60 x-rayluminous galaxy clusters, 88% of which are new discoveries. we also examine thedegree to which known superclusters extend into the zone of avoidance andhighlight newly discovered structures which have previously gone unnoticed. weshow that the survey has found far fewer rich clusters in the great attractorregion than would be expected given the region's proposed mass. instead, wefind a significant increase in the number of clusters behind the greatattractor, with the most notable being an association of clusters near theshapley supercluster. we propose these clusters trace an extension of thelarge-scale filament network in which the shapley concentration is embedded. wealso highlight an association of clusters near the galactic anticenter, whichis the first supercluster found to be completely hidden by the milky way. ourfinding of a less massive great attractor and the detection of significantstructures behind the complex supports studies which suggest the motion ofnearby galaxies, including that of the local group, is due, in part, to alarge-scale bulk flow which is induced by overdensities beyond the greatattractor region.

astro-ph;0702705	a statistical study of multiply-imaged systems in the lensing cluster  abell 68	we have carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey with the keck and vlttelescopes, targeting lensed galaxies in the background of the massive clusterabell 68. spectroscopic measurements are obtained for 26 lensed images,including a distant galaxy at z=5.4 . redshifts have been determined for 5 outof 7 multiply-image systems. through a careful modeling of the massdistribution in the strongly-lensed regime, we derive a mass estimate of 5.3 x10^14 msun within 500 kpc. our mass model is then used to constrain theredshift distribution of the remaining multiply-imaged and singly-imagedsources. this enables us to examine the physical properties for a subsample of7 lyman-alpha emitters at 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 5.5, whose unlensed luminosities of ~ 10^41ergs/s are fainter than similar objects found in blank fields. of particularinterest is an extended lyman-alpha emission region surrounding a highlymagnified source at z=2.6, detected in vimos integral field spectroscopy data.the physical scale of the most distant lensed source at z=5.4 is very small(&lt;300 pc), similar to the lensed z ~ 5.6 emitter reported by ellis et al.(2001) in abell 2218. new photometric data available for abell 2218 allow for adirect comparison between these two unique objects. our survey illustrates thepracticality of using lensing clusters to probe the faint end of the z ~ 2-5lyman-alpha luminosity function in a manner that is complementary to blankfield narrow-band surveys.

astro-ph;9611083	the environmental dependence of brightest cluster galaxies: implications  for large-scale flows	(shortened) we construct a subsample of the lauer &amp; postman (lp) brightestcluster galaxy (bcg) sample which comprises 64 abell/aco clusters with x-rayluminosities from rosat. we find that both bcg metric luminosities andresiduals from the l-alpha relation of lp are significantly correlated with thex-ray luminosity of the cluster at the 99.6% confidence level, in the sensethat more x-ray luminous clusters have brighter bcgs. the strength of thiscorrelation increases with increasing x-ray luminosity and with increasingvalues of alpha. we obtain a new distance indicator for bcgs, the l-alpha-l_xrelation. applying this new relation to our sample, we find that the framedefined by these clusters has a bulk motion of 494 km/s in the cmb frame butthe 95% confidence range on the amplitude is 306 to 1419 km/s. these resultsare inconsistent with this frame being at rest in the cmb frame at the 98.6%confidence level. for the outer shell subsample (57 bcgs with cz &gt; 6000 km/s),the bulk motion is consistent both with no motion in the cmb frame and with themotion found by lp. however, our analysis of the 107 lauer and postman bcgs inthis outer shell indicates that, even with no x-ray correction, the cmb-framebulk motion of these clusters is not statistically different from zero.furthermore, for the subsample with x-ray data, the x-ray correction goes inthe sense of reducing both the amplitude (by 663 km/s) and significance (from98.8% to 83.8%) of its cmb-frame bulk motion, as well as reducing the internalinconsistency between its motion and that of the remainder of the lauer andpostman sample with no x-ray data. claims of large-scale, large-amplitude bulkflows should be regarded with caution until x-ray data become available formore clusters.

0812.2259	constraints on modified gravity from the observed x-ray luminosity  function of galaxy clusters	we use measurements of the growth of cosmic structure, as inferred from theobserved evolution of the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of galaxy clusters,to constrain departures from general relativity (gr) on cosmological scales. weemploy the popular growth rate parameterization, omega_m(z)^gamma, for which grpredicts a growth index gamma~0.55. we use observations of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb), type ia supernovae (snia), and x-ray cluster gas-massfractions (fgas), to simultaneously constrain the expansion history and energycontent of the universe, as described by the background model parameters:omega_m, w, and omega_k, i.e., the mean matter density, the dark energyequation of state parameter, and the mean curvature, respectively. usingconservative allowances for systematic uncertainties, in particular for theevolution of the mass-luminosity scaling relation in the xlf analysis, we findgamma=0.51+0.16-0.15 and omega_m=0.27+-0.02 (68.3 per cent confidence limits),for a flat cosmological constant (lcdm) background model. allowing w to be afree parameter, we find gamma=0.44+0.17-0.15. relaxing the flatness prior inthe lcdm model, we obtain gamma=0.51+0.19-0.16. when in addition to the xlfdata we use the cmb data to constrain gamma through the isw effect, we obtain acombined constraint of gamma=0.45+0.14-0.12 for the flat lcdm model. ouranalysis provides the tightest constraints to date on the growth index. we findno evidence for departures from general relativity on cosmological scales.
