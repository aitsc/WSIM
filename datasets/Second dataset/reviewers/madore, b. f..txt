0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0706.4088	a study of the type ia/iin supernova 2005gj from x-ray to the infrared:  paper i	we present extensive ugrizyhjk photometry and optical spectroscopy of sn2005gj obtained by the sdss-ii and csp supernova projects, which give excellentcoverage during the first 150 days after the time of explosion. these data showthat sn 2005gj is the second clear case, after sn 2002ic, of a thermonuclearexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. both the presence of singly anddoubly ionized iron-peak elements (feiii and weak sii, siii) near maximum lightas well as the spectral evolution show that sn 2002ic-like events are type iaexplosions. independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosityof sn 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium isstronger than in sn 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the balmeremission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higherclose to maximum light. the velocity evolution of the halpha components suggestthat the csm around sn 2005gj is clumpy and it has a flatter densitydistribution compared with the steady wind solution, in agreement with sn2002ic. an early x-ray observation with chandra gives an upper-limit on themass loss rate from the companion of &lt; 2x10^{-4} msun/yr.

0909.2648	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. i. surface  photometry and morphology	we present ultraviolet through far-infrared surface brightness profiles forthe 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). theimagery used to measure the profiles includes galex uv data, optical imagesfrom kpno, ctio and sdss, near-ir data from 2mass, and mid- and far-infraredimages from spitzer. along with the radial profiles, we also providemulti-wavelength asymptotic magnitudes and several non-parametric indicators ofgalaxy morphology: the concentration index (c_42), the asymmetry (a), the ginicoefficient (g) and the normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20% ofthe galaxy's flux (m_20). our radial profiles show a wide range of morphologiesand multiple components (bulges, exponential disks, inner and outer disktruncations, etc.) that vary not only from galaxy to galaxy but also withwavelength for a given object. in the optical and near-ir, the sings galaxiesoccupy the same regions in the c_42-a-g-m_20 parameter space as other normalgalaxies in previous studies. however, they appear much less centrallyconcentrated, more asymmetric and with larger values of g when viewed in the uv(due to star-forming clumps scattered across the disk) and in the mid-ir (dueto the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8.0 microns and very hotdust at 24 microns).

0909.2658	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. ii.  derived dust properties	we present a detailed analysis of the radial distribution of dust propertiesin the sings sample, performed on a set of uv, ir and hi surface brightnessprofiles, combined with published molecular gas profiles and metallicitygradients. the internal extinction, derived from the tir-to-fuv luminosityratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in sb-sbc galaxies. the tir-to-fuvratio correlates with the uv spectral slope beta, following a sequence shiftedto redder uv colors with respect to that of starbursts. the star formationhistory (sfh) is identified as the main driver of this departure. we have alsoderived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction ofthe dust mass contributed by pahs, the fraction of the dust mass heated by veryintense starlight and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains.the dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale-length being constantfrom sb to sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale-length). manys0/a-sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions.the pah abundance increases with metallicity for 12+\log(o/h)&lt;9, and at largermetallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the sfh being aplausible underlying driver for this behavior. the dust-to-gas ratio is alsowell correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentricradius.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

0704.3813	the curious case of ngc6908	the object ngc6908 was once thought to be simply a surface-brightnessenhancement in the eastern spiral arm of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc6907.based on an examination of near-infrared imaging, the object is shown in factto be a lenticular s0(6/7) galaxy hidden in the optical glare of the disk andspiral structure of the larger galaxy. new radial velocities of ngc6908(3,060+/-16 (emission); 3,113+/-73 km/s (absorption)) have been obtained at thebaade 6.5m and the dupont 2.5m telescopes at las campanas, chile placingngc6908 at the same expansion-velocity distance as ngc6907 (3,190+/-5 km/s),eliminating the possibility of a purely chance line-of-sight coincidence. theonce-enigmatic asymmetries in the disk and outer spiral structure of ngc6907are now explained as being due to an advanced merger event. newly discoveredtails and debris in the outer reaches of this galaxy further support the mergerscenario for this system. this pair of galaxies is a rather striking example oftwo objects discovered over 100 years ago, whose true nature was lost untilmodern detectors operating at infrared wavelengths gave us a new(high-contrast) look. other examples of embedded merger remnants may alsoreveal themselves in the growing samples of near-infrared imaging of nearbygalaxies; and a pilot study does reveal several other promising candidates forfollow-up observations.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1304.6083	the impact of bars on disk breaks as probed by s4g imaging	we have analyzed the radial distribution of old stars in a sample of 218nearby face-on disks, using deep 3.6um images from the spitzer survey ofstellar structure in galaxies (s4g). in particular, we have studied thestructural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. wefind that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have ascale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to thoseof the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same totalstellar mass. in the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break andthe bar radii (rbr/rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of thegalaxy. for galaxies more massive than 10^10 msun, the distribution is bimodal,peaking at rbr/rbar~2 and ~3.5. the first peak, which is the most populatedone, is linked to the outer lindblad resonance of the bar, whereas the secondone is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiralpattern. for galaxies below 10^10 msun, breaks are found up to ~10 rbar, but weshow that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature ofrotation curves in these low-mass disks. while not ruling out star formationthresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced bynon-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2rbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.

1308.5023	physical parameters and the projection factor of the classical cepheid  in the binary system ogle-lmc-cep-0227	a novel method of analysis of double-lined eclipsing binaries containing aradially pulsating star is presented. the combined pulsating-eclipsing lightcurve is built up from a purely eclipsing light curve grid created using anexisting modeling tool. for every pulsation phase the instantaneous radius andsurface brightness are taken into account, being calculated from thedisentangled radial velocity curve of the pulsating star and from itsout-of-eclipse pulsational light curve and the light ratio of the components,respectively. the best model is found using the markov chain monte carlomethod.  the method is applied to the eclipsing binary cepheid ogle-lmc-cep-0227(p_puls = 3.80 d, p_orb = 309 d). we analyze a set of new spectroscopic andphotometric observations for this binary, simultaneously fitting ogle v-band,i-band and spitzer 3.6 {\mu}m photometry. we derive a set of fundamentalparameters of the system significantly improving the precision comparing to theprevious results obtained by our group. the cepheid mass and radius are m_1 =4.165 +/- 0.032 m_solar and r_1 = 34.92 +/- 0.34 r_solar, respectively.  for the first time a direct, geometrical and distance-independentdetermination of the cepheid projection factor is presented. the value p = 1.21+/- 0.03(stat.) +/- 0.04(syst.) is consistent with theoretical expectations fora short period cepheid and interferometric measurements for {\delta} cep. wealso find a very high value of the optical limb darkening coefficients for thecepheid component, in strong disagreement with theoretical predictions forstatic atmospheres at a given surface temperature and gravity.

1410.5460	new nir light-curve templates for classical cepheids	we present new near-infrared (nir) light-curve templates for fundamental (fu,jhk) and first overtone (fo, j) cepheids. the new templates together with pland pw relations provide cepheid distances from single-epoch observations witha precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method adopted. thetemplates rely on a very large set of galactic and magellanic clouds (mcs)cepheids (fu,~600; fo,~200) with well sampled nir (irsf data) and optical (v,i;ogle data) light curves. to properly trace the change in the shape of the lightcurve as a function of period, we split the sample of calibrating cepheids into10 different period bins. the templates for the first time cover fo cepheidsand the fu short-period cepheids (p&lt;5 days). moreover, the zero-point phase isanchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. the newapproach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump cepheidswhen compared with the phase of maximum light. we also provide new estimates ofthe nir-to-optical amplitude ratios for fu and fo cepheids. we perform detailedanalytical fits using both 7th-order fourier series and multi-gaussian periodicfunctions. the latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters(9 vs 15). mean nir magnitudes based on the new templates are up to 80% moreaccurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50% more accurate than meanmagnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertaintiesranging from 0.015 mag (j) to 0.019 mag (k). moreover, the errors on individualdistances of small mc cepheids derived from nir pw relations, are essentiallyreduced to the intrinsic scatter of the adopted relations. thus, the newtemplates are the ultimate tool to estimate precise cepheid distances from nirsingle-epoch observations, which can be adopted to derive the 3d structure ofthe mcs.

astro-ph;0001277	high resolution rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies	high resolution halpha rotation curves are presented for five low surfacebrightness galaxies. these halpha rotation curves have shapes different fromthose previously derived from hi observations, probably because of the higherspatial resolution of the halpha observations. the halpha rotation curves risemore steeply in the inner parts than the hi rotation curves and reach a flatpart beyond about two disk scale lengths. with radii expressed in optical diskscale lengths, the rotation curves of the low surface brightness galaxiespresented here and those of hsb galaxies have almost identical shapes. massmodeling shows that the contribution of the stellar component to the rotationcurves may be scaled to explain most of the inner parts of the rotation curves,albeit with high stellar mass-to-light ratios. on the other hand, well fittingmass models can also be obtained with lower contributions of the stellar disk.these observations suggest that the luminous mass density and the total massdensity are coupled in the inner parts of these galaxies.

astro-ph;0012376	final results from the hubble space telescope key project to measure the  hubble constant	we present here the final results of the hubble space telescope key projectto measure the hubble constant. we summarize our method, the results and theuncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications ofthese results for cosmology. the analysis presented here benefits from a numberof recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger lmc cepheidsample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (pl) relations, (2) a morerecent hst wide field and planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) photometric calibration,(3) a correction for cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction forincompleteness bias in the observed cepheid pl samples. new, revised distancesare given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which cepheids have been discovered aspart of the key project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with publishedcepheid data. the new calibration results in a cepheid distance to ngc 4258 inbetter agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. based on these revisedcepheid distances, we find values (in km/sec/mpc) of h0 = 71 +/- 2 (random) +/-6 (systematic) (type ia supernovae), 71 +/- 2 +/- 7 (tully-fisher relation), 70+/- 5 +/- 6 (surface brightness fluctuations), 72 +/- 9 +/- 7 (type iisupernovae), and 82 +/- 6 +/- 9 (fundamental plane). we combine these resultsfor the different methods with 3 different weighting schemes, and find goodagreement and consistency with h0 = 72 +/- 8. finally, we compare these resultswith other, global methods for measuring the hubble constant.

astro-ph;0112153	the first detections of the extragalactic background light at 3000,  5500, and 8000a (i): results	(abridged) we present the first detections of the mean flux of the opticalextragalactic background light (ebl) at 3000, 5500, and 8000a. diffuseforeground flux at these wavelengths comes from terrestrial airglow,dust-scattered sunlight (zodiacal light), and dust-scattered galactic starlight(diffuse galactic light). we have avoided the brightest of these, terrestrialairglow, by measuring the absolute surface brightness of the night sky fromabove the earth's atmosphere using the wide field planetary camera2 (wfpc2) andfaint object spectrograph (fos), both aboard the hubble space telescope (hst).on the ground, we have used the dupont 2.5 m telescope at las campanasobservatory (lco) to obtain contemporaneous spectrophotometry of ``blank'' skyin the hst field of view to measure and then subtract foreground zodiacal lightfrom the hst observations. we have minimized the diffuse galactic light inadvance by selecting the hst target field along a line of sight with lowgalactic dust column density, and then estimated the low--level galacticforeground using a simple scattering model and the observed correlation betweenthermal, 100 micron emission and optical scattered flux from the same dust. inthis paper, we describe the coordinated lco/hst program and the hstobservations and data reduction, and present the resulting measurements of theebl.

astro-ph;0112170	the first detections of the extragalactic background light at 3000,  5500, and 8000a (iii): cosmological implications	(abridged) we have used hst wfpc2 and ground-based spectroscopy to measurethe integrated extragalactic background light (ebl) at optical wavelengths. wehave also computed the integrated light from individual galaxy counts in theimages used to measure the ebl and in the hubble deep field. we find that theflux in galaxies as measured by standard galaxy photometry methods hasgenerally been underestimated by about 50%. further, we find that the totalflux in individually detected galaxies is a factor of 2 to 3 less than the eblat 3000--8000a. we show that a significant fraction of the ebl may come fromnormal galaxies at z&lt;4, which are simply undetectable as a result ofk-corrections and cosmological surface brightness dimming. this is consistentwith recent redshift surveys at z&lt;4. in the context of some simple models, wediscuss the constraints placed by the ebl on the evolution of the luminositydensity at z&gt;1. based on our optical ebl and published uv and ir eblmeasurements, we estimate that the total ebl from 0.1--1000 microns is 100+/-20nw/m^2/sr. if the total ebl were produced entirely by stellar nucleosynthesis,then we estimate that the total baryonic mass processed through stars isomega_* = 0.0062 (+/- 0.0022) h^{-2}, which corresponds to 0.33+/-0.12 omega_bfor currently favored values of the baryon density. this estimate is smaller byroughly 7% if 7 h_{0.7} nw/m^2/sr of the total ebl comes from accretion ontocentral black holes. this estimate of omega_* suggests that the universe hasbeen enriched to a total metal mass of 0.21(+/-0.13) z_sun omega_b. ourestimate is consistent with other measurements of the cumulative metal massfraction of stars, stellar remnants, and the intracluster medium of galaxyclusters in the local universe.

astro-ph;0112193	the first detections of the extragalactic background light at 3000,  5500, and 8000a (ii): measurement of foreground zodiacal light	we present a measurement of the absolute surface brightness of the zodiacallight (3900-5100a) toward a fixed extragalactic target at high eclipticlatitude based on moderate resolution (~1.3a per pixel) spectrophotometryobtained with the du pont 2.5m telescope at las campanas observatory in chile.this measurement and contemporaneous hubble space telescope data from wfpc2 andfos comprise a coordinated program to measure the mean flux of the diffuseextragalactic background light (ebl). the zodiacal light at optical wavelengthsresults from scattering by interplanetary dust, so that the zodiacal light fluxtoward any extragalactic target varies seasonally with the position of theearth. this measurement of zodiacal light is therefore relevant to the specificobservations (date and target field) under discussion. to obtain this result,we have developed a technique that uses the strength of the zodiacal fraunhoferlines to identify the absolute flux of the zodiacal light in themultiple-component night sky spectrum. statistical uncertainties in the resultare 0.6% (1 sigma). however, the dominant source of uncertainty is systematicerrors, which we estimate to be 1.1% (1 sigma). we discuss the contributionsincluded in this estimate explicitly. the systematic errors in this resultcontribute 25% in quadrature to the final error in our coordinated eblmeasurement, which is presented in the first paper of this series.

astro-ph;0210152	the central mass distribution in dwarf and low surface brightness  galaxies	we present halpha rotation curves for a sample of 15 dwarf and lsb galaxies.  from these, we derive limits on the slopes of the central mass distributions.assuming the density distributions of dark matter halos follow a power-law atsmall radii, rho(r)~r^(-alpha), we find inner slopes in the range 0&lt;alpha&lt;1 formost galaxies. in general, halos with constant density cores (\alpha=0) providesomewhat better fits, but the majority of our galaxies (~75%) are alsoconsistent with alpha=1, provided that the r-band mass-to-light ratios aresmaller than about 2. halos with alpha=1.5, however, are ruled out in virtuallyevery case. to investigate the robustness of these results we discuss and modelseveral possible causes of systematic errors including non-circular motions,slit width, seeing, and slit alignment errors. taking the associateduncertainties into account, we conclude that even for the 25% of the caseswhere alpha=1 seems inconsistent with the rotation curves, we cannot rule outcusp slopes this steep. inclusion of literature samples similar to the onepresented here leads to the same conclusion when possible systematic errors aretaken into account. in the ongoing debate on whether the rotation curves ofdwarf and lsb galaxies are consistent with predictions for a cdm universe, weargue that our sample and the literature samples discussed in this paperprovide insufficient evidence to rule out halos with alpha=1. at the same time,we note that none of the galaxies in these samples require halos with steepcusps, as most are equally well or better explained by constant density cores.(abridged)

astro-ph;0411309	galex observations of the ultraviolet halos of ngc 253 and m82	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images of the prototypicaledge-on starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253. our initial analysis is restrictedto the complex of ultraviolet (uv) filaments in the starburst-driven outflowsin the galaxy halos. the uv luminosities in the halo are too high to beprovided by shock-heated or photoionized gas except perhaps in the brightestfilaments in m82, suggesting that most of the uv light is the stellar continuumof the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust in the outflow. thisinterpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging polarimetry inm82. the morphology of the uv filaments in both galaxies shows a high degree ofspatial correlation with h-alpha and x-ray emission. this indicates that theseoutflows contain cold gas and dust, some of which may be vented into theintergalactic medium (igm). uv light is seen in the ``h-alpha cap'' 11 kpcnorth of m82. if this cap is a result of the wind fluid running into apre-existing gas cloud, the gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial innature but was probably stripped from m82 or m81. if starburst windsefficiently expel dust into the igm, this could have significant consequencesfor the observation of cosmologically distant objects.

astro-ph;0411318	the look-back time evolution of far-uv flux from elliptical galaxies:  the fornax cluster and abell 2670	in order to investigate the origin of the far-uv (fuv) flux from theearly-type galaxies, galaxy evolution explorer (galex) is collecting the uvdata for the elliptical-rich clusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) where thedominant fuv source is predicted to be hot horizontal-branch (hb) stars andtheir post-hb progeny. here we present our first result for the early-typegalaxies in abell 2670 at z = 0.076. compared to ngc 1399, a nearby giantelliptical galaxy in the fornax cluster, it appears that the rest-frame fuv - vcolor of the giant ellipticals gets redder by ~ 0.7 mag at the distance ofabell 2670 (z = 0.076; look-back time ~ 1.0 gyr). although a detailedcomparison with the models is postponed until more cluster data areaccumulated, it is interesting to note that this value is consistent with thevariation predicted by the population synthesis models where the meantemperature of hb stars declines rapidly with increasing look-back time.

astro-ph;0411336	a comparative study of the spatial distribution of ultraviolet and  far-infrared fluxes from m 101	the total ultraviolet (uv) flux (from 1412 to 2718 aa) of m 101 is comparedon a pixel-to-pixel basis with the total far-infrared (fir) flux (from 60 to170 micron), using the maps of the galaxy taken by galex in the near-uv andfar-uv and by isophot at 60, 100 and 170 micron. the main result of thisinvestigation is the discovery of a tight dependence of the fir/uv ratio onradius, with values monotonically decreasing from around 4 in the nuclearregion to nearly zero towards the edge of the optical disk.  although the tightness of this dependence is in part attributable toresolution effects, the result is consistent with the presence of a large-scaledistribution of diffuse dust having a face-on optical depth which decreaseswith radius and which dominates over the more localized variations in opacitybetween the arm and interarm regions. we also find a trend for the fir/uv ratioto take on higher values in the regions of diffuse interarm emission than inthe spiral-arm regions, at a given radius. this is interpreted quantitativelyin terms of the escape probability of uv photons from spiral arms and theirsubsequent scattering in the interarm regions, and in terms of the largerrelative contribution of optical photons to the heating of the dust in theinterarm regions.

astro-ph;0411372	uv emission from stellar populations within tidal tails: catching the  youngest galaxies in formation?	new galex observations have detected significant fuv (1530 angstroms) and nuv(2310 angstroms) emission from stellar substructures within the tidal tails offour ongoing galaxy mergers. the uv-bright regions are optically faint and arecoincident with hi density enhancements. fuv emission is detected at anylocation where the hi surface density exceeds ~2 m_sun pc^{-2}, and is oftendetected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. uv luminosities of thebrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 m_sun to ~10^9 m_sunin young stars in the tails, and hi luminosities imply similar hi masses.uv-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as afew myr, and in all cases ages &lt; 400myr. most of the young stars in the tailsformed in single bursts rather than resulting from continuous star formation,and they formed *in situ* as the tails evolved. star formation appears to beolder near the parent galaxies and younger at increasing distances from theparent galaxy. this could be because the star formation occurs progressivelyalong the tails, or because the star formation has been inhibited near thegalaxy/tail interface. the youngest stellar concentrations, usually near theends of long tidal tails, have masses comparable to confirmed tidal dwarfgalaxies and may be newly forming galaxies undergoing their first burst of starformation.

astro-ph;0506332	extinction law variations and dust excitation in the spiral galaxy ngc  300	we investigate the origin of the strong radial gradient in theultraviolet-to-infrared ratio in the spiral galaxy ngc 300, and emphasize theimportance of local variations in the interstellar medium geometry, concludingthat they cannot be neglected with respect to metallicity effects. thisanalysis is based upon a combination of maps from galex and spitzer, and fromthe ground (ubvri, halpha and hbeta). we select ionizing stellar clustersassociated with hii regions of widely varying morphologies, and derive theirfundamental parameters from population synthesis fitting of their spectralenergy distributions, measured to eliminate local backgrounds accurately. fromthese fits, we conclude that the stellar extinction law is highly variable inthe line of sight of young clusters of similar ages. in the particular modelgeometry that we consider most appropriate to the sampled regions, we checkedthat our findings are not significantly altered by the correct treatment ofradiative transfer effects. the variations are systematic in nature: extinctionlaws of the milky way or lmc type are associated with compact hii regions (thecompacity being quantified in two different ways), while clusters surrounded bydiffuse hii regions follow extinction laws of the 30 doradus or smc type. thecalzetti starburst attenuation law, although most often degenerate with the 30doradus extinction law, overpredicts ionizing photon fluxes by large amounts.we also find that the extinction law variations are correlated with the columndensity of dust species emitting in the near- and mid-infrared. finally, webriefly discuss the nebular to stellar extinction ratios, and the excitation ofaromatic band carriers, invalidating their claimed association with cold dust.

astro-ph;0510165	uv dust attenuation in normal star forming galaxies: i. estimating the  l_tir/l_fuv ratio	we analyze the dust attenuation properties of a volume-limited,optically-selected sample of normal star forming galaxies in nearby clusters asobserved by galex. the internal attenuation is estimated using threeindependent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared tofar-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the balmerdecrement. we confirm that normal galaxies follow a l_tir/l_fuv-beta relationoffset from the one observed for starburst galaxies. this offset is found toweakly correlate with the birthrate parameter, thus with the galaxy starformation history. we study the correlations of dust attenuation with otherglobal properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gasattenuation, halpha emission and mass surface density. metal-rich, massivegalaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the uv than are smallsystems. for the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower l_tir/l_fuvratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in thel_tir/l_fuv-beta relation. unexpectedly we find however that normal starforming galaxies follow exactly the same relationship between metallicity andultraviolet spectral slope beta determined for starbursts, complicating ourunderstanding of dust properties. this result might indicate a different dustgeometry between normal galaxies and starbursts, but it could also be due toaperture effects eventually present in the iue starbursts dataset. the presentmultiwavelength study allows us to provide some empirical relations from whichthe total infrared to far ultraviolet ratio (l_tir/l_fuv) can be estimated whenfar infrared data are absent.

astro-ph;0601123	ultraviolet-to-far infrared properties of lyman break galaxies and  luminous infrared galaxies at z ~ 1	we present the first large, unbiased sample of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz ~ 1. far ultraviolet-dropout (1530 a) galaxies in the chandra deep fieldsouth have been selected using galex data. this first large sample in the z ~ 1universe provides us with a high quality reference sample of lbgs. we analyzedthe sample from the uv to the ir using galex, spitzer, eso and hst data. themorphology (obtained from goods data) of 75 % of our lbgs is consistent with adisk. the vast majority of lbgs with an ir detection are also luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs). as a class, the galaxies not detected at 24 microns are anorder of magnitude fainter relative to the uv compared with those detectedindividually, suggesting that there may be two types of behavior within thesample. for the ir-bright galaxies, there is an apparent upper limit for the uvdust attenuation and this upper limit is anti-correlated with the observed uvluminosity. previous estimates of dust attenuations based on the ultravioletslope are compared to new ones based on the fir/uv ratio (for lbgs detected at24 microns), which is usually a more reliable estimator. depending on thecalibration we use to estimate the total ir luminosity, beta-based attenuationsa_{fuv} are larger by 0.2 to 0.6 mag. than the ones estimated from fir/uvratio. finally, for ir-bright lbgs, median estimated beta-based sfrs are 2-3times larger than the total sfrs estimated as sfr_{tot} = sfr_{uv} + sfr_{ir}while ir-based sfrs provide values below sfr_{tot} by 15 - 20 %. we use astacking method to statistically constrain the 24 microns flux of lbgs nonindividually detected. the results suggest that these lbgs do not contain largeamounts of dust.

astro-ph;0601235	star formation in the nearby universe: the ultraviolet and infrared  points of view	this work presents the main ultraviolet (uv) and far-infrared (fir)properties of two samples of nearby galaxies selected from the galex ($\lambda= 2315$\aa, hereafter nuv) and iras ($\lambda = 60\mu$m) surveys respectively.they are built in order to get detection at both wavelengths for most of thegalaxies. star formation rate (sfr) estimators based on the uv and firemissions are compared. systematic differences are found between the sfrestimators for individual galaxies based on the nuv fluxes corrected for dustattenuation and on the total ir luminosity. a combined estimator based on nuvand ir luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of valuesof sfr. although both samples present similar average values of the birthrateparameter b, their star-formation-related properties are substantiallydifferent: nuv-selected galaxies tend to show larger values of $b$ for lowermasses, sfrs and dust attenuations, supporting previous scenarios for the starformation history (sfh). conversely, about 20% of the fir-selected galaxiesshow high values of $b$, sfr and nuv attenuation. these galaxies, most of thembeing lirgs and ulirgs, break down the downsizing picture for the sfh, howevertheir relative contribution per unit volume is small in the local universe.finally, the cosmic sfr density of the local universe is estimated in aconsistent way from the nuv and ir luminosities.

astro-ph;0606440	the galex ultraviolet atlas of nearby galaxies	we present images, integrated photometry, surface-brightness and colorprofiles for a total of 1034 nearby galaxies recently observed by the galexsatellite in its far-ultraviolet (fuv; 1516a) and near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2267a)bands. (...) this data set has been complemented with archival optical,near-infrared, and far-infrared fluxes and colors. we find that the integrated(fuv-k) color provides robust discrimination between elliptical andspiral/irregular galaxies and also among spiral galaxies of differentsub-types. elliptical galaxies with brighter k-band luminosities (i.e. moremassive) are redder in (nuv-k) color but bluer in (fuv-nuv) than less massiveellipticals. in the case of the spiral/irregular galaxies our analysis showsthe presence of a relatively tight correlation between the (fuv-nuv) color andthe total infrared-to-uv ratio. the correlation found between (fuv-nuv) colorand k-band luminosity (with lower luminosity objects being bluer than moreluminous ones) can be explained as due to an increase in the dust content withgalaxy luminosity.  the images in this atlas along with the profiles and integrated propertiesare publicly available through a dedicated web page athttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/galex_atlas/

astro-ph;0609020	the fate of spiral galaxies in clusters: the star formation history of  the anemic virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4569	we present a new method for studying the star formation history of late-type,cluster galaxies undergoing gas starvation or a ram-pressure stripping event bycombining bidimensional multifrequency observations with multi-zones models ofgalactic chemical and spectrophotometricevolution. this method is applied tothe virgo cluster anemic galaxy ngc 4569. we extract radial profiles fromrecently obtained uv galex images at 1530 and 2310 a, from visible and near-irnarrow (halpha) and broad band images at different wavelengths (u, b, g, v, r,i, z, j, h, k), from spitzer irac and mips images and from atomic and moleculargas maps. the model in the absence of interaction (characterized by itsrotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed h bandlight profile and by the halpha rotation curve. we can reconstruct the observedtotal-gas radial-density profile and the light surface-brightness profiles atall wavelengths in a ram-pressure stripping scenario by making simpleassumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of ngc 4569 inside thecluster. the observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gasinfall, thus mimicing starvation. gas removal is required, which is moreefficient in the outer disk, inducing a radial quenching in the star formationactivity, as observed and reproduced by the model. this observational result,consistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy-cluster igm interactionis able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitationalperturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticulars inclusters.

astro-ph;0609738	the local universe as seen in far-infrared and in far-ultraviolet: a  global point of view on the local recent star formation	we select far-infrared (fir-60 microns) and far-ultraviolet (fuv-1530 a)samples of nearby galaxies in order to discuss the biases encountered bymonochromatic surveys (fir or fuv). very different volumes are sampled by eachselection and much care is taken to apply volume corrections to all theanalyses. the distributions of the bolometric luminosity of young stars arecompared for both samples: they are found to be consistent with each other forgalaxies of intermediate luminosities but some differences are found for high(&gt;5 10^{10} l_sun) luminosities. the shallowness of the iras survey prevents usfrom securing comparison at low luminosities (&lt;2 10^9 l_sun). the ratio of thetotal infrared (tir) luminosity to the fuv luminosity is found to increase withthe bolometric luminosity in a similar way for both samples up to 5 10^{10}l_sun. brighter galaxies are found to have a different behavior according totheir selection: the l_tir/l_fuv ratio of the fuv-selected galaxies brighterthan 5 10^{10} l_sun reaches a plateau whereas l_tir/l_fuv continues toincrease with the luminosity of bright galaxies selected in fir. thevolume-averaged specific star formation rate (sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass,ssfr) is found to decrease toward massive galaxies within each selection. thessfr is found to be larger than that measured for optical and nir-selectedsample over the whole mass range for the fir selection, and for masses largerthan 10^{10} m_sun for the fuv selection. luminous and massive galaxiesselected in fir appear as active as galaxies with similar characteristicsdetected at z ~ 0.7.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.
