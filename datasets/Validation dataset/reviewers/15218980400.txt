8844269227	Expansive soil character later test verification on freeway embankment treatment	In the expansive soil area freeway embankment construction the expansive soil needs treatments if not take the displacement and refilling measures. This is especially necessary in the middle and strong expansive soils building foundations. In order to find out the status after the expansive soil embankment modified treatment and deepen the comprehension of the treatment effect, we carried out the experiment about the expansive soil characteristic on freeway embankment construction one year later. Results show that the later moisture content and dry density change in different degree which is related to the treatment mode, boring position and sampling depth. Later dry density will reduction which will induce to safety incipient fault. If embankment fulling up with full expansive soil, the later dry density will increase and the long-term stability will be safeguard with lime modified expansive soil. Flyash improves the capability of the expansive soils in a certain extent, but the effect is not as good as the lime and the incipient fault hasn't been eliminated thoroughly.

17944370580	Testing study on properties of mid-expansive soil for expressway construction	With the rapid development of expressway construction, more and more engineering problems related to expansive soil occur. Based on a real expressway project, the physico-mechanical properties of mid-expansive soil and its lime-treatment effect were studied by laboratory and field tests. It is discovered that mid-expansive soil without lime treatment has high strength at the optimum water content and in the immersion test it behaves as large swelling, decreasing strength and very bad water stability. While the strength of mid-expansive soil after lime treatment is largely increased and it has good water stability. All of those show the fact that with effective treatment and rational construction, mid-expansive soil can be used in the embankment fill of expressway.

27944487595	Study on active and passive failure surface in backfilled cohesionless soil behind rigid retaining wall	In the classical Coulomb's earth pressure theory, the failure surface in the backfilled cohesionless soil behind rigid retaining wall in slope engineering is assumed a plane. However, it has been proved by a number of laboratory and field tests that this failure surface is actually a curved surface. In this paper, based on the vertical differential element method and the variational principle with moveable boundary, a quadratic ordinary differential equation of the first order about the failure surface is deduced. Three cases of the equation are discussed: 1) without lateral shear force at the interface between two elements, and the back of the retaining wall is frictionless, the failure surface is a plane; 2) lateral shear force is a constant, and the back of the wall is rough, the failure surface is also a plane, the two cases above mentioned are identical to Coulomb's theory; 3) lateral shear force increases linearly from the tip to the toe, the failure surface is a curved surface. Results show that the proposed approach can predict right failure pattern of the backfilled cohesionless soil, which is in good agreement with that of the laboratory and field tests.

Effect of the groundwater on deep excavation is discussed briefly, and fundamental treating method is put forward. Taking Baofeng Times Square deep excavation as an example, effect of the deep-well dewatering on supporting structure and surroundings is analysed. Monitoring data show that deformation of the retaining structure and surrounding buildings developed rapidly during excavation. When earthwork is finished, the supporting structure tends to be stable, but surrounding buildings subside continually because of dewatering.

33645937655	Engineering behaviors of weak expansive soil and its treatment measures for roadbed filling	Compacting properties, swelling-shrinkage behavior and mechanical behavior of compacted sample for weak expansive soils in Xiang-Jing Expressway of Hubei Province are investigated. It is discovered that the engineering behavior of weak expansive soils is controlled by the coupled action of water content and degree of compaction, while the swelling-shrinkage behavior is inherent property of weak expansive soils and its value depends on the initial water content and dry density; the optimum moisture content and maximum dry density of expansive soils depends on tamping effort, bigger tamping effort; bigger the maximum dry density, and smaller the optimum moisture content correspondingly; the variation of California bearing ratio (CBR) of the expansive soils with water content is similar to the compaction curve. However, the water content of soil corresponding the maximum CBR is higher than the optimum water content. In the construction of expansive soil embankment, the influence of total swell-shrink ratio should be considered besides the degree of compaction and CBR value; and it is helpful to understand the engineering properties of expansive soils. At last, the structural shape of weak expansive soil embankment and the standard of controlling compaction of weak expansive soil for constructing embankment are suggested.

Based on the principle of minimum potential energy, a new analytic solution to determine the maximum displacement of the pile head is derived; and the effects of the retaining structural parameters on the maximum displacement are discussed. Results show that the maximum displacement of the pile head increases with the increase of the surcharge and the spacing of the pile linearly. When the excavation length increases to a critical length, the maximum displacement will be a constant. In addition, the coefficient of the embedded depth of the pile has an dramatic effect on the maximum displacement. Finally, the result obtained from the proposed approach is compared with field tests and elastic resistance method.

33747079922	Effect of soil sample preparation on free swelling ratio and its improved measures	Free swelling ratio is a significant index for classification of expansive soil and identification of swelling potential. Unfortunately it is influenced by many factors, among which the effect of soil sample preparation is discussed. Test researches show that soil sampling mass and test results is of little influence by three funnel bores (4.5, 5, 5.5 mm) and three drop heights (5, 10, 15 mm) while they are much influenced by degree of grinding of soil. The specified standard that soil particle size is less than 0.5 mm is not perfect and the results of free swelling ratio for three soil particle sizes (0.25-0.5, 0.1-0.25, <0.1 mm) is widely variable, it is discovered that the finest soil (<0.1 mm) is reduced by 30%-45% and isn't consistent with other indexes for expansive soil classification. The contrast is studied and mass difference of particle up to 2 g measured by a cup of 10 ml is found; the conclusion that the results is influenced by particle mass is established and the changing of structure is a possible reason. At last the particle size between 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm is suggested.

Based on Hefei-Luan-Yeji Expressway Project, laboratory comparative tests on basic physical, compacted, swelling-shrinkage and mechanical characteristics of CMA-treated expansive soils have been carried out. Compared with unmodified sample, the free swelling ratio of the modified samples lowers from 71% to about 20%; its liquid limit and plastic index also decrease obviously; hydrophilic nature falls down by a wide range as well as micelle content, but silt content increases sharply. The results also indicate that index for swelling-shrinkage property has reduced, swelling ratio without load is 2%-3% and swelling power is 5% of those without modifying. The value of CBR reaches 50% and deformation is small when soaked; soils have a high shear strength and unconfined compressive strength whether saturated or not, and possess better water stability. Conclusion can be drawn that CMA can change the properties of expansive soils notably and the first formula is suitable for Hefei expansive soils for its good treating effect.

Inside experiments consist of general physical properties, impaction and swelling characteristics of natural, impacted and improved expansive soils. Some results are drawn, such as the impacted expansive soils are more expansible than natural expansive soils, not expansive soils but IESLs are filled in superstratum of roadbed; it is effective that expansive soils are improved with lime, optimal lime contents are 6% to 8%, different filling cannot be mixed because there are much difference in maximal dry density and optimal water content of IESL. Field tests include roller compacting of IESL, general physical properties and swelling characteristics of compacting IESL, load test with pouring water, resilient module and deflection of roadbed. Some conclusions are drawn, for example, if compactness of IESL can arrive at 95 percent or settlement of IESL can arrive gradually at stabilization on condition that lime and water content are controlled effectively; roller compacting number must be over eight times to loose filling thickness of 50 cm, and six times to 30 cm, when exciting force of roller is 450 kN; though swelling capacity of in-site impacted IESLs is very low, impacted IESLs still have shrinkage characteristic because of water reducing; and measures which prevent water from falling would be taken; the impacted IESLs have larger bearing capacity, intensity and water stability.

34447327516	Characteristics and mechanism of California bearing ratio of expansive soils	The influence of moisture content, compacting energy and swelling potential grade on California bearing ratio (CBR) of expansive soils is experimentally studied. It is found that the moisture content of maximum CBR is always higher than the optimum moisture content. The difference increases as the compacting energy or swelling potential grade increase. The unsaturated soils theory is applied to explain these characteristics. The regularity is due to the different gas-water phases of expansive soils with different saturation degrees. When the saturation degree is less than the boundary saturation ratio, the CBR value increase assumes the exponential relationship along with the increment of saturation degree. But when the saturation degree is more than the boundary value, the strength property is similar with saturated soil and the CBR value is controlled by the dry density.

The results show that, in a certain particle size range, the dry density decreases with the increasing of the maximum particle size, and its standard deviation has no obvious correlation with the maximum particle size. The dry density decreases with the increasing of coarse particles content, and its standard deviation is increasing along with the coarse particles content. Some well-graded measuring points have smaller dry density, which indicates that dry density has no obvious correlation with the gradation. The coarse particles content and maximum particle size have large affect on the field compaction characteristics, but the gradation has less impact. It is so important to focus on the coarse particles content and the maximum particle size during filling. © 2013 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY. All rights reserved.

Test results indicate that under low confining pressures over coarse-grained soils are characterized by weak strain softening or strain hardening. The form rests with the value of confining pressure. At the same time, volume shrink happens first and cubic dilation develops gradually with the increase of axial strain. The sample varies from dilation to volume shrink with the increase of confining pressure. But the shrinkage degree decreases little by little till stability. The shear strength of over coarse-grained soils shows nonlinear characters with the stress level. It decreases generally with the increase of confining pressure. Water has important effect on the compression characters and the shear characters of over coarse-grained soil.

79959666873	On the characteristics of the cone penetration value and its correlation with bearing capacity for recently sedimentary layer in Huaibei plain	According to the unique geological characteristics in Huaibei plain, the systematic field testing study is developed, and the characteristics of actual range and influencing factors of the specific penetration resistance of recently deposited silt and calcareous concretionary soil are analyzed. Based on this, the correlation between the cone penetration test value and bearing capacity of foundation in Huaibei plain is discussed. The experimental research shows that the main factors influencing the specific penetration resistance of cohesive soil are the age of geological formation and the calcareous concretion, and the main influencing factor of recently deposited silt is the sandwich soil. It also shows that the discreteness of the cone penetration test value is determined by non-uniform distribution of diameter of the calcareous concretion, and the average value of the specific penetration resistance is directly affected by content of the calcareous concretion. Finally, the empirical formula between the calcareous concretion and bearing capacity of foundation in cohesive soil, silt and silty sand is established, and also the reliability of the formula is verified by adopting a large amount of existing measured data. © 2011 IEEE.

80053470675	Concurrent checkpoint/restart mechanism for real-time interactive processes	This paper presents a new concurrent checkpoint/restart mechanism, it allows the checkpointed process (checkpointee) without stopping while doing checkpointing to some extent. The checkpointee can continue to run until a write request is captured by tracing TLB during dumping memory pages (which is a critical step of doing checkpoint). At that time, the checkpoint module will copy the requested page to the designated memory buffer, then enable the write operation. Then, it can form an image file with consistent process state by using original pages which copied in the designate memory buffer. The experimental results show that this mechanism can reduce 20%~70% stopping time of checkpointee to ensure the concurrency between doing checkpoint and execution of checkpointee. This mechanism is a quite good choice for hign real-time and interactive priority applications.

Based on the field observation data of subgrade settlement of Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway, aiming at measured settlement data being characteristic of small in magnitude, but large relative fluctuation, the suitability of exponential curve method for predicting settlements of subgrade under ballastless track has been studied synthetically. it was found that exponential curve method can't be directly used for predicting subgrade settlements in high-speed railway. The basic idea of three-point method is introduced into exponential curve model, a three-point modified exponential curve method for predicting subgrade settlements has been proposed. Combining the measured settlement data of subgrade in Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway, the characteristics of three-point modified exponential curve model have been analyzed. The analysis shows that selecting three points as forecast sample on settlement-time curve of subgrade can commendably evade the influence brought by data fluctuation; and the settlement regularity after inflection point on settlement-time curve of subgrade more tally with exponential curve, therefore, the samples must be selected after inflection point on settlement-time curve of subgrade; and three samples should reflect the settlement development tendency as far as possible. The prediction results of three point modified exponential curve method are stable with high correlation coefficient. The new prediction method has engineering value.

The limit equilibrium method and finite element method for unsaturated slope stability analysis concerning climate were introduced. Based on mechanical analysis, a prediction model of slope stability due to permeation of rainwater was proposed. The prediction of slope stability according to weather forecast can be realized by the following steps: first, to compute the seepage field by numerical method; second, to derive the strength distribution of slope from the seepage field by the strength theory of unsaturated soil; third, to analyze the slope stability by the limit equilibrium method or finite element method; at last, the relationship between the safety factors of slope stability and rainfall parameters such as intensity and duration of rainfall can be obtained.

According to the results, middle expansive soil should be stabilized before being filled into roadbed because it will expand and soften remarkably after being wetted and its CBR is lower than 3%; the intensity of low expansive soil meets the regulations if the compacting water content is about 3-4% higher than optimum moisture content. After being stabilized with lime, the middle expansive soil can be restrained in terms of the trend of expansion and shrink, and the intensity of the soil can be enhanced significantly to fill into roadbed.

For the backup VM part, it first decodes the received data and re-constructs the dirty pages, and then applies these pages to complete the VM synchronization.

84872349280	Anisotropic properties study of chlorite schist	In order to study anisotropic properties of schist in Shiyan area, Hubei province, uniaxial compressive tests on cubic samples and Brazilian tests on disk samples of Wudang chlorite schist were carried out. The anisotropic strength and fracture characteristics of samples under different loading states were discussed, the mechanism was revealed. The results show that: Wudang chlorite schist shows obvious anisotropic properties; the strength parallel to foliation is higher than the vertical direction. The special orientation bunch structure and the weak cementing strength between foliations caused the different fractures and mechanisms along different directions. Under compression stress, tension-split along foliations and rod press-bent failure are easily caused by Poisson effect; and tension-shear failure is easily caused under vertical direction compression. There is strength consistency in the same direction, for the compression strength and tension strength parallel to foliations are higher than that vertical to foliations. As the tension stress between foliations is extremely low, tension-split failure and tension-shear failure are easily caused with a small angle to foliations under splitting load; so tension failure along foliation should be avoided as far as possible. The results can be referenced for reinforcement and water-proof treatment of tunnel and slope projects.

The strength of cemented soil is inversely proportional to the diameter distance of electrode. There is strong discontinuous surface between the coral layer and the affected layer. The cemented ground load force and the deformation modulus are 10 times better than the former, and it has good water stability.

84878841637	An approximate gradient descent algorithm for wireless sensor signal reconstruction	Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of wireless nodes and are responsible for sensing, processing and monitoring. In the wireless sensor networks, there are some constraints such as power consumption, lifetime, and bandwidth and so on. However, compressed sensing theory is a good avenue that could get rid of those troublesome. It could help us acquire complete signal at low cost. Namely, one can sample the signal below the Nyquist frequency. Specially, it is difficult to collect complete signal when wireless sensor signal is in the open scene. The compressed sensing ensures that signal could imperfect recovery although samples are incomplete. In view of this station, we present a proximal gradient algorithm to reconstruct undersampling signal in the noise environment. This algorithm iteratively uses a straightforward shrinkage step for finding the optimum solution to constrained formula. Furthermore, it is feasibility to recovering original signal. Finally, simulations show that the proximal gradient algorithm has superior performance comparing to the orthogonal matching pursuit, the based pursuit, and the subspace pursuit while signal is corrupted by noises.

Qualitative analysis for microstructure is carried out by using the scanning electron microscopy images, and quantitative analysis for microstructures of pores and microstructural units is performed based on MATLAB. Microstructures such as particle morphology, structural type and microfracture distribution and their correlation with engineering characteristics are discussed. The results show that the content of clay minerals in expansive soil and rock is high. Strong expansive soil and rock have flocculation structure, flat aggregate and curly sheet-shape grains, and medium expansive soil and rock have turbulence and granular stack structure, flake aggregate and single grains. The former has higher void ratio, its microfracture with obvious orientation is well developed, and its pore fractal dimension and particle size are lower than those of the latter. The microstructural units of expansive soil and rock have low circular degree and high complexity. The orientation of expansion rock is significant and its particle fractal dimension is low. The fractal dimension has the same variation as the expansion potential and void ratio. The microcomposition, microstructure and physical properties exhibit linear and negative exponent correlations.

84885061825	Experimental study on physico-mechanical characteristics of undisturbed loess soaked in acid solution	There are a lot of calcium carbonate cementations in natural loess, and the cementations have significant influence on the mechanical properties of loess. The undisturbed natural loess samples are immersed into the hydrochloric acid solutions with concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 2 mol/L, respectively. The concentrations of calcium ions in soaking solution are measured at different time. The particle size analysis tests, oedometer tests and direct shear tests are used to study the mechanical properties and their variations of loess samples soaked in the hydrochloric acid solution for different time. The results show that the particle sizes of the cementations in the loess are mainly smaller than 0.01 mm. Under the action of acid solution, the calcareous cementations are gradually dissolved when soaked in hydrochloric solution. The small particles are gradually reduced, especially the percentage by weight of particles smaller than 0.005 mm is significantly reduced. With the higher acidity of the hydrochloric solution, the viscosity of dissolution is faster and the dissolution is fuller. The cementations in soils play the role of connecting particles in soil skeleton; therefore, the cementations have significant influence on the soil cohesion, while the effect of soil friction angle by the cementations is not obvious. The cohesion of samples decreases with the increase of the soaking time in hydrochloric solution, and it is gradually stabilized after being soaked for 60 d. The cohesion of samples decreases by about 47%, 63%, 87% after being soaked in hydrochloric acid solution with concentrations of 0.1, 1, 2 mol/L for 120 d, respectively. It is found that the more decrease of soil cohesion, the higher acidity of the solution. The porosity and the compression coefficient of soils increase with the erosion of calcareous cementations. With the decrease of calcareous cementations, the relationship curves of stress and strain of the loess change gradually from strain hardening type to strain softening one.

Therefore the first problem of the sloped foundation stability analysis to be solved is to reasonably determining the position and shape of the sliding surface. The Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, commonly used in the geotechnical engineering, shows that the failure of the rock and soil mass is due to the reach of the shear stress on someone surface to its shear strength, when there must occur a large shear deformation on the shear plane. Therefore, the sliding surface can be determined through searching the positions where have the largest shear strain increment.

On that basis, the change characteristics of permeability coefficient and its nonlinear relationship with matric suction are discussed; and the infiltration characteristics and rules of expansive soils and rocks are summarized. The results show that, water-holding characteristics are influenced by the physical properties, mineral composition and structure characteristics of expansive soils and rocks. The sample with stronger expansion potential, higher fine grain content and smaller pore structure has lower dehydrated rate. Permeability coefficient and water volume change coefficient decrease with the decrease of the moisture content; and these parameters are influenced by dry density and expansion potential, which also have power function relationship with matric suction.

This position is considered as the standard of defining sliding surfaces to assess the slope stability under the action of the foundation. A new method is proposed to determine the potential sliding surface, which is based on the largest shear strain increment. Firstly, the stress and strain in the slope were calculated by using the finite difference software-FALC3D. Secondly, a series of vertical line would be set in the calculating section. And then the discrete coordinates of the sliding surface, where the shear strain is largest on the vertical line, would be found through programming fish program. At last the position and shape of the sliding surface can be obtained through carrying on curve fitting of the discrete points by using the least squares method. The concept of this method is clear and can reflect the true form of the sliding surface through contrasting with the limit equilibrium method. Sliding surfaces of different depths and distances of slope are researched and a quadratic function is put forward which can describe the trends of glide direction. Three coefficients of the quadratic function were analyzed and the corresponding expression was obtained which can provide a reference to specification revision and engineering. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The test results show that a large number of AE signals of sericite schist coarse aggregates are generated in the initial stage. Before the axial strain reach 10%, AE counts are relatively quiet. But after 10%, they become anomalous and emerge obvious leap values. When the confining pressure up to 200kPa, AE signals are mainly generated by sliding friction.

84886287093	Sparse base constructed by the non-negative matrix factorization	When the signal is sparse or compressible in a transform domain, the measurement matrix which is non-coherent with the transform matrix can be used to project transform coefficients to the low-dimensional vector, and this projection can maintain the information for signal reconstruction. The compressed sensing technology can achieve the reconstruction with high accuracy or high probability using small number of projection data. The signal's reconstruction ability largely depends on its sparsity, as well as the non-coherence between the sampling matrix and the transform matrix. This paper proposes to use the NMF (non-negative matrix factorization) method to carry out sparse changes for the original signal and construct sparse transform base matrix φ. Besides, a comparative study between it and the transform matrix constructed by DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) is conducted to measure the coherence degree and sparsity. Then the OMP (orthogonal matching pursuit) is adopted to analyze the signal's restoration ability, showing that the restoration ability of NMF is superior to that of DFT and DWT. © 2013 Binary Information Press.

There is an approximate linear relationship between waviness of shear surface and stone ratio; and the value of waviness increases with the increase of stone ratio. The climbing effect may cause shear dilation and increase of shear stress and normal stress. With increase of normal stress, the failure mechanism in shear surface turns sliding into gnawing fracture; and the ratio of shear-normal stress is in decrease.

By the numerical simulation study of the pattern and scope of tunnel surrounding rock failure, the basic failure modes of this tunnel can be concluded as which the vault slope rock slip along a ramp through the arch of the foot to form a wedge, and the size of the angle between the sliding failure surface and the horizontal plane determine the range of surrounding rock failure.

The basic goal is to reconstruction of sparse images or signals from very few samples by means of solving a tractable optimization problem. An important aspect of sparse recovery is to develop the recovery performance in the presence of noise. In this article, we propose the matching pursuit algorithm of combinatorial optimization based Conjugate Gradient Lest Squares (CGLS) and Lest Squares QR (LSQR). We use non-negative matrix factorization for measuring discrepancy of solution sequence between CGLS and LSQR, and represent combinatorial optimization based CGLS and LSQR to choose optimal solution sequences.

84897729933	Numerical simulation study on the failure mechanism of bedding rock slope based on the Lagrangian multiplier method	The weak formulation of the Lagrangian control equations considering the contact constraint conditions and the FEM discrete equations have been derived. The non-linear and nonsmooth problems of the mechanical response are solved perfectly by adopting the suggestion method for which tolerance large tangential slipping of the contact surface. One excavation bedding rock slope of the Hu-Rong-Xi expressway is analyzed applying the method mentioned above. The distribution rules of the displacement, stress, strain, contact state, contact friction force and sliding distance under the status of critical sliding are obtained. The analysis results indicate that the failure of the bedding slope is a progressive course. The interlayer stagger firstly, then the deformation evaluates to creep bedding slip and the bottom rock occurs buckling slip at last. The destruction model changes form the bedding slide to rock buckling slip. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84901417322	A codesigned compact dual-band filtering antenna with PIN loaded for WLAN applications	A codesigned compact dual-band filtering antenna incorporating a PIN diode for 2.45/5.2GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) applications is proposed in this paper. The integrated filtering antenna system consists of a simple monopole radiator, a microstrip dual-band band-pass filter, and a PIN diode. The performance of the filtering antenna is notably promoted by optimizing the impedance between the antenna and the band-pass filter,with good selectivity and out-of-band rejection.The design process follows the approach of the synthesis of band-pass filter. In addition, the PIN diode is incorporated in the filtering antenna for further size reduction, which also widens the coverage of the bandwidth by about 230% for 2.4 GHz WLAN. With the presence of small size and good filtering performances, the proposed filtering antenna is a good candidate for the wireless communication systems. Prototypes of the proposed filtering antenna incorporating a PIN diode are fabricated and measured. The measured results including return losses and radiation patterns are presented.

84907234118	Experimental study of mechanical properties of coarse aggregates of sericite schist under different stress paths	Coarse aggregates of sericite schist are widely used in the construction of Gucheng-Zhuxi expressway as subgrade fillings. In order to study the mechanical properties of coarse aggregates of sericite schist, a series of large-scale triaxial tests under different stress paths were carried out, including the conventional drained triaxial, conventional undrained triaxial and constant p tests. All of the stress-strain curves under the low confining pressures exhibited the strain hardening phenomenon. However, the stress-strain curves exhibited the weak strain softening behavior under the high confining pressures. The volumetric strains were found to be mainly shear contraction under different confining pressures, and no shear dilatancy behavior appeared under low confining pressure. The reason of the abnormal strain change behaviour was explained through the analysis of the breakage characteristics of particles. In addition, it is verified that the Duncan's nonlinear strength criterion has a good applicability for the sericite schist coarse aggregates.

84907718328	Experimental study on influence of stress history on dynamic properties of remolded red clay	The dynamic characteristics of soils are important factors affecting the engineering stability. Experimental studies have shown that the stress history has a more significant impact on the static characteristics of the red clay. However, there are few research achievements from the studies on the influence of the stress history on the dynamic properties of the red clay. In order to further reveal the effect of the stress history on the dynamic characteristics of the red clay, a large number of dynamic triaxial tests are performed on the remolded red clay samples with different stress histories. The dynamic stress-strain bone curve and the dynamic modulus variation curve of the remolded red clay under different stress histories are obtained. The influence laws of the stress history on the remolded red clay are analyzed. The test results show that in the range not exceeding the strength of the red clay, improving the soil compactness, confining pressure, consolidation ratio and vibration frequency is beneficial to enhancing the dynamic strength and elastic modulus of the soils. In order to provide basic data and references for the relevant projects, several empirical equations for the dynamic indexes and stress history factors of red clay are established.

84907775819	Model test and numerical simulation of horizontal bearing capacity and impact factors for foundation piles in slope	The foundation pile in the slope soil has the dual function of load-bearing and slip resistance. The horizontal force character of it is more complex than the pile in the flat ground. Numerical experiments and model tests are used to study bearing characters and influence factor. Results of the model test show that the distance from the top of the slope has a great impact on horizontal bearing deformation properties of the pile. Under the same level of the load, the horizontal displacement of the pile with a bigger distance is less than that of the pile with a smaller distance. The critical load and ultimate bearing capacity of the pile with a bigger distance is larger than that of the pile with a smaller distance. The result of numerical simulation shows that the horizontal ultimate bearing capacity decreases with the increase of the slope ratio and increases with the growth of the distance from the top of the slope, which is same as the result of model tests. Differences between horizontal bearing deformation properties of piles in the slope and piles in the flat ground are discussed and the calculation method of horizontal bearing capacity of pile in the slope is developed, which can provide a reference to specification revision and engineering design.

84918826738	A method for predicting evaporation process in unsaturated soil surface	A method for predicting evaporation process in unsaturated soil surface is presented based on physical properties of soil and meteorological data. The soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is estimated by physical properties of soil (i.e. particle size distribution, specific gravity and dry density). Then, the relationship between relative humidity of soil surface and water content is obtained based on the SWCC. Finally, the Penman-Wilson model is applied to predict evaporation curve of unsaturated soil surface. In this method, only in situ soil physical properties and meteorological data are needed to get the predicted evaporation curve. The evaporation rate of soil surface can be obtained with given water content at that time. Laboratory evaporation tests of thin layer soils are conducted in a designed evaporation measuring system. The measured evaporation curves are compared with those predicted. The results show that the measured and prediction evaporation curves have same processes and slight difference in evaporation rate. Three evaporation stages, i.e. stable rate stage, reducing rate stage and residual stage, are evidently shown in both observed and predicted curves. The stages are divided by as called critical moisture content and air-dried moisture content. The suggested method is accurate and practical for engineers to predict unsaturated soil surface evaporation rate and determine the boundary flux.

84916936892	Experimental study of effect of particle breakage on strength and deformation of sericite schist	In order to further clarify the effect of particle breakage on strength and deformation of soft rock coarse aggregates, consolidation drained triaxial shear tests of two groups of different initial dry densities of sericite schist coarse aggregates are carried out. The law of particle breakage and its influence on mechanical properties of sercite schist coarse aggregates are discussed. The result shows that the relative particle breakage index of sercite schist coarse aggregates increases with confining pressure. But the growth rate of particle breakage is greatly influenced by the initial dry density. The relationship between particle breakage and confining pressure might be described by a linear function. The particle breakage of high density samples is significantly higher than low density samples under the same stress level because of the influence of the initial porosity. So influence of particle breakage on shear strength decrease under the high density is higher than the influence of low density samples; this might cause stress strain curve of two different dry densities to intersect somewhere. Finally, the shear strength of low density is greater than the high density samples. The porosity of high density sample is small and its dilatancy factor always stay near 1.The porosity of low density sample is larger and the particle breakage and dilatancy delay the impact on its dilatancy factor. So the lower density of samples, the larger volume change is. However, the volume change is very small because of the influence of particle breakage and dilatancy of sericite schist coarse aggregates.

12844251817	Unequal step lengths grey time-varying parameters model for settlement prediction	The settlement prediction of soft ground is a typical time varying system, of which the parameters have time-varying property; hence, the time-varying property of parameters taken into account in the grey model for settlement prediction is significant. According to the information handling principle of the grey theory, the unequal step lengths grey time-varying parameters model for settlement prediction has been built. In the model, both time-varying and grey property are considered; and a forgetting factor, of which the optimum value is validated according to the posterior variance ratio c, is quoted in the model to correct prediction results. The example shows that the unequal step lengths grey time-varying parameters model for settlement prediction has applicability, and prediction error can be decreased and the prediction precision can be enhance by the grey time-varying paraheters model.

84921977666	Stability analysis considering fracture distribution and strength for expansive soil slope	To complement the limitations of existing stability analysis method for expansive soil slope with generalized soil structure, especially fracture surface and weak interlayer, a new geological model of expansive soil slope with fractures has been established, which takes the slope as a combination of homogeneous soil filling with cracks and tension cracks, fitting the spatial information such as height, angle, thickness and length of typical controlling fracture of site survey into the slope model, and meanwhile, considering the strength parameters of the fracture surface. Based on the equilibrium methods, such as Janbu, Spencer and Morgenstern in the Slide program, which meet the equilibrium among the forces and moment of slices and are suitable for the broken line sliding surface, a typical landslide on the South-to-North Water Transfer Project is taken as an example for analyzing the stability and features of the expansive soil slope with fractures. The results show that with the model closer to the real slope conditions, the stability of the slope is also getting closer to the engineering practice. After considering the vertical fracture from surface, groundwater and gentle-dipping fracture at toe of the slope, safety factor falls significantly, and sliding surface, which made of vertical crack at slope top and slip surface developed from the bottom of the vertical cracks to the slope foot, assumes broken line form and its failure characteristics is basically the same as that of actual landslide.
