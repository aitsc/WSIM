0906.0977	binary orbit, physical properties, and evolutionary state of capella  (alpha aurigae)	we report extensive radial-velocity measurements of the two giant componentsof the detached, 104-day period binary system of capella. our highly accuratethree-dimensional orbital solution based on all existing spectroscopic andastrometric observations including our own yields much improved masses of 2.466+/- 0.018 m_sun and 2.443 +/- 0.013 m_sun for the primary and secondary(relative errors of 0.7% and 0.5%). improved values are derived also for theradii (11.87 +/- 0.56 r_sun and 8.75 +/- 0.32 r_sun), effective temperatures(4920 +/- 70 k and 5680 +/- 70 k), and luminosities (79.5 +/- 4.8 l_sun and72.1 +/- 3.6 l_sun). the distance is determined to be 13.042 +/- 0.028 pc.capella is unique among evolved stars in that, in addition to all of the above,the chemical composition is known, including the overall metallicity [m/h], thecarbon isotope ratio 12c/13c for the primary, and the lithium abundance and c/nratios for both components. the latter three quantities are sensitivediagnostics of evolution, and change drastically for giants as a result of thedeepening of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. the secondaryis crossing the hertzprung gap, while the primary is believed to be in thelonger-lived core-helium burning phase. however, we find that current stellarevolution models are unable to match all of the observations for bothcomponents at the same time, and at a single age, for any evolutionary state ofthe primary. similar problems are found when testing the rotationalsynchronization, spin axis alignment, and orbital circularization of the systemagainst tidal theory. we conclude that our understanding of the advanced stagesof stellar evolution is still very incomplete.

0906.2207	mass and radius determinations for five transiting m-dwarf stars	we have derived masses and radii for both components in five short-periodsingle-lined eclipsing binary stars discovered by the tres wide-anglephotometric survey for transiting planets. all these systems consist of avisible f-star primary and an unseen m-star secondary (m_a &gt; 0.8 m_sun, m_b &lt;0.45 m_sun). the spectroscopic orbital solution combined with a high precisiontransit light curve for each system gives sufficient information to calculatethe density of the primary star and the surface gravity of the secondary. themasses of the primary stars were obtained using stellar evolution models. thesolutions were compared with results obtained by calculating the radius of theprimary stars under the assumption of rotational synchronization with theorbital period and alignment between their spin axis and the axis of the orbit.four systems show an acceptable match between the two sets of results, but onesystem shows a clear mismatch between the two solutions, which may indicate theabsence of synchronization or a misalignment between the rotational and orbitalaxis. when compared to low-mass stellar evolution models, the derived massesand radii of the unseen m dwarfs are inconsistent (three only marginally) withthe predicted values, with all of the radii being larger than expected fortheir masses. these results confirm the discrepancy shown in previous workbetween the predicted and observed radii on low-mass binary stars. this workalso shows that reliance on the assumption of synchronization to derive themass and radius of stars in eclipsing single--lined f+m binaries is a usefultool, but may not always be warranted and should be carefully tested againststellar evolution models.

1001.5011	epsilon aurigae: an improved spectroscopic orbital solution	a rare eclipse of the mysterious object epsilon aurigae will occur in2009-2011. we report an updated single-lined spectroscopic solution for theorbit of the primary star based on 20 years of monitoring at the cfa, combinedwith historical velocity observations dating back to 1897. there are 518 newcfa observations obtained between 1989 and 2009. two solutions are presented.one uses the velocities outside the eclipse phases together with mid-times ofprevious eclipses, from photometry dating back to 1842, which provide thestrongest constraint on the ephemeris. this yields a period of 9896.0 +/- 1.6days (27.0938 +/- 0.0044 years) with a velocity semi-amplitude of 13.84 +/-0.23 km/s and an eccentricity of 0.227 +/- 0.011. the middle of the currenton-going eclipse predicted by this combined fit is jd 2,455,413.8 +/- 4.8,corresponding to 2010 august 5. if we use only the radial velocities, we findthat the predicted middle of the current eclipse is nine months earlier. thiswould imply that the gravitating companion is not the same as the eclipsingobject. alternatively, the purely spectroscopic solution may be biased byperturbations in the velocities due to the short-period oscillations of thesupergiant.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1110.5336	spitzer infrared observations and independent validation of the  transiting super-earth corot-7b	the detection and characterization of the first transiting super-earth,corot-7 b, has required an unprecedented effort in terms of telescope time andanalysis. although the star does display a radial velocity signal at the periodof the planet, this has been difficult to disentangle from the intrinsicstellar variability, and pinning down the velocity amplitude has been verychallenging. as a result, the precise value of the mass of the planet - andeven the extent to which it can be considered to be confirmed - have beendebated in the recent literature, with six mass measurements published so farbased on the same spectroscopic observations, ranging from about 2 to 8 earthmasses. here we report on an independent validation of the planet discovery,using one of the fundamental properties of a transit signal: its achromaticity.we observed four transits of corot-7 b with spitzer, in order to determinewhether the depth of the transit signal in the near-infrared is consistent withthat observed in the corot bandpass, as expected for a planet. we detected thetransit and found an average depth of 0.426 {\pm} 0.115 mmag at 4.5 {\mu}m,which is in good agreement with the depth of 0.350 {\pm} 0.011 mmag found bycorot. these observations place important constraints on the kinds ofastrophysical false positives that could mimic the signal. combining this withadditional constraints reported earlier, we performed an exhaustive explorationof possible blends scenarios for corot-7 b using the blender technique. we areable to rule out the vast majority of false positives, and the remaining onesare found to be much less likely than a true transiting planet. we thusvalidate corot-7 b as a bona-fide planet with a very high degree of confidence,independently of any radial-velocity information. our spitzer observations haveadditionally allowed us to significantly improve the ephemeris of the planet.

1112.4514	kepler-20: a sun-like star with three sub-neptune exoplanets and two  earth-size candidates	we present the discovery of the kepler-20 planetary system, which weinitially identified through the detection of five distinct periodic transitsignals in the kepler light curve of the host star 2massj19104752+4220194. wefind a stellar effective temperature teff=5455+-100k, a metallicity of[fe/h]=0.01+-0.04, and a surface gravity of log(g)=4.4+-0.1. combined with anestimate of the stellar density from the transit light curves we deduce astellar mass of mstar=0.912+-0.034 msun and a stellar radius ofrstar=0.944^{+0.060}_{-0.095} rsun. for three of the transit signals, ourresults strongly disfavor the possibility that these result from astrophysicalfalse positives. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more likely thanthat of an astrophysical false positive by a factor of 2e5 (kepler-20b), 1e5(kepler-20c), and 1.1e3 (kepler-20d), sufficient to validate these objects asplanetary companions. for kepler-20c and kepler-20d, the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: from spitzer datagathered at 4.5um, we infer a ratio of the planetary to stellar radii of0.075+-0.015 (kepler-20c) and 0.065+-0.011 (kepler-20d), consistent with eachof the depths measured in the kepler optical bandpass. we determine the orbitalperiods and physical radii of the three confirmed planets to be 3.70d and1.91^{+0.12}_{-0.21} rearth for kepler-20b, 10.85 d and 3.07^{+0.20}_{-0.31}rearth for kepelr-20c, and 77.61 d and 2.75^{+0.17}_{-0.30} rearth forkepler-20d. from multi-epoch radial velocities, we determine the masses ofkepler-20b and kepler-20c to be 8.7\+-2.2 mearth and 16.1+-3.5 mearth,respectively, and we place an upper limit on the mass of kepler-20d of 20.1mearth (2 sigma).

1112.4550	two earth-sized planets orbiting kepler-20	since the discovery of the first extrasolar giant planets around sun-likestars, evolving observational capabilities have brought us closer to thedetection of true earth analogues. the size of an exoplanet can be determinedwhen it periodically passes in front of (transits) its parent star, causing adecrease in starlight proportional to its radius. the smallest exoplanethitherto discovered has a radius 1.42 times that of the earth's radius (rearth), and hence has 2.9 times its volume. here we report the discovery of twoplanets, one earth-sized (1.03r earth) and the other smaller than the earth(0.87r earth), orbiting the star kepler-20, which is already known to hostthree other, larger, transiting planets. the gravitational pull of the newplanets on the parent star is too small to measure with currentinstrumentation. we apply a statistical method to show that the likelihood ofthe planetary interpretation of the transit signals is more than three ordersof magnitude larger than that of the alternative hypothesis that the signalsresult from an eclipsing binary star. theoretical considerations imply thatthese planets are rocky, with a composition of iron and silicate. the outerplanet could have developed a thick water vapour atmosphere.

1201.5409	transit timing observations from kepler: ii. confirmation of two  multiplanet systems via a non-parametric correlation analysis	we present a new method for confirming transiting planets based on thecombination of transit timingn variations (ttvs) and dynamical stability.correlated ttvs provide evidence that the pair of bodies are in the samephysical system. orbital stability provides upper limits for the masses of thetransiting companions that are in the planetary regime. this paper describes anon-parametric technique for quantifying the statistical significance of ttvsbased on the correlation of two ttv data sets. we apply this method to ananalysis of the transit timing variations of two stars with multiple transitingplanet candidates identified by kepler. we confirm four transiting planets intwo multiple planet systems based on their ttvs and the constraints imposed bydynamical stability. an additional three candidates in these same systems arenot confirmed as planets, but are likely to be validated as real planets oncefurther observations and analyses are possible. if all were confirmed, thesesystems would be near 4:6:9 and 2:4:6:9 period commensurabilities. our resultsdemonstrate that ttvs provide a powerful tool for confirming transitingplanets, including low-mass planets and planets around faint stars for whichdoppler follow-up is not practical with existing facilities. continued keplerobservations will dramatically improve the constraints on the planet masses andorbits and provide sensitivity for detecting additional non-transiting planets.if kepler observations were extended to eight years, then a similar analysiscould likely confirm systems with multiple closely spaced, small transitingplanets in or near the habitable zone of solar-type stars.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

0710.4883	the transiting exoplanet host star gj 436: a test of stellar evolution  models in the lower main sequence, and revised planetary parameters	knowledge of the stellar parameters for the parent stars of transitingexoplanets is pre-requisite for establishing the planet properties themselves,and often relies on stellar evolution models. gj 436, which is orbited by atransiting neptune-mass object, presents a difficult case because it is an mdwarf. stellar models in this mass regime are not as reliable as for highermass stars, and tend to underestimate the radius. here we use constraints frompublished transit light curve solutions for gj 436 along with otherspectroscopic quantities to show how the models can still be used to infer themass and radius accurately, and at the same time allow the radius discrepancyto be estimated. similar systems should be found during the upcoming keplermission, and could provide in this way valuable constraints to stellarevolution models in the lower main sequence. the stellar mass and radius of gj436 are m = 0.452 [-0.012,+0.014] m(sun) and r = 0.464 [-0.011,+0.009] r(sun),and the radius is 10% larger than predicted by the standard models, inagreement with previous results from well studied double-lined eclipsingbinaries. we obtain an improved planet mass and radius of m = 23.17 +/- 0.79m(earth) and r = 4.22 [-0.10,+0.09] r(earth), a density of rho = 1.69[-0.12,+0.14] g/cm3, and an orbital semimajor axis of a = 0.02872 +/- 0.00027au.

1202.0300	precise infrared radial velocities from keck/nirspec and the search for  young planets	we present a high-precision infrared radial velocity study of late-type starsusing spectra obtained with nirspec at the w. m. keck observatory. radialvelocity precisions of 50 m/s are achieved for old field mid-m dwarfs usingtelluric features for precise wavelength calibration. using this technique, 20young stars in the {\beta} pic (age ~12 myr) and tw hya (age ~8 myr)associations were monitored over several years to search for low masscompanions; we also included the chromospherically active field star gj 873 (evlac) in this survey. based on comparisons with previous optical observations ofthese young active stars, radial velocity measurements at infrared wavelengthsmitigate the radial velocity noise caused by star spots by a factor of ~3.nevertheless, star spot noise is still the dominant source of measurement errorfor young stars at 2.3 {\mu}m, and limits the precision to ~77 m/s for theslowest rotating stars (v sin i &lt; 6 km/s), increasing to ~168 m/s for rapidlyrotating stars (v sin i &gt; 12 km/s). the observations reveal both gj 3305 andtwa 23 to be single-lined spectroscopic binaries; in the case of gj 3305, themotion is likely caused by its 0.09" companion, identified after this surveybegan. the large amplitude, short-timescale variations of twa 13a areindicative of a hot jupiter-like companion, but the available data areinsufficient to confirm this. we label it as a candidate radial velocityvariable. for the remainder of the sample, these observations exclude thepresence of any 'hot' (p &lt; 3 days) companions more massive than 8 mjup, and any'warm' (p &lt; 30 days) companions more massive than 17 mjup, on average. assumingan edge-on orbit for the edge-on disk system au mic, these observations excludethe presence of any hot jupiters more massive than 1.8 mjup or warm jupitersmore massive than 3.9 mjup.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1208.1268	improved spectroscopic parameters for transiting planet hosts	we report homogeneous spectroscopic determinations of the effectivetemperature, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for the host starsof 56 transiting planets. our analysis is based primarily on the stellarparameter classification (spc) technique. we investigate systematic errors byexamining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been usedin previous studies (sme and moog). the spc and sme results, both based oncomparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strongcorrelations between temperature, [fe/h], and log g when solving for all threequantities simultaneously. in contrast the moog results, based on a moretraditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. to combat thecorrelations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, werepeat the spc analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellardensity that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves.previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have beensubject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and10%, respectively, which can be larger than other observational uncertainties,and which also cause systematic errors in the planetary mass and radius.

1301.0842	the false positive rate of kepler and the occurrence of planets	the kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolarplanets. this goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives suchas eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound tothem, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. we performnumerical simulations to predict the occurrence of astrophysical falsepositives detectable by the mission, and quantify the fraction of them thatwould pass the kepler candidate vetting procedure. by comparing theirdistribution with that of the kepler objects of interest detected during thefirst six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positiverate of kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planetsize, and orbital period. we find that the global false positive rate of kepleris 9.4 %, peaking for giant planets (6-22 earth radii) at 17.7 %, reaching alow of 6.7 % for small neptunes (2-4 earth radii), and increasing again forearth-size planets (0.8-1.25 earth radii) to 12.3 %.  most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rateof occurrence of planets down to earth size with no prior assumptions on theirfrequency, by subtracting from the population of actual kepler candidates oursimulated population of astrophysical false positives. we find that 16.5 +/-3.6 % of main-sequence fgk stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25earth radii with orbital periods up to 85 days. there is no significantdependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 earth radii withspectral type. in the process, we derive also a prescription for the signalrecovery rate of kepler that enables a good match to both the koi size andorbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.

1406.3788	empirical tests of pre-main-sequence stellar evolution models with  eclipsing binaries	we examine the performance of standard pms stellar evolution models againstthe accurately measured properties of a benchmark sample of 26 pms stars in 13eb systems. we provide a definitive compilation of all fundamental propertiesfor the ebs. we also provide a definitive compilation of the various pms modelsets. in the h-r diagram, the masses inferred for the individual stars by themodels are accurate to better than 10% above 1 msun, but below 1 msun they arediscrepant by 50-100%. we find evidence that the failure of the models to matchthe data is linked to the triples in the eb sample; at least half of the ebspossess tertiary companions. excluding the triples, the models reproduce thestellar masses to better than ~10% in the h-r diagram, down to 0.5 msun, belowwhich the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. we considerseveral mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the eb propertiesand thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. we show that theenergies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentiallyexplain the scatter in the eb properties through injection of heat, perhapsinvolving tidal interaction. it seems from the evidence at hand that thismechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surfaceproperties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithiumabundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. the ebs thatare members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, butcollectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreadsin young clusters. however, this apparent spread in the eb ages may also be theresult of scatter in the eb properties induced by tertiaries.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

1505.07461	capella (alpha aurigae) revisited: new binary orbit, physical  properties, and evolutionary state	knowledge of the chemical composition and absolute masses of capella are keyto understanding the evolutionary state of this benchmark binary systemcomprising two giant stars. previous efforts, including our own 2009 study,have largely failed to reach an acceptable agreement between the observationsand current stellar evolution models, preventing us from assessing the statusof the primary. here we report a revision of the physical properties of thecomponents incorporating recently published high-precision radial velocitymeasurements, and a new detailed chemical analysis providing abundances formore than 20 elements in both stars. we obtain highly precise (to about 0.3%)masses of 2.5687 +/- 0.0074 and 2.4828 +/- 0.0067 solar masses, radii of 11.98+/- 0.57 and 8.83 +/- 0.33 solar radii, effective temperatures of 4970 +/- 50 kand 5730 +/- 60 k, and independently measured luminosities based on the orbitalparallax (78.7 +/- 4.2 and 72.7 +/- 3.6 solar luminosities). we find anexcellent match to stellar evolution models at the measured composition of[fe/h] = -0.04 +/- 0.06. three different sets of models place the primary starfirmly at the end of the core helium-burning phase (clump), while the secondaryis known to be evolving rapidly across the hertzprung gap. the measured lithiumabundance, the c/n ratio, and the 12c/13c isotopic carbon abundance ratio,which change rapidly in the giant phase, are broadly in agreement withexpectations from models. predictions from tidal theory for the spin rates,spin-orbit alignment, and other properties do not fare as well, requiring a40-fold increase in the efficiency of the dissipation mechanisms in order tomatch the observations.

0807.1530	determination of stellar, orbital and planetary parameters using  complete monte-carlo analysis -- the case of hat-p-7b	the recently discovered transiting very hot jupiter, hat-p-7b, a planetdetected by the telescopes of hatnet, turned out to be among the ones subjectedto the highest irradiation from the parent star. as known, the combination ofphotometric and spectroscopic data for such an object yields the stellar,orbital and planetary parameters. in order to best characterize this particularplanet, we carried out a complex analysis based on a complete and simultaneousmonte-carlo solution using all available data. we included the discovery lightcurves, partial follow-up light curves, the radial velocity data, and we usedthe stellar evolution models to infer the stellar properties. thisself-consistent way of modeling provides the most precise estimate of the aposteriori distributions of all of the system parameters of interest, andavoids making assumptions on the values and uncertainties of any of theinternally derived variables describing the system. this analysis demonstratesthat even partial light curve information can be valuable. this may become veryimportant for future discoveries of planets with longer periods -- andtherefore longer transit durations -- where the chance of observing a fullevent is small.

0807.3746	t-lyr1-17236: a long-period low-mass eclipsing binary	we describe the discovery of a 0.68+0.52 solar mass eclipsing binary (eb)with an 8.4-day orbital period, found through a systematic search of ten fieldsof the trans-atlantic exoplanet survey (tres). such long-period low-mass ebsconstitute critical test cases for resolving the long standing discrepancybetween the theoretical and observational mass-radius relations at the bottomof the main sequence. it has been suggested that this discrepancy may berelated to strong stellar magnetic fields, which are not properly accounted forin current theoretical models. all previously well-characterized low-mass mainsequence ebs have periods of a few days or less, and their components aretherefore expected to be rotating rapidly as a result of tidal synchronization,thus generating strong magnetic fields. in contrast, the binary systemdescribed here has a period that is over three times longer than previouslycharacterized low-mass main sequence ebs, and its components rotate relativelyslowly. it is therefore expected to have a weaker magnetic field and to bettermatch the assumptions of theoretical stellar models. our follow-up observationsof this eb yield preliminary stellar properties that suggest it is indeedconsistent with current models. if further observations confirm a low level ofactivity in this system, these determinations would provide support for thehypothesis that the mass-radius discrepancy is at least partly due to magneticactivity.

astro-ph;0012542	the change in the inclination angle of the non-eclipsing binary ss  lacertae: future eclipses	eclipses in the 14.4-day period double-lined binary ss lac were observedphotographically and visually early in the 20th century, but stopped some 50 or60 years ago. this has been explained by the presence of a distant third starin the system, which has now been detected spectroscopically with a period of679 days. the plane of the orbit of the binary is changing relative to the lineof sight in response to perturbations from this third object. a recent analysisby milone et al. (m00) of all photometric material available for the system,including a re-measurement of original harvard plates, has confirmed earlierreports of changes in the depth of the eclipses as a function of time, whichare due to the third star. in this paper we discuss our detailed analysis ofthe eclipse amplitude measurements, and extract from them information on thechange in the inclination angle of the binary over the last century. our use ofa much improved ephemeris for the system by torres &amp; stefanik was found to becrucial, and prompted us to re-determine all the amplitudes from the historicaldata at our disposal, including the harvard material used by m00.systematically lower measurements on the branches of the minima were properlyaccounted for, and we made use of both a linear approximation to the timevariation of the inclination angle and a more realistic model based on thetheory of three-body interactions ("regression of the nodes" effect). the nodalcycle is found to be about 600 yr, within which two eclipse "seasons" occur,each lasting about 100 yr. the non-eclipsing status of the system is expectedto continue until the beginning of the 23rd century.

astro-ph;0111167	absolute dimensions of the m-type eclipsing binary yy geminorum (castor  c): a challenge to evolutionary models in the lower main-sequence	we present new spectroscopic observations of the detached late-typedouble-lined eclipsing binary yy gem, a member of the castor sextuple systemand one of the benchmarks for the comparison between observations and stellarevolution theory in the lower main-sequence. in addition, we have re-analyzedexisting light curves in several passbands using modern techniques that accountfor the conspicuous presence of spots. this, combined with the spectroscopy,has yielded a very precise determination of the absolute dimensions of thecomponents, which are virtually identical to each other. we obtain mean valuesof m=0.5992+/-0.0047 mo, r=0.6191+/-0.0057 ro, and teff=3820+/-100 k. both themass and the radius determinations are good to better than 1%. a re-analysis ofthe hipparcos transit data for castor ab has yielded an improved parallax forthe system of 66.90+/-0.63 mas. with this, we have estimated the age (~370 myr)and metal abundance ([fe/h]~0.0) of yy gem from isochrone fits to castor a andb. we have compared the observations of yy gem with a large number of recenttheoretical calculations, and we show that all models underestimate the radiusby up to 20%, and most overestimate the effective temperature by 150 k or more.both of these trends are confirmed by observations of another similar system inthe hyades cluster (v818 tau). consequently, theoretical ages for relativelylow-mass objects such as t tauri stars derived from the h-r diagram may beconsiderably biased. if the radius is used directly as a measure of evolution,ages could be underestimated by as much as a factor of 10 in this mass regime.in view of these discrepancies, absolute ages from essentially all currentmodels for the lower main sequence must be viewed with at least some measure ofskepticism.

astro-ph;0410157	testing blend scenarios for extrasolar transiting planet candidates. ii.  -- ogle-tr-56	we re-examine the photometric and spectroscopic evidence available for thestar ogle-tr-56, recently discovered to harbor a giant planet presentingtransits and orbiting with a period of 1.21 days. we investigate thepossibility that the observational signatures reported might be the result of"blending" with the light of an eclipsing binary along the same line of sight.using techniques developed earlier we perform fits to the light curve under avariety of blend configurations, subject to all observational constraints, andwe infer further properties of these possible blends. we then carry outrealistic end-to-end simulations based on those properties in order to quantifythe spectral line asymmetries and radial velocity variations expected from suchscenarios. we confront these calculations with the observations. the resultsfrom these models are clearly inconsistent with the measured radial velocityand bisector span variations, ruling out blends and confirming the planetarynature of the companion. the example of ogle-tr-56 serves to illustrate thesort of tests that can and should be performed on transiting planet candidatesto eliminate the possibility of "false positives", and in particular,line-of-sight contamination from eclipsing binaries.

astro-ph;0501554	the challenge of wide-field transit surveys: the case of gsc 01944-02289	wide-field searches for transiting extra-solar giant planets face thedifficult challenge of separating true transit events from the numerous falsepositives caused by isolated or blended eclipsing binary systems. we describehere the investigation of gsc 01944-02289, a very promising candidate for atransiting brown dwarf detected by the transatlantic exoplanet survey (tres)network. the photometry and radial velocity observations suggested that thecandidate was an object of substellar mass in orbit around an f star. however,careful analysis of the spectral line shapes revealed a pattern of variationsconsistent with the presence of another star whose motion produced theasymmetries observed in the spectral lines of the brightest star. detailedsimulations of blend models composed of an eclipsing binary plus a third stardiluting the eclipses were compared with the observed light curve and used toderive the properties of the three components. our photometric andspectroscopic observations are fully consistent with a blend model of ahierarchical triple system composed of an eclipsing binary with g0v and m3vcomponents in orbit around a slightly evolved f5 dwarf. we believe that thisinvestigation will be helpful to other groups pursuing wide-field transitsearches as this type of false detection could be more common than truetransiting planets, and difficult to identify.

astro-ph;0502250	testing stellar models with an improved physical orbit for 12 bootis	we report on a significantly improved determination of the physical orbit ofthe double-lined spectroscopic binary system 12 boo. we have a 12 boointerferometry dataset spanning six years with the palomar testbedinterferometer, a smaller amount of data from the navy prototype opticalinterferometer, and a radial velocity dataset spanning 14 years from theharvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics. we have updated the 12 boophysical orbit model with our expanded interferometric and radial velocitydatasets. the revised orbit is in good agreement with previous results, and thephysical parameters implied by a combined fit to our visibility and radialvelocity data result in precise component masses and luminosities. inparticular, the orbital parallax of the system is determined to be 27.74 $\pm$0.15 mas, and masses of the two components are determined to be 1.4160 $\pm$0.0049 m$_{\sun}$ and 1.3740 $\pm$ 0.0045 m$_{\sun}$, respectively. based ontheoretical models we can estimate a system age of approximately 3.2 gyr.comparisons with stellar models suggest that the 12 boo primary may be justentering the hertzsprung gap, but that conclusion is highly dependent ondetails of the models. such a dynamic evolutionary state makes the 12 boosystem a unique and important test for stellar models.

astro-ph;0503457	detection of thermal emission from an extrasolar planet	we present spitzer space telescope infrared photometric time series of thetransiting extrasolar planet system tres-1. the data span a predicted time ofsecondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star.in both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing,amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system.this signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e. the observation ofphotons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. the observed eclipse depths(in units of relative flux) are 0.00066 +/- 0.00013 at 4.5um and 0.00225 +/-0.00036 at 8.0um. these estimates provide the first observational constraintson models of the thermal emission of hot jupiters. assuming that the planetemits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of t_p=1060 +/- 50k. under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibriumwith the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a bond albedoof a = 0.31 +/- 0.14. this would imply that the planet absorbs the majority ofstellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact toatmospheric models of these objects. we compare our data to apreviously-published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predictsprominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbonmonoxide. based on the time of secondary eclipse, we present an upper limit onthe orbital eccentricity that is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidaldissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior tothe planet.(abridged)

astro-ph;0510455	the astrometric-spectroscopic binary system hip 50796: an overmassive  companion	we report spectroscopic observations of the star hip 50796, previouslyconsidered (but later rejected) as a candidate member of the tw hyaassociation. our measurements reveal it to be a single-lined binary with anorbital period of 570 days and an eccentricity of e = 0.61. the astrometricsignature of this orbit was previously detected by the hipparcos satellite inthe form of curvature in the proper motion components, although the period wasunknown at the time. by combining our radial velocity measurements with thehipparcos intermediate data (abscissae residuals) we are able to derive thefull three-dimensional orbit, and determine the dynamical mass of the unseencompanion as well as a revised trigonometric parallax that accounts for theorbital motion. given our primary mass estimate of 0.73 solar masses (mid-kdwarf), the companion mass is determined to be 0.89 solar masses, or about 20%larger than the primary. the likely explanation for the larger mass without anyapparent contribution to the light is that the companion is itself a closerbinary composed of m dwarfs. the near-infrared excess and x-ray emissiondisplayed by hip 50796 support this. our photometric modeling of the excessleads to a lower limit to the mass ratio of the close binary of about q = 0.8,and individual masses of 0.44-0.48 solar masses and 0.41-0.44 solar masses. thenew parallax (20.6 +/- 1.9 mas) is significantly smaller than the originalhipparcos value, and more precise.

astro-ph;0601515	a physical orbit for the high proper motion binary hd 9939	we report spectroscopic and interferometric observations of the high-propermotion double-lined binary system hd 9939, with an orbital period ofapproximately 25 days. by combining our radial-velocity and visibilitymeasurements we estimate the system physical orbit and derive dynamical massesfor the components of $m_a = 1.072 \pm 0.014$ m$_{\sun}$ and $m_b = 0.8383 \pm0.0081$ m$_{\sun}$; fractional errors of 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively. we alsodetermine a system distance of $42.23 \pm 0.21$ pc, corresponding to an orbitalparallax of $\pi_{\rm orb} = 23.68 \pm 0.12$ mas. the system distance and theestimated brightness difference between the stars in $v$, $h$, and $k$ yieldcomponent absolute magnitudes in these bands. by spectroscopic analysis andspectral energy distribution modeling we also estimate the component effectivetemperatures and luminosities as $t_{\rm eff}^a = 5050 \pm 100$ k and $t_{\rmeff}^b = 4950 \pm 200$ k and $l_a$ = 2.451 $\pm$ 0.041 $l_{\sun}$ and $l_b$ =0.424 $\pm$ 0.023 $l_{\sun}$.  both our spectral analysis and comparison with stellar models suggest that hd9939 has elemental abundances near solar values. further, comparison withstellar models suggests the hd 9939 primary has evolved off the main sequenceand appears to be traversing the hertzsprung gap as it approaches the red giantphase of its evolution. our measurements of the primary properties provide newempirical constraints on stellar models during this particularly dynamicevolutionary phase. that hd 9939 is currently in a relatively short-livedevolutionary state allows us to estimate the system age as 9.12 $\pm$ 0.25 gyr.in turn the age and abundance of the system place a potentially interesting, ifanecdotal, constraint on star formation in the galactic disk.

astro-ph;0703193	astrometric-spectroscopic determination of the absolute masses of the  hgmn binary star phi herculis	the mercury-manganese star phi her is a well known spectroscopic binary thathas been the subject of a recent study by zavala et al.
