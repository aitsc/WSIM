0902.3385	discovery of long-term superorbital periodicities in the  pseudo-transient lmxbs: igr j17098-3628 and exo0748-676	long-term monitoring of the recently discovered x-ray transient, igrj17098-3628, by the all sky monitor on board the rossi x-ray timing explorer,has shown that it displays a long term (~163d) quasi-periodic modulation in thedata spanning its "active" state (i.e. approximately mjd 53450-54200).furthermore, this light-curve is not typical of "classical" soft x-raytransients, in that j17098-3628 has remained active since its initialdiscovery, and may be more akin to the pseudo-transient exo0748-676, which isnow classified as a persistent low mass x-ray binary. however, exo0748-676recently entered a more active phase (since approximately mjd 53050), sincewhen we find that it too displays a quasi-periodic modulation (~181d) in itslight-curve. this must be a "superorbital" modulation, as the orbital period ofexo0748-676 is well established (3.8hrs), and hence we interpret both objects'long periods as representing some intrinsic properties of the accretion disc(such as coupled precessional and warping effects). by analogy, we thereforesuggest that igr j17098-3628 is another member of this class ofpseudo-transient lmxbs and is likely to have a &lt;1d orbital period.

1010.4184	correlated optical/x-ray long-term variability in lmxb 4u1636-536	we have conducted a 3-month program of simultaneous optical, soft and hardx-ray monitoring of the lmxb 4u1636-536/v801 ara using the smarts 1.3mtelescope and archival rxte/asm and swift/xrt data. 4u1636-536 has beenexhibiting a large amplitude, quasi-periodic variability since 2002 when itsx-ray flux dramatically declined by roughly an order of magnitude. we confirmedthat the anti-correlation between soft (2-12 kev) and hard (&gt; 20 kev) x-rays,first investigated by shih et al. (2005), is not an isolated event but afundamental characteristic of this source's variability properties. however,the variability itself is neither strictly stable nor changing on an evenlonger characteristic timescale. we also demonstrate that the opticalcounterpart varies on the same timescale, and is correlated with the soft, andnot the hard, x-rays. this clearly shows that x-ray reprocessing in lmxb discsis mainly driven by soft x-rays. the x-ray spectra in different epochs of thevariability revealed a change of spectral characteristics which resemble thestate change of black hole x-ray binaries. all the evidence suggests that4u1636-536 is frequently (~monthly) undergoing x-ray state transitions, acharacteristic feature of x-ray novae with their wide range of luminositiesassociated with outburst events. in its current behavioural mode, this makes4u1636-536 an ideal target for investigating the details of state changes inluminous x-ray binaries.

1111.6946	the nature of the x-ray transient maxi j0556-332	phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly discovered x-ray transient maxij0556-332 has revealed the presence of narrow emission lines in the bowenregion that most likely arise on the surface of the mass donor star in this lowmass x-ray binary. a period search of the radial velocities of these linesprovides two candidate orbital periods (16.43+/-0.12 and 9.754+/-0.048 hrs),which differ from any potential x-ray periods reported. assuming that maxij0556-332 is a relatively high inclination system that harbors a precessingaccretion disk in order to explain its x-ray properties, it is only possible toobtain a consistent set of system parameters for the longer period. theseassumptions imply a mass ratio of q~0.45, a radial velocity semi-amplitude ofthe secondary of k_2~190 km/s and a compact object mass of the order of thecanonical neutron star mass, making a black hole nature for maxi j0556-332unlikely. we also report the presence of strong n iii emission lines in thespectrum, thereby inferring a high n/o abundance. finally we note that thestrength of all emission lines shows a continuing decay over the ~1 month ofour observations.

astro-ph;0102075	the optical counterpart to sax j1808.4-3658: observations in quiescence	we report the first extensive set of optical photometric observations of thecounterpart to sax j1808.4-3658 (v4580 sagittarius) in quiescence. the sourcewas detected at v~21, 5 magnitudes fainter than at the peak of its 1998outburst. however, a comparable ~6% semi-amplitude 2hr modulation of its fluxis revealed. this has the same phasing and approximately sinusoidal modulationas seen during outburst and with photometric minimum when the pulsar is behindthe companion. the lack of a double-humped morphology rules out an ellipsoidalorigin, implying that the bulk of the optical flux does not arise from thecompanion. moreover, applying crude modelling to the disc and x-ray irradiatedface of the donor shows that the internal energy release of a remnant disc(with mass transfer driven by gravitational radiation) is sufficient to explainmost of the optical emission, and with the modulation due to the varyingcontribution of the heated star's face. we note that this model is alsoconsistent with the much lower x-ray to optical flux ratio in quiescence versusoutburst, and with the phasing of the optical modulation.

astro-ph;0211154	the optical light curves of xte j2123--058: the mass of the binary  components and the structure of the quiescent accretion disk	we present optical photometry of xte j2123-058 during its quiescent statetaken in 1999 and 2000. the dominant feature of our r-band light curve is theellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star, however, in order to fit thissatisfactorily we require additional components which comprise an x-ray heatedroche-lobe filling secondary star, and an accretion disk bulge, i.e. where thegas stream impacts the accretion disk. the observed dip near phase 0.8 isinterpreted as the eclipse of inner parts of the accretion disk by the bulge.this scenario is highly plausible given the high binary inclination. our fitsallow us to constrain the size of the quiescent accretion disk to lie in therange 0.26-0.56r_l1 (68% confidence). using the distance of 9.6 kpc and thex-ray flux inferred from the heated hemisphere of the companion, we obtain anunabsorbed x-ray luminosity of 1.2x10^33 erg/s for xte j2123-058 in quiescence.  from the observed quiescent optical/ir colors we find that the power-lawindex (-1.4) for the spectral distribution of the accretion disk compares wellwith other quiescent x-ray transients. we also re-analyse the optical lightcurves of the soft x-ray transient xte j2123-058 taken during its outburst anddecay in 1998. we use a robust method to fit the data using a refined x-raybinary model. the model computes the light arising from a roche-lobe fillingstar and flared accretion disk irradiated by x-rays, and calculates the effectsof shadowing and mutual star/disk eclipses. we obtain relatively accuratevalues for the binary inclination and mass ratio, which when combined withspectroscopic results obtained in paper ii gives a neutron star mass in therange 1.04-1.56mo (68% confidence).

astro-ph;0402075	x-ray behaviour of circinus x-1 - i: x-ray dips as a diagnostic of  periodic behaviour	we examine the periodic nature of detailed structure (particularly dips) inthe rxte/asm lightcurve of circinus x-1. the significant phase wandering of thex-ray maxima suggests their identification with the response on a viscoustimescale of the accretion disk to perturbation. we find that the x-ray dipsprovide a more accurate system clock than the maxima, and thus use these asindicators of the times of periastron passage. we fit a quadratic ephemeris tothese dips, and find its predictive power for the x-ray lightcurve to besuperior to ephemerides based on the radio flares and the full archival x-raylightcurve. under the hypothesis that the dips are tracers of the mass transferrate from the donor, we use their occurrence rate as a function of orbitalphase to explore the (as yet unconstrained) nature of the donor. the high$\dot{p}$ term in the ephemeris provides another piece of evidence that cir x-1is in a state of dynamical evolution, and thus is a very young post-supernovasystem. we further suggest that the radio ``synchrotron nebula'' immediatelysurrounding cir x-1 is in fact the remnant of the event that created thecompact object, and discuss briefly the evidence for and against such aninterpretation.

astro-ph;0402408	the distance and interstellar sight line to gx339-4	the distance to the black hole binary gx339-4 remains a topic of debate. weexamine high-resolution optical spectra of the nad lines resolving the velocitystructure along the line of sight. we find this to be complex, with at leastnine components, mostly blue-shifted, spanning a velocity range of nearly200km/s. the presence of components with a large blue-shift rules out a nearbylocation and requires that the binary be located at or beyond the tangentpoint, implying a lower limit to the distance of ~6kpc. the presence of asignificant red-shifted component at +30km/s is even more intriguing as gx339-4also has a slightly positive systemic velocity, suggesting that the source, andthis cloud, could be on the far side of the galaxy, where the radial velocitiesdue to galactic rotation become positive again. if this is the case, we requirea distance of ~15kpc. this is less secure than the 6kpc lower limit however. wediscuss the implications of these possible distances for the outburst andquiescent luminosities, and the nature of the companion star, and argue that alarge distance is consistent with these characteristics. in particular, itwould explain the non-detection of the companion star during the fainteststates.

astro-ph;0408331	evidence for a black hole in the x-ray transient gs 1354-64 (=bw cir)	we present the first radial velocity curve of the companion star to bw cirwhich demonstrates the presence of a black hole in this x-ray transient whichrecorded outbursts in 1987 and 1997 (and possibly 1971-2). we identify weakabsorption features corresponding to a g0-5iii donor star, strongly veiled by aresidual accretion disc which contributes 61-65 % of the total light at lambda6300. the doppler motions of these features trace an orbit of p=2.54448 days(or its 1-yr alias of p=2.56358 days) and velocity semi-amplitude k2=279 +- 5km/s (or k2=292 +- 5 km/s). both solutions are equally possible. the massfunction implied by the shorter period solution is f(m)= 5.75 +- 0.30 msunwhich, combined with the rotational broadening of the tidally locked companion(v sin i =71 +- 4 km/s), yields a compact object mass of m1 sin3 i = 7.34 +-0.46 msun. this is substantially above the mass of a neutron star under anystandard equation of state of nuclear matter. the companion star is probably ag subgiant which has evolved off the main sequence in order to fill its rochelobe. remarkably, a distance of &gt; 27 kpc is inferred by the companion'sluminosity and this is supported by the large observed systemic velocity (gamma= 103 +- 4 km/s) which requires such a distance in order to be consistent withthe galactic rotation curve.

astro-ph;0509638	a "combination nova" outburst in z andromedae: nuclear shell burning  triggered by a disk instability	we describe observational evidence for a new kind of interacting-binary-staroutburst that involves both an accretion instability and an increase inthermonuclear shell burning on the surface of an accreting white dwarf. werefer to this new type of eruption as a combination nova. in late 2000, theprototypical symbiotic star z andromedae brightened by roughly two magnitudesin the optical. we observed the outburst in the radio with the vla and merlin,in the optical both photometrically and spectroscopically, in the farultraviolet with fuse, and in the x-rays with both chandra and xmm. thetwo-year-long event had three distinct stages. during the first stage, theoptical rise closely resembled an earlier, small outburst that was caused by anaccretion-disk instability. in the second stage, the hot component ejected anoptically thick shell of material. in the third stage, the shell cleared toreveal a white dwarf whose luminosity remained on the order of 10^4 lsun forapproximately one year. the eruption was thus too energetic to have beenpowered by accretion alone. we propose that the initial burst of accretion waslarge enough to trigger enhanced nuclear burning on the surface of the whitedwarf and the ejection of an optically thick shell of material. this outbursttherefore combined elements of both a dwarf nova and a classical nova. ourresults have implications for the long-standing problem of producing shellflashes with short recurrence times on low-mass white dwarfs in symbioticstars.

astro-ph;9807174	soft x-ray transient light curves as standard candles: exponential  versus linear decays	a recent paper by king and ritter (1998: hereafter kr) proposed that thelight curves of soft x-ray transients (sxts) are dominated by the effect ofirradiation of the accretion disc by the central x-rays. this prevents theonset of the cooling wave which would otherwise return the disc to thequiescent state, and so prolongs the outbursts beyond those in dwarf novadiscs. kr show that the decay of the resulting x-ray light curve should beexponential or linear depending on whether or not the observed peak x-rayluminosity is sufficient to ionize the outer edge of the accretion disc. herewe examine the observed x-ray decays, and show that they are exponential orlinear according as the peak luminosity is greater or smaller than the criticalvalue defined by kr, strongly suggesting that the light curves are indeedirradiation--dominated. we show further that the occurrence of an exponentialor linear decay tends to favour the same type of decay in subsequent outbursts,so that systems usually show only one or the other type. we use the equationsof kr and the observed x-ray light curve to determine the size $r_{h}$ of thehot disc at the peak of the outburst. for exponential decays, $r_{h}$ is foundto be comparable to the circularization radius, as expected since the discconsists entirely of material transferred from the secondary since the previousoutburst. further, $r_h$ is directly proportional to the time at which one seesthe secondary maximum ($t_{s}$), as expected if $t_{s}$ is the viscoustimescale of the irradiated disc. this implies that the orders of magnitude ofthe viscosity parameter alpha and disc aspect ratio h/r are such that alpha(h/r)~0.01. observation of a secondary maximum calibrates the peak luminosityand gives an eqaution for the distance to the source.

0812.3032	phase resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond x-ray pulsar  sax j1808.4-3658 during the 2008 outburst	aims: we obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy of the accreting millisecondx-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 during its outburst in 2008 to find a signatureof the donor star, constrain its radial velocity semi-amplitude (k_2), andderive estimates on the pulsar mass. methods: using doppler images of the bowenregion we find a significant (&gt;8sigma) compact spot at a position where thedonor star is expected. if this is a signature of the donor star, we measurek_em=248+/-20 km/s (1sigma confidence) which represents a strict lower limit tok_2. also, the doppler map of he ii lambda4686 shows the characteristicsignature of the accretion disk, and there is a hint of enhanced emission thatmay be a result of tidal distortions in the accretion disk that are expected invery low mass ratio interacting binaries. results: the lower-limit on k_2 leadsto a lower-limit on the mass function of f(m_1)&gt;0.10m_sun. applying the maximumk-correction gives 228&lt;k_2&lt;322 km/s and a mass ratio of 0.051&lt;q&lt;0.072.conclusions: despite the limited s/n of the data we were able to detect asignature of the donor star in sax j1808.4-3658, although future observationsduring a new outburst are still warranted to confirm this. if the derived k_emis correct, the largest uncertainty in the determination of the mass of theneutron star in sax j1808.4-3658 using dynamical studies lies with the poorlyknown inclination.
