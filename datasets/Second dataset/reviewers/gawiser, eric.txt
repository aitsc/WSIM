0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0903.4505	increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in astronomy:  executive summary	promoting racial and ethnic diversity is critically important to the futuresuccess and growth of the field of astronomy. the raw ability, drive andinterest required to excel in the field is distributed without regard to race,gender, or socioeconomic background. by not actively promoting diversity in ourfield we risk losing talented people to other professions (or losing thementirely), which means that there will be astronomical discoveries that simplywon't get made. there is demonstrated evidence that stem fields benefit fromdiverse perspectives on problems that require more complex thought processes.this is especially relevant to a field like astronomy where more and more workis being done collaboratively. the lack of notable growth in african american,hispanic, and native american representation in astronomy indicates that the'pipeline' for these individuals is systemically leaky at critical junctures.substantially more effort must be directed toward improving the educational andcareer development of minorities to insure that these potential colleagues aresupported through the process. however, simply recognizing that the pipeline isfaulty is woefully inadequate. there must be very specific, targeted solutionsto help improve the situation. with this in mind, we offer two position papersaddressing specific areas of improvement that we identify as (a) essential forany foreseeable progress in the field, and (b) attainable in the 2010-2020decade. these position papers focus primarily on african americans, hispanics,and native americans. although we do not directly address issues of asianamericans, pacific islanders, and other groups, many of the recommendationsmade here can be adapted to address issues faced by these groups as well.

1006.5645	clustering and descendants of musyc galaxies at z&lt;1.5	we measure the evolution of galaxy clustering out to a redshift of z~1.5using data from two musyc fields, the extended hubble deep field south (ehdf-s)and the extended chandra deep field south (ecdf-s). we use photometric redshiftinformation to calculate the projected-angular correlation function,omega(sigma), from which we infer the projected correlation function xi(sigma).we demonstrate that this technique delivers accurate measurements of clusteringeven when large redshift measurement errors affect the data. to this aim we usetwo mock musyc fields extracted from a lambdacdm simulation populated withgalform semi-analytic galaxies which allow us to assess the degree of accuracyof our estimates of xi(sigma) and to identify and correct for systematiceffects in our measurements. we study the evolution of clustering for volumelimited subsamples of galaxies selected using their photometric redshifts andrest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes. we find that the real-space correlationlength r_0 of bright galaxies, m_r&lt;-21 (rest-frame) can be accurately recoveredout to z~1.5, particularly for ecdf-s given its near-infrared photometriccoverage. there is mild evidence for a luminosity dependent clustering in bothfields at the low redshift samples (up to &lt;z&gt;=0.57), where the correlationlength is higher for brighter galaxies by up to 1mpc/h between medianrest-frame r-band absolute magnitudes of -18 to -21.5. as a result of thephotometric redshift measurement, each galaxy is assigned a best-fit template;we restrict to e and e+20%sbc types to construct subsamples of early typegalaxies (etgs). our etg samples show a strong increase in r_0 as the redshiftincreases, making it unlikely (95% level) that etgs at median redshiftz_med=1.15 are the direct progenitors of etgs at z_med=0.37 with equivalentpassively evolved luminosities.

1008.3392	how to falsify the gr+lambdacdm model with galaxy redshift surveys	a wide range of models describing modifications to general relativity havebeen proposed, but no fundamental parameter set exists to describe them.similarly, no fundamental theory exists for dark energy to parameterize itspotential deviation from a cosmological constant. this motivates amodel-independent search for deviations from the concordance gr+lambdacdmcosmological model in large galaxy redshift surveys. we describe twomodel-independent tests of the growth of cosmological structure, in the form ofquantities that must equal one if gr+lambdacdm is correct. the first, epsilon,was introduced previously as a scale-independent consistency check between theexpansion history and structure growth. the second, upsilon, is introduced hereas a test of scale-dependence in the linear evolution of matter densityperturbations. we show that the ongoing and near-future galaxy redshift surveyswigglez, boss, and hetdex will constrain these quantities at the 5-10% level,representing a stringent test of concordance cosmology at different redshifts.when redshift space distortions are used to probe the growth of cosmologicalstructure, galaxies at higher redshift with lower bias are found to be mostpowerful in detecting deviations from the gr+lambdacdm model.

1105.3753	candels: the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy  survey	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution, over theapproximate redshift (z) range 8--1.5. it will image &gt;250,000 distant galaxiesusing three separate cameras on the hubble space telescope, from themid-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and will find and measure type iasupernovae at z&gt;1.5 to test their accuracy as standardizable candles forcosmology. five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected, each withextensive ancillary data. the use of five widely separated fields mitigatescosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples ofgalaxies down to a stellar mass of 10^9 m_\odot to z \approx 2, reaching theknee of the ultraviolet luminosity function (uvlf) of galaxies to z \approx 8.the survey covers approximately 800 arcmin^2 and is divided into two parts. thecandels/deep survey (5\sigma\ point-source limit h=27.7 mag) covers \sim 125arcmin^2 within goods-n and goods-s. the candels/wide survey includes goods andthree additional fields (egs, cosmos, and uds) and covers the full area to a5\sigma\ point-source limit of h \gtrsim 27.0 mag. together with the hubbleultra deep fields, the strategy creates a three-tiered "wedding cake" approachthat has proven efficient for extragalactic surveys. data from the survey arenonproprietary and are useful for a wide variety of science investigations. inthis paper, we describe the basic motivations for the survey, the candels teamscience goals and the resulting observational requirements, the field selectionand geometry, and the observing design. the hubble data processing and productsare described in a companion paper.

1105.5642	the evolution of early-type galaxies selected by their spatial  clustering	aims: we present a new method that uses luminosity or stellar mass functionscombined with clustering measurements to select samples of galaxies atdifferent redshifts likely to follow a progenitor-to-descendant relationship.as the method uses clustering information, we refer to galaxy samples selectedthis way as clustering-selected samples. we apply this method to infer thenumber of mergers during the evolution of musyc early-type galaxies (etgs) fromz~1 to the present-day. methods: the method consists in using clusteringinformation to infer the typical dark-matter halo mass of the hosts of theselected progenitor galaxies. using lambdacdm predictions, it is then possibleto follow these haloes to a later time where the sample of descendants will bethat with the clustering of these descendant haloes. results: this techniqueshows that etgs at a given redshift evolve into brighter galaxies at lowerredshifts (considering rest-frame, passively evolved optical luminosities).this indicates that the stellar mass of these galaxies increases with time andthat, in principle, a stellar mass selection at different redshifts does notprovide samples of galaxies in a progenitor-descendant relationship.conclusions: the comparison between high redshift etgs and their likelydescendants at z=0 points to a higher number density for the progenitors by afactor 5.5+-4.0, implying the need for mergers to decrease their number densityby today. because the luminosity densities of progenitors and descendants areconsistent, our results show no need for significant star-formation in etgssince z=1, which indicates that the needed mergers are dry, i.e. gas free.

1106.2811	x-ray constraints on the lyman-alpha escape fraction	we have coadded x-ray flux of all known lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the 4msec chandra deep field south (cdf-s) region, to place sensitive upper limitson the average unobscured star-formation rate (sfr_x) in these galaxies. a verysmall fraction of lyman-alpha galaxies in the field are individually detectedin the x-rays, implying a low fraction of agn activity. after excluding the fewx-ray detected laes, we stack the undetected laes located in the 4 ms cdf-sdata and 250 ks extended cdf-s (ecdfs) data, and compute a 1-\sigma upper limiton sfr_x &lt; 14, 28, 28, 140, 440, 880 m$_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$ for laes located at z= 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.5, 5.7 and 6.5, respectively. the upper limit of sfr_x inlaes can be then be compared to sfr$_{ly\alpha}$ derived from lyman-alpha lineand thus can constrain on the lyman-alpha escape fraction($f^{esc}_{ly\alpha}$). we derive a lower limit on f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 14%(84 % confidence level, 1-\sigma lower limit) for laes at redshift z ~ 2.1 andz ~ 3.1-3.2. at z &gt; 4, the current lae samples are not of sufficient size toconstrain sfr_x well. by averaging all the laes at z&gt; 2, the x-raynon-detection constrains f(lyman-alpha escape) &gt; 17% (84 % confidence level,1-\sigma lower limit), and rejects f(lyman-alpha escape) &lt; 5.7% at the 99.87%confidence level from 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 6.5.

1106.3079	black hole growth in the early universe is self-regulated and largely  hidden from view	the formation of the first massive objects in the infant universe remainsimpossible to observe directly and yet it sets the stage for the subsequentevolution of galaxies. while some black holes with masses &gt; billion solarmasses? have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion yearsafter the big bang, these individual extreme objects have limited utility inconstraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes. the initialconditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growthprocess. from deep, optimally stacked, archival x-ray observations, we measurethe amount of black hole growth in z=6-8 galaxies (0.7-1 billion years afterthe big bang). our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with theirhosts throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. we find thatmost copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significantamounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highestenergy x-rays. this suggests that black holes grow significantly more thanpreviously thought during these early bursts, and due to obscuration they donot contribute to the re-ionization of the universe with their ultravioletemission.

1109.4685	the evolution of ly-alpha emitting galaxies between z = 2.1 and z = 3.1	we describe the results of a new, wide-field survey for z=3.1 ly-alphaemission-line galaxies (laes) in the extended chandra deep field south(ecdf-s). by using a nearly top-hat 5010 angstrom filter and complementarybroadband photometry from the musyc survey, we identify a complete sample of141 objects with monochromatic fluxes brighter than 2.4e-17 ergs/cm^2/s andobservers-frame equivalent widths greater than ~ 80 angstroms (i.e., 20angstroms in the rest-frame of ly-alpha). the bright-end of this dataset isdominated by x-ray sources and foreground objects with galex detections, butwhen these interlopers are removed, we are still left with a sample of 130 laecandidates, 39 of which have spectroscopic confirmations. this sample overlapsthe set of objects found in an earlier ecdf-s survey, but due to our filter'sredder bandpass, it also includes 68 previously uncataloged sources. we confirmearlier measurements of the z=3.1 lae emission-line luminosity function, andshow that an apparent anti-correlation between equivalent width and continuumbrightness is likely due to the effect of correlated errors in ourheteroskedastic dataset. finally, we compare the properties of z=3.1 laes tolaes found at z=2.1. we show that in the ~1 gyr after z~3, the lae luminosityfunction evolved significantly, with l* fading by ~0.4 mag, the number densityof sources with l &gt; 1.5e42 ergs/s declining by ~50%, and the equivalent widthscale-length contracting from 70^{+7}_{-5} angstroms to 50^{+9}_{-6} angstroms.when combined with literature results, our observations demonstrate that overthe redshift range z~0 to z~4, laes contain less than ~10% of thestar-formation rate density of the universe.

0710.2697	ly alpha-emitting galaxies at z=3.1: l* progenitors experiencing rapid  star formation	we studied the clustering properties and multiwavelength spectral energydistributions of a complete sample of 162 ly alpha-emitting (lae) galaxies atz=3.1 discovered in deep narrow-band musyc imaging of the extended chandra deepfield south. laes were selected to have observed frame equivalent widths &gt;80aand emission line fluxes &gt;1.5e-17 erg/cm^2/s. only 1% of our lae sample appearsto host agn. the laes exhibit a moderate spatial correlation length ofr_0=3.6+0.8-1.0 mpc, corresponding to a bias factor b=1.7+0.3-0.4, whichimplies median dark matter halo masses of log10(m_med) = 10.9+0.5-0.9 m_sun.comparing the number density of laes, (1.5+-0.3)e-3/mpc^3, with the numberdensity of these halos finds a mean halo occupation ~1-10%. the evolution ofgalaxy bias with redshift implies that most z=3.1 laes evolve into present-daygalaxies with l&lt;2.5l*, whereas other z&gt;3 galaxy populations typically evolveinto more massive galaxies. halo merger trees show that z=0 descendants occupyhalos with a wide range of masses, with a median descendant mass close to thatof l*. only 30% of laes have sufficient stellar mass (&gt;~3e9 m_sun) to yielddetections in deep spitzer-irac imaging. a two-population sed fit to thestacked ubvrizjk+[3.6,4.5,5.6,8.0]micron fluxes of the irac-undetected objectsfinds that the typical lae has low stellar mass (1.0+0.6-0.4 e9 m_sun),moderate star formation rate (2+-1 m_sun/yr), a young component age of 20+30-10myr, and little dust (a_v&lt;0.2). the best fit model has 20% of the mass in theyoung stellar component, but models without evolved stars are also allowed.

0710.3384	spitzer constraints on the stellar populations of lyman-alpha emitting  galaxies at z = 3.1	we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 162 lyman-alphaemitting galaxies (laes) at z = 3.1 in the extended chandra deep field south,using deep spitzer irac data available from the goods and simple surveys toderive reliable stellar population estimates. we divide the laes according totheir rest-frame near-ir luminosities into irac-detected and irac-undetectedsamples. about 70% of the laes are undetected in 3.6 micron down to [3.6] =25.2 ab. stacking analysis reveals that the average stellar population of theirac-undetected sample has an age of ~ 200 myr and a mass of ~ 3x10^8 solarmasses, consistent with the expectation that laes are mostly young and low-massgalaxies. on the other hand, the irac-detected laes are on averagesignificantly older and more massive, with an average age &gt; 1 gyr and mass ~10^10 solar masses. comparing the irac colors and magnitudes of the laes to z ~3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) shows that the irac-detected laes lie at thefaint blue end of the lbg color-magnitude distribution, suggesting thatirac-detected laes may be the low mass extension of the lbg population. we alsopresent tentative evidence for a small fraction (~ 5%) of obscured agn withinthe lae sample. our results suggest that laes posses a wide range of ages andmasses. additionally, the presence of evolved stellar populations inside laessuggests that the lyman-alpha luminous phase of galaxies may either be along-lasting or recurring phenomenon.

1111.6688	the curious case of lyman alpha emitters: growing younger from z ~ 3 to  z ~ 2?	lyman alpha emitting (lae) galaxies are thought to be progenitors ofpresent-day l* galaxies. clustering analyses have suggested that laes at z ~ 3might evolve into laes at z ~ 2, but it is unclear whether the physical natureof these galaxies is compatible with this hypothesis. several groups haveinvestigated the properties of laes using spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting, but direct comparison of their results is complicated byinconsistencies in the treatment of the data and in the assumptions made inmodeling the stellar populations, which are degenerate with the effects ofgalaxy evolution. by using the same data analysis pipeline and sed fittingsoftware on two stacked samples of laes at z = 3.1 and z = 2.1, and byeliminating several systematic uncertainties that might cause a discrepancy, wedetermine that the physical properties of these two samples of galaxies aredramatically different. laes at z = 3.1 are found to be old (age ~ 1 gyr) andmetal-poor (z &lt; 0.2 z_sun), while laes at z = 2.1 appear to be young (age ~ 50myr) and metal-rich (z &gt; z_sun). the difference in the observed stellar agesmakes it very unlikely that z = 3.1 laes evolve directly into z = 2.1 laes.larger samples of galaxies, studies of individual objects and spectroscopicmeasurements of metallicity at these redshifts are needed to confirm thispicture, which is difficult to reconcile with the effects of 1 gyr ofcosmological evolution.

1201.1012	survey design for spectral energy distribution fitting: a fisher matrix  approach	the spectral energy distribution (sed) of a galaxy contains information onthe galaxy's physical properties, and multi-wavelength observations are neededin order to measure these properties via sed fitting. in planning thesesurveys, optimization of the resources is essential. the fisher matrixformalism can be used to quickly determine the best possible experimental setupto achieve the desired constraints on the sed fitting parameters. however,because it relies on the assumption of a gaussian likelihood function, it is ingeneral less accurate than other slower techniques that reconstruct theprobability distribution function (pdf) from the direct comparison betweenmodels and data. we compare the uncertainties on sed fitting parameterspredicted by the fisher matrix to the ones obtained using the more thorough pdffitting techniques. we use both simulated spectra and real data, and consider alarge variety of target galaxies differing in redshift, mass, age, starformation history, dust content, and wavelength coverage. we find that theuncertainties reported by the two methods agree within a factor of two in thevast majority (~ 90%) of cases. if the age determination is uncertain, thetop-hat prior in age used in pdf fitting to prevent each galaxy from beingolder than the universe needs to be incorporated in the fisher matrix, at leastapproximately, before the two methods can be properly compared. we concludethat the fisher matrix is a useful tool for astronomical survey design.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1308.2598	damped ly{\alpha} absorption systems in semi-analytic models with  multiphase gas	we investigate the properties of damped ly{\alpha} absorption systems (dlas)in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, including partitioning of cold gasin galactic discs into atomic, molecular, and ionized phases with a moleculargas-based star formation recipe. we investigate two approaches for partitioninggas into these constituents: a pressure-based and a metallicity-based recipe.we identify dlas by passing lines of sight through our simulations to computehi column densities. we find that models with "standard" gas radial profiles -where the average specific angular momentum of the gas disc is equal to that ofthe host dark matter halo - fail to reproduce the observed column densitydistribution of dlas. these models also fail to reproduce the distribution ofvelocity widths {\delta}v, overproducing low {\delta}v relative to high{\delta}v systems. models with "extended" radial gas profiles - correspondingto gas discs with higher specific angular momentum - are able to reproducequite well the column density distribution of absorbers over the column densityrange 19 &lt; log nhi &lt; 22.5 in the redshift range 2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5. the model withpressure-based gas partitioning also reproduces the observed line density ofdlas, hi gas density, and {\delta}v distribution at z &lt; 3 remarkably well.however all of the models investigated here underproduce dlas and the hi gasdensity at z &gt; 3. if this is the case, the flatness in the number of dlas andhi gas density over the redshift interval 0 &lt; z &lt; 5 may be due to a cosmiccoincidence where the majority of dlas at z &gt; 3 arise from intergalactic gas infilaments while those at z &lt; 3 arise predominantly in galactic discs. wefurther investigate the dependence of dla metallicity on redshift and{\delta}v, and find reasonably good agreement with the observations,particularly when including the effects of metallicity gradients (abbrv.).

1308.4405	candels multi-wavelength catalogs: source detection and photometry in  the goods-south field	we present a uv-to-mid infrared multi-wavelength catalog in thecandels/goods-s field, combining the newly obtained candels hst/wfc3 f105w,f125w, and f160w data with existing public data. the catalog is based on sourcedetection in the wfc3 f160w band. the f160w mosaic includes the data fromcandels deep and wide observations as well as previous ers and hudf09 programs.the mosaic reaches a 5$\sigma$ limiting depth (within an aperture of radius0.17 arcsec) of 27.4, 28.2, and 29.7 ab for candels wide, deep, and hudfregions, respectively. the catalog contains 34930 sources with therepresentative 50% completeness reaching 25.9, 26.6, and 28.1 ab in the f160wband for the three regions. in addition to wfc3 bands, the catalog alsoincludes data from uv (u-band from both ctio/mosaic and vlt/vimos), optical(hst/acs f435w, f606w, f775w, f814w, and f850lp), and infrared (hst/wfc3 f098m,vlt/isaac ks, vlt/hawk-i ks, and spitzer/irac 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0 $\mu$m)observations. the catalog is validated via stellar colors, comparison withother published catalogs, zeropoint offsets determined from the best-fittemplates of the spectral energy distribution of spectroscopically observedobjects, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts. the catalog is able todetect unreddened star-forming (passive) galaxies with stellar mass of10^{10}m_\odot at a 50% completeness level to z$\sim$3.4 (2.8), 4.6 (3.2), and7.0 (4.2) in the three regions. as an example of application, the catalog isused to select both star-forming and passive galaxies at z$\sim$2--4 via thebalmer break. it is also used to study the color--magnitude diagram of galaxiesat 0&lt;z&lt;4.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1309.6341	to stack or not to stack: spectral energy distribution properties of  lya-emitting galaxies at z=2.1	we use the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels) goods-s multi-wavelength catalog to identify counterparts for 20 lyaemitting (lae) galaxies at z=2.1. we build several types of stacked spectralenergy distributions (seds) of these objects. we combine photometry to formaverage and median flux-stacked seds, and postage stamp images to form averageand median image-stacked seds. we also introduce scaled flux stacks thateliminate the influence of variation in overall brightness. we use the sedfitting code speedymc to constrain the physical properties of individualobjects and stacks. our laes at z = 2.1 have stellar masses ranging from 2x10^7msun - 8x10^9 msun (median = 3x10^8 msun), ages ranging from 4 myr to 500 myr(median =100 myr), and e(b-v) between 0.02 and 0.24 (median = 0.12). we do notobserve strong correlations between lya equivalent width (ew) and stellar mass,age, or e(b-v). the lya radiative transfer (q) factors of our sample arepredominantly close to one and do not correlate strongly with ew or e(b-v),implying that lya radiative transfer prevents lya photons from resonantlyscattering in dusty regions. the sed parameters of the flux stacks match theaverage and median values of the individual objects, with the flux-scaledmedian sed performing best with reduced uncertainties. median image-stackedseds provide a poor representation of the median individual object, and none ofthe stacking methods captures the large dispersion of lae properties.

1403.4935	spectral energy distribution fitting of hetdex pilot survey lyman-alpha  emitters in cosmos and goods-n	we use broadband photometry extending from the rest-frame uv to the near-irto fit the individual spectral energy distributions (seds) of 63 bright(l(ly-alpha) &gt; 10^43 ergs/s) ly-alpha emitting galaxies (laes) in the redshiftrange 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.6. we find that these laes are quite heterogeneous, withstellar masses that span over three orders of magnitude, from 7.5 &lt; log m &lt;10.5. moreover, although most laes have small amounts of extinction, somehigh-mass objects have stellar reddenings as large as e(b-v) ~0.4.interestingly, in dusty objects the optical depths for ly-alpha and the uvcontinuum are always similar, indicating that ly-alpha photons are notundergoing many scatters before escaping their galaxy. in contrast, the ratioof optical depths in low-reddening systems can vary widely, illustrating thediverse nature of the systems. finally, we show that in the star formation rate(sfr)-log mass diagram, our laes fall above the "main-sequence" defined by z ~3 continuum selected star-forming galaxies. in this respect, they are similarto sub-mm-selected galaxies, although most laes have much lower mass.

1403.7463	the wavelength dependence of high-redshift galaxy structure in the  rest-frame ultraviolet	we present the rest-frame uv wavelength dependence of the petrosian-likehalf-light radius ($r_{50}$), and the concentration parameter for a sample of198 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. we find a ~5% decrease in $r_{50}$from 1500 \aa\ to 3000 \aa, with half-light radii at 3000 \aa\ ranging from 0.6kpc to 6 kpc. we also find a decrease in concentration of ~0.07 (1.9 &lt;$c_{3000}$ &lt; 3.9). the lack of a strong relationship between $r_{50}$ andwavelength is consistent with a model in which clumpy star formation isdistributed over length scales comparable to the galaxy's rest-frame opticallight. while the wavelength dependence of $r_{50}$ is independent of size atall redshifts, concentration decreases more sharply in the far-uv (~1500 \aa)for large galaxies at z ~ 1. this decrease in concentration is caused by aflattening of the inner ~20% of the light profile in disk-like galaxies,indicating that the central regions have different uv colors than the rest ofthe galaxy. we interpret this as a bulge component with older stellarpopulations and/or more dust. the size-dependent decrease in concentration isless dramatic at z ~ 2, suggesting that bulges are less dusty, younger, and/orless massive than the rest of the galaxy at higher redshifts.

0803.0763	the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc): wide k-band imaging,  photometric catalogs, clustering and physical properties of galaxies at z~2	we present k-band imaging of two ~30'x30' fields covered by the musyc widenir survey. the 1030 and 1255 fields were imaged with ispi on the 4m blancotelescope at ctio to a 5 sigma point-source limiting depth of k~20 (vega).combining this data with the musyc optical ubvriz imaging, we createdmulti-band k-selected source catalogs for both fields. these catalogs, togetherwith the musyc k-band catalog of the ecdf-s field, were used to select k&lt;20 bzkgalaxies over an area of 0.71 deg^2. this is the largest area ever surveyed forbzk galaxies. we present number counts, redshift distributions and stellarmasses for our sample of 3261 bzk galaxies (2502 star-forming (sbzk) and 759passively evolving (pbzk)), as well as reddening and star formation rateestimates for the star-forming bzk systems. we also present 2-point angularcorrelation functions and spatial correlation lengths for both sbzk and pbzkgalaxies and show that previous estimates of the correlation function of thesegalaxies were affected by cosmic variance due to the small areas surveyed. wehave measured correlation lengths r_0 of 8.89+/-2.03 mpc and 10.82+/-1.72 mpcfor sbzk and pbzk galaxies respectively. this is the first reported measurementof the spatial correlation function of passive bzk galaxies. in the lambdacdmscenario of galaxy formation, these correlation lengths at z~2 translate intominimum masses of ~4x10^{12} m_sun and ~9x10^{12} m_sun for the dark matter(dm) halos hosting sbzk and pbzk galaxies respectively. the clusteringproperties of the galaxies in our sample are consistent with them being thedescendants of bright lbg at z~3, and the progenitors of present-day &gt;1l*galaxies.

1406.4503	the hetdex pilot survey v: the physical origin of lyman-alpha emitters  probed by near-infrared spectroscopy	we present the results from a vlt/sinfoni and keck/nirspec near-infraredspectroscopic survey of 16 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at $z$ = 2.1 - 2.5 inthe cosmos and goods-n fields discovered from the hetdex pilot survey. wedetect rest-frame optical nebular lines (h$\alpha$ and/or [oiii]$\lambda$5007)for 10 of the laes and measure physical properties, including the starformation rate (sfr), gas-phase metallicity, gas-mass fraction, and ly$\alpha$velocity offset. we find that laes may lie below the mass-metallicity relationfor continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift. the laes allshow velocity shifts of ly$\alpha$ relative to the systemic redshift rangingbetween +85 and +296 km s$^{-1}$ with a mean of +180 km s$^{-1}$. this value issmaller than measured for continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at similarredshifts. the ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets show a moderate correlation with themeasured star formation rate (2.5$\sigma$), but no significant correlations areseen with the sfr surface density, specific sfr, stellar mass, or dynamicalmass ($\lesssim$ 1.5$\sigma$). exploring the role of dust, kinematics of theinterstellar medium (ism), and geometry on the escape of ly$\alpha$ photons, wefind no signature of selective quenching of resonantly scattered ly$\alpha$photons. however, we also find no evidence that a clumpy ism is enhancing thely$\alpha$ equivalent width. our results suggest that the low metallicity inlaes may be responsible for yielding an environment with a low neutral hydrogencolumn density as well as less dust, easing the escape of ly$\alpha$ photonsover that in continuum-selected star-forming galaxies.

1410.2873	properties of submillimeter galaxies in a semi-analytic model using the  "count matching" approach: application to the ecdf-s	we present a new technique for modeling submillimeter galaxies (smgs): the"count matching" approach. using lightcones drawn from a semi-analytic model ofgalaxy formation, we choose physical galaxy properties given by the model asproxies for their submillimeter luminosities, assuming a monotonicrelationship. as recent interferometric observations of the extended chandradeep field south show that the brightest sources detected by single-dishtelescopes are comprised by emission from multiple fainter sources, we assignthe submillimeter fluxes so that the combined laboca plus bright-end almaobserved number counts for this field are reproduced. after turning the modelcatalogs given by the proxies into submillimeter maps, we perform a sourceextraction to include the effects of the observational process on the recoveredcounts and galaxy properties. we find that for all proxies, there are lines ofsight giving counts consistent with those derived from laboca observations,even for input sources with randomized positions in the simulated map.comparing the recovered redshift, stellar mass and host halo mass distributionsfor model smgs with observational data, we find that the best among theproposed proxies is that in which the submillimeter luminosity increasesmonotonically with the product between dust mass and sfr. this proxy naturallyreproduces a positive trend between sfr and bolometric ir luminosity. themajority of components of blended sources are spatially unassociated.

1502.07757	simultaneous estimation of photometric redshifts and sed parameters:  improved techniques and a realistic error budget	we seek to improve the accuracy of joint galaxy photometric redshiftestimation and spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting. by simulatingdifferent sources of uncorrected systematic errors, we demonstrate that if theuncertainties on the photometric redshifts are estimated correctly, so arethose on the other sed fitting parameters, such as stellar mass, stellar age,and dust reddening. furthermore, we find that if the redshift uncertainties areover(under)-estimated, the uncertainties in sed parameters tend to beover(under)-estimated by similar amounts. these results hold even in thepresence of severe systematics and provide, for the first time, a mechanism tovalidate the uncertainties on these parameters via comparison withspectroscopic redshifts. we propose a new technique (annealing) to re-calibratethe joint uncertainties in the photo-z and sed fitting parameters withoutcompromising the performance of the sed fitting + photo-z estimation. thisprocedure provides a consistent estimation of the multidimensional probabilitydistribution function in sed fitting + z parameter space, including allcorrelations. while the performance of joint sed fitting and photo-z estimationmight be hindered by template incompleteness, we demonstrate that the latter is"flagged" by a large fraction of outliers in redshift, and that significantimprovements can be achieved by using flexible stellar populations synthesismodels and more realistic star formation histories. in all cases, we find thatthe median stellar age is better recovered than the time elapsed from the onsetof star formation [abridged].

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

astro-ph;0103387	first investigation of the clustering environment of damped lyman alpha  absorbers at z=4	we report the first observations of the clustering environment of dampedlyman alpha absorption systems at z=4. color selection and photometricredshifts were used to select 44 candidate lyman-break galaxies brighter thani_ab=25.5 from deep bri images of the 35 sq. arcmin field containing the quasarbr 0951-04. multislit spectroscopy of 35 candidate galaxies was performed and 8of these candidates have been confirmed as z&gt;3.5 lyman-break galaxies. withonly bri photometry, the photometric redshifts are quite accurate for thespectroscopically confirmed galaxies but have a high rate of misclassificationdue to color degeneracies between lyman-break galaxies and low-redshiftellipticals. both of the z&gt;3.5 galaxies found within 15'' of the quasarline-of-sight appear to be causing absorption systems in the quasar spectrum.we use a battery of statistical tests to look for clustering in the redshifthistogram of the z&gt;3.5 galaxies but do not find measurable clustering of theselyman-break galaxies with the damped lyman alpha absorbers. with a largersample of galaxies, our method should determine the cross-correlation betweenthese objects, which probes the bias and hence the mass of the damped lymanalpha absorbers.

astro-ph;0304040	cii* absorption in damped lyman alpha systems: (i) star formation rates  in a two-phase medium	we describe a technique that for the first time measures star formation rates(sfrs) in damped lyman alpha systems(dlas) directly. we assume that massivestars form in dlas, and that the fuv radiation they emit heats the gas by thegrain photoelectric mechanism. we infer the heating rate from the cooling ratemeasured by the strength of cii* 1335.7 absorption. since the heating rate isproportional to the dust-to-gas ratio and the sfr per unit area, we deduce thesfr per unit area for dlas in which both quantities have been measured. weconsider models in which the the dust comprises carbonaceous or silicategrains. we present two-phase models where the cold neutral medium (cnm) andwarm neutral medium (wnm) are in pressuer equilibrium. in the cnm model the thesightline goes throught the cnm and wnm, while in the wnm model it goes onlythrough the wnm. since the grain photoelectric heating efficiency is at least10 times higher in the cnm than in the wnm, cii* absorption mainly arises inthe cnm in the cnm model. but in the wnm model all of the cii* absorptionarises in the wnm. we use cii* absorption lines to derive the sfr per unit areafor a sample of ~ 30 dlas in which the dust-to-gas ratio has been inferred fromelement depletion patterns. we show that the resulting sfr per unit areacorresponds to an average over the star forming volume of galaxy hosting thedla rather than to local star formation along the line of sight. we find theaverage sfr per unit area and equals10$^{-2.2}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$for the cnm model and 10$^{-1.3}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for the wnmmodel. the sfr per unit area in the cnm solution is similar to that measured inthe milky way ism.

astro-ph;0304042	cii* absorption in damped lyman alpha systems: (ii) a new window on the  star formation history of the universe	starting from the sfr per unit physical area, determined for dlas using the cii* method, we obtain the sfr per unit comoving volume at $z$ $\approx$ 3, andfind that it agrees with that for the lyman break galaxies (lbgs). though themass of produced stars indicated by the sfrs is consistent with the currentdensities of known stellar populations, the mass of metals produced by $z$=2.5is 30 times larger than detected in absorption in dlas. the most likelysolutions to this ``missing metals'' problem is that star formation occurs incompact bulge regions. we search for evidence of feedback and find nocorrelations between the sfr per unit area and n(h i), but possiblecorrelations between sfr per unit area and low-ion velocity width and sfr perunit area and metal abundance. we show that (a) the correlation between coolingrate and dust-to-gas ratio is positive evidence for grain photoelectricheating, (b) the cmb does not significantly populate the c ii excitedfine-structure states, and (c) the ratio of cii* to resonance-line opticaldepths is a sensitive probe of the multi-phase structure of the dla gas. weaddress recent arguments that dlas are comprised only of wnm gas, and show themto be inconclusive. despite the rough agreement between sfr per unit comovingvolume for dlas and lbgs, current evidence indicates these are distinctpopulations.

astro-ph;0305314	the age-metallicity relation of the universe in neutral gas: the first  100 damped lya systems	we present accurate metallicity measurements for 121 damped lya systems at0.5&lt;z&lt;5 including ~50 new measurements from our recently published echellettespectrograph and imager surveys. this dataset is analysed to determine theage-metallicity relation of neutral gas in the universe. contrary to previousdatasets this sample shows statistically significant evolution in the meanmetallicity. the best linear fit rate to metallicity vs. redshift is -0.26 +/-0.07 dex corresponding to approximately a factor of 2 every gyr at z=3. the dlacontinue to maintain a floor in metallicity of ~1/700 solar independent ofobservational effects. this metallicity threshold limits the prevalence ofprimordial gas in high redshift galaxies and stresses the correspondencebetween damped systems and star formation (i.e. galaxy formation). this flooris significantly offset from the metallicity of the lya forest and therefore weconsider it to be more related to active star formation within these galaxiesthan scenarios of enrichment in the very early universe. finally, we comment onan apparent 'missing metals problem': the mean metallicity of the dampedsystems is ~10x lower than the value expected from their observed starformation history. this problem is evident in current theoretical treatments ofchemical evolution and galaxy formation; it may indicate a serious flaw in ourunderstanding of the interplay between star formation and metal production.

astro-ph;0407517	on the nature of the heat source for damped lya systems	we investigate the heat source of the neutral gas comprising dlas. unlike thelya forest, where the extragalactic background radiation field ionizes andheats the gas, we find that grain photoelectric heating by the fuv backgroundis not sufficient to balance the c ii 158um cooling rate inferred from dlas. inthese systems, a local energy source is required. we show that in the case ofthe z=1.919 dla toward q2206-19, the local source is fuv emission from theassociated galaxy found by moller et al (2002): the mean intensity inferredfrom photometry is in good agreement with the intensity jnu required to explainthe cooling rate. the fuv mean intensity predicted for a cold neutral medium(cnm) model, jnu=(1.7+2.7-1.0)x10^(-18) cgs (95% c.l.), is the largest expectedfrom our cii* study of 45 dlas. this may explain why this is the only confirmeddla yet detected in emission at z&gt;1.9. we argue that in most dlas with detectedcii* absorption, jnu is between 10^{-19} and 10^{-18} and heats the gas whichis a cnm. by contrast, in most dlas with upper limits on cii* absorption thegas is a warm neutral medium (wnm). surprisingly, the upper limits arecompatible with the same range of jnu values suggesting the majority of dlasare heated by radiation fields generated by a limited range of star formationrates per unit h i area, between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2} msol/kpc^2. we also showthat cii* absorption is unlikely to arise in gas that is ionized.

astro-ph;0603063	direct measurements of the stellar continua and balmer/4000 angstrom  breaks of red z&gt;2 galaxies: redshifts and improved constraints on stellar  populations	we use near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy obtained with gnirs on gemini,nirspec on keck, and isaac on the vlt to study the rest-frame optical continuaof three `distant red galaxies' (having js - ks &gt; 2.3) at z&gt;2. all three galaxyspectra show the balmer/4000 angstrom break in the rest-frame optical. thespectra allow us to determine spectroscopic redshifts from the continuum withan estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. these redshifts agree well withthe emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with halpha emission. thistechnique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in therest-frame uv, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selectedin optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. furthermore, weuse the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of halpha together withevolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. inclusionof the nir spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range ofpossible solutions for stellar population properties. we find that the stellarpopulations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dustystarburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxywith a strong break and no detected line emission. the dusty starburst galaxyhas an age of 0.3 gyr and a stellar mass of 1*10^11 msun. the spectra of thetwo most evolved galaxies imply ages of 1.3-1.4 gyr and stellar masses of4*10^11 msun. the large range of properties seen in these galaxies strengthensour previous much more uncertain results from broadband photometry. largersamples are required to determine the relative frequency of dusty starburstsand (nearly) passively evolving galaxies at z~2.5.

astro-ph;0604334	the ucsd radio-selected quasar survey for damped lyman alpha system	as large optical quasar surveys for damped lya become a reality and the studyof star forming gas in the early universe achieves statistical robustness, itis now vital to identify and quantify the sources of systematic error. becausethe nature of optically-selected quasar surveys makes them vulnerable to dustobscuration, we have undertaken a radio-selected quasar survey for damped lyasystems to address this bias. we present the definition and results of thissurvey. we then combine our sample with the corals dataset to investigate thehi column density distribution function f(n) of damped lya systems towardradio-selected quasars. we find that f(n) is well fit by a power-law f(n) = k_1n^alpha_1, with log k_1 = 22.90 and alpha_1 = -2.18. this power-law is inexcellent agreement with that of optically-selected samples at low n(hi), animportant yet expected result given that obscuration should have negligibleeffect at these gas columns. however, because of the relatively small size ofthe radio-selected sample, 26 damped lya systems in 119 quasars, f(n) is notwell constrained at large n(hi) and the first moment of the hi distributionfunction, omega_g, is, strictly speaking, a lower limit. the power-law is steepenough, however, that extrapolating it to higher column densities implies onlya modest, logarithmic increase in omega_g. the radio-selected value of omega_g= 1.15 x 10^-3, agrees well with the results of optically-selected surveys.while our results indicate that dust obscuration is likely not a major issuefor surveys of damped lya systems, we estimate that a radio-selected sample ofapproximately 100 damped lya systems will be required to obtain the precisionnecessary to absolutely confirm an absence of dust bias.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.

astro-ph;9906156	constraining primordial non-gaussianity with the abundance of high  redshift clusters	we show how observations of the evolution of the galaxy cluster numberabundance can be used to constrain primordial non-gaussianity in the universe.we carry out a maximum likelihood analysis incorporating a number of currentdatasets and accounting for a wide range of sources of systematic error. underthe assumption of gaussianity, the current data prefer a universe with matterdensity $\omega_m\simeq 0.3$ and are inconsistent with $\omega_m=1$ at the$2\sigma$ level. if we assume $\omega_m=1$, the predicted degree of clusterevolution is consistent with the data for non-gaussian models where theprimordial fluctuations have at least two times as many peaks of height$3\sigma$ or more as a gaussian distribution does. these results are robust toalmost all sources of systematic error considered: in particular, the$\omega_m=1$ gaussian case can only be reconciled with the data if a number ofsystematic effects conspire to modify the analysis in the right direction.given an independent measurement of $\omega_m$, the techniques described hererepresent a powerful tool with which to constrain non-gaussianity in theprimordial universe, independent of specific details of the non-gaussianphysics. we discuss the prospects and strategies for improving the constraintswith future observations.

0810.3459	the rise of massive red galaxies: the color-magnitude and color-stellar  mass diagrams for z &lt; ~2 from the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile  (musyc)	we present the color-magnitude and color-stellar mass diagrams for galaxieswith z_phot &lt; ~2, based on a k &lt; 22 (ab) catalog of the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs) from the multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc). ourmain sample of 7840 galaxies contains 1297 m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies in therange 0.2 &lt; z_phot &lt; 1.8. we show empirically that this catalog isapproximately complete for m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies for z_phot &lt; 1.8. forthis mass-limited sample, we show that the locus of the red sequencecolor-stellar mass relation evolves as del(u-r) ~ (-0.44+/-0.02) z_phot forz_phot &lt; ~1.2. for z_phot &gt; ~1.3, however, we are no longer able to reliablydistinguish red and blue subpopulations from the observed color distribution;we show that this would require much deeper near infrared data. at 1.5 &lt; z_phot&lt;1.8, the comoving number density of m_* &gt; 10^11 m_sol galaxies is ~50% of thelocal value, with a red fraction of ~33%. making a parametric fit to theobserved evolution, we find n_tot(z) ~ (1+z_phot)^(-0.52+/-0.12(+/-0.20)). wefind stronger evolution in the red fraction: f_red(z) ~(1+z_phot)^(-1.17+/-0.18(+/-0.21)). through a series of sensitivity analyses,we show that the most important sources of systematic error are: 1. systematicdifferences in the analysis of the z~0 and z&gt;&gt;0 samples; 2. systematic effectsassociated with details of the photometric redshift calculation; and 3.uncertainties in the photometric calibration. with this in mind, we show thatour results based on photometric redshifts are consistent with a completelyindependent analysis which does not require redshift information for individualgalaxies. our results suggest that, at most, 1/5 of local red sequence galaxieswith m_* &gt;10^11 m_sol were already in place at z ~ 2.
