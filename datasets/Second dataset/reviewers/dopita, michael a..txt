1001.0815	supernova remnants and the interstellar medium of m83: imaging &amp;  photometry with wfc3 on hst	we present wide field camera 3 images taken with the hubble space telescopewithin a single field in the southern grand design star-forming galaxy m83.based on their size, morphology and photometry in continuum-subtractedh$\alpha$, [\sii], h$\beta$, [\oiii] and [\oii] filters, we have identified 60supernova remnant candidates, as well as a handful of young ejecta-dominatedcandidates. a catalog of these remnants, their sizes and, where possible theirh$\alpha$ fluxes are given. radiative ages and pre-shock densities are derivedfrom those snr which have good photometry. the ages lie in the range $2.62 &lt;log(\tau_{\rm rad}/{\rm yr}) &lt; 5.0$, and the pre-shock densities at the blastwave range over $0.56 &lt; n_0/{\rm cm^{-3}} &lt; 1680$. two populations of snr havebeen discovered. these divide into a nuclear and spiral arm group and aninter-arm population. we infer an arm to inter-arm density contrast of 4. thesurface flux in diffuse x-rays is correlated with the inferred pre-shockdensity, indicating that the warm interstellar medium is pressurised by the hotx-ray plasma. we also find that the interstellar medium in the nuclear regionof m83 is characterized by a very high porosity and pressure and infer a snrrate of one per 70-150 yr for the nuclear ($r&lt;300 $pc) region. on the basis ofthe number of snr detected and their radiative ages, we infer that the lowermass of type ii sne in m83 is $m_{\rm min} = 16^{+7}_ {-5}$ m$_{\odot}$.finally we give evidence for the likely detection of the remnant of thehistorical supernova, sn1968l.

1007.5237	the luminosity, mass, and age distributions of compact star clusters in  m83 based on hst/wfc3 observations	the newly installed wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on the hubble space telescopehas been used to obtain multi-band images of the nearby spiral galaxy m83.these new observations are the deepest and highest resolution images ever takenof a grand-design spiral, particularly in the near ultraviolet, and allow us tobetter differentiate compact star clusters from individual stars and to measurethe luminosities of even faint clusters in the u band. we find that theluminosity function for clusters outside of the very crowded starburst nucleuscan be approximated by a power law, dn/dl \propto l^{alpha}, with alpha = -2.04+/- 0.08, down to m_v ~ -5.5. we test the sensitivity of the luminosityfunction to different selection techniques, filters, binning, and aperturecorrection determinations, and find that none of these contribute significantlyto uncertainties in alpha. we estimate ages and masses for the clusters bycomparing their measured ubvi,halpha colors with predictions from singlestellar population models. the age distribution of the clusters can beapproximated by a power-law, dn/dt propto t^{gamma}, with gamma=-0.9 +/- 0.2,for m &gt; few x 10^3 msun and t &lt; 4x10^8 yr. this indicates that clusters aredisrupted quickly, with ~80-90% disrupted each decade in age over this time.the mass function of clusters over the same m-t range is a power law, dn/dmpropto m^{beta}, with beta=-1.94 +/- 0.16, and does not have bends or showcurvature at either high or low masses. therefore, we do not find evidence fora physical upper mass limit, m_c, or for the earlier disruption of lower massclusters when compared with higher mass clusters, i.e. mass-dependentdisruption. we briefly discuss these implications for the formation anddisruption of the clusters.

1008.0634	hubble space telescope imaging of lyman alpha emission at z=4.4	we present the highest redshift detections of resolved lyman alpha emission,using hubble space telescope/acs f658n narrowband-imaging data taken inparallel with the wide field camera 3 early release science program in thegoods cdf-s. we detect lyman alpha emission from three spectroscopicallyconfirmed z = 4.4 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes), more than doubling thesample of laes with resolved lyman alpha emission. comparing the lightdistribution between the rest-frame ultraviolet continuum and narrowbandimages, we investigate the escape of lyman alpha photons at high redshift.while our data do not support a positional offset between the lyman alpha andrest-frame ultraviolet (uv) continuum emission, the half-light radii in two outof the three galaxies are significantly larger in lyman alpha than in therest-frame uv continuum. this result is confirmed when comparing object sizesin a stack of all objects in both bands. additionally, the narrowband fluxdetected with hst is significantly less than observed in similar filters fromthe ground. these results together imply that the lyman alpha emission is notstrictly confined to its indigenous star-forming regions. rather, the lymanalpha emission is more extended, with the missing hst flux likely existing in adiffuse outer halo. this suggests that the radiative transfer of lyman alphaphotons in high-redshift laes is complicated, with the interstellar-mediumgeometry and/or outflows playing a significant role in galaxies at theseredshifts.

1011.2942	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies. v. the dust and  pah emission seds of disk galaxies	we present a self-consistent model of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of spiral galaxies from the ultraviolet (uv) to the mid-infrared(mir)/far-infrared (fir)/submillimeter (submm) based on a full radiativetransfer calculation of the propagation of starlight in galaxy disks. thismodel predicts not only the total integrated energy absorbed in the uv/opticaland re-emitted in the infrared/submm, but also the colours of the dust emissionbased on an explicit calculation of the strength and colour of the uv/opticalradiation fields heating the dust, and incorporating a full calculation of thestochastic heating of small dust grains and pah molecules.  the geometry of the translucent components of the model is empiricallyconstrained using the results from the radiation transfer analysis of xilouriset al. on spirals in the middle range of the hubble sequence, while thegeometry of the optically thick components is constrained from physicalconsiderations with a posteriori checks of the model predictions withobservational data.  these geometrical constraints enable the dust emission to be predicted interms of a minimum set of free parameters: the central face-on dust opacity inthe b-band tau^f_b, a clumpiness factor f for the star-forming regions, thestar-formation rate sfr, the normalised luminosity of the old stellarpopulation old and the bulge-to-disk ratio b/d. we show that these parametersare almost orthogonal in their predicted effect on the colours of the dust/pahemission.  the results of the calculations are made available in the form of a largelibrary of simulated dust emission seds spanning the whole parameter space ofour model, together with the corresponding library of dust attenuationcalculated using the same model.

1011.5504	anatomy of a post-starburst minor merger: a multi-wavelength wfc3 study  of ngc 4150	(abridged) we present a spatially-resolved near-uv/optical study of ngc 4150,using the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board the hubble space telescope.previous studies of this early-type galaxy (etg) indicate that it has a largereservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likelyindication of recent merging) and strong, central h_b absorption (indicative ofyoung stars). the core of ngc 4150 shows ubiquitous near-uv emission andremarkable dusty substructure. our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in thenear-uv green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow rangeof near-uv/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby e+a(post-starburst) galaxies. we parametrise the properties of the recent starformation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in thengc 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-uv/optical photometry to stellarmodels. the typical age of the recent star formation (rsf) is around 0.9 gyrs,consistent with the similarity of the near-uv colours to post-starburstsystems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports theproposed merger scenario. the rsf metallicity, representative of themetallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 zsun.assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly fromthe infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phasemetallicity (gpm) of the accreted satellite. comparison to the local mass-gpmrelation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around3x10^8 msun, making ngc 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. a summation of the pixel rsfmass fractions indicates that the rsf contributes about 2-3 percent of thestellar mass. this work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play asignificant role in the evolution of etgs at late epochs.

1012.2174	modeling ir spectral energy distributions: a pilot study of starburst  parameters and silicate absorption curves for some goals galaxies	this paper describes a pilot study into the spectral energy distribution(sed) fitting and the derivation of physical parameters for 19 galaxiesobserved as part of the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) surveyas observed with the \emph{spitzer space telescope}. for this we have used thepan-spectral fitting tools developed in a series of papers by dopita and hisco-workers. we show that the standard lee and draine `astronomical silicate'model cannot provide a good fit to the silicate absorption features as observedin the heavily dust-extinguished ($a_{\rm v} \sim 50$mag.) starbursts. we havederived an empirical fit to the `starburst silicate' absorption in theseobjects. this absorption curve is consistent with the silicate grains beingsystematically larger in starburst environments than in the local galacticinterstellar medium. we demonstrate the sensitivity of the sed fitting to eachof the fitted parameters, and derive these parameters for those galaxies whichdo not have an embedded agn. this technique is simple and provides reasonablyrobust and uniform parameters for the starburst, especially as far as the starformation rate, population of old stars, compactness of the starburst regionand total foreground extinction are concerned. however, the chemical abundancesand the optical extinction cannot be reliably determined by this analysis, andoptical seds will also be required to provide a complete characterization ofthe starburst region and of the surrounding galaxy.

1101.4521	detection of brown dwarf-like objects in the core of ngc3603	we use near-infrared data obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on thehubble space telescope to identify objects having the colors of brown dwarfs(bds) in the field of the massive galactic cluster ngc 3603. these areidentified through use of a combination of narrow and medium band filtersspanning the j and h bands, and which are particularly sensitive to thepresence of the 1.3-1.5{\mu}m h2o molecular band - unique to bds. we provide acalibration of the relationship between effective temperature and color forboth field stars and for bds. this photometric method provides effectivetemperatures for bds to an accuracy of {\pm}350k relative to spectroscopictechniques. this accuracy is shown to be not significantly affected by eitherstellar surface gravity or uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. weidentify nine objects having effective temperature between 1700 and 2200 k,typical of bds, observed j-band magnitudes in the range 19.5-21.5, and that arestrongly clustered towards the luminous core of ngc 3603. however, if these arelocated at the distance of the cluster, they are far too luminous to be normalbds. we argue that it is unlikely that these objects are either artifacts ofour dataset, normal field bds/m-type giants or extra-galactic contaminants and,therefore, might represent a new class of stars having the effectivetemperatures of bds but with luminosities of more massive stars. we explore theinteresting scenario in which these objects would be normal stars that haverecently tidally ingested a hot jupiter, the remnants of which are providing ashort-lived extended photosphere to the central star. in this case, we wouldexpect them to show the signature of fast rotation.

1102.2444	large-scale shock-ionized and photo-ionized gas in m83: the impact of  star formation	we investigate the ionization structure of the nebular gas in m83 using theline diagnostic diagram, [o iii](5007 \dega)/h{\beta} vs. [s ii](6716 \dega+6731 \deg a)/h{\alpha} with the newly available narrowband images from thewide field camera 3 (wfc3) of the hubble space telescope (hst). we produce thediagnostic diagram on a pixel-by-pixel (0.2" x 0.2") basis and compare it withseveral photo- and shock-ionization models. for the photo-ionized gas, weobserve a gradual increase of the log([o iii]/h{\beta}) ratios from the centerto the spiral arm, consistent with the metallicity gradient, as the h iiregions go from super solar abundance to roughly solar abundance from thecenter out. using the diagnostic diagram, we separate the photo-ionized fromthe shock-ionized component of the gas. we find that the shock-ionizedh{\alpha} emission ranges from ~2% to about 15-33% of the total, depending onthe separation criteria used. an interesting feature in the diagnostic diagramis an horizontal distribution around log([o iii]/h{\beta}) ~ 0. this feature iswell fit by a shock-ionization model with 2.0 z\odot metallicity and shockvelocities in the range of 250 km/s to 350 km/s. a low velocity shockcomponent, &lt; 200 km/s, is also detected, and is spatially located at theboundary between the outer ring and the spiral arm. the low velocity shockcomponent can be due to : 1) supernova remnants located nearby, 2) dynamicalinteraction between the outer ring and the spiral arm, 3) abnormal line ratiosfrom extreme local dust extinction. the current data do not enable us todistinguish among those three possible interpretations. our main conclusion isthat, even at the hst resolution, the shocked gas represents a small fractionof the total ionized gas emission at less than 33% of the total. however, itaccounts for virtually all of the mechanical energy produced by the centralstarburst in m83.

1103.4026	using h-alpha morphology and surface brightness fluctuations to age-date  star clusters in m83	we use new wfc3 observations of the nearby grand design spiral galaxy m83 todevelop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters.the first method uses the physical extent and morphology of halpha emission toestimate the ages of clusters younger than tau ~10 myr. it is based on thesimple premise that the gas in very young (tau &lt; few myr) clusters is largelycoincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structuresurrounding the stars in slightly older clusters (e.g., tau ~5 myr), and is ina larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ~5-10 myr). thesecond method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel fluxvariations within clusters and their ages. this method relies on the fact thatthe brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around10 myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., m_v &lt; -3.5) for ages olderthan about 100 myr. these two methods are the basis for a new morphologicalclassification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clustersbased on their appearance. we compare previous age estimates of clusters in m83determined from fitting ubvi halpha measurements using predictions from stellarevolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find goodagreement at the ~95% level. the scatter within categories is ~0.1 dex in logtau for young clusters (&lt;10 myr) and ~0.5 dex for older (&gt;10 myr) clusters. aby-product of this study is the identification of 22 "single-star" hii regionsin m83, with central stars having ages ~4 myr.

1106.2801	star formation in 30 doradus	using observations obtained with the wide field camera 3 (wfc3) on board thehubble space telescope (hst), we have studied the properties of the stellarpopulations in the central regions of 30 dor, in the large magellanic cloud.the observations clearly reveal the presence of considerable differentialextinction across the field. we characterise and quantify this effect usingyoung massive main sequence stars to derive a statistical reddening correctionfor most objects in the field. we then search for pre-main sequence (pms) starsby looking for objects with a strong (&gt; 4 sigma) halpha excess emission andfind about 1150 of them over the entire field. comparison of their location inthe hertzsprung-russell diagram with theoretical pms evolutionary tracks forthe appropriate metallicity reveals that about one third of these objects areyounger than ~4myr, compatible with the age of the massive stars in the centralionising cluster r136, whereas the rest have ages up to ~30myr, with a medianage of ~12myr. this indicates that star formation has proceeded over anextended period of time, although we cannot discriminate between an extendedepisode and a series of short and frequent bursts that are not resolved intime. while the younger pms population preferentially occupies the centralregions of the cluster, older pms objects are more uniformly distributed acrossthe field and are remarkably few at the very centre of the cluster. weattribute this latter effect to photoevaporation of the older circumstellardiscs caused by the massive ionising members of r136.

1106.5546	re-ionizing the universe without stars	recent observations show that the measured rates of star formation in theearly universe are insufficient to produce re-ionization, and therefore,another source of ionizing photons is required. in this \emph{letter}, weexamine the possibility that these can be supplied by the fast accretion shocksformed around the cores of the most massive haloes ($10.5&lt; \log m/m_{\odot} &lt;12$) on spatial scales of order 1 kpc. we model the detailed physics of thesefast accretion shocks, and apply these to a simple 1-d spherical hydrodynamicaccretion model for baryonic infall in dark matter halos with an einastodensity distribution. the escape of uv photons from these halos is delayed bythe time taken to reach the critical accretion shock velocity for escape of uvphotons; 220 km s$^{-1}$, and by the time it takes for these photons to ionizethe surrounding baryonic matter in the accretion flow. assuming that in theuniverse at large the baryonic matter tracks the dark matter, we can estimatethe epoch of re-ionization in the case that accretion shocks act alone as thesource of uv photons. we find that 50% of the volume (and 5-8% of the mass) ofthe universe can be ionized by $z \sim 7-8$. the uv production rate has anuncertainty of a factor of about 5 due to uncertainties in the cosmologicalparameters controlling the development of large scale structure. because ourmechanism is a steeply rising function of decreasing redshift, this uncertaintytranslates to a re-ionization redshift uncertainty of less than $\pm0.5$. wealso find that, even without including the uv photon production of stars,re-ionization is essentially complete by $z \sim 5.8$. thus, fast accretionshocks can provide an important additional source of ionizing photons in theearly universe.

1204.3880	resolving the electron temperature discrepancies in hii regions and  planetary nebulae: kappa-distributed electrons	the measurement of electron temperatures and metallicities in h ii regionsand planetary nebulae (pne) has-for several decades-presented a problem:results obtained using different techniques disagree. what it worse, theydisagree consistently. there have been numerous attempts to explain thesediscrepancies, but none has provided a satisfactory solution to the problem. inthis paper, we explore the possibility that electrons in h ii regions and pnedepart from a maxwell-boltzmann equilibrium energy distribution. we adopt a"kappa-distribution" for the electron energies. such distributions are widelyfound in solar system plasmas, where they can be directly measured. this simpleassumption is able to explain the temperature and metallicity discrepancies inh ii regions and pne arising from the different measurement techniques. we findthat the energy distribution does not need to depart dramatically from anequilibrium distribution. from an examination of data from hii regions and pneit appears that kappa ~ 10 is sufficient to encompass nearly all objects. weargue that the kappa-distribution offers an important new insight into thephysics of gaseous nebulae, both in the milky way and elsewhere, and one thatpromises significantly more accurate estimates of temperature and metallicityin these regions.

1209.3540	hot gas, cold gas and sub-halos in a lyman-alpha blob at redshift 2.38	we present integral field spectroscopy of a lyman-alpha blob at redshift2.38, with a spectral resolution three times better than previous publishedwork. as with previous observations, the blob has a chaotic velocity structure,much of which breaks up into multiple components. our spectroscopy shows,however, that some of these multiple components are extremely narrow: they havevelocity widths of less than 100 km/s.  combining these new data with previous observations, we argue that thislyman-alpha blob resides in a dark-matter halo of around 10^13 solar masses. atthe centre of this halo are two compact red massive galaxies. they aresurrounded by hot gas, probably a super-wind from merger-induced nuclearstarbursts. this hot gas has shut down star formation in the non-nuclear regionof these galaxies, leading to their red-and-dead colours.  a filament or lump of infalling cold gas is colliding with the hot gas phaseand being shocked to high temperatures, while still around 30kpc from the redgalaxies. the shock region is self-absorbed in lyman-alpha but produces c ivemission.  further out still, the cold gas in a number of sub-halos is being lit up,most likely by a combination of tidally triggered star formation, bow-shocks asthey plough through the hot halo medium, resonant scattering of lyman-alphafrom the filament collision, and tidal stripping of gas which enhances thelyman-alpha escape fraction. the observed lyman-alpha emission from the blob isdominated by the sum of the emission from these sub-halos.  on statistical grounds, we argue that lyman-alpha blobs are not greatlyelongated in shape, and that most are not powered by ionisation or scatteringfrom a central active galactic nucleus or starburst.

1306.2023	measuring nebular temperatures: the effect of new collision strengths  with equilibrium and kappa-distributed electron energies	in this paper we develop tools for observers to use when analysing nebularspectra for temperatures and metallicities, with two goals: to present a new,simple method to calculate equilibrium electron temperatures for collisionallyexcited line flux ratios, using the latest atomic data; and to adapt currentmethods to include the effects of possible non-equilibrium '{\kappa}' electronenergy distributions. adopting recent collision strength data for [o iii], [siii], [o ii], [s ii], and [n ii], we find that existing methods based on olderatomic data seriously overestimate the electron temperatures, even whenconsidering purely maxwellian statistics. if {\kappa} distributions exist in hii regions and planetary nebulae as they do in solar system plasmas, it isimportant to investigate the observational consequences. this paper continuesour previous work on the {\kappa} distribution (nicholls et al. 2012). wepresent simple formulaic methods that allow observers to (a) measureequilibrium electron temperatures and atomic abundances using the latest atomicdata, and (b) to apply simple corrections to existing equilibrium analysistechniques to allow for possible non-equilibrium effects. these tools shouldlead to better consistency in temperature and abundance measurements, and aclearer understanding of the physics of h ii regions and planetary nebulae.

1307.0508	theoretical evolution of optical strong lines across cosmic time	we use the chemical evolution predictions of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations with our latest theoretical stellar population synthesis,photoionization and shock models to predict the strong line evolution ofensembles of galaxies from z=3 to the present day. in this paper, we focus onthe brightest optical emission-line ratios, [nii]/h-alpha and [oiii]/h-beta. weuse the optical diagnostic baldwin-phillips-terlevich (bpt) diagram as a toolfor investigating the spectral properties of ensembles of active galaxies. weuse four redshift windows chosen to exploit new near-infrared multi-objectspectrographs. we predict how the bpt diagram will appear in these fourredshift windows given different sets of assumptions. we show that the positionof star-forming galaxies on the bpt diagram traces the ism conditions andradiation field in galaxies at a given redshift. galaxies containing agn form amixing sequence with purely star-forming galaxies. this mixing sequence maychange dramatically with cosmic time, due to the metallicity sensitivity of theoptical emission-lines. furthermore, the position of the mixing sequence mayprobe metallicity gradients in galaxies as a function of redshift, depending onthe size of the agn narrow line region. we apply our latest slow shock modelsfor gas shocked by galactic-scale winds. we show that at high redshift,galactic wind shocks are clearly separated from agn in line ratio space.instead, shocks from galactic winds mimic high metallicity starburst galaxies.we discuss our models in the context of future large near-infraredspectroscopic surveys.

1307.0514	the cosmic bpt diagram: confronting theory with observations	we compare a large sample of galaxies between 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 with theoreticalpredictions for how the optical diagnostic line ratios in galaxy ensembleschange as a function of cosmic time. we show that star forming galaxies at highredshift (z&gt;1.5) are consistent with a model in which the ism conditions aremore extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of localgalaxies. we speculate that global spectra of our high redshift galaxies may bedominated by hii regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-formingcomplexes in the antennae and m82. the transition to local-type conditionsoccurs between 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.5. we conclude that classification schemes developed forlocal samples should not be applied at high redshift (z &gt; 1.5). we use ourtheoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line thatutilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [oiii]/h-beta and[nii]/h-alpha. our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies fromagn between z=0 to z~3.5. we anticipate that our redshift-dependent opticalclassification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infraredmulti-object spectrographs. we apply our classification line to a sample ofgravitationally lensed galaxies at z~2.5. although limited by small numbers, weshow that our classification line is consistent with the position of agn thathave been independently confirmed via other methods.

1307.5950	new strong line abundance diagnostics for \hii regions: effects of  $\kappa$-distributed electron energies and new atomic data	recently, \citet{nicholls12}, inspired by \emph{in situ} observations ofsolar system astrophysical plasmas, suggested that the electrons in \hiiregions are characterised by a $\kappa$-distribution of electron energiesrather than by a simple maxwell-boltzmann distribution. here we have collectedtogether the new atomic data within a modified photoionisation code to explorethe effects of both the new atomic data and the $\kappa$-distribution on thestrong-line techniques used to determine chemical abundances in \hii regions.by comparing the recombination temperatures ($t_{\rm rec}$) with the forbiddenline temperatures ($t_{\rm fl}$) we conclude that $ \kappa \sim 20$. whilerepresenting only a mild deviation from equilibrium, this is sufficient tostrongly influence abundances determined using methods which depend onmeasurements of the electron temperature from forbidden lines. we present anumber of new emission line ratio diagnostics which cleanly separate the twoparameters determining the optical spectrum of \hii regions - the ionisationparameter $q$ or $\cal{u}$ and the chemical abundance; 12+log(o/h). anautomated code to extract these parameters is presented. using the homogeneousdataset from \citet{vanzee98}, we find self-consistent results between allthese different diagnostics. the systematic errors between different line ratiodiagnostics are much smaller than was found in the earlier strong line work.overall the effect of the $\kappa$-distribution on the strong line abundancesderived solely on the basis of theoretical models is rather small.

1310.3441	composite spectra in merging u/lirgs caused by shocks	we present a key result from our optical integral field spectroscopic surveyof 27 nearby ultra luminous and luminous infrared galaxies (u/lirgs) from thegreat observatory all-sky lirg survey. using spatially resolved multi-componentemission line fitting to trace the emission line ratios and velocity dispersionof the ionized gas, we quantify for the first time the widespread shockionization in gas-rich merging u/lirgs. our results show a fractionalcontribution to the total observed \ha flux from radiative shocks increasingfrom a few percent during early merger stages to upwards of 60% of the observedoptical emission line flux in late stage mergers. we compare our resolvedspectroscopy to nuclear spectra and find that 3/4 of the galaxies in our samplethat would be classified as "composite" based on optical spectroscopy areprimarily characterized by a combination of star formation and merger-drivenshocks. our results have important implications for the interpretation of"composite" rest-frame optical spectra of u/lirgs as starburst+agn, as theshock emission combined with star formation can mimic "composite" opticalspectra in the absence of any contribution from an agn.

1312.4633	spaxel analysis: probing the physics of star formation in ultraluminous  infrared galaxies	this paper presents a detailed spectral pixel (spaxel) analysis of the tenluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) previously observed with the wide fieldspectrograph (wifes), an integral field spectrograph mounted on the anu 2.3mtelescope, and for which an abundance gradient analysis has already beenpresented by rich et al. (2012). here we use the strong emission line analysistechniques developed by dopita et al. (2013) to measure the ionisationparameter and the oxygen abundance in each spaxel. in addition, we use theobserved h$\alpha$ flux to determine the surface rate of star formation($m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$) and use the [\ion{s}{2}]$\lambda\lambda6717/6731$ ratio to estimate the local pressure in the ionisedplasma. we discuss the correlations discovered between these physicalquantities, and use them to infer aspects of the physics of star formation inthese extreme star forming environments. in particular, we find a correlationbetween the star formation rate and the inferred ionisation parameter. weexamine the possible reasons for this correlation, and determine that the mostlikely explanation is that the more active star forming regions have adifferent distribution of molecular gas which favour higher ionisationparameters in the ionised plasma.

1401.0955	choirs hi galaxy groups: the metallicity of dwarf galaxies	we present a recalibration of the luminosity-metallicity relation forgas-rich, star-forming dwarfs to magnitudes as faint as m$_r$ ~ -13. we use thedopita et al. (2013) metallicity calibrations to calibrate the relation for allof the data in this analysis. in metallicity-luminosity space we find twosub-populations within a sample of high-confidence sdss dr8 star-forminggalaxies; 52% are metal-rich giants and 48% are metal-medium galaxies.metal-rich dwarfs classified as tidal dwarf galaxy (tdg) candidates in theliterature are typically of metallicity 12 + log(o/h) = 8.70 $\pm$ 0.05, whilesdss dwarfs fainter than m$_r$ = -16 have a mean metallicity of 12 + log(o/h) =8.28 $\pm$ 0.10, regardless of their luminosity, indicating that there is anapproximate floor to the metallicity of low luminosity galaxies. ourhydrodynamical simulations predict that tdgs should have metallicities elevatedabove the normal luminosity-metallicity relation. metallicity can therefore bea useful diagnostic for identifying tdg candidate populations in the absence oftidal tails. at magnitudes brighter than m$_r$ ~ -16 our sample of 53star-forming galaxies in 9 hi gas-rich groups is consistent with the normalrelation defined by the sdss sample. at fainter magnitudes there is an increasein dispersion in metallicity of our sample, suggestive of a wide range of hicontent and environment. in our sample we identify three (16% of dwarfs) strongtdg candidates (12 + log(o/h) &gt; 8.6), and four (21%) very metal poor dwarfs (12+ log(o/h) &lt; 8.0), which are likely gas-rich dwarfs with recently ignited starformation.

1405.7170	metal-poor dwarf galaxies in the sigrid galaxy sample. ii. the electron  temperature-abundance calibration and the parameters that affect it	in this paper, we use the mappings photoionization code to explore thephysical parameters that impact on the measurement of electron temperature andabundance in hii regions. in the previous paper we presented observations andmeasurements of physical properties from the spectra of seventeen hii regionsin fourteen isolated dwarf irregular galaxies from the sigrid sample. here, weanalyze these observations further, together with three additional publisheddata sets. we explore the effects of optical thickness, electron density,ionization parameter, ionization source, and non-equilibrium effects on therelation between electron temperature and metallicity. we present a standardmodel that fits the observed data remarkably well at metallicities between 1/10and 1 solar. we investigate the effects of optically thin hii regions, and showthat they can have a considerable effect on the measured electron temperature,and that there is evidence that some of the observed objects are opticallythin. we look at the role of the ionization parameter and find that lowerionization parameter values give better fits at higher oxygen abundance. weshow that higher pressures combined with low optical depth, and also kappaelectron energy distributions at low kappa values, can generate the apparenthigh electron temperatures in low metallicity hii regions, and that the formerprovides the better fit to observations. we examine the effects of theseparameters on the strong line diagnostic methods. we extend this tothree-dimensional diagnostic grids to confirm how well the observations aredescribed by the grids.

1406.5186	galaxy emission line classification using 3d line ratio diagrams	two-dimensional (2d) line ratio diagnostic diagrams have become a key tool inunderstanding the excitation mechanisms of galaxies. the curves used toseparate the different regions - hii-like or else excited by an active galacticnucleus (agn) - have been refined over time but the core technique has notevolved significantly. however, the classification of galaxies based on theiremission line ratios really is a multi-dimensional problem. here we exploitrecent software developments to explore the potential of three-dimensional (3d)line ratio diagnostic diagrams. we introduce a specific set of 3d diagrams, thezqe diagrams, which separate the oxygen abundance and the ionisation parameterof hii region-like spectra, and which also enable us to probe the excitationmechanism of the gas. by examining these new 3d spaces interactively, we definea new set of 2d diagnostics, the ze diagnostics, which can provide themetallicity of objects excited by hot young stars, and which cleanly separatehii region-like objects from the different classes of agns. we show that theseze diagnostics are consistent with the key log[nii]/h$\alpha$ vs.log[oiii]/h$\beta$ diagnostic currently used by the community. they also havethe advantage of attaching a probability that a given object belongs to oneclass or to the other. finally, we discuss briefly why zqe diagrams can providea new way to differentiate and study the different classes of agns inanticipation of a dedicated follow-up study.

1407.2411	the sami galaxy survey: shocks and outflows in a normal star-forming  galaxy	we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using large integral fieldspectroscopic surveys to investigate the prevalence of galactic-scale outflowsin the local universe. using integral field data from sami and the wide fieldspectrograph, we study the nature of an isolated disk galaxy, sdssj090005.05+000446.7 (z = 0.05386). in the integral field datasets, the galaxypresents skewed line profiles changing with position in the galaxy. the skewedline profiles are caused by different kinematic components overlapping in theline-of-sight direction. we perform spectral decomposition to separate the lineprofiles in each spatial pixel as combinations of (1) a narrow kinematiccomponent consistent with hii regions, (2) a broad kinematic componentconsistent with shock excitation, and (3) an intermediate component consistentwith shock excitation and photoionisation mixing. the three kinematiccomponents have distinctly different velocity fields, velocity dispersions,line ratios, and electron densities. we model the line ratios, velocitydispersions, and electron densities with our mappings iv shock andphotoionisation models, and we reach remarkable agreement between the data andthe models. the models demonstrate that the different emission line propertiesare caused by major galactic outflows that introduce shock excitation inaddition to photoionisation by star-forming activities. interstellar shocksembedded in the outflows shock-excite and compress the gas, causing theelevated line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities observed inthe broad kinematic component. we argue from energy considerations that, withthe lack of a powerful active galactic nucleus, the outflows are likely to bedriven by starburst activities. our results set a benchmark of the type ofanalysis that can be achieved by the sami galaxy survey on large numbers ofgalaxies.

1507.07932	a rise in the ionizing photons in star-forming galaxies over the past 5  billion years	we investigate the change in ionizing photons in galaxies between 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6using the f2 field of the shels complete galaxy redshift survey. we show, forthe first time, that while the [oiii]/hb and [oiii]/[oii] ratios rise, the[nii]/h-alpha and [sii]/h-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.35redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.6. the[oiii]/h-beta and [oiii]/[oii] ratios continue to rise across the full0.2&lt;z&lt;0.6 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.8&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.0. weconclusively rule out agn contamination, a changing ism pressure, and a changein the hardness of the euv radiation field as the cause of the change in theline ratios between 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.35. we find that the ionization parameter risessignificantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar massof the sample). we show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlatedwith the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the h-beta equivalentwidth. we discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies,and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicitydiagnostics at high redshift.

astro-ph;0112256	spatial resolution of high-velocity filaments in the narrow-line region  of ngc 1068: associated absorbers caught in emission?	using the hst stis spectrograph we have obtained a grid of [o iii] and h-betaemission-line spectra at 0"05x0"19 and 60 km/s (fwhm) resolution that coversmuch of the nlr of ngc 1068. we find emitting knots that have blueshiftedradial velocities up to 3200 km/s relative to galaxy systemic, are 70-150 pc neof the nucleus and up to 40 pc from the radio jet, emit several percent of thenlr line flux but no significant continuum, span velocity extents of up to 1250km/s but a small fraction of the sky seen from the nucleus, coincide with aregion of enhanced ir coronal-line emission, and have ionized masses $\sim$200msun/ne4 (ne4=10^4 cm^{-3}). we argue that the blueshifted knots are ablatafrom disintegrating molecular clouds that are being photoionized by the agn,and are being accelerated readiatively by the agn or mechanically by the radiojet. in their kinematic properties, the knots resemble the associated absorbersseen projected on the uv continua of some agn. between 2"5-4"5 from thenucleus, emission is redshifted relative to systemic, a pattern that weinterpret as gas in the galaxy disk being pushed away from us by the ne radiolobe.

astro-ph;0208094	the internal extinction curve of ngc 6302 and its extraordinary spectrum	in this paper we present a new method for obtaining the opticalwavelength-dependent reddening function of planetary nebulae, using the nebularand stellar continuum. the data used was a spectrum of ngc 6302 obtained with amean signal to noise of &gt;10^2 a^-1 in the nebular continuum. with such a highs/n the continuum can be accurately compared with a theoretical model nebularplus stellar continuum. the nebular electron temperature and density used inthe model are determined using ratios of prominent emission lines. thereddening function can then be obtained from the ratio of the theoretical andthe observed continuum. we find that for ngc 6302, the visible to ir extinctionlaw is indistinguishable from `standard' interstellar reddening, but that theuv extinction curve is much steeper than normal, suggesting that more smalldust grains had been ejected into the nebula by the pn central star. finally,using the extinction law that we have determined, we present a completede--reddened line list of nearly 600 emission lines, and report on thedetection of the he(2-10) and he(2-8) raman features at 4331 a and 4852 a, andthe detection of raman-scattered ovi features at 6830 and 7087 aa.

astro-ph;0306573	radio-excess iras galaxies: pmn/fsc sample selection	a sample of 178 extragalactic objects is defined by correlating the 60 microniras fsc with the 5 ghz pmn catalog. of these, 98 objects lie above theradio/far-infrared relation for radio-quiet objects. these radio-excessgalaxies and quasars have a uniform distribution of radio excesses and appearto be a new population of active galaxies not present in previousradio/far-infrared samples. the radio-excess objects extend over the full rangeof far-infrared luminosities seen in extragalactic objects. objects with smallradio excesses are more likely to have far-infrared colors similar tostarbursts, while objects with large radio excesses have far-infrared colorstypical of pure agn. some of the most far-infrared luminous radio-excessobjects have the highest far-infrared optical depths. these are good candidatesto search for hidden broad line regions in polarized light or via near-infraredspectroscopy. some low far-infrared luminosity radio-excess objects appear toderive a dominant fraction of their far-infrared emission from star formation,despite the dominance of the agn at radio wavelengths. many of the radio-excessobjects have sizes likely to be smaller than the optical host, but showoptically thin radio emission. we draw parallels between these objects and highradio luminosity compact steep-spectrum (css) and gigahertz peaked-spectrum(gps) objects. radio sources with these characteristics may be young agn inwhich the radio activity has begun only recently. alternatively, high centraldensities in the host galaxies may be confining the radio sources to compactsizes. we discuss future observations required to distinguish between thesepossibilities and determine the nature of radio-excess objects.

astro-ph;0309471	starburst galaxies: why the calzetti dust extinction law?	the empirical reddening function for starburst galaxies generated by calzettiand her co-workers has proven very successful, and is now used widely in theobservational literature. despite its success, however, the physical basis forthis extinction law, or more correctly, attenuation law remains weak. here weprovide a physical explanation for the calzetti law based on a turbulentinterstellar medium. in essence, this provides a log-normal distribution ofcolumn densities, giving a wide range of column densities in the dustyforeground screen. therefore, extended sources such as starburst regions or hiiregions seen through it suffer a point-to-point stochastic extinction andreddening. regions of high column densities are "black" in the uv, buttranslucent in the ir, which leads to a flatter extinction law, and a largervalue of the total to selective extinction, r_v. we fit the calzetti law, andinfer that the variance sigma of the log-normal distribution lies in the range0.6&lt;sigma&lt;2.2. the absolute to selective extinction r_v is found to be in therange 4.3 to 5.2 consistent with r_v=4.05+/-0.80 of the calzetti law.

astro-ph;0311202	anisotropy in the distribution of satellite galaxy orbits	nearby clusters such as virgo and coma possess galaxy distributions whichtend to be aligned with the principal axis of the cluster itself. this has alsobeen confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of some 300 abell clusterswhere the effect has been linked to the dynamical state of the cluster.moreover, the orbits of satellite galaxies in galactic systems like our ownmilky way also demonstrate a high degree of anisotropy - the so-called holmbergeffect, the origin of which has been the subject of debate for more than 30years. this study presents the analysis of cosmological simulations focusing onthe orbits of satellite galaxies within dark matter halos. the apocentres ofthe orbits of these satellites are preferentially found within a cone ofopening angle ~40 around the major axis of the host halo, in accordance withthe observed anisotropy found in galaxy clusters. we do, however, note that alink to the dynamical age of the cluster is not well established as both ouroldest dark matter halos do show a clear anisotropy signal. further analysisconnects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along thefilaments: the orbits are determined rather by the environment of the host halothan some "dynamical selection" during their life within the host's virialradius.

astro-ph;0401630	modelling the spectral energy distribution of galaxies. iii. attenuation  of stellar light in spiral galaxies	we present new calculations of the attenuation of stellar light from spiralgalaxies using geometries for stars and dust which can reproduce the entirespectral energy distribution from the uv to the fir/submm and can also accountfor the surface brightness distribution in both the optical/nir and fir/submm.the calculations are based on the model of popescu et al. (2000), whichincorporates a dustless stellar bulge, a disk of old stars with associateddiffuse dust, a thin disk of young stars with associated diffuse dust, and aclumpy dust component associated with star-forming regions in the thin disk.the attenuations, which incorporate the effects of multiple anisotropicscattering, are derived separately for each stellar component, and presented inthe form of easily accessible polynomial fits as a function of inclination, fora grid in optical depth and wavelength. the wavelength range considered isbetween 912 aa and 2.2 micron, sampled such that attenuation can beconveniently calculated both for the standard optical bands and for the bandscovered by galex. the attenuation characteristics of the individual stellarcomponents show marked differences between each other. a general formula isgiven for the calculation of composite attenuation, valid for any combinationof the bulge-to-disk ratio and amount of clumpiness. as an example, we show howthe optical depth derived from the variation of attenuation with inclinationdepends on the bulge-to-disk ratio. finally, a recipe is given for aself-consistent determination of the optical depth from the halpha/hbeta lineratio.

astro-ph;0404176	dusty, radiation pressure dominated photoionization. ii.  multi-wavelength emission line diagnostics for narrow line regions	seyfert narrow line region (nlr) emission line ratios are remarkably uniform,displaying only ~0.5 dex variation between galaxies, and even less within anindividual object. previous photoionization and shock models of this regionwere unable to explain this observation without the introduction of arbitraryassumptions or additional parameters. dusty, radiation pressure dominatedphotoionization models provide a simple physical mechanism which can reproducethis spectral uniformity between different objects. in the first paper of thisseries we described this model and its implementation in detail, as well aspresenting grids of model emission lines and examining the model structures.here we explore these models further, demonstrating their ability to reproducethe observed seyfert line ratios on standard line diagnostic diagrams in boththe optical and uv. we also investigate the effects that the variation ofmetallicity, density and ionizing spectrum have upon both the new paradigm andthe standard photoionization models used hitherto. along with the standarddiagnostic diagrams we provide several new diagnostic diagrams in the uv,optical and ir. these new diagrams can provide further tests of the dusty,radiation pressure photoionization paradigm as well as being used asdiagnostics of the metallicity, density and ionizing spectrum of the emissionline clouds.

astro-ph;0604478	radio-excess iras galaxies: iv. optical spectroscopy	this is the fourth in our series of papers investigating radio-excessgalaxies, which have radio emission associated with an active nucleus but whichdo not fit into the traditional categories of either radio-loud or radio-quietactive galaxies. in this paper, we present optical spectra of our sample offir-luminous radio-excess galaxies. optical emission line diagnostics are usedto determine the dominant source of the ionizing radiation. we find that radioexcess is an excellent indicator of the presence of an active nucleus: theradio-excess sample contains a much higher fraction of agn than samplesselected on fir luminosity alone, or using other criteria such as warm fircolors. several objects have ambiguous classifications and are likely to becomposite objects with mixed excitation. the type of optical spectrum appearsto be associated with the radio-loudness: radio-loud objects may be more `pure'agn than radio-intermediate objects. we find strong evidence for interactionbetween the radio plasma and the surrounding gas. the jet energy fluxes of theradio-excess objects, inferred from the [o iii] luminosities, are lower than inpowerful radio sources, consistent with our previous results. we conclude thatthe jets of radio-intermediate sources are intrinsically weaker than those insources with more powerful radio emission. a significant fraction of the samplespectra show post-starburst stellar continuum, with a-star absorption lines,consistent with the large fraction of merging or disturbed host galaxies in thesample. the ages of the radio sources are significantly less than those of astars indicating that, if the radio sources are associated with mergingactivity, there is a delay between the interaction and the initiation of theradio activity.

astro-ph;0606544	modelling the pan-spectral energy distribution of starburst galaxies:  ii. control of the \hii region parameters	we examine, from a theoretical viewpoint, how the physical parameters of hiiregions are controlled in both normal galaxies and in starburst environments.these parameters are the hii region luminosity function, the time-dependentsize, the covering fraction of molecular clouds, the pressure in the ionizedgas and the ionization parameter. the factors which control them are theinitial mass function of the exciting stars, the cluster mass function, themetallicity and the mean pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. weinvestigate the sensitivity of the h$\alpha$ luminosity to the imf, and findthat this can translate to more than a factor two variation in derived starformation rates. the molecular cloud dissipation timescale is estimated from acase study of m17 to be $\sim1$ myr for this object. based upon hii luminosityfunction fitting for nearby galaxies, we suggest that the \hii region clustermass function is fitted by a log-normal form peaking at $\sim 100 m_{\odot}$.the cluster mass function continues the stellar imf to higher mass. thepressure in the hii regions is controlled by the mechanical luminosity fluxfrom the central cluster. since this is closely related to the ionizing photonflux, we show that the ionization parameter is not a free variable, and thatthe diffuse ionized medium may be composed of many large, faint and old hiiregions. finally, we derive theoretical probability distributions for theionization parameter as a function of metallicity and compare these to thosederived for sdss galaxies.

astro-ph;0608062	modelling the pan-spectral energy distribution of starburst galaxies:  iii. emission line diagnostics of ensembles of evolving hii regions	we build, as far as theory will permit, self consistent model hii regionsaround central clusters of aging stars. these produce strong emission linediagnostics applicable to either individual hii regions in galaxies, or to theintegrated emission line spectra of disk or starburst galaxies. the modelsassume that the expansion and internal pressure of individual hii regions isdriven by the net input of mechanical energy from the central cluster, be itthrough winds or supernova events. this eliminates the ionization parameter asa free variable, replacing it with a parameter which depends on the ratio ofthe cluster mass to the pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. thesemodels explain why hii regions with low abundances have high excitation, anddemonstrate that at least part of the warm ionized medium is the result ofoverlapping faint, old, large, and low pressure hii regions. we present lineratios (at both optical and ir wavelengths) which provide reliable abundancediagnostics for both single hii regions or for integrated galaxy spectra, andwe find a number that can be used to estimate the mean age of the cluster starsexciting individual hii regions.

astro-ph;0702753	metal enriched gaseous halos around distant radio galaxies: clues to  feedback in galaxy formation	we present the results of an optical and near-ir spectroscopic study of giantnebular emission line halos associated with three z &gt; 3 radio galaxies, 4c41.17, 4c 60.07 and b2 0902+34. previous deep narrow band ly-alpha imaging hadrevealed complex morphologies with sizes up to 100 kpc), possibly connected tooutflows and agn feedback from the central regions. the outer regions of thesehalos show quiet kinematics with typical velocity dispersions of a few hundredkm/s, and velocity shears that can mostly be interpreted as being due torotation. the inner regions show shocked cocoons of gas closely associated withthe radio lobes. these display disturbed kinematics and have expansionvelocities and/or velocity dispersions &gt;1000 km/s. the core region ischemically evolved, and we also find spectroscopic evidence for the ejection ofenriched material in 4c 41.17 up to a distance of approximately 60 kpc alongthe radio-axis. the dynamical structures traced in the ly-alpha line are, inmost cases, closely echoed in the carbon and oxygen lines. this shows that thely-alpha line is produced in a highly clumped medium of small filling factor,and can therefore be used as a tracer of the dynamics of high-z radio galaxies(hzrgs). we conclude that these hzrgs are undergoing a final jet-induced phaseof star formation with ejection of most of their interstellar medium beforebecoming "red and dead" elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9711241	m87: a misaligned bl lac?	the nuclear region of m87 was observed with the faint object spectrograph(fos) on the hubble space telescope (hst) at 6 epochs, spanning 18 months,after the hst image quality was improved with the deployment of the correctiveoptics (costar) in december 1993. from the fos target acquisition data, we haveestablished that the flux from the optical nucleus of m87 varies by a factor ~2on time scales of ~2.5 months and by as much as 25% over 3 weeks, and remainsunchanged (&lt;= 2.5%) on time scales of ~1 day. the changes occur in anunresolved central region &lt;= 5 pc in diameter, with the physical size of theemitting region limited by the observed time scales to a few hundredgravitational radii. the featureless continuum spectrum becomes bluer as itbrightens while emission lines remain unchanged. this variability combined withthe observations of the continuum spectral shape, strong relativistic boostingand the detection of significant superluminal motions in the jet, stronglysuggest that m87 belongs to the class of bl lac objects but is viewed at anangle too large to reveal the classical bl lac properties.

astro-ph;9809123	physical conditions in the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992	this paper presents long slit spectral maps of the bi-cone shaped extendednarrow line region (enlr) in the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992. we investigate thephysical properties of the enlr via emission line diagnostics, and compare theobservations to shock and photoionization models for the excitation mechanismof the gas. the line ratios vary as a function of position in the enlr, and theloci of the observed points on line ratio diagrams are shown to be mostconsistent with shock+precursor model grids. we consider the energetics of anuclear ionizing source for the enlr, and perform the q-test in which the rateof ionizing photons from the nucleus is inferred from measurements of thedensity and ionization parameter. the q-test is shown to be invalid in the caseof ngc 2992 because of the limitations of the [s ii]6717/6731 densitydiagnostic. the excitation of the gas is shown to be broadly consistent withthe kinematics, with higher [n ii]6583/h-alpha present in the more dynamicallyactive region. we also show that the pressure associated with the x-rayemitting plasma may provide a large fraction of the pressure required to powerthe enlr via shocks.

astro-ph;9909218	jet-induced emission-line nebulosity and star formation in the  high-redshift radio galaxy 4c41.17	the high redshift radio galaxy 4c41.17 consists of a powerful radio source inwhich previous work has shown that there is strong evidence for jet-inducedstar formation along the radio axis. we argue that nuclear photoionization isnot responsible for the excitation of the emission line clouds and we constructa jet-cloud interaction model to explain the major features revealed by thedata. the interaction of a high-powered jet with a dense cloud in the halo of4c41.17 produces shock-excited emission-line nebulosity through ~1000 km/sshocks and induces star formation. the ciii to civ line ratio and the civluminosity emanating from the shock, imply that the pre-shock density in theline-emitting cloud is high enough (~1-10 cm^-3) that shock initiated starformation could proceed on a timescale of order a few x 10^6 yrs, well withinthe estimated dynamical age of the radio source. broad (fwhm ~ 100 - 1400 km/s)emission lines are attributed to the disturbance of the gas cloud by a partialbow--shock and narrow emission lines (fwhm ~ 500 - 650 km/s) (in particularciv) arise in precursor emission in relatively low metallicity gas. the impliedbaryonic mass ~ 8 \times 10^{10} solar masses of the cloud is high and impliesthat milky way size condensations existed in the environments of forming radiogalaxies at a redshift of 3.8. our interpretation of the data provides aphysical basis for the alignment of the radio, emission-line and uv continuumimages in some of the highest redshift radio galaxies and the analysispresented here may form a basis for the calculation of densities and cloudmasses in other high redshift radio galaxies.
