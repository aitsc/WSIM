0906.3187	uves/vlt high resolution absorption spectroscopy of the grb080330  afterglow: a study of the grb host galaxy and intervening absorbers	we study the gamma ray burst (grb) environment and intervening absorbers byanalyzing the optical absorption features produced by gas surrounding the grbor along its line of sight. we analyzed high resolution spectroscopicobservations (r=40000, s/n=3 - 6) of the optical afterglow of grb080330, takenwith uves at the vlt ~ 1.5 hours after the grb trigger. the spectrumillustrates the complexity of the ism of the grb host galaxy at z = 1.51 whichhas at least four components in the main absorption system. we detect strongfeii, siii, and niii excited absorption lines associated with the bluemostcomponent only. in addition to the host galaxy, at least two more absorberslying along the line of sight to the afterglow have been detected in theredshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, each exhibiting mgii absorption. for the bluemostcomponent in the host galaxy, we derive information about its distance from thesite of the grb explosion. we do so by assuming that the excited absorptionlines are produced by indirect uv pumping, and compare the data with a timedependent photo-excitation code. the distance of this component is found to be280+40-50 pc, which is lower than found for other grbs (1 - 6 kpc). we identifytwo additional mgii absorbers, one of them with a rest frame equivalent widthlarger than 1a. the distance between the grb and the absorber measured in thispaper confirms that the power of the grb radiation can influence the conditionsof the interstellar medium up to a distance of at least several hundred pc. forthe intervening absorbers, we confirm the trend that on average one strongintervening system is found per afterglow, as has been noted in studiesexhibiting an excess of strong mgii absorbers along grb sightlines compared toquasars.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

0708.1383	grb 070311: a direct link between the prompt emission and the afterglow	we present prompt gamma-ray, early nir/optical, late optical and x-rayobservations of the peculiar grb 070311 discovered by integral, in order togain clues on the mechanisms responsible for the prompt gamma-ray pulse as wellas for the early and late multi-band afterglow of grb 070311. we fitted withempirical functions the gamma-ray and optical light curves and scaled theresult to the late time x-rays. the h-band light curve taken by rem shows twopulses peaking 80 and 140 s after the peak of the gamma-ray burst and possiblyaccompanied by a faint gamma-ray tail. remarkably, the late optical and x-rayafterglow underwent a major rebrightening between 3x10^4 and 2x10^5 s after theburst with an x-ray fluence comparable with that of the prompt emissionextrapolated in the same band. notably, the time profile of the laterebrightening can be described as the combination of a time-rescaled version ofthe prompt gamma-ray pulse and an underlying power law. this result supports acommon origin for both prompt and late x-ray/optical afterglow rebrightening ofgrb 070311 within the external shock scenario. the main fireball would beresponsible for the prompt emission, while a second shell would produce therebrightening when impacting the leading blastwave in a refreshed shock(abridged).

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1008.0637	a translucent interstellar cloud at z=2.69: co, h2 and hd in the  line-of-sight to sdss j123714.60+064759.5	we present the analysis of a sub-dla system (log n(h^0)=20.0+/-0.15,z_abs=2.69) toward sdss j123714+064759 (z_em=2.78). using the vlt/uves andx-shooter spectrographs, we detect h2, hd and co molecules in absorption withlog n(h2,hd,co)=(19.21,14.48,14.17). the overall metallicity of the system issuper-solar ([zn/h]=+0.34) and iron is highly depleted ([fe/zn]=-1.39),revealing metal-rich and dusty gas. the strongest h2 component does notcoincide with the centre of the hi absorption. this implies that the molecularfraction in this component, f=2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(h^0)), is larger than the meanmolecular fraction &lt;f&gt;=1/4 in the system. this is supported by the detection ofcl^0 associated with this h2-component having n(cl^0)/n(cl^+)&gt;0.4. since cl^0is tied up to h2 by charge exchange reactions, this means that the molecularfraction in this component is not far from unity. the size of the molecularcloud is probably smaller than 1pc. both the co/h2=10^-5 and co/c^0~1 ratiosfor f&gt;0.24 indicate that the cloud classifies as translucent, i.e., a regimewhere carbon is found both in atomic and molecular form. the correspondingextinction, av=0.14, albeit lower than the definition of a translucentsightline (based on extinction properties), is high for the observed h^0 columndensity. this means that intervening clouds with similar local properties butwith larger column densities could be missed by current magnitude-limited qsosurveys. the excitation of co is dominated by radiative interaction with thecosmic microwave background radiation (cmbr) and we derive tex(co)=10.5+0.8-0.6k when tcmbr(z=2.69)=10.05 k is expected. the astration factor of deuterium-with respect to the primordial d/h ratio- is only about 3. this can be theconsequence of accretion of unprocessed gas from the intergalactic medium ontothe associated galaxy.

1107.3841	grb091127/sn2009nz and the vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of its host  galaxy: probing the faint end of the mass-metallicity relation	we perform a detailed study of the gamma-ray burst grb091127/sn2009nz hostgalaxy at z=0.490 using the vlt/x-shooter spectrograph in slit andintegral-field unit (ifu). from the analysis of the optical and x-ray afterglowdata obtained from ground-based telescopes and swift-xrt we confirm thepresence of a bump associated with sn2009nz and find evidence of a possible jetbreak in the afterglow lightcurve. the x-shooter afterglow spectra revealseveral emission lines from the underlying host, from which we derive itsintegrated properties. these are in agreement with those of previously studiedgrb-sn hosts and, more generally, with those of the long grb host population.we use the hubble space telescope and ground based images of the host todetermine its stellar mass (m_star). our results extend to lower m_star valuesthe m-z plot derived for the sample of long grb hosts at 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.0 adding newinformation to probe the faint end of the m-z relation and the shift of thelgrb host m-z relation from that found from emission line galaxy surveys.thanks to the ifu spectroscopy we can build the 2d velocity, velocitydispersion and star formation rate (sfr) maps. they show that the host galaxyhas a perturbed rotation kinematics with evidence of a sfr enhancementconsistent with the afterglow position.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1112.1700	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts: sample  presentation, luminosity function and evolution	we present a carefully selected sub-sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts(grbs), that is complete in redshift. the sample is constructed by consideringonly bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-upsearches, that are bright in the 15-150 kev swift/bat band, i.e. with 1-s peakphoton fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. the sample is composed by 58bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while anothertwo have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. for onlythree bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. the high level of redshiftcompleteness allows us for the first time to constrain the grb luminosityfunction and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. we find thatstrong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5)is required in order to account for the observations. the derived redshiftdistribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite oftheir different intrinsic redshift distribution. this calls for otherindicators to distinguish among different evolution models. complete samplesare at the base of any population studies. in future works we will use thisunique sample of swift bright grbs to study the properties of the population oflong grbs.

1112.4470	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma ray bursts: testing the  spectral-energy correlations	we use a nearly complete sample of gamma ray bursts (grbs) detected by theswift satellite to study the correlations between the spectral peak energy epof the prompt emission, the isotropic energetics eiso and the isotropicluminosity liso. this grb sample is characterized by a high level ofcompleteness in redshift (90%). this allows us to probe in an unbiased way theissue related to the physical origin of these correlations against selectioneffects. we find that one burst, grb 061021, is an outlier to the ep-eisocorrelation. despite this case, we find strong ep-eiso and ep-liso correlationsfor the bursts of the complete sample. their slopes, normalisations anddispersions are consistent with those found with the whole sample of burstswith measured redshift and ep. this means that the biases present in the totalsample commonly used to study these correlations do not affect theirproperties. finally, we also find no evolution with redshift of the ep-eiso andep-liso correlations.

1112.4480	the dark bursts population in a complete sample of bright swift long  gamma-ray bursts	we study the properties of the population of optically dark events present ina carefully selected complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts. thehigh level of completeness in redshift of our sample (52 objects out of 58)allow us to establish the existence of a genuine dark population and we areable to estimate the maximum fraction of dark burst events (~30%) expected forthe whole class of long gamma-ray burst. the redshift distribution of thispopulation of dark bursts is similar to the one of the whole sample.interestingly, the rest-frame x-ray luminosity (and the de-absorbed x-ray flux)of the sub-class of dark bursts is slightly higher than the average luminosityof the non-dark events. at the same time the prompt properties do not differand the optical flux of dark events is at the lower tail of the optical fluxdistribution, corrected for galactic absorption. all these properties suggestthat dark bursts events generate in much denser environments with respect tonormal bright events. we can therefore exclude the high-z and the low-densityscenarios and conclude that the major cause of the origin of optically darkevents is the dust extinction.

1112.5111	the x-ray absorbing column density of a complete sample of bright swift  gamma-ray bursts	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has been recentlyselected by salvaterra et al. (2011). the sample has a high level ofcompleteness in redshift (91%). we derive here the intrinsic absorbing x-raycolumn densities of these grbs making use of the swift x-ray telescope data.this distribution has a mean value of log(nh/cm-2)=21.7+-0.5. this value isconsistent with the distribution of the column densities derived from the totalsample of grbs with redshift. we find a mild increase of the intrinsic columndensity with redshift. this can be interpreted as due to the contribution ofintervening systems along the line of sight. making use of the spectral indexconnecting optical and x-ray fluxes at 11 hr (beta_ox), we investigate therelation of the intrinsic column density and the grb `darkness'. we find thatthere is a very tight correlation between dark grbs and high x-ray columndensities. this clearly indicates that the dark grbs are formed in a metal-richenvironment where dust must be present.

1202.0280	discovery of a compact gas-rich dla galaxy at z = 2.2: evidences for a  starburst-driven outflow	we present the detection of ly-alpha, [oiii] and h-alpha emission associatedwith an extremely strong dla system (n(hi) = 10^22.10 cm^-2) at z=2.207 towardsthe quasar sdss j113520-001053. this is the largest hi column density evermeasured along a qso line of sight, though typical of what is seen in grb-dlas.this absorption system also classifies as ultrastrong mgii system withw2796_r=3.6 a. the mean metallicity of the gas ([zn/h]=-1.1) and dust depletionfactors ([zn/fe]=0.72, [zn/cr]=0.49) are consistent with (and only marginallylarger than) the mean values found in the general qso-dla population. the[oiii]-ha emitting region has a very small impact parameter with respect to theqso line of sight, b=0.1", and is unresolved. from the ha line, we measuresfr=25 msun/yr. the ly-a line is double-peaked and is spatially extended. morestrikingly, the blue and red ly-a peaks arise from distinct regions extendedover a few kpc on either side of the star-forming region. we propose that thisis the consequence of ly-a transfer in outflowing gas. the presence ofstarburst-driven outflows is also in agreement with the large sfr together witha small size and low mass of the galaxy (mvir~10^10 msun). from the stellar uvcontinuum luminosity of the galaxy, we estimate an age of at most a few 10^7yr, again consistent with a recent starburst scenario. we interpret the data asthe observation of a young, gas rich, compact starburst galaxy, from whichmaterial is expelled through collimated winds powered by the vigorous starformation activity. we substantiate this picture by modelling the radiativetransfer of ly-a photons in the galactic counterpart. though our model (aspherical galaxy with bipolar outflowing jets) is a simplistic representationof the true gas distribution and velocity field, the agreement between theobserved and simulated properties is particularly good.

1203.0003	the impact of selection biases on the ep-liso correlation of gamma ray  bursts	we study the possible effects of selection biases on the ep-liso correlationcaused by the unavoidable presence of flux-limits in the existing samples ofgamma ray bursts (grbs). we consider a well defined complete sample of swiftgrbs and perform monte carlo simulations of the grb population under differentassumptions for their luminosity functions. if we assume that there is nocorrelation between the peak energy ep and the isotropic luminosity liso, weare unable to reproduce it as due to the flux limit threshold of the swiftcomplete sample. we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no intrinsiccorrelation between ep and liso at more than 2.7 sigma level of confidence.this result is robust against the assumptions of our simulations and it isconfirmed if we consider, instead of swift, the trigger threshold of the batseinstrument. therefore, there must be a physical relation between these twoquantities. our simulations seem to exclude, at a lower confidence level of 1.6sigma, the possibility that the observed ep-liso correlation among differentbursts is caused by a boundary, i.e. such that for any given ep, we see onlythe largest liso, which has a flux above the threshold of the currentinstruments.

1203.1864	on the environment of short gamma-ray bursts	in this paper we present a sample of 10 short gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with arobust redshift determination, discovered by the swift satellite up to january2011. we measure their x-ray absorbing column densities and collect data on thehost galaxy offsets. we find evidence for intrinsic absorption and nocorrelation between the intrinsic absorbing column density and the projectedoffset of the grb from its host galaxy center. we find that the properties inthe gamma regime (t90, fluence and 1-s peak photon flux) of short grbs with"bright" and "faint" x-ray afterglow likely disfavour different prompt emissionmechanisms. host galaxy offset and grb duration (t90) do not correlate.instead, there is a hint of anti-correlation between the effective radiusnormalised host galaxy offset and t90. finally, we examine the properties ofshort grbs with short-lived and long-lived x-ray afterglows, finding that someshort grbs with short-lived x-ray afterglows have their optical afterglowdetected. in light of this, the x-ray afterglow duration does not seem to be anunique indicator of a specific progenitor and/or environment for short grbs.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

1206.5532	the optical sn 2012bz associated with the long grb 120422a	the association of type ic sne with long-duration grbs is well established.we endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, tocharacterize these sne at increasingly high redshifts. we obtained a series ofoptical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ic sn2012bzassociated with the swift long-duration grb120422a (z=0.283) using the 3.6-mtng and the 8.2-m vlt telescopes. the peak times of the light curves ofsn2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the b-band and i'-band lightcurves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. thebolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometricmeasurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in thenear-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. therefore, the presentlight curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual uv-optical-irbolometric light curve. this pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (mbol= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape andluminosity to the bolometric light curves of the sne associated with z&lt;0.2 grbsand more luminous than those of sne associated with xrfs. a comparison with themodel generated for the bolometric light curve of sn2003dh suggests thatsn2012bz produced only about 15% less 56ni than sn2003dh, about 0.35 msol.similarly the vlt spectra of sn2012bz, after correction for galactic extinctionand for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosionparameters with those observed in sn2003dh (ek~3.5 x 10^52 erg, mej~7 msol) anda similar progenitor mass (~25-40 msol). grb120422a is consistent with theepeak-eiso and the ex,iso-egamma,iso-e_peak relations. grb120422a/sn2012bzshows the grb-sn connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitoredboth photometrically and spectroscopically.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1306.0013	how to switch on and off a gamma-ray burst through a magnetar	one of the most elusive features of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is the sporadicemission prior to the main prompt event observed in at least $\sim 15\%$ ofcases. these precursors have spectral and temporal properties similar to themain prompt emission, and smaller, but comparable, energetics. they areseparated from the main event by a quiescent time that may be extremely longand, in some cases, more than one precursor has been observed in the sameburst. precursors are still a puzzle: despite many attempts none of theproposed models can account for all the observed features. based on thecomplete sample of bright long grbs observed by swift (bat6), we propose a newscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central grbengine is a newly born magnetar. in this model the precursor and the promptemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar. theaccretion process can be halted by the centrifugal drag exerted by the rotatingmagnetosphere onto the in-falling matter, allowing for multiple precursors andvery long quiescent times.

1307.7704	radio afterglows of a complete sample of bright swift grbs: predictions  from present days to the ska era	radio observations of gamma ray bursts afterglows are fundamental inproviding insights into their physics and environment, and in constraining thetrue energetics of these sources. nonetheless, radio observations of grbafterglows are presently sparse in the time/frequency domain. starting from acomplete sample of 58 bright swift long bursts (bat6), we constructed ahomogeneous sub-sample of 38 radio detections/upper limits which preserves allthe properties of the parent sample. one half of the bursts have detectionsbetween 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes f&gt;100 mujy at 8.4ghz. through a population synthesis code coupled with the standard afterglowhydrodynamical emission model (psyche) we reproduce the radio flux distributionof the radio sub-sample. based on these results we study the detectability inthe time/frequency domain of the entire long grb population by present andfuture radio facilities. we find that the grbs that typically trigger swift canbe detected at 8.4 ghz by jvla within few days with modest exposures even athigh redshifts. the final ska can potentially observe the whole grb populationprovided that there will be a dedicated grb gamma-ray detector more sensitivethan swift. for a sizable fraction (50%) of these bursts, ska will allow us toperform radio-calorimetry, after the trans-relativistic transition (occurring~100 d), providing an estimate of the true (collimation corrected) energeticsof grbs.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1401.1972	a magnetar powering the ordinary monster grb 130427a?	we present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (grb)130427a under the hypothesis that the grb central engine is anaccretion-powered magnetar. in this framework, initially proposed to explaingrbs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion ofmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to theaccretion rate. the emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces areable to pause accretion. we show that the x-ray and optical afterglow is wellexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contributionfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. our modelling does not require anycontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglowlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. wederive the magnetic field ($b\sim 10^{16}$ g) and the spin period ($p\sim 20$ms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimumluminosity for accretion. this minimum luminosity results well below the promptemission luminosity of grb 130427a, providing a strong consistency check forthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuousaccretion onto the magnetar. this is in agreement with the relatively long spinperiod of the magnetar. grb 130427a was a well monitored grb showing a verystandard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that anaccretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long grbs.

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1402.4026	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 120327a afterglow	we present a study of the environment of the swift long gamma-ray burst grb120327a at z ~2.8 through optical spectroscopy of its afterglow. we analyzedmedium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (~7000 - 12000,corresponding to ~ 15 - 23 km/s, s/n = 15- 30 and wavelength range3000-25000aa) of the optical afterglow of grb 120327a, taken with x-shooter atthe vlt 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the grb trigger. the first epoch spectrum showsthat the ism in the grb host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich inabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.the hydrogen column density associated with grb 120327a has log nh / cm^(-2) =22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [x/h] =-1.3 to -1.1. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorptionfeatures associated with excited states of cii, oi, siii, feii, and niii, whichwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gasand the site of the grb explosion. the variability of the fei\lambda2396excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited bythe grb uv flux. moreover, the distance of component i is found to bedi=200+100-60 pc, while component ii is located closer to the grb, atdii=100+40-30 pc. these values are among the lowest found in grbs. componentiii does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther awayfrom the grb. the presence of h2 molecules is firmly established, with amolecular fraction in the range f=4 x 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). this particularly lowvalue can be attributed to the small dust content. this represents the thirdpositive detection of molecules in a grb environment.

1402.6338	grb orphan afterglows in present and future radio transient surveys	orphan afterglows (oa) are slow transients produced by gamma ray bursts seenoff-axis that become visible on timescales of days/years at optical/nir andradio frequencies, when the prompt emission at high energies (x and gamma rays)has already ceased. given the typically estimated jet opening angle of grbstheta_jet ~ 3 deg, for each burst pointing to the earth there should be afactor ~ 700 more grbs pointing in other directions. despite this, no secureoas have been detected so far. through a population synthesis code we study theemission properties of the population of oa at radio frequencies. oas reachtheir emission peak on year-timescales and they last for a comparable amount oftime. the typical peak fluxes (which depend on the observing frequency) are offew micro jy in the radio band with only a few oa reaching the mjy level. thesevalues are consistent with the upper limits on the radio flux of sn ib/cobserved at late times. we find that the oa radio number count distribution hasa typical slope -1.7 at high fluxes and a flatter (-0.4) slope at low fluxeswith a break at a frequency-dependent flux. our predictions of the oa rates areconsistent with the (upper) limits of recent radio surveys and archive searchesfor radio transients. future radio surveys like vast/askap at 1.4 ghz shoulddetect ~ 3x10^-3 oa deg^-2 yr-1, meerkat and evla at 8.4 ghz should see ~3x10^-1 oa deg-2 yr-1. the ska, reaching the micro jy flux limit, could see upto ~ 0.2-1.5 oa deg^-2 yr^-1. these rates also depend on the duration of the oaabove a certain flux limit and we discuss this effect with respect to thesurvey cadence.

1403.3245	optical and x-ray rest-frame light curves of the bat6 sample	we present the rest-frame light curves in the optical and x-ray bands of anunbiased and complete sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), namely thebat6 sample. the unbiased bat6 sample (consisting of 58 events) has the highestlevel of completeness in redshift ($\sim$ 95%), allowing us to compute therest-frame x-ray and optical light curves for 55 and 47 objects, respectively.we compute the x-ray and optical luminosities accounting for any possiblesource of absorption (galactic and intrinsic) that could affect the observedfluxes in these two bands. we compare the behaviour observed in the x-ray andin the optical bands to assess the relative contribution of the emission duringthe prompt and afterglow phases. we unarguably demonstrate that the grbsrest-frame optical luminosity distribution is not bimodal, being ratherclustered around the mean value log(l$_{r}$) = 29.9 $\pm$ 0.8 when estimated ata rest frame time of 12 hr. this is in contrast with what found in previousworks and confirms that the grb population has an intrinsic unimodal luminositydistribution. for more than 70% of the events the rest-frame light curves inthe x-ray and optical bands have a different evolution, indicating distinctemitting regions and/or mechanisms. the x-ray light curves normalised to thegrb isotropic energy (e$_{\rm iso}$), provide evidence for x-ray emission stillpowered by the prompt emission until late times ($\sim$ hours after the burstevent). on the other hand, the same test performed for the e$_{\rmiso}$-normalised optical light curves shows that the optical emission is abetter proxy of the afterglow emission from early to late times.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1408.5076	herschel observations of gamma-ray burst host galaxies: implications for  the topology of the dusty interstellar medium	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are indisputably related to starformation, and their vast luminosity in gamma rays pin-points regions of starformation independent of galaxy mass. as such, grbs provide a unique tool forstudying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. most ofour understanding of the properties of grb hosts (grbhs) comes from optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up observations, and we therefore have relativelylittle knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resideswithin grbhs. currently ~20% of grbs show evidence of significant amounts ofdust along the line of sight to the afterglow through the host galaxy, andthese grbs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than grbswith optically bright afterglows. in this paper we present herschelobservations of five grbhs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted tounderstand the dust attenuation properties within grbs better. despite thesensitivity of our herschel observations, only one galaxy in our sample wasdetected (grbh 070306), for which we measure a total star formation rate (sfr)of ~100mstar/yr, and which had a relatively high stellar mass(log[mstar]=10.34+0.09/-0.04). nevertheless, when considering a larger sampleof grbhs observed with herschel, it is clear that stellar mass is not the onlyfactor contributing to a herschel detection, and significant dust extinctionalong the grb sightline (a_{v,grb}&gt;1.5~mag) appears to be a considerably bettertracer of grbhs with high dust mass. this suggests that the extinguishing dustalong the grb line of sight lies predominantly within the host galaxy ism, andthus those grbs with a_{v,grb}&gt;1~mag but with no host galaxy herscheldetections are likely to have been predominantly extinguished by dust within anintervening dense cloud.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

1504.02096	unveiling the population of orphan gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets areoriented towards the observer. however, for each grb with a typical theta_jet,there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewherein space. these off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to thedeceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparableto the viewing angle. orphan afterglows (oa) should outnumber the currentpopulation of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not beenconclusively observed so far at any frequency. we compute the expected flux ofthe population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and x-ray bands througha population synthesis code of grbs and the standard afterglow emission model.we estimate the detection rate of oa by on-going and forthcoming surveys. theaverage duration of oa as transients above a given limiting flux is derived anddescribed with analytical expressions: in general oa should appear as dailytransients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radioband. we find that ~ 2 oa yr^-1 could already be detected by gaia and up to 20oa yr^-1 could be observed by the ztf survey. a larger number of 50 oa yr^-1should be detected by lsst in the optical band. for the x-ray band, ~ 26 oayr^-1 could be detected by the erosita. for the large population of oadetectable by lsst, the x-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for thebrightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm andradio band could be the key to disentangle their grb nature from otherextragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

1505.06743	grb hosts through cosmic time - vlt/x-shooter emission-line spectroscopy  of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.6	[abridged] we present data and initial results from vlt/x-shooteremission-line spectroscopy of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.6, thelargest sample of grb host spectroscopy available to date. most of our grbswere detected by swift and 76% are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 with a median z~1.6. based onbalmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measuresystemic redshifts, star formation rates (sfrs), visual attenuations, oxygenabundances (12+log(o/h)), and emission-line widths. we find a strong change ofthe typical physical properties of grb hosts with redshift. the median sfr, forexample, increases from ~0.6 m_sun/yr at z~0.6 up to ~15 m_sun/yr at z~2. ahigher ratio of [oiii]/[oii] at higher redshifts leads to an increasingdistance of grb-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the bptdiagram. oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between12+log(o/h)=7.9 and 12+log(o/h)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(o/h)~8.5. thefraction of grb-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20%at z&lt;1 in the adopted metallicity scale. this is significantly less than thefraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that grbs arescarce in high-metallicity environments. at z~3, sensitivity limits us toprobing only the most luminous grb hosts for which we derive metallicities of z~&lt; 0.5 z_sun. together with a high incidence of galaxies with similarmetallicity in our sample at z~1.5, this indicates that the metallicitydependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z~3.

1506.03079	the high-redshift gamma-ray burst grb140515a	high-redshift gamma-ray bursts have several advantages for the study of thedistant universe, providing unique information about the structure andproperties of the galaxies in which they exploded. spectroscopic identificationwith large ground-based telescopes has improved our knowledge of the class ofsuch distant events. we present the multi-wavelength analysis of the high-$z$swift gamma-ray burst grb140515a ($z = 6.327$). the best estimate of theneutral hydrogen fraction of the intergalactic medium (igm) towards the burstis $x_{hi} \leq 0.002$. the spectral absorption lines detected for this eventare the weakest lines ever observed in gamma-ray burst afterglows, suggestingthat grb140515a exploded in a very low density environment. its circum-burstmedium is characterised by an average extinction (a$_{\rm v} \sim 0.1$) thatseems to be typical of $z \ge 6$ events. the observed multi-band light curvesare explained either with a very flat injected spectrum ($p = 1.7$) or with amulti-component emission ($p = 2.1$). in the second case a long-lasting centralengine activity is needed in order to explain the late time x-ray emission. thepossible origin of grb140515a from a pop iii (or from a pop ii stars with localenvironment enriched by pop iii) massive star is unlikely.

1506.05463	the rate and luminosity function of long gamma ray bursts	we derive, adopting a direct method, the luminosity function and theformation rate of long gamma ray bursts through a complete, flux-limited,sample of swift bursts which has a high level of completeness in redshift z(~82%). we parametrise the redshift evolution of the grb luminosity as l =l_0(1+ z)^k and we derive k = 2.5, consistently with recent estimates. thede-evolved luminosity function of grbs can be represented by a broken power lawwith slopes a = -1.32 +- 0.21 and b = -1.84 +- 0.24 below and above,respectively, a characteristic break luminosity l_0,b = 10^51.45+-0.15 erg/s.under the hypothesis of luminosity evolution we find that the grb formationrate increases with redshift up to z~2, where it peaks, and then decreases inagreement with the shape of the cosmic star formation rate. we test the directmethod through numerical simulations and we show that if it is applied toincomplete (both in redshift and/or flux) grb samples it can misleadinglyresult in an excess of the grb formation rate at low redshifts.

1506.07791	grb host galaxies with vlt/x-shooter: properties at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3	long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) are associated with the death of massive stars.their host galaxies therefore represent a unique class of objects tracing starformation across the observable universe. indeed, recently accumulated evidenceshows that grb hosts do not differ substantially from general population ofgalaxies at high (z &gt; 2) redshifts. however, it has been long recognised thatthe properties of z &lt; 1.5 hosts, compared to general star-forming population,are unusual. to better understand the reasons for the supposed difference inlgrb hosts properties at z &lt; 1.5, we obtained vlt/x- shooter spectra of sixhosts lying in the redshift range of 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. some of these hosts havebeen observed before, yet we still lack well constrained information on theircharacteristics such as metallicity, dust extinction and star formation rate.we search for emission lines in the vlt/x-shooter spectra of the hosts andmeasure their fluxes. we perform a detailed analysis, estimating host averageextinction, star-formation rates, metallicities and electron densities wherepossible. measured quantities of our hosts are compared to a larger sample ofpreviously observed grb hosts at z &lt; 2. star-formation rates and metallicitiesare measured for all the hosts analyzed in this paper and metallicities arewell determined for 4 hosts. the mass-metallicity relation, the fundamentalmetallicity relation and sfrs derived from our hosts occupy similar parameterspace as other host galaxies investigated so-far at the same redshift. wetherefore conclude that grb hosts in our sample support the found discrepancybetween the properties of low-redshift grb hosts and the general population ofstar- forming galaxies.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.

0807.1348	the short grb070707 afterglow and its very faint host galaxy	we present the results from an eso/vlt campaign aimed at studying theafterglow properties of the short/hard gamma ray burst grb 070707. observationswere carried out at ten different epochs from ~0.5 to ~80 days after the event.the optical flux decayed steeply with a power-law decay index greater than 3,later levelling off at r~27.3 mag; this is likely the emission level of thehost galaxy, the faintest yet detected for a short grb. spectroscopicobservations did not reveal any line features/edges that could unambiguouslypinpoint the grb redshift, but set a limit z &lt; 3.6. in the range of allowedredshifts, the host has a low luminosity, comparable to that of long-durationgrbs. the existence of such faint host galaxies suggests caution whenassociating short grbs with bright, offset galaxies, where the true host mightjust be too dim for detection. the steepness of the decay of the opticalafterglow of grb 070707 challenges external shock models for the opticalafterglow of short/hard grbs. we argue that this behaviour might results fromprolonged activity of the central engine or require alternative scenarios.

astro-ph;0310184	dust and dark gamma-ray bursts: mutual implications	in a cosmological context dust has been always poorly understood. that istrue also for the statistic of grbs so that we started a program to understandits role both in relation to grbs and in function of z. this paper presents acomposite model in this direction. the model considers a rather genericdistribution of dust in a spiral galaxy and considers the effect of changingsome of the parameters characterizing the dust grains, size in particular. wefirst simulated 500 grbs distributed as the host galaxy mass distribution,using as model the milky way. if we consider dust with the same properties asthat we observe in the milky way, we find that due to absorption we miss about10% of the afterglows assuming we observe the event within about 1 hour or evenwithin 100s. in our second set of simulations we placed grbs randomly insidegiants molecular clouds, considering different kinds of dust inside and outsidethe host cloud and the effect of dust sublimation caused by the grb inside theclouds. in this case absorption is mainly due to the host cloud and thephysical properties of dust play a strong role. computations from this modelagree with the hypothesis of host galaxies with extinction curve similar tothat of the small magellanic cloud, whereas the host cloud could be alsocharacterized by dust with larger grains. to confirm our findings we need a setof homogeneous infrared observations. the use of coming dedicated infraredtelescopes, like rem, will provide a wealth of cases of new afterglowobservations.

astro-ph;0701558	uves - vlt high resolution spectroscopy of grb afterglows	we present early time, high resolution spectroscopy of three grb afterglows:grb050730, grb050922c and grb060418. these data give us precious information onthe kinematics, ionization and metallicity of the interstellar matter of grbhost galaxies up to a redshift z = 4, and of intervening absorbers along theline of sight. the absorption spectra show that elements are present both withhigh and low ionization states, and even forbidden, fine structure levels arecommonly observed. these features allow us to evaluate the physical parametersof the absorbing gas. in details, the density of the gas regions lie in therange n = 10 - 10^6 cm-3, and the temperatures are of the order of t = 10^3 -10^4 k. the metallicity of the grb host galaxies is computed using the hydrogenabsorption features. we find undersolar abundances for our grbs, namely, z =0.001 - 0.01. however, depletion has not been considered. it can be taken intoaccount using as metallicity indicators zn and cr, which tend to remain in thegas phase. we find metallicities higher than the previous values and inagreement with other measurements for grb host galaxies. finally, the observed[c/fe] ratio for grb050730 (z = 3.967) agrees with values expected for a galaxyyounger than a gyr undergoing bursts of star-formation. in addition, the [c/fe]ratio evaluated component by component can give informations on the relativedistances of the components from the grb explosion site, since fe dust is moreefficiently destroyed than graphite.

astro-ph;0701591	swift grbs: the early afterglow spectral energy distribution	we present the first results of a program to systematically study theoptical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) of swift grb afterglowswith known redshift. the goal is to study the properties of the grb explosionand of the intervening absorbing material. in this report we present thepreliminary analysis on 23 afterglows. thanks to swift, we could build the sedat early times after the grb (minutes to hours). we derived the hydrogen columndensities and the spectral slopes from the x-ray spectrum. we then constrainedthe visual extinction by requiring that the combined optical/x-ray sed is dueto synchrotron, namely either a single power law or a broken power law with aslope change by 0.5. we confirm a low dust-to-metal ratio, smaller than in thesmc, even from the analysis of data taken significantly earlier than previouslypossible. our analysis does not support the existence of ``grey'' dust. we alsofind that the synchrotron spectrum works remarkably well to explain afterglowseds. we clearly see, however, that during the x-ray steep decay phases and theflares, the x-ray radiation cannot be due only to afterglow emission.

0706.1273	multicolor observations of the afterglow of the short/hard grb 050724	new information on short/hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is being gatheredthanks to the discovery of their optical and x-ray afterglows. however, somekey aspects are still poorly understood, including the collimation level of theoutflow, the duration of the central engine activity, and the properties of theprogenitor systems. we want to constrain the physical properties of the shortgrb 050724 and of its host galaxy, and make some inferences on the global shortgrb population. we present optical observations of the afterglow of grb 050724and of its host galaxy, significantly expanding the existing dataset for thisevent. we compare our results with models, complementing them with availablemeasurements from the literature. we study the afterglow light curve andspectrum including x-ray data. we also present observations of the host galaxy.the observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed inthe x-ray light curve. the apparent steep decay was therefore not due to thejet effect. available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turnimplying a large energy release, comparable to that of long grbs. the flareproperties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a largelorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. this implies that thecentral engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shellssimultaneously. the host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,consistent with previous findings on this grb. however, it is not a pureelliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. grb 050724 provides the mostcompelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with oldstellar population. it thus plays a pivotal role in constraining progenitorsmodels, which should allow for long delays between birth and explosion.
