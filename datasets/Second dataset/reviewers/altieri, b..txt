1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.1658	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: source extraction and  cross-identifications in confusion-dominated spire images	we present the cross-identification and source photometry techniques used toprocess herschel spire imaging taken as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). cross-identifications are performed in map-spaceso as to minimise source blending effects. we make use of a combination oflinear inversion and model selection techniques to produce reliablecross-identification catalogues based on spitzer mips 24 micron sourcepositions. testing on simulations and real herschel observations show that thisapproach gives robust results for even the faintest sources s250~10 mjy. weapply our new technique to hermes spire observations taken as part of thescience demostration phase of herschel. for our real spire observations we showthat, for bright unconfused sources, our flux density estimates are in goodagreement with those produced via more traditional point source detectionmethods (sussextractor; savage &amp; oliver et al. 2006) by smith et al. 2010. whencompared to the measured number density of sources in the spire bands, we showthat our method allows the recovery of a larger fraction of faint sources thanthese traditional methods. however this completeness is heavily dependant onthe relative depth of the existing 24 micron catalogues and spire imaging.using our deepest multi-wavelength dataset in goods-n, we estimate that the useof shallow 24 micron in our other fields introduces an incompleteness at faintlevels of between 20-40 per cent at 250 micron.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.6195	the xmm-lss survey: optical assessment and properties of different x-ray  selected cluster classes	xmm and chandra opened a new area for the study of clusters of galaxies. notonly for cluster physics but also, for the detection of faint and distantclusters that were inaccessible with previous missions. this article presents66 spectroscopically confirmed clusters (0.05&lt;z&lt;1.5) within an area of 6 deg2enclosed in the xmm-lss survey. almost two thirds have been confirmed withdedicated spectroscopy only and 10% have been confirmed with dedicatedspectroscopy supplemented by literature redshifts. sub-samples, or classes, ofextended-sources are defined in a two-dimensional x-ray parameter spaceallowing for various degrees of completeness and contamination. we describe theprocedure developed to assess the reality of these cluster candidates using thecfhtls photometric data and spectroscopic information from our own follow-upcampaigns. most of these objects are low mass clusters, hence constituting astill poorly studied population. in a second step, we quantify correlationsbetween the optical properties such as richness or velocity dispersion and thecluster x-ray luminosities. we examine the relation of the clusters to thecosmic web. finally, we review peculiar structures in the surveyed area likevery distant clusters and fossil groups.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

0709.1950	the xmm-lss survey: the class 1 cluster sample over the initial 5 square  degrees and its cosmological modelling	we present a sample of 29 galaxy clusters from the xmm-lss survey over anarea of some 5deg2 out to a redshift of z=1.05. the sample clusters, whichrepresent about half of the x-ray clusters identified in the region, followwell defined x-ray selection criteria and are all spectroscopically confirmed.for all clusters, we provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures as well asmasses. the cluster distribution peaks around z=0.3 and t =1.5 kev, half of theobjects being groups with a temperature below 2 kev. our l-t(z) relation pointstoward self-similar evolution, but does not exclude other physically plausiblemodels. assuming that cluster scaling laws follow self-similar evolution, ournumber density estimates up to z=1 are compatible with the predictions of theconcordance cosmology and with the findings of previous rosat surveys. our wellmonitored selection function allowed us to demonstrate that the inclusion ofselection effects is essential for the correct determination of the evolutionof the l-t relation, which may explain the contradictory results from previousstudies. extensive simulations show that extending the survey area to 10deg2has the potential to exclude the non-evolution hypothesis, but that constraintson more refined icm models will probably be limited by the large intrinsicdispersion of the l-t relation. we further demonstrate that increasing thedispersion in the scaling laws increases the number of detectable clusters,hence generating further degeneracy [in addition to sigma8, omega_m, l(m,z) andt(m,z)] in the cosmological interpretation of the cluster number counts. weprovide useful empirical formulae for the cluster mass-flux and mass-count-raterelations as well as a comparison between the xmm-lss mass sensitivity and thatof forthcoming sz surveys.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1106.3070	building the cosmic infrared background brick by brick with herschel/pep	the cosmic infrared background (cib) includes roughly half of the energyradiated by all galaxies at all wavelengths across cosmic time, as observed atthe present epoch. the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey is exploited hereto study the cib and its redshift differential, at 70, 100 and 160 micron,where the background peaks. combining pacs observations of the goods-s,goods-n, lockman hole and cosmos areas, we define number counts spanning overmore than two orders of magnitude in flux: from ~1 mjy to few hundreds mjy.stacking of 24 micron sources and p(d) statistics extend the analysis down to~0.2 mjy. taking advantage of the wealth of ancillary data in pep fields,differential number counts and cib are studied up to z=5. based on thesecounts, we discuss the effects of confusion on pacs blank field observationsand provide confusion limits for the three bands considered. the total cibsurface brightness emitted above pep 3 sigma flux limits is 4.52 +/- 1.18, 8.35+/- 0.95 and 9.49 +/- 0.59 [nw/m2/sr] at 70, 100, and 160 micron, respectively.these values correspond to 58 +/- 7% and 74 +/- 5% of the cobe/dirbe cib directmeasurements at 100 and 160 micron. employing the p(d) analysis, thesefractions increase to ~65% and ~89%. more than half of the resolved cib wasemitted at redshift z&lt;=1. the 50%-light redshifts lie at z=0.58, 0.67 and 0.73at the three pacs wavelengths. the distribution moves towards earlier epochs atlonger wavelengths: while the 70 micron cib is mainly produced by z&lt;=1.0objects, the contribution of z&gt;1.0 sources reaches 50% at 160 micron. most ofthe cib resolved in the three pacs bands was emitted by galaxies with infraredluminosities in the range 1e11-1e12 l(sun).

1106.4284	goods-herschel: the far-infrared view of star formation in agn host  galaxies since z~3	we present a study of the infrared properties of x-ray selected, moderateluminosity (lx=10^{42}-10^{44}ergs/s) active galactic nuclei (agns) up to z~3,to explore the links between star formation in galaxies and accretion ontotheir central black holes. we use 100um and 160um fluxes from goods-herschel-the deepest survey yet undertaken by the herschel telescope- and show that in&gt;94 per cent of cases these fluxes are dominated by the host. we find noevidence of any correlation between the x-ray and infrared luminosities ofmoderate agns at any redshift, suggesting that star-formation is decoupled fromnuclear (agn) activity. the star formation rates of agn hosts increase stronglywith redshift; by a factor of 43 from z&lt;0.1 to z=2-3 for agns with the samex-ray luminosities. this increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50increase in the specific star formation rates (ssfrs) of normal, star-forming(main-sequence) galaxies. indeed, the average ssfrs of agn hosts are onlymarginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with thissmall deficit being due to a fraction of agns residing in quiescent (low-ssfr)galaxies. we estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate agns are hosted inmain-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and &lt;10 per centin strongly starbursting galaxies. the fractions of all main sequence galaxiesat z&lt;2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependenton galaxy stellar mass (mstars); rising from a few per cent atmstars~10^{10}msun to &gt;20 per cent at mstars&gt;10^{11}msun. our results indicatethat it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether agalaxy hosts a moderate luminosity agn. we argue that the majority of moderatenuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers,suggesting that disk instabilities could be an important agn feeding mechanism.

1107.1049	goods-herschel: evidence for a uv extinction bump in galaxies at z &gt; 1	dust attenuation curves in external galaxies are useful to study their dustproperties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energydistributions. in particular the presence or absence of a uv bump at 2175 aremains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broadband colours of distant galaxies. we study the dust attenuation curve in the uvrange at z &gt;1. in particular we search for the presence of a uv bump. we usedeep photometric data of the cdfs obtained with intermediate and broad bandfilters by the musyc project to sample the uv rest-frame of galaxies with 1&lt;z&lt;2. herschel/pacs and spitzer/mips data are used to measure the dust emission.30 galaxies were selected with high s/n in all bands. their seds from the uv tothe far-ir are fitted using the cigale code and the characteristics of the dustattenuation curve are obtained. the mean dust attenuation curve we deriveexhibits a uv bump at 2175a whose amplitude corresponds to 35 % (76%) that ofthe mw (lmc2 supershell) extinction curve. an analytical expression of theaverage attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than thecalzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. our galaxy sample is used tostudy the derivation of the slopes of the uv continuum from broad band colours,including the galex fuv-nuv colour. systematic errors induced by the presenceof the bump are quantified. we compare dust attenuation factors measured withcigale to the slope of the uv continuum and find that there is a large scatteraround the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). the uncertainties onthe determination of the uv slope lead to an extra systematic error of theorder of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the uv bump.

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1109.1937	goods-herschel: the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the  far-infrared properties of galaxies	we study the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the fir properties ofgalaxies and its evolution at 0&lt;z&lt;1.2. using the high-z galaxies in the fieldsof goods observed by herschel in the framework of the goods-herschel keyprogram and the local iras or akari-selected galaxies in the field of sdss dr7,we investigate the dependence of galaxy properties on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy. we find that the sfrs and the ssfrs ofgalaxies, on average, depend on the morphology of and the distance to thenearest neighbor galaxy in this redshift range. when a late-type galaxy has aclose neighbor galaxy, the sfr and the ssfr increase as it approaches alate-type neighbor, which is supported by k-s and mc tests with a significancelevel of &gt;99%. however, the sfr and the ssfr decrease or do not change much asit approaches an early-type neighbor. the bifurcations of sfrs and ssfrsdepending on the neighbor's morphology seem to occur at r_n~0.5r_vir,nei, whichis supported by k-s and mc tests with a significance level of &gt;98%. for allredshift bins, the ssfrs of late-type galaxies interacting with late-typeneighbors are increased by factors of about 1.8+/-0.7 and 4.0+/-1.2 compared tothose of non-interacting galaxies when the pair separation is smaller than0.5r_vir,nei and 0.1r_vir,nei, respectively. the tdust of both local and high-zlate-type galaxies strongly interacting with late-type neighbors (i.e. r_n &lt;0.1r_vir,nei) appears to be higher than that of non-interacting galaxies with asignificance level of 96-99%. however, tdust of local late-type galaxiesstrongly interacting with early-type neighbors seems to be lower than orsimilar to that of non-interacting galaxies. our results suggest thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers have been strongly affecting the sfr andthe dust properties of star-forming galaxies over at least 8 billion years.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1201.1294	the relation between cool cluster cores and herschel-detected star  formation in brightest cluster galaxies	we present far-infrared (fir) analysis of 68 brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) at 0.08 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. deriving total infrared luminosities directly fromspitzer and herschel photometry spanning the peak of the dust component(24-500um), we calculate the obscured star formation rate (sfr). 22(+6.2,-5.3)%of the bcgs are detected in the far-infrared, with sfr= 1-150 m_sun/yr. theinfrared luminosity is highly correlated with cluster x-ray gas cooling timesfor cool-core clusters (gas cooling time &lt;1 gyr), strongly suggesting that thestar formation in these bcgs is influenced by the cluster-scale coolingprocess. the occurrence of the molecular gas tracing ha emission is alsocorrelated with obscured star formation. for all but the most luminous bcgs(l_tir &gt; 2x10^11 l_sun), only a small (&lt;0.4 mag) reddening correction isrequired for sfr(ha) to agree with sfr_fir. the relatively low ha extinction(dust obscuration), compared to values reported for the general star-formingpopulation, lends further weight to an alternate (external) origin for the coldgas. finally, we use a stacking analysis of non-cool-core clusters to show thatthe majority of the fuel for star formation in the fir-bright bcgs is unlikelyto originate form normal stellar mass loss.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

"warm dust" galaxies are,however, statistically rarer in field samples (&gt; 3sigma), indicating that theresponsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. the spatialdistribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared brightpopulation, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although thegalaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (m_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun). we proposedust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for theunusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. a normal star-forming galaxywould need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outerreaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a sed similar to a "warmdust" galaxy. these progenitors would not require a higher ir-luminosity ordust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.

1209.3016	no clear submillimetre signature of suppressed star formation amongst  x-ray luminous agns	many theoretical models require powerful active galactic nuclei (agns) tosuppress star formation in distant galaxies and reproduce the observedproperties of today's massive galaxies. a recent study based on herschel-spiresubmillimetre observations claimed to provide direct support for this picture,reporting a significant decrease in the mean star-formation rates (sfrs) of themost luminous agns (lx&gt;10^44 erg/s) at z=1-3 in the chandra deep field-north(cdf-n). in this letter we extend these results using herschel-spire 250um datain the cosmos and cdf-s fields to achieve an order of magnitude improvement inthe number of sources at lx&gt;10^44 erg/s. on the basis of our analysis, we findno strong evidence for suppressed star formation in lx&gt;10^44 erg/s agns atz=1-3. the mean sfrs of the agns are constant over the broad x-ray luminosityrange of lx~10^43-10^45 erg/s (with mean sfrs consistent with typicalstar-forming galaxies at z~2; &lt;sfrs&gt;~100-200 msol/yr). we suggest that theprevious cdf-n results were likely due to low number statistics. we discuss ourresults in the context of current theoretical models.

1210.5370	physical properties of osiris-rex target asteroid (101955) 1999 rq36  derived from herschel, eso-visir and spitzer observations	in september 2011, the herschel space observatory performed an observationcampaign with the pacs photometer observing the asteroid (101955) 1999 rq36 inthe far infrared. the herschel observations were analysed, together with esovlt-visir and spitzer-irs data, by means of a thermophysical model in order toderive the physical properties of 1999 rq36. we find the asteroid has aneffective diameter in the range 480 to 511 m, a slightly elongated shape with asemi-major axis ratio of a/b=1.04, a geometric albedo of 0.045 +0.015/-0.012,and a retrograde rotation with a spin vector between -70 and -90 deg eclipticlatitude. the thermal emission at wavelengths below 12 micron -originating inthe hot sub-solar region- shows that there may be large variations in roughnesson the surface along the equatorial zone of 1999 rq36, but further measurementsare required for final proof. we determine that the asteroid has adisk-averaged thermal inertia of gamma = 650 jm-2s-0.5k-1 with a 3-sigmaconfidence range of 350 to 950 jm-2s-0.5k-1, equivalent to what is observed for25143 itokawa and suggestive that 1999 rq36 has a similar surface texture andmay also be a rubble-pile in nature. the low albedo indicates that 1999 rq36very likely contains primitive volatile-rich material, consistent with itsspectral type, and that it is an ideal target for the osiris-rex sample returnmission.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1311.0628	herschel celestial calibration sources: four large main-belt asteroids  as prime flux calibrators for the far-ir/sub-mm range	celestial standards play a major role in observational astrophysics. they areneeded to characterise the performance of instruments and are paramount forphotometric calibration. during the herschel calibration asteroid preparatoryprogramme approximately 50 asteroids have been established as far-ir/sub-mm/mmcalibrators for herschel. the selected asteroids fill the flux gap between thesub-mm/mm calibrators mars, uranus and neptune, and the mid-ir brightcalibration stars. all three herschel instruments observed asteroids forvarious calibration purposes, including pointing tests, absolute fluxcalibration, relative spectral response function, observing mode validation,and cross-calibration aspects. here we present newly established models for thefour large and well characterized main-belt asteroids (1) ceres, (2) pallas,(4) vesta, and (21) lutetia which can be considered as new prime fluxcalibrators. the relevant object-specific properties (size, shape,spin-properties, albedo, thermal properties) are well established. the seasonal(distance to sun, distance to observer, phase angle, aspect angle) and dailyvariations (rotation) are included in a new thermophysical model setup forthese targets. the thermophysical model predictions agree within 5% with theavailable (and independently calibrated) herschel measurements. the fourobjects cover the flux regime from just below 1,000 jy (ceres at mid-irn-/q-band) down to fluxes below 0.1 jy (lutetia at the longest wavelengths).based on the comparison with pacs, spire and hifi measurements and pre-herschelexperience, the validity of these new prime calibrators ranges frommid-infrared to about 700 micron, connecting nicely the absolute stellarreference system in the mid-ir with the planet-based calibration at sub-mm/mmwavelengths.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1404.5847	thermal infrared observations of asteroid (99942) apophis with herschel	the near-earth asteroid (99942) apophis is a potentially hazardous asteroid.we obtained far-infrared observations of this asteroid with the herschel spaceobservatory's pacs instrument at 70, 100, and 160 micron. these were taken attwo epochs in january and march 2013 during a close earth encounter. thesefirst thermal measurements of apophis were taken at similar phase angles beforeand after opposition. we performed a detailed thermophysical model analysis byusing the spin and shape model recently derived from applying a 2-periodfourier series method to a large sample of well-calibrated photometricobservations. we find that the tumbling asteroid apophis has an elongated shapewith a mean diameter of 375$^{+14}_{-10}$ m (of an equal volume sphere) and ageometric v-band albedo of 0.30$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. we find a thermal inertia inthe range 250-800 jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$k$^{-1}$ (best solution at 600jm$^{-2}$s$^{-0.5}$k$^{-1}$), which can be explained by a mixture of lowconductivity fine regolith with larger rocks and boulders of high thermalinertia on the surface. the thermal inertia, and other similarities with(25143) itokawa indicate that apophis might also have a rubble-pile structure.if we combine the new size value with the assumption of an itokawa-like densityand porosity we estimate a mass between 4.4 and 6.2 10$^{10}$ kg which is morethan 2-3 times larger than previous estimates. we expect that the newly derivedproperties will influence impact scenario studies and influence the long-termorbit predictions of apophis.

1405.1046	star formation in the massive cluster merger abell 2744	we present a comprehensive study of star-forming (sf) galaxies in the hstfrontier field recent cluster merger a2744 (z=0.308). wide-field,ultraviolet-infrared (uv-ir) imaging enables a direct constraint of the totalstar formation rate (sfr) for 53 cluster galaxies, with sfr{uv+ir}=343+/-10msun/yr. within the central 4 arcmin (1.1 mpc) radius, the integrated sfr iscomplete, yielding a total sfr{uv+ir}=201+/-9 msun/yr. focussing on obscuredstar formation, this core region exhibits a total sfr{ir}=138+/-8 msun/yr, amass-normalised sfr{ir} of sigma{sfr}=11.2+/-0.7 msun/yr per 10^14 msun and afraction of ir-detected sf galaxies f{sf}=0.080(+0.010,-0.037). overall, thecluster population at z~0.3 exhibits significant intrinsic scatter in irproperties (total sfr{ir}, tdust distribution) apparently unrelated to thedynamical state: a2744 is noticeably different to the merging bullet cluster,but similar to several relaxed clusters. however, in a2744 we identify a trailof sf sources including jellyfish galaxies with substantial unobscured sf dueto extreme stripping (sfr{uv}/sfr{ir} up to 3.3). the orientation of the trail,and of material stripped from constituent galaxies, indicates that the passingshock front of the cluster merger was the trigger. constraints on starformation from both ir and uv are crucial for understanding galaxy evolutionwithin the densest environments.

1407.8214	the evolution of galaxy star formation activity in massive halos	there is now a large consensus that the current epoch of the cosmic starformation history (csfh) is dominated by low mass galaxies while the mostactive phase at 1&lt;z&lt;2 is dominated by more massive galaxies, which undergo afaster evolution. massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such asgalaxy groups and clusters. we aim to understand whether the observed "galaxydownsizing" could be interpreted as a "halo downsizing", whereas the mostmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halosof lower mass. thus, we study the contribution to the csfh of galaxiesinhabiting group-sized halos. this is done through the study of the evolutionof the infra-red (ir) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to~1.6. we use a sample of 39 x-ray selected groups in the extended chandra deepfield south (ecdfs), the chandra deep field north (cdfn), and the cosmos field,where the deepest available mid- and far-ir surveys have been conducted withspitzer mips and hersche pacs. groups at low redshift lack the brightest,rarest, and most star forming ir-emitting galaxies observed in the field. theirir-emitting galaxies contribute &lt;10% of the comoving volume density of thewhole ir galaxy population in the local universe. at redshift &gt;~1, the mostir-luminous galaxies (lirgs and ulirgs) are preferentially located in groups,and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .densityanti-correlation observed in the nearby universe. at these redshifts, groupgalaxies contribute 60-80% of the csfh, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.below z~1, the comoving number and sfr densities of ir-emitting galaxies ingroups decline significantly faster than those of all ir-emitting galaxies. ourresults are consistent with a "halo downsizing" scenario and highlight thesignificant role of "environment" quenching in shaping the csfh.

1408.6325	the xmm-lss survey: the class 1 cluster sample over the extended 11  deg$^2$ and its spatial distribution	this paper presents 52 x-ray bright galaxy clusters selected within the 11deg$^2$ xmm-lss survey. 51 of them have spectroscopic redshifts($0.05&lt;z&lt;1.06$), one is identified at $z_{\rm phot}=1.9$, and all together makethe high-purity "class 1" (c1) cluster sample of the xmm-lss, the highestdensity sample of x-ray selected clusters with a monitored selection function.their x-ray fluxes, averaged gas temperatures (median $t_x=2$ kev),luminosities (median $l_{x,500}=5\times10^{43}$ ergs/s) and total massestimates (median $5\times10^{13} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$) are measured, adapting tothe specific signal-to-noise regime of xmm-lss observations. the redshiftdistribution of clusters shows a deficit of sources when compared to thecosmological expectations, regardless of whether wmap-9 or planck-2013 cmbparameters are assumed. this lack of sources is particularly noticeable at $0.4\lesssim z \lesssim 0.9$. however, after quantifying uncertainties due to smallnumber statistics and sample variance we are not able to put firm (i.e. $&gt;3\sigma$) constraints on the presence of a large void in the clusterdistribution. we work out alternative hypotheses and demonstrate that anegative redshift evolution in the normalization of the $l_{x}-t_x$ relation(with respect to a self-similar evolution) is a plausible explanation for theobserved deficit. we confirm this evolutionary trend by directly studying howc1 clusters populate the $l_{x}-t_x-z$ space, properly accounting for selectionbiases. we point out that a systematically evolving, unresolved, centralcomponent in clusters and groups (agn contamination or cool core) can impactthe classification as extended sources and be partly responsible for theobserved redshift distribution.[abridged]

1410.3730	an excess of dusty starbursts related to the spiderweb galaxy	we present apex laboca 870 micron observations of the field around thehigh-redshift radio galaxy mrc1138-262 at z=2.16. we detect 16 submillimetergalaxies in this ~140 square arcmin bolometer map with flux densities in therange 3-11 mjy. the raw number counts indicate a density of submillimetergalaxies (smgs) that is up to four times that of blank field surveys. based onan exquisite multiwavelength database, including vla 1.4 ghz radio and infraredobservations, we investigate whether these sources are members of theprotocluster structure at z=2.2. using herschel pacs+spire and spitzer mipsphotometry, we derive reliable far-infrared photometric redshifts for allsources. follow-up vlt isaac and sinfoni near-infrared spectra confirm thatfour of these smgs have redshifts of z=2.2. we also present evidence thatanother smg in this field, detected earlier at 850 micron, has a counterpartthat exhibits halpha and co(1-0) emission at z=2.15. including the radio galaxyand two smgs with far-ir photometric redshifts at z=2.2, we conclude that atleast eight submm sources are part of the protocluster at z=2.16 associatedwith the radio galaxy mrc1138-262. we measure a star formation rate densitysfrd ~1500 msun yr^-1 mpc^-3, four magnitudes higher than the global sfrd ofblank fields at this redshift. strikingly, these eight sources are concentratedwithin a region of 2 mpc (the typical size of clusters in the local universe)and are distributed within the filaments traced by the halpha emitters atz=2.2. this concentration of massive, dusty starbursts is not centered on thesubmillimeter-bright radio galaxy which could support the infalling of thesesources into the cluster center. approximately half (6/11) of the smgs that arecovered by the halpha imaging data are associated with halpha emitters,demonstrating the potential of tracing smg counterparts with this population(abridged).

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

(1998) we have obtained acceptable and wellconstrained fits to the observed spectral energy distributions (seds) of 41 ofthese sources, for which additional optical/near-infrared magnitudes, and, insome cases, redshifts, were available. we have then determined the totalinfrared luminosities and star formation rates (sfrs) of these 41 sources, ofwhich 27 are cluster members and 14 are field galaxies at a median redshiftz~0.6.  the seds of most of the isocam cluster members are best fit by models withnegligible star formation in the last ~1 gyr. the 7 faintest cluster membershave a slightly higher, but still very mild, star-formation activity. theisocam-selected cluster galaxies appear to be an unbiased subsample of theoverall cluster population. if a2218 is undergoing a merger, as suggested bysome optical and x-ray analyses, then this merger does not seem to affect themid-infrared properties of its galaxies.  the seds of most isocam-selected field sources are best fit by models withsignificant ongoing (and recent) star formation, resembling those of massivestar-forming spirals or (post)starburst galaxies. their median sfr is 22 solarmasses per year. eight of the 14 field sources are luminous ir galaxies.(abridged)

astro-ph;0509022	processing challenges in the xmm-newton slew survey	the great collecting area of the mirrors coupled with the high quantumefficiency of the epic detectors have made xmm-newton the most sensitive x-rayobservatory flown to date. this is particularly evident during slew exposureswhich, while giving only 15 seconds of on-source time, actually constitute a2-10 kev survey ten times deeper than current "all-sky" catalogues. here wereport on progress towards making a catalogue of slew detections constructedfrom the full, 0.2-12 kev energy band and discuss the challenges associatedwith processing the slew data. the fast (90 degrees per hour) slew speedresults in images which are smeared, by different amounts depending on thereadout mode, effectively changing the form of the point spread function. theextremely low background in slew images changes the optimum source searchingcriteria such that searching a single image using the full energy band is seento be more sensitive than splitting the data into discrete energy bands. falsedetections due to optical loading by bright stars, the wings of the psf in verybright sources and single-frame detector flashes are considered and techniquesfor identifying and removing these spurious sources from the final catalogueare outlined. finally, the attitude reconstruction of the satellite during theslewing manoeuver is complex. we discuss the implications of this on thepositional accuracy of the catalogue.

astro-ph;0612340	candidate tidal disruption events from the xmm-newton slew survey	in recent years, giant amplitude x-ray flares have been observed from ahandful of non-active galaxies. the most plausible scenario of these unusualphenomena is tidal disruption of a star by a quiescent supermassive black holeat the centre of the galaxy. comparing the xmm-newton slew survey sourcecatalogue with the rosat pspc all-sky survey five galaxies have been detected afactor of up to 88 brighter in xmm-newton with respect to rosat pspc upperlimits and presenting a soft x-ray colour. x-ray luminosities of these sourcesderived from slew observations have been found in the range 10^41-10^44 ergs^-1, fully consistent with the tidal disruption model. this model predictsthat during the peak of the outburst, flares reach x-ray luminosities up to10^45 erg s^-1, which is close to the eddington luminosity of the black hole,and afterwards a decay of the flux on a time scale of months to years isexpected. multi-wavelength follow-up observations have been performed on thesehighly variable objects in order to disentangle their nature and to investigatetheir dynamical evolution. here we present sources coming from the xmm-newtonslew survey that could fit in the paradigm of tidal disruption events. x-rayand optical observations revealed that two of these objects are in fullagreement with that scenario and three other sources that, showing signs ofoptical activity, need further investigation within the transient galacticnuclei phenomena.
