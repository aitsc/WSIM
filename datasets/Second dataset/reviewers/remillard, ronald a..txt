0901.0031	spectral states of xte j1701-462: link between z and atoll sources	we have analyzed 866 rxte observations of the 2006-2007 outburst of theaccreting neutron star xte j1701-462, during which the source evolves fromsuper-eddington luminosities to quiescence. the x-ray color evolution firstresembles the cyg x-2 subgroup of z sources, with frequent excursions on thehorizontal and normal branches (hb/nb). the source then decays and evolves tothe sco x-1 subgroup, with increasing focus on the flaring branch (fb) and thelower vertex of the "z". finally, the fb subsides, and the source transformsinto an atoll source, with the lower vertex evolving to the atoll soft state.spectral analyses suggest that the atoll stage is characterized by a constantinner disk radius, while the z stages exhibit a luminosity-dependent expansionof the inner disk, which we interpret as effects related to the local eddingtonlimit. contrary to the view that the mass accretion rate ($\dot{m}$) changesalong the z, we find that changes in $\dot{m}$ are instead responsible for thesecular evolution of the z and the subclasses. motion along the z branchesappears to be caused by three different mechanisms that may operate at roughlyconstant $\dot{m}$. for the sco x-1-like z stage, we find that the fb is aninstability track that proceeds off the lower vertex when the inner disk radiusshrinks from the value set by the x-ray luminosity toward the value measuredfor the atoll soft state. excursions up the nb occur when the apparent size ofthe boundary layer increases while the disk exhibits little change. the hb isassociated with comptonization of the disk emission. the z branches for the cygx-2-like stage are more complicated, and their origin is unclear. finally, ourspectral results lead us to hypothesize that the lower and upper z verticescorrespond to a standard thin disk and a slim disk, respectively.

0901.0920	a determination of the spin of the black hole primary in lmc x-1	the first extragalactic x-ray binary, lmc x-1, was discovered in 1969. in the1980s, its compact primary was established as the fourth dynamical black-holecandidate. recently, we published accurate values for the mass of the blackhole and the orbital inclination angle of the binary system. building on theseresults, we have analyzed 53 x-ray spectra obtained by rxte and, using aselected sample of 18 of these spectra, we have determined the dimensionlessspin parameter of the black hole to be a* = 0.92(-0.07,+0.05). this resulttakes into account all sources of observational and model-parameteruncertainties. the standard deviation around the mean value of a* for these 18x-ray spectra, which were obtained over a span of several years, is only 0.02.when we consider our complete sample of 53 rxte spectra, we find a somewhathigher value of the spin parameter and a larger standard deviation. finally, weshow that our results based on rxte data are confirmed by our analyses ofselected x-ray spectra obtained by the xmm-newton, bepposax and ginga missions.

0902.3488	measuring the spins of stellar-mass black holes	in astronomy, the problem of black holes is arguably second in importanceonly to the problem of cosmology. a current frontier in black hole research isthe measurement of spin. during the past three years, the spins of severalstellar-mass black holes in x-ray binaries have been measured via twotechniques: fitting the x-ray continuum spectrum and modeling the profile ofthe fe k line. this fledgling enterprise motivates the following decadal goals:(1) firmly establish the continuum-fitting and fe k methods; obtain precisevalues of spin for 10-20 black holes, several using both methods; (2) use thederived masses and spins to test models of jets, grbs, supernovae, black holeformation, black hole binary evolution, etc.; (3) serve the ixo mission bysecuring the fe k methodology, which is currently the only means to measure thespins of supermassive black holes in agn; (4) identify the correct model ofhigh-frequency qpos, thereby opening a third channel for measuring spin; (5)pursue x-ray polarimetry as a means of securing the continuum-fitting and fe kmethods, and also as a possible fourth avenue to spin; and (6) develop and testmhd models of thin disks in strong gravity. achieving these goals requires theestablishment of an rxte follow-on mission dedicated to the study of bright andtransient compact objects, as well as strong support for theoretical work on 3dmhd simulations of accretion flows in the kerr metric of a spinning black hole.

0902.4238	x-ray timing of stellar mass black holes	x-ray timing observations of accreting stellar mass black holes have shownthat they can produce signals with such short time scales that we must beprobing very close to the innermost stable circular orbit that is predicted bythe theory of general relativity (gr). these signals are quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos), and both the high-frequency variety (hfqpos, which havefrequencies in the 40-450 hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 hz low-frequency typehave the potential to provide tests of gr in the strong field limit. animportant step on the path to gr tests is to constrain the physical black holeproperties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possiblewith x-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black holespins. while current x-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, thehfqpos are weak signals, and future x-ray timing missions with larger effectivearea are required for testing the candidate theoretical qpo mechanisms. anothermain goal in the study of accreting black holes is to understand the productionof relativistic jets. here, we have also made progress during the past decadeby finding clear connections between the radio emission that traces thestrength of the jet and the properties of the x-ray emission. with new radiocapabilities just coming on-line, continuing detailed x-ray studies ofaccreting black holes is crucial for continuing to make progress.

0907.2920	measuring black hole spin via the x-ray continuum fitting method: beyond  the thermal dominant state	all prior work on measuring the spins of stellar-mass black holes via thex-ray continuum-fitting method has relied on the use of weakly-comptonizedspectra obtained in the thermal dominant state. using a self-consistentcomptonization model, we show that one can analyze spectra that exhibit strongpower-law components and obtain values of the inner disk radius, and hencespin, that are consistent with those obtained in the thermal dominant state.specifically, we analyze many rxte spectra of two black hole transients,h1743-322 and xte j1550-564, and we demonstrate that the radius of the inneredge of the accretion disk remains constant to within a few percent as thestrength of the comptonized component increases by an order of magnitude, i.e.,as the fraction of the thermal seed photons that are scattered approaches 25%.we conclude that the continuum-fitting method can be applied to a much widerbody of data than previously thought possible, and to sources that have neverbeen observed to enter the thermal dominant state (e.g., cyg x-1).

1006.5168	suzaku and bepposax x-ray spectra of the persistently accreting  neutron-star binary 4u 1705-44	we present an analysis of the broad-band spectra of 4u~1705--44 obtained with{\it suzaku} in 2006--2008 and by {\it bepposax} in 2000. the source exhibitstwo distinct states: the hard state shows emission from 1 to 150 kev, while thesoft state is mostly confined to be $&lt;40$ kev. we model soft-state continuumspectra with two thermal components, one of which is a multicolor accretiondisk and the other is a single-temperature blackbody to describe the boundarylayer, with additional weak comptonization represented by either a simple powerlaw or the simpl model by steiner et al. the hard-state continuum spectra aremodeled by a single-temperature blackbody for the boundary layer plus strongcomptonization, modeled by a cutoff power law. while we are unable to draw firmconclusions about the physical properties of the disk in the hard state, theaccretion disk in the soft state appears to approximately follow $l\proptot^{3.2}$. the deviation from $l\propto t^4$, as expected from a constant innerdisk radius, might be caused by a luminosity-dependent spectral hardeningfactor and/or real changes of the inner disk radius in some part of the softstate. the boundary layer apparent emission area is roughly constant from thehard to the soft states, with a value of about 1/11 of the neutron starsurface. the magnetic field on the surface of the ns in 4u~1705--44 isestimated to be less than about $1.9\times 10^8$ g, assuming that the disk istruncated by the isco or by the neutron star surface. broad relativistic felines are detected in most spectra and are modeled with the diskline model. thestrength of the fe lines is found to correlate well with the boundary layeremission in the soft state. in the hard state, the fe lines are probably due toillumination of the accretion disk by the strong comptonization emission.

1311.1198	discovery of a highly variable dipping ultraluminous x-ray source in m94	we report the discovery of a new ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) 2xmmj125048.6+410743 within the spiral galaxy m94. the source has been observed byrosat, chandra, and xmm-newton on several occasions, exhibiting as a highlyvariable persistent source or a recurrent transient with a flux variationfactor of &gt;100, a high duty cycle (at least ~70%), and a peak luminosity of lx~ 2x10^{39} erg/s (0.2-10 kev, absorbed). in the brightest observation, thesource is similar to typical low-luminosity ulxs, with the spectrum showing ahigh-energy cutoff but harder than that from a standard accretion disk. thereare also sporadical short dips, accompanied by spectral softening. in a fainterobservation with lx ~ 3.6x10^{38} erg/s, the source appears softer and isprobably in the thermal state seen in galactic black-hole x-ray binaries(bhbs). in an even fainter observation (lx ~ 9x10^{37} erg/s), the spectrum isharder again, and the source might be in the steep-powerlaw state or the hardstate of bhbs. in this observation, the light curve might exhibit ~7 hr(quasi-)periodic large modulations over two cycles. the source also has apossible point-like optical counterpart from hst images. in terms of the colorsand the luminosity, the counterpart is probably a g8 supergiant or a compactred globular cluster containing ~2x10^5 k dwarfs, with some possible weak uvexcess that might be ascribed to accretion activity. thus our source is acandidate stellar-mass bhb with a supergiant companion or with a dwarfcompanion residing in a globular cluster. our study supports that somelow-luminosity ulxs are supercritically accreting stellar-mass bhbs.

1401.5529	modeling the optical-x-ray accretion lag in lmc x-3: insights into  black-hole accretion physics	the x-ray persistence and characteristically soft spectrum of the black holex-ray binary lmc x-3 make this source a touchstone for penetrating studies ofaccretion physics. we analyze a rich, 10-year collection of optical/infrared(oir) time-series data in conjunction with all available contemporaneous x-raydata collected by the asm and pca detectors aboard the rossi x-ray timingexplorer. a cross-correlation analysis reveals an x-ray lag of ~2 weeks.motivated by this result, we develop a model that reproduces the complex oirlight curves of lmc x-3. the model is comprised of three components ofemission: stellar light; accretion luminosity from the outer disk inferred fromthe time-lagged x-ray emission; and light from the x-ray-heated star and outerdisk. using the model, we filter a strong noise component out of theellipsoidal light curves and derive an improved orbital period for the system.concerning accretion physics, we find that the local viscous timescale in thedisk increases with the local mass accretion rate; this in turn implies thatthe viscosity parameter alpha decreases with increasing luminosity. finally, wefind that x-ray heating is a strong function of x-ray luminosity below ~50% ofthe eddington limit, while above this limit x-ray heating is heavilysuppressed. we ascribe this behavior to the strong dependence of the flaring inthe disk upon x-ray luminosity, concluding that for luminosities above ~50% ofeddington, the star lies fully in the shadow of the disk.

1506.05447	the megasecond chandra x-ray visionary project observation of ngc 3115  (iii): luminosity functions of lmxbs and dependence on stellar environments	we have studied the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) in the nearby lenticular galaxy ngc 3115, using the megasecondchandra x-ray visionary project observation. with a total exposure time of ~1.1ms, we constructed the xlf down to a limiting luminosity of ~10^36 erg/s, muchdeeper than typically reached for other early-type galaxies. we foundsignificant flattening of the overall lmxb xlf from dn/dl \proptol^{-2.2\pm0.4} above 5.5x10^37 erg/s to dn/dl \propto l^{-1.0\pm0.1} below it,though we could not rule out a fit with a higher break at ~1.6x10^38 erg/s. wealso found evidence that the xlf of lmxbs in globular clusters (gcs) is overallflatter than that of field lmxbs. thus our results for this galaxy do notsupport the idea that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. the xlf of field lmxbs seemsto show spatial variation, with the xlf in the inner region of the galaxy beingflatter than that in the outer region, probably due to contamination of lmxbsfrom undetected and/or disrupted gcs in the inner region. the xlf in the outerregion is probably the xlf of primordial field lmxbs, exhibiting dn/dl \proptol^{-1.2\pm0.1} up to a break close to the eddington limit of neutron star lmxbs(~1.7x10^38 erg/s). the break of the gc lmxb xlf is lower, at ~1.1x10^37 erg/s.we also confirm previous findings that the metal-rich/red gcs are more likelyto host lmxbs than the metal-poor/blue gcs, which is more significant for moreluminous lmxbs, and that more massive gcs are more likely to host lmxbs.

1508.02761	on the geometric nature of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in  neutron-star low-mass x-ray binaries	we report on a detailed analysis of the so-called ~1 hz quasi-periodicoscillation (qpo) in the eclipsing and dipping neutron-star low-mass x-raybinary exo 0748-676. this type of qpo has previously been shown to have ageometric origin. our study focuses on the evolution of the qpo as the sourcemoves through the color-color diagram, in which it traces out anatoll-source-like track. the qpo frequency increases from ~0.4 hz in the hardstate to ~25 hz as the source approaches the soft state. combining powerspectra based on qpo frequency reveals additional features that stronglyresemble those seen in non-dipping/eclipsing atoll sources. we show that thelow-frequency qpos in atoll sources and the ~1 hz qpo in exo 0748-676 followsimilar relations with respect to the noise components in their power spectra.we conclude that the frequencies of both types of qpos are likely set by (thesame) precession of a misaligned inner accretion disk. for high-inclinationsystems, like exo 0748-676, this results in modulations of the neutron-staremission due to obscuration or scattering, while for lower-inclination systemsthe modulations likely arise from relativistic doppler boosting andlight-bending effects.

(1999, 2000).during the first 60 days of the observed optical re-flare, we find nocorrespondence between the thermal component of the x-rays often associatedwith a disk and the optical flux -- the former remains essentially flat whereasthe latter declines exponentially and exhibits three substantial dips. however,the power law flux is anti-correlated with the optical dips, suggesting thatthe optical flux may by up-scattered into the x-ray by the hot corona. periodicmodulations were discovered during the final stage of the outburst (may tojune), with p=1.546+/-0.038 days, and during quiescence (july and august), withp=1.540+/-0.008 days. the analysis of the combined data set reveals a strongsignal for a unique period at p=1.541+/-0.009 days, which we believe to be theorbital period.

astro-ph;0202305	evidence for harmonic relationships in the high frequency qpos of xte  j1550-564 and gro j1655-40	we continue to investigate the x-ray timing and spectral properties of theblack hole binary, xte j1550-564. for three different groups of observations,we show evidence that two high-frequency qpos (hfqpos) occur simultaneouslynear 184 and 276 hz. in one group, there is also evidence of a broad feature at92 hz. in each case, we can model the qpo profiles while assuming that thecentral frequencies are related as integral harmonics of a single frequency. wenext investigate the x-ray energy spectra, and we find a systematic increase inthe strength of the power-law component as the stronger of the two hfqposshifts from 276 to 184 hz. a strikingly similar result is seen for gro j1655-40when the stronger hfqpo shifts from 450 to 300 hz. the fundamental hfqpofrequencies for the two x-ray sources scale inversely with black hole mass,which is consistent with the hypotheses that these hfqpos represent someoscillation rooted in general relativity (gr) and that the two black holes havesimilar values of the dimensionless spin parameter. we discuss physicalmechanisms that may explain these hfqpos. in particular, a resonance betweenthe orbital and radial coordinate frequencies in the innner accretion disk, asproposed by abramowicz &amp; kluzniak, would imply moderate values for thedimensionless spin parameter (0.1 &lt; a &lt; 0.6) for both black holes.

astro-ph;0402012	the importance of discovering a 3:2 twin-peak qpo in a ulx or how to  solve the puzzle of intermediate mass black holes	recently, twin-peak qpos have been observed in a 3:2 ratio for three galacticblack-hole microquasars with frequencies that have been shown to scale as 1/m,as expected for general relativisitic motion near a black hole. it may bepossible to extend this result to distinguish between the following twodisparate models that have been proposed for the puzzling ultraluminous x-raysources (ulxs): (1) an intermediate-mass black hole m ~1000 solar mass)radiating very near the eddington limit and (2) a conventional black hole (m ~10 solar mass) accreting at a highly super-eddington rate with its emissionbeamed along the rotation axis. we suggest that it may be possible todistinguish between these models by detecting the counterpart of a galactictwin-peak qpo in a ulx: the expected frequency for the intermediate-mass blackhole model is only about 1 hz, whereas, for the conventional black hole modelthe expected frequency would be the ~100 hz value observed for the galacticmicroquasars.

astro-ph;0404343	orbital parameters for the black hole binary xte j1650-500	(shortened) we present r-band photometry of the x-ray transient and candidateblack hole binary xte j1650-500 obtained between 2003 may and august with the6.5m clay telescope. a timing analysis of these data reveals a photometricperiod of 0.3205 +/- 0.0007 days (i.e. 7.63 hr) with a possible alias at 0.3785days (9.12 hr). our photometry completely rules out the previously publishedspectroscopic period of 0.212 days (5.09 hr). consequently, we reanalyzed the15 archival eso/vlt spectra (obtained 2002 june by sanchez-fernandez et al.)that were the basis of the previously published spectroscopic period. we used a``restframe search'' technique that is well suited for cases when thesignal-to-noise ratio of individual spectra is low. the results confirmed thephotometric period of 0.3205 days, and rule out the alias period near 0.38days. the best value for the velocity semiamplitude of the companion star isk_2 = 435 +/- 30 km/sec, and the corresponding optical mass function is f(m) =2.73 +/- 0.56 solar masses. the amplitude of the phased r-band light curve is0.2 magnitudes, which gives a lower limit to the inclination of 50 +/- 3degrees in the limiting case of no contribution to the r-band light curve fromthe accretion disk. if the mass ratio of xte j1650-500 is similar to the massratios of other black hole binaries like a0620-00 or grs 1124-683 (e.g. q &gt;~10), then our lower limit to the inclination gives an upper limit to the massof the black hole in xte j1650-500 of m_1 &lt;~ 7.3 solar masses. however, themass can be considerably lower if the r-band flux is dominated by the accretiondisk. for example, if the accretion disk does contribute 80% of the flux, asour preliminary results suggest, then the black hole mass would be only about 4solar masses.

($4.1\sigma$; 3--35 kev); and (2) a second group with lower 7-35 kev count rates (26intervals) produced an average pds with a qpo at $242 \pm 3$ hz ($6.0 \sigma$;7--35 kev). the ratio of these two frequencies is $1.46 \pm 0.05$. this findingis consistent with results obtained for three other black hole systems thatexhibit commensurate hfqpos in a 3:2 ratio. furthermore, the occurrence ofh1743-322's slower hfqpo at times of higher x-ray luminosity closely resemblesthe behavior of xte j1550-564 and gro j1655-40. we discuss our results in termsof a resonance model that invokes frequencies set by general relativity fororbital motions near a black-hole event horizon.

astro-ph;0606076	the spin of the near-extreme kerr black hole grs 1915+105	based on a spectral analysis of the x-ray continuum that employs a fullyrelativistic accretion-disk model, we conclude that the compact primary of thebinary x-ray source grs 1915+105 is a rapidly-rotating kerr black hole. we finda lower limit on the dimensionless spin parameter of a* greater than 0.98. ourresult is robust in the sense that it is independent of the details of the dataanalysis and insensitive to the uncertainties in the mass and distance of theblack hole. furthermore, our accretion-disk model includes an advancedtreatment of spectral hardening. our data selection relies on a rigorous andquantitative definition of the thermal state of black hole binaries, which weused to screen all of the available rxte and asca data for the thermal state ofgrs 1915+105. in addition, we focus on those data for which the accretion diskluminosity is less than 30% of the eddington luminosity. we argue that theselow-luminosity data are most appropriate for the thin alpha-disk model that weemploy. we assume that there is zero torque at the inner edge of the disk, asis likely when the disk is thin, although we show that the presence of asignificant torque does not affect our results. our model and the model of therelativistic jets observed for this source constrain the distance and blackhole mass and could thus be tested by determining a vlba parallax distance andimproving the measurement of the mass function. finally, we comment on thesignificance of our results for relativistic-jet and core-collapse models, andfor the detection of gravitational waves.
