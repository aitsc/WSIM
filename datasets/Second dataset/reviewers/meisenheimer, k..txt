0904.3066	barred galaxies in the abell 901/2 supercluster with stages	we present a study of bar and host disk evolution in a dense clusterenvironment, based on a sample of ~800 bright (mv &lt;= -18) galaxies in the abell901/2 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w imaging from the stagessurvey, and data from spitzer, xmm-newton, and combo-17. we identify andcharacterize bars through ellipse-fitting, and other morphological featuresthrough visual classification. (1) we explore three commonly used methods forselecting disk galaxies. we find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,via visual classification, a single component s'ersic cut (n &lt;= 2.5), and ablue-cloud cut. in cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) for moderately inclineddisks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical barfraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appearto have no significant bulge component. within a given absolute magnitude bin,f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge asopposed to those with bulges. for a given morphological class, f_bar-opt risesat higher luminosities. (4) for bright early-types, as well as faint late-typesystems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the abell 901/2clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxiesat lower redshifts (5) between the core and the virial radius of the cluster atintermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appearto depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by afactor of ~1.3. we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution ofbars and disks in dense environments.

0707.0177	resolving the innermost parsec of centaurus a at mid-infrared  wavelengths	we report the results of interferometric observations of centaurus a with themid-infrared interferometer (midi) at eso's vlti telescope array. theinterferometric measurements are spectrally resolved (r = 30) in the wavelengthrange 8 to 13 micron. their spatial resolution reaches 15 mas at the shortestwavelengths. supplementary observations were obtained in the near-infrared withthe adaptive optics instrument naco, and at mm wavelengths with sest and jcmt.we find that he mid-infrared emission from the core of centaurus a is dominatedby an unresolved point source (&lt;10 mas). observations with baselines orientatedperpendicular to the radio jet reveal an extended component which can beinterpreted as a geometrically thin, dusty disk, the axis of which is alignedwith the radio jet. its diameter is about 0.6 pc. we argue, that the unresolvedemission is dominated by a synchrotron source. its overall spectrum ischaracterized by a \nu^{-0.36} power-law which cuts off exponentially towardshigh frequencies at 8x10^{13} hz and becomes optically thick at \nu &lt; 45 ghz.based on a synchrotron self compton (ssc) interpretation for the gamma-rayemission, we find a magnetic field strength of 26 microtesla and a maximumenergy of relativistic electrons of \gamma_c = e_c/m_e c^2 = 8500. near\gamma_c, the acceleration time scale is 4 days, in good agreement with thefastest x-ray variations. our ssc model argues for an upper limit for the bulklorentz factor &lt; 2.5, at variance with the concept of a "mis-directed bl lacobject". we estimate a thermal core luminosity of 1.3x10^{34} w, intermediatebetween the values for highly efficiently accreting agn (e.g. seyfert galaxies)and those of typical fr i radio galaxies.

0707.1517	environmental dependence of agn activity in the supercluster a901/2	we present xmm data for the supercluster a901/2, at z ~ 0.17, which iscombined with deep imaging and 17-band photometric redshifts (from the combo-17survey), 2df spectra and spitzer 24um data, to identify agn in thesupercluster. the 90ksec xmm image contains 139 point sources, of which 11 areidentified as supercluster agn with l_x(0.5-7.5kev) &gt; 1.7x10^41 erg/cm2/s. thehost galaxies have m_r &lt; -20 and only 2 of 8 sources with spectra could havebeen identified as agn by the detected optical emission lines. using a largesample of 795 supercluster galaxies we define control samples of massivegalaxies with no detected agn. the local environments of the agn and controlsamples differ at &gt;98 per cent significance. the agn host galaxies liepredominantly in areas of moderate projected galaxy density and with more localblue galaxies than the control sample, with the exception of one very brighttype i agn very near the centre of a cluster. these environments are similarto, but not limited to, cluster outskirts and blue groups. despite the largenumber of potential host galaxies, no agn are found in regions with the highestgalaxy density (excluding some cluster cores where emission from the icmobscures moderate luminosity agn). agn are also absent from the areas withlowest galaxy density. we conclude that the prevalence of cluster agn is linkedto their environment.

0910.3771	the spectral energy distribution of the central parsecs of the nearest  agn	spectral energy distributions (seds) of the central few tens of parsec regionof some of the nearest, most well studied, active galactic nuclei (agn) arepresented. these genuine agn-core seds, mostly from seyfert galaxies, arecharacterised by two main features: an ir bump with the maximum in the 2-10micron range, and an increasing x-ray spectrum in the 1 to ~200 kev region.these dominant features are common to seyfert type 1 and 2 objects alike. type2 agn exhibit a sharp drop shortward of 2 micron, with the optical to uv regionbeing fully absorbed, while type 1s show instead a gentle 2 micron drop ensuedby a secondary, partially-absorbed optical to uv emission bump. assuming thebulk of optical to uv photons generated in these agn are reprocessed by dustand re-emitted in the ir in an isotropic manner, the ir bump luminosityrepresents &gt;70% of the total energy output in these objects while the highenergies above 20 kev are the second energetically important contribution.  galaxies selected by their warm ir colours, i.e. presenting a relatively-flatflux distribution in the 12 to 60 micron range have often being classified asagn. the results from these high spatial resolution seds question thiscriterion as a general rule. it is found that the intrinsic shape of the ir sedof an agn and inferred bolometric luminosity largely depart from those derivedfrom large aperture data. agn luminosities can be overestimated by up to twoorders of magnitude if relying on ir satellite data. we find these differencesto be critical for agn luminosities below or about 10^{44} erg/s. above thislimit, agns tend to dominate the light of their host galaxy regardless of theaperture size used. we tentatively mark this luminosity as a threshold toidentify galaxy-light- vs agn- dominated objects.

0910.5718	interacting galaxies in the a901/902 supercluster with stages	we present a study of galaxy mergers and the influence of environment in theabell 901/902 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w data from thestages survey, combo-17, spitzer 24um, and xmm-newton x-ray data. our analysisutilizes both a visual classification system, and quantitative cas parametersto identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of massratio &gt;1/10. our results are: (1) after visual classification and minimizingthe contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fractionf_merge is 0.023+/-0.007. the estimated fractions of likely major mergers,likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01+/-0.004, 0.006+/-0.003, and0.007+/-0.003, respectively. (2) the mergers lie outside the cluster core ofradius r &lt; 0.25 mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the largegalaxy velocity dispersion in the core. mergers populate the region (0.25 mpc &lt;r &lt;= 2 mpc) between the core and outskirt. in this region, the estimatedfrequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities.this suggests ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and fieldgalaxies. (3) we compare our observed merger fraction with those reported inother clusters and groups out to z~0.4. existing data points on the mergerfraction for l&lt;= l* galaxies in clusters allow for a range of evolutionaryscenarios. (4) the fraction of mergers, which lie on the blue cloud is80%+/-18% versus 34%+/-7% for non-interacting galaxies, implying thatinteracting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) the average sfr, based on uvor uv+ir data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 to 2 in mergers compared tonon-interacting galaxies. however, mergers in the clusters contribute only asmall fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total sfr density.(abridged)

0911.0005	observational constraints on the co-evolution of supermassive black  holes and galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) and black hole accretion rate (bhar) functionsare measured to be proportional to each other at z &lt; ~3. this closecorrespondence between sf and bha would naturally yield a bh mass-galaxy masscorrelation, whereas a bh mass-bulge mass correlation is observed. to explorethis apparent contradiction we study the sf in spheroid-dominated galaxiesbetween z=1 and the present day. we use 903 galaxies from the combo-17 surveywith m* &gt;2x10^10m_sun, ultraviolet and infrared-derived sfrs from spitzer andgalex, and morphologies from gems hst/acs imaging. using stacking techniques,we find that &lt;25% of all sf occurs in spheroid-dominated galaxies (sersic indexn&gt;2.5), while the bhar that we would expect if the global scalings held isthree times higher. this rules out the simplest picture of co-evolution, inwhich sf and bha trace each other at all times. these results could beexplained if sf and bha occur in the same events, but offset in time, forexample at different stages of a merger event. however, one would then expectto see the corresponding star formation activity in early-stage mergers, inconflict with observations. we conclude that the major episodes of sf and bhaoccur in different events, with the bulk of sf happening in isolated disks andmost bha occurring in major mergers. the apparent global co-evolution resultsfrom the regulation of the bh growth by the potential well of the galacticspheroid, which includes a major contribution from disrupted disk stars.

0911.0704	relating basic properties of bright early-type dwarf galaxies to their  location in abell 901/902	we present a study of the population of bright early-type dwarf galaxies inthe multiple-cluster system abell 901/902. we use data from the stages surveyand combo-17 to investigate the relation between the color and structuralproperties of the dwarfs and their location in the cluster. the definition ofthe dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includesgalaxies in the luminosity range -16 &gt;= m_b &gt;~-19 mag. using a fit to the colormagnitude relation of the dwarfs, our sample is divided into a red and bluesubsample. we find a color-density relation in the projected radialdistribution of the dwarf sample: at the same luminosity dwarfs with reddercolors are located closer to the cluster centers than their bluer counterparts.furthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than thebluer dwarfs. these findings are consistent with theoretical expectationsassuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformedlate-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. this indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarfelliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processesrelated to interactions with their host cluster.

0911.5641	obscuring and feeding supermassive black holes with evolving nuclear  star clusters	recently, high resolution observations with the help of the near-infraredadaptive optics integral field spectrograph sinfoni at the vlt proved theexistence of massive and young nuclear star clusters in the centres of a sampleof seyfert galaxies. with the help of high resolution hydrodynamicalsimulations with the pluto-code, we follow the evolution of such clusters,especially focusing on mass and energy feedback from young stars. this leads toa filamentary inflow of gas on large scales (tens of parsec), whereas aturbulent and very dense disc builds up on the parsec scale. here, weconcentrate on the long-term evolution of the nuclear disc in ngc 1068 with thehelp of an effective viscous disc model, using the mass input from the largescale simulations and accounting for star formation in the disc. this two-stagemodelling enables us to connect the tens of parsec scale region (observablewith sinfoni) with the parsec scale environment (midi observations). at thecurrent age of the nuclear star cluster, our simulations predict disc sizes ofthe order of 0.8 to 0.9 pc, gas masses of 1.0e6 msun and mass transfer ratesthrough the inner boundary of 0.025 msun/yr in good agreement with valuesderived from observations.

1002.1067	barred disks in dense environments	we investigate the properties of bright (mv &lt;= -18) barred and unbarred disksin the abell 901/902 cluster system at z~0.165 with the stages hst acs survey.to identify and characterize bars, we use ellipse-fitting. we use visualclassification, a sersic cut, and a color cut to select disk galaxies, and findthat the latter two methods miss 31% and 51%, respectively of disk galaxiesidentified through visual classification. this underscores the importance ofcarefully selecting the disk sample in cluster environments. however, we findthat the global optical bar fraction in the clusters is ~30% regardless of themethod of disk selection. we study the relationship of the optical bar fractionto host galaxy properties, and find that the optical bar fraction dependsstrongly on the luminosity of the galaxy and whether it hosts a prominent bulgeor is bulgeless. within a given absolute magnitude bin, the optical barfraction increases for galaxies with no significant bulge component. withineach morphological type bin, the optical bar fraction increases for brightergalaxies. we find no strong trend (variations larger than a factor of 1.3) forthe optical bar fraction with local density within the cluster between the coreand virial radius (r ~ 0.25 to 1.2 mpc). we discuss the implications of ourresults for the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments.

1005.5016	herschel/pacs far-infrared photometry of two z&gt;4 quasars	we present herschel far-infrared (fir) observations of two sub-mm brightquasars at high redshift: sdss j1148+5251 (z=6.42) and br 1202-0725 (z=4.69)obtained with the pacs instrument. both objects are detected in the pacsphotometric bands. the herschel measurements provide additional data pointsthat constrain the fir spectral energy distributions (seds) of both sources,and they emphasise a broad range of dust temperatures in these objects. forlambda_rest ~&lt; 20mu, the two seds are very similar to the average seds ofquasars at low redshift. in the fir, however, both quasars show excess emissioncompared to low-z qso templates, most likely from cold dust powered by vigorousstar formation in the qso host galaxies. for sdss j1148+5251 we detect anotherobject at 160mu with a distance of ~10 arcseconds from the qso. although nophysical connection between the quasar and this object can be shown with theavailable data, it could potentially confuse low-resolution measurements, thusresulting in an overestimate of the fir luminosity of the z=6.42 quasar.

0709.0209	resolving the complex structure of the dust torus in the active nucleus  of the circinus galaxy	to test the dust torus model for active galactic nuclei directly, we studythe extent and morphology of the nuclear dust distribution in the circinusgalaxy using high resolution interferometric observations in the mid-infraredwith the midi instrument at the very large telescope interferometer. we findthat the dust distribution in the nucleus of circinus can be explained by twocomponents, a dense and warm disk-like component of 0.4 pc size and a slightlycooler, geometrically thick torus component with a size of 2.0 pc. the diskcomponent is oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow andseems to show the silicate feature at 10 micron in emission. it coincides witha nuclear maser disk in orientation and size. from the energy needed to heatthe dust, we infer a luminosity of the accretion disk corresponding to 20% ofthe eddington luminosity of the nuclear black hole. we find that theinterferometric data are inconsistent with a simple, smooth and axisymmetricdust emission. the irregular behaviour of the visibilities and the shallowdecrease of the dust temperature with radius provide strong evidence for aclumpy or filamentary dust structure. we see no evidence for dust reprocessing,as the silicate absorption profile is consistent with that of standard galacticdust. we argue that the collimation of the ionising radiation must originate inthe geometrically thick torus component. our findings confirm the presence of ageometrically thick, torus-like dust distribution in the nucleus of circinus,as required in unified schemes of seyfert galaxies. several aspects of our datarequire that this torus is irregular, or "clumpy".

1109.1333	the properties of the brightest lyman alpha emitters at z~5.7	(abridged) we use deep vlt optical and near-ir spectroscopy and deepspitzer/irac imaging to examine the properties of two of the most luminouslyman alpha emitters at z=5.7. the continuum red-ward of the lyman alpha lineis clearly detected in both objects, thus facilitating a relatively accuratemeasurement (10--20% uncertainties) of the observed rest-frame equivalentwidths, which are around 160 angstroms for both objects. through detailedmodelling of the profile of the lyman alpha line with a 3-d monte-carloradiative transfer code, we estimate the intrinsic rest-frame equivalent widthof lyman alpha and find values that are around 300 angstroms, which is at theupper end of the range allowed for very young, moderately metal-poorstar-forming galaxies. however, the uncertainties are large and values as highas 700 angstroms are permitted by the data. both lyman alpha emitters aredetected at 3.6 micron in deep images taken with the spitzer space telescope.we use these measurements, the measurement of the continuum red-ward of lymanalpha and other photometry to constrain the spectral energy distributions ofthese very luminous lyman alpha emitters and to compare them to three similarlyman alpha emitters from the literature. the contribution from nebularemission is included in our models: excluding it results in significantlyhigher masses. evidence for dust is found in all objects, and emission fromnebular lines often make a dominant contribution to the rest frame 3.6 micronflux. rich in emission lines, these objects are prime targets for the nextgeneration of extremely large telescopes, jwst and alma.

1201.4773	the dust emission of high-redshift quasars	the detection of powerful near-infrared emission in high redshift (z&gt;5)quasars demonstrates that very hot dust is present close to the active nucleusalso in the very early universe. a number of high-redshift objects even showsignificant excess emission in the rest frame nir over more local agn spectralenergy distribution (sed) templates. in order to test if this is a result ofthe very high luminosities and redshifts, we construct mean seds from thelatest sdss quasar catalogue in combination with mir data from the wisepreliminary data release for several redshift and luminosity bins. comparingthese mean seds with a large sample of z&gt;5 quasars we could not identify anysignificant trends of the nir spectral slope with luminosity or redshift in theregime 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 and 10^45 &lt; nul_nu(1350aa) &lt; 10^47 erg/s. in addition to thenir regime, our combined herschel and spitzer photometry provides full infraredsed coverage of the same sample of z&gt;5 quasars. these observations revealstrong fir emission (l_fir &gt; 10^13 l_sun) in seven objects, possibly indicatingstar-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year. the fir excessemission has unusally high temperatures (t ~ 65 k) which is in contrast to thetemperature typically expected from studies at lower redshift (t ~ 45 k). theseobjects are currently being investigated in more detail.

1204.2823	the complexity of parsec-scaled dusty tori in agn	warm gas and dust surround the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei(agn). they provide the material for accretion onto the super-massive blackhole and they are held responsible for the orientation-dependent obscuration ofthe central engine. the agn-heated dust distributions turn out to be verycompact with sizes on scales of about a parsec in the mid-infrared. onlyinfrared interferometry currently provides the necessary angular resolution todirectly study the physical properties of this dust. size estimates for thedust distributions derived from interferometric observations can be used toconstruct a size--luminosity relation for the dust distributions. the largescatter about this relation suggests significant differences between the dusttori in the individual galaxies, even for nuclei of the same class of objectsand with similar luminosities. this questions the simple picture of the samedusty doughnut in all agn. the circinus galaxy is the closest seyfert 2 galaxy.because its mid-infrared emission is well resolved interferometrically, it is aprime target for detailed studies of its nuclear dust distribution. anextensive new interferometric data set was obtained for this galaxy. it showsthat the dust emission comes from a very dense, disk-like structure which issurrounded by a geometrically thick, similarly warm dust distribution as wellas significant amounts of warm dust within the ionisation cone.

1206.4263	the vista deep extragalactic observations (video) survey	in this paper we describe the first data release of the the visible andinfrared survey telescope for astronomy (vista) deep extragalactic observations(video) survey. video is a ~12degree^2 survey in the near-infrared z,y,j,h andk_s bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and largestructures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from thepresent day out to z=4, and active galactic nuclei (agn) and the most massivegalaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. with its depth and area,video will be able to fully explore the period in the universe where agn andstarburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters werebeginning to virialize. video therefore offers a unique data set with which toinvestigate the interplay between agn, starbursts and environment, and the roleof feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial.  we provide data over the video-xmm3 tile, which also covers thecanada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey deep-1 field (cfhtls-d1). thereleased video data reach a 5-sigma ab-magnitude depth of z=25.7, y=24.5,j=24.4, h=24.1 and k_s=23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth ofy=24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases).the data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find goodastrometric agreement with the two-micron all sky survey, and source counts inagreement with the recently released ultravista survey data. the addition ofthe video data to the cfhtls-d1 optical data increases the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophicoutliers over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absenceof an i-band luminosity prior.

1305.3999	complete infrared spectral energy distributions of mm detected quasars  at z&gt;5	we present herschel far-infrared (fir) photometry of eleven quasars atredshift z&gt;5 that have previously been detected at 1.2mm. we perform fullspectral energy distribution (sed) fits over the wavelength range lambda_rest~0.1-400mu for those objects with good herschel detections. these fits revealthe need for an additional far-infrared (fir) component besides the emissionfrom a dusty agn-powered torus. this additional fir component has temperaturesof t_fir ~ 40-60k with luminosities of l_(8-1000mu) ~ 10^13 l_sun (accountingfor 25-60% of the bolometric fir luminosity). if the fir dust emission is dueto star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solarmasses per year. we show that at long wavelengths (lambda_rest &gt; 50mu) thecontribution of the agn-powered torus emission is negligible. this explains howprevious fir studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single componentfits to (ground-based) observations at lambda_obs &gt; 350mu reached t_fir andl_fir values similar to our complete sed fits. stacking the herschel data offour individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal inthe pacs bands but not in spire. the average sed of sources with individualherschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared emissionwhen compared to common agn templates. the comparison between two average seds(sources with and without individual herschel detections) matched in theuv/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the mir emissionmay correlate with the strength of the fir emission.

1312.4534	the dusty torus in the circinus galaxy: a dense disk and the torus  funnel	(abridged) with infrared interferometry it is possible to resolve the nucleardust distributions that are commonly associated with the dusty torus in activegalactic nuclei (agn). the circinus galaxy hosts the closest seyfert 2 nucleusand previous interferometric observations have shown that its nuclear dustemission is well resolved.  to better constrain the dust morphology in this active nucleus, extensive newobservations were carried out with midi at the very large telescopeinterferometer.  the emission is distributed in two distinct components: a disk-like emissioncomponent with a size of ~ 0.2 $\times$ 1.1 pc and an extended component with asize of ~ 0.8 $\times$ 1.9 pc. the disk-like component is elongated along pa ~46{\deg} and oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow. theextended component is elongated along pa ~ 107{\deg}, roughly perpendicular tothe disk component and thus in polar direction. it is interpreted as emissionfrom the inner funnel of an extended dust distribution and shows a strongincrease in the extinction towards the south-east. we find no evidence of anincrease in the temperature of the dust towards the centre. from this we inferthat most of the near-infrared emission probably comes from parsec scales aswell. we further argue that the disk component alone is not sufficient toprovide the necessary obscuration and collimation of the ionising radiation andoutflow. the material responsible for this must instead be located on scales of~ 1 pc, surrounding the disk.  the clear separation of the dust emission into a disk-like emitter and apolar elongated source will require an adaptation of our current understandingof the dust emission in agn. the lack of any evidence of an increase in thedust temperature towards the centre poses a challenge for the picture of acentrally heated dust distribution.

0802.2604	three-dimensional radiative transfer models of clumpy tori in seyfert  galaxies	tori of active galactic nuclei are made up of a mixture of hot and cold gas,as well as dust. in order to protect the dust grains from destruction by thehot gas as well as by the energetic radiation of the accretion disk, the dustis often assumed to be distributed in clouds. in our new 3d model of agn dusttori, the torus is modelled as a wedge-shaped disk in which dusty clouds arerandomly distributed, by taking the dust density distribution of thecorresponding continuous model into account. we especially concentrate on thedifferences between clumpy and continuous models in terms of the temperaturedistributions, the surface brightness distributions and interferometricvisibilities, as well as spectral energy distributions. to this end, we employradiative transfer calculations with the help of the 3d monte carlo code mc3d.in a second step, interferometric visibilities are calculated from thesimulated surface brightness distributions, which can be directly compared toobservations with the midi instrument. the radial temperature distributions ofclumpy models possess significantly enhanced scatter compared to the continuouscases. even at large distances, clouds can be heated directly by the centralaccretion disk. the existence of the silicate 10 micron-feature in absorptionor in emission depends sensitively on the distribution, the size and opticaldepth of clouds in the innermost part of the torus, due to shadowing effects ofclouds there. this explains failure and success of previous modelling effortsof clumpy tori. after adapting the parameters of our clumpy standard model tothe circumstances of the seyfert 2 circinus galaxy, it can qualitativelyexplain recent mid-infrared interferometric observations performed with midi,as well as high resolution spectral data.

(2) for m&gt;=1e9 msunsystems, the average star formation rate (sfr) of strongly disturbed systems isonly modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement withrecent simulations. in fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systemsonly account for a small fraction (&lt;~30%) of the total sfr density. thissuggests that the behaviour of the cosmic sfr density over the last sevenbillion years is predominantly shaped by normal galaxies.

0704.0774	galaxy morphologies and environment in the abell 901/902 supercluster  from combo-17	we present a morphological study of galaxies in the a901/902 superclusterfrom the combo-17 survey. a total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts inthe range 0.155 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.185 are visually classified by three independentclassifiers to m_v=-18. these morphological classifications are compared tolocal galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surfacemass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. at high localgalaxy densities, log(sigma_10 /mpc^2) &gt; 1.5, a classical morphology-densityrelation is found. a correlation is also found between morphology and localprojected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to thenearest cluster. this supports the finding that local environment is moreimportant to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. the breakdown ofthe morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in thegalaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of redgalaxies in the early-type population. using the 17-band photometry fromcombo-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passivegalaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescriptionof wolf et al. (2005). we find that the dusty star-forming population describesan intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformedinto s0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.

astro-ph;0002011	gravitational lens magnification by abell 1689: distortion of the  background galaxy luminosity function	gravitational lensing magnifies the luminosity of galaxies behind the lens.we use this effect to constrain the total mass in the cluster abell 1689 bycomparing the lensed luminosities of background galaxies with the luminosityfunction of an undistorted field. since galaxies are assumed to be a randomsampling of luminosity space, this method is not limited by clustering noise.we use photometric redshift information to estimate galaxy distance andintrinsic luminosity. knowing the redshift distribution of the backgroundpopulation allows us to lift the mass/background degeneracy common to lensinganalysis. in this paper we use 9 filters observed over 12 hours with the calaralto 3.5m telescope to determine the redshifts of 1000 galaxies in the field ofabell 1689. using a complete sample of 151 background galaxies we measure thecluster mass profile. we find that the total projected mass interior to0.25h^(-1)mpc is (0.48 +/- 0.16) * 10^(15)h^(-1) solar masses, where our errorbudget includes uncertainties from the photometric redshift determination, theuncertainty in the off-set calibration and finite sampling. this result is ingood agreement with that found by number count and shear-based methods andprovides a new and independent method to determine cluster masses.

(2)galaxies resembling present-day sa- to sbc-colours show a co-moving numberdensity and contribution to j_r that does not vary much with redshift. (3)galaxies with blue spectra reflecting strong star formation decrease towardslow redshift both in luminosity and density, and by a factor of 4 in their j_rcontribution. (abridged)

astro-ph;0302116	star forming rates between z=0.25 and z=1.2 from the cadis emission line  survey	the emission line survey within the calar alto deep imaging survey (cadis)detects emission line galaxies by a scan with an imaging fabry-perotinterferometer. it covers 5 fields of &gt; 100 square arcmin each in threewavelengths windows centered on lambda ~ 700, 820, and 920nm, and reaches to atypical limiting line flux of 3 x 10^(-20) w m^(-2). this is the deepestemission line survey covering a field of several 100 square arcmin. galaxiesbetween z = 0.25 and z = 1.4 are detected by prominent emission lines (fromhalpha to [oii]372.7) falling into the fp scans. additional observations with adozen medium band filters allow to establish the line identification and thusthe redshift of the galaxies to better than sigma(z) =0.001. on the basis of atotal of more than 400 emission line galaxies detected in halpha (92 galaxies),[oiii]500.7 (124 galaxies), or [oii]372.7 (222 galaxies) we measure theinstantaneous star formation rate (sfr) in the range 0.24 &lt; z &lt; 1.21. with thispurely emission line selected sample we are able to reach much fainter emissionline galaxies than previous, continuum-selected samples. thus completenesscorrections are much less important. our results substantiates the indicationsfrom previous studies (based on small galaxy samples) that the sfr decreases bya factor of ~20 between z = 1.2 and today. in fact, for a omega(m) = 0.3,omega(lambda) = 0.7 cosmology, we find an exponential decline rho(sfr)proportional to exp(-lookback_time) / 2.6gyr). the inferred sf density is inperfect agreement with that deduced from the fir emission of optically selectedgalaxies which is explained by a large overlap between both populations. weshow that self-consistent extinction corrections of both our emission lines andthe uv continua lead to consistent results for the sf density.

astro-ph;0306505	the evolution of galaxy clustering since z=1 from the calar alto deep  imaging survey	we present results from an investigation of the clustering evolution of fieldgalaxies between a redshift of z~1 and the present epoch. the current analysisrelies on a sample of ~3600 galaxies from the calar alto deep imaging  survey (cadis). the redshift distribution extends to z~1.1, with formalerrors of sigma_z~0.02. thus the amplitude of the three-dimensional correlationfunction can be estimated by means of the projected correlation functionw(r_p). we developed a new method to overcome the influence of redshift errorson w(r_p). we parametrise the evolution of the clustering strength withredshift by a parameter q, the values of which give directly the deviation ofthe evolution from the global hubble flow. from a subsample of bright galaxieswe find q=-2.28+-0.31 for omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7, that is a significantgrowth of the clustering strength between z=1 and the present epoch. fromlinear theory of dark matter clustering growth one would only expect q=-2.moreover, we establish that the measured clustering strength depends on galaxytype: galaxies with early type seds (hubble type: e0 to sbc) are more stronglyclustered at redshifts z&gt;0.2 than later types. the evolution of the amplitudeof the two-point correlation function for these ``old'' galaxies is much slower(q=-0.85+-0.82 for omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7).

astro-ph;0312363	the expected abundance of lyman-$\alpha$ emitting primeval galaxies. i.  general model predictions	we present model calculations for the expected surface density of ly-$\alpha$emitting primeval galaxies (pgs) at high redshifts. we assume that ellipticalgalaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies (= spheroids) formed early in theuniverse and that the ly-$\alpha$ emitting pgs are these spheroids during theirfirst burst of star formation at high redshift. one of the main assumptions ofthe models is that the ly-$\alpha$ bright phase of this first starburst in thespheroids is confined to a short period after its onset due to rapid formationof dust. the models do not only explain the failure of early surveys forly-$\alpha $ emitting pgs but are also consistent with the limits of newsurveys (e.g. the calar alto deep imaging survey - cadis). at faint detectionlimits $s_{lim} \le 10^{-20}$w/m$^2$ the surface density of ly-$\alpha$emitters is expected to vary only weakly in the redshift range between $z=3$and $z=6$ with values $&gt; 10^3 / {deg}^2 / \delta z = 0.1 $ reaching its maximumat $z_0 \approx 4$. at shallower detection limits, $s_{lim} \ge 3\times10^{-20}$w/m$^2$ the surface density of high-z ly-$\alpha$ emitters is expectedto be a steep function of redshift and detection limit. this explains the lowsuccess in finding bright ly-$\alpha$ galaxies at $z &gt; 5$. we demonstrate howthe observed surface densities of ly-$\alpha $ emitting pgs derived from recentsurveys constrain the parameters of our models. finally, we discuss thepossibility that two ly-$\alpha$ bright phases occur in the formation processof galaxies: an initial -- primeval -- phase in which dust is virtuallynon-existing, and a secondary later phase in which strong galactic winds asobserved in some lyman break galaxies facilitate the escape of ly-$\alpha $photons after dust has already been formed.

astro-ph;0404527	the influence of redshift information on galaxy-galaxy lensing  measurements	we investigate how galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements depend on the knowledgeof redshifts for lens and source galaxies. galaxy-galaxy lensing allows one tostudy dark matter halos of galaxies statistically using weak gravitationallensing. redshift information is required to reliably distinguish foregroundlens galaxies from background source galaxies and to convert the measured shearinto constraints on the lens model. without spectroscopy or multi-colourinformation, redshifts can be drawn from independently estimated probabilitydistributions. the combo-17 survey provides redshifts for both lens and sourcegalaxies. it thus offers the unique possibility to do this investigation withobservational data. we find that it is of great importance to know theredshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties oftheir dark matter halos. whether the redshifts are derived from $ubvri$ or thelarger number of filters available in combo-17 is not very important. incontrast, knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurementsonly very little over the use of statistical source redshift distributions aslong as the source redshift distribution is known accurately.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0412615	weak lensing measurements of dark matter halos of galaxies from combo-17	we present a measurement of mass estimates for dark matter halos aroundgalaxies from the combo-17 survey using weak gravitational lensing. combo-17 isparticularly useful for this kind of investigation because it coversobservations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshiftsand spectral classification for objects with $r&lt;24$ are derived. this allows usto select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid anyuncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. we studygalaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalizationof either singular isothermal spheres (sis) or navarro-frenk-white (nfw)profiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and redsubsamples separately. we also constrain the scaling of halo mass with light.for the nfw model, we find virial masses$m_\mathrm{vir}^*=3.9^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$ (1-$\sigma$)for blue and $m_\mathrm{vir}^*=7.1^{+7.1}_{-3.8}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$for red galaxies of $l_\star=10^{10}h^{-2}l_{\sun}$, respectively. the derivedmass-to-light scaling relations suggest that the mass-to-light ratio mightdecrease with increasing luminosity for blue galaxies but increase withincreasing luminosity for red galaxies. however, these differences between blueand red galaxies are only marginally significant and both subsamples areconsistent with having the same mass-to-light ratio at all luminosities.finally, we compare our results to those obtained from the red-sequence clustersurvey (rcs) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). taking differences in theactual modelling into account, we find very good agreement with these surveys.

astro-ph;0506150	red-sequence galaxies with young stars and dust: the cluster abell  901/902 seen with combo-17	we report the discovery of a rich component of dusty star-forming galaxiescontaminating the red-sequence in the supercluster system comprising abell901a, 901b and a902 at redshift ~0.17. these galaxies do not fit into thecolour-density relation, because their preferred habitat is different from thatof regular red-sequence galaxies, which are typically dust-poor, old andpassively evolving. the dusty red galaxies prefer the medium-density outskirtsof clusters while being rare in both the low-density field and the high-densitycluster cores. this new result is based on the information content in themedium-band photometry of the combo-17 survey. the photo-z accuracy of the ~800brightest cluster galaxies is &lt;0.01 and of the order of the velocity dispersionof the cluster. this enables us to select a rich and clean cluster sample, inwhich we can trace age-sensitive and dust-sensitive spectral featuresindependently with the detailed medium-band sed data. we find the red colour ofthe dusty galaxies to be a result of dust extinction combined with relativelyold stellar ages. we speculate that the dusty red galaxies could either be aproduct of minor mergers between established old red cluster galaxies withinfalling blue field galaxies, or mark a period in the internal transformationof blue field galaxies into red cluster galaxies, which is triggered by theenvironmental influences experienced during cluster infall.

astro-ph;0507094	vlt diffraction limited imaging and spectroscopy in the nir: weighing  the black hole in centaurus a with naco	we present high spatial resolution near-infrared spectra and images of thenucleus of centaurus a (ngc 5128) obtained with naos-conica at the vlt. theadaptive optics corrected data have a spatial resolution of 0.06" (fwhm) in k-and 0.11" in h-band, four times higher than previous studies. the observed gasmotions suggest a kinematically hot disk which is orbiting a central object andis oriented nearly perpendicular to the nuclear jet. we model the centralrotation and velocity dispersion curves of the [feii] gas orbiting in thecombined potential of the stellar mass and the (dominant) black hole. ourphysically most plausible model, a dynamically hot and geometrically thin gasdisk, yields a black hole mass of m_bh = (6.1 +0.6/-0.8) 10^7 m_sun. as thephysical state of the gas is not well understood, we also consider two limitingcases: first a cold disk model, which completely neglects the velocitydispersion; it yields an m_bh estimate that is almost two times lower. theother extreme case is to model a spherical gas distribution in hydrostaticequilibrium through jeans equation. compared to the hot disk model the best-fitblack hole mass increases by a factor of 1.5. this wide mass range spanned bythe limiting cases shows how important the gas physics is even for highresolution data. our overall best-fitting black hole mass is a factor of 2-4lower than previous measurements. with our revised m_bh estimate, cen a'soffset from the m_bh-sigma relation is significantly reduced; it falls abovethis relation by a factor of ~2, which is close to the intrinsic scatter ofthis relation.

astro-ph;0507220	galactic structure from the calar alto deep imaging survey (cadis)	we used 1627 faint (15.5&lt; r&lt;23) stars in five fields of the calar alto deepimaging survey (cadis) to estimate the structure parameters of the galaxy. theresults were derived by applying two complementary methods: first by fittingthe density distribution function to the measured density of starsperpendicular to the galactic plane, and second by modelling the observedcolors and apparent magnitudes of the stars in the field, using monte carlosimulations. the best-fitting model of the galaxy is then determined byminimising the c-statistic, a modified chisquared. our model includes a doubleexponential for the stellar disk with scaleheights h_1 and h_2 and a power lawhalo with exponent alpha. 24480 different parameter combinations have beensimulated. both methods yield consistent results: the best fitting parametercombination is alpha=3.0 (or alpha=2.5, if we allow for a flattening of thehalo with an axial ratio of (c/a)=0.6), h_1=300 pc, h_2=900 pc, and thecontribution of thick disk stars to the disk stars in the solar neighbourhoodis found to be between 4 and 10%.

astro-ph;0511255	oxygen gas abundances at z~1.4: implications for the chemical evolution  history of galaxies	the 1&lt;z&lt;2 redshift window hosts the peak of the star formation and metalproduction rates. studies of the metal content of the star forming galaxies atthese epochs are however sparse. we report vlt-isaac near-infrared spectroscopyfor a sample of five [oii]-selected, m_b,ab&lt;-21.5, z~1.4 galaxies, by which wemeasured hbeta and [oiii]5007 emission line fluxes from j-band spectra, andhalpha line fluxes plus upper limits for [nii]6584 fluxes from h-band spectra.the z~1.4 galaxies are characterized by the high [oiii]/[oii] line ratios, lowextinction and low metallicity that are typical of lower luminosity cadisgalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7, and of more luminous lyman break galaxies at z~3, butnot seen in cfrs galaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9. this type of spectrum (e.g., high[oiii]/[oii]) is seen in progressively more luminous galaxies as the redshiftincreases. these spectra are caused by a combination of high ionisationparameter q and lower [o/h]. pegase2 chemical evolution models are used torelate the observed metallicities and luminosities of z~1.4 galaxies to galaxysamples at lower and higher redshift. not surpringsingly, we see a relationshipbetween redshift and inferred chemical age. we suppose that the metal-enrichedreservoirs of star forming gas that we are probing at intermediate redshiftsare being mostly consumed to build up both the disk and the bulge components ofspiral galaxies. finally, our analysis of the metallicity-luminosity relationat 0&lt;z&lt;1.5 suggests that the period of rapid chemical evolution may take placeprogressively in lower mass systems as the universe ages. these results areconsistent with a ``downsizing'' type picture in the sense that particularsignatures (e.g., high [oiii]/[oii] or low [o/h]) are seen in progressivelymore luminous (massive) systems at higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0605019	the wide field imager lyman-alpha search (wfilas) for galaxies at  redshift ~5.7: ii. survey design and sample analysis	context: wide-field narrowband surveys are an efficient way of searchinglarge volumes of high-redshift space for distant galaxies.  aims: we describe the wide field imager lyman-alpha search (wfilas) over 0.74sq. degree for bright emission-line galaxies at z~5.7.  methods: wfilas uses deep images taken with the wide field imager (wfi) onthe eso/mpi 2.2m telescope in three narrowband (70 a), one encompassingintermediate band (220 a) and two broadband filters, b and r. we use the noveltechnique of an encompassing intermediate band filter to exclude falsedetections. images taken with broadband b and r filters are used to remove lowredshift galaxies from our sample.  results: we present a sample of seven lya emitting galaxy candidates, two ofwhich are spectroscopically confirmed. compared to other surveys all ourcandidates are bright, the results of this survey complements other narrowbandsurveys at this redshift. most of our candidates are in the regime of brightluminosities, beyond the reach of less voluminous surveys. adding ourcandidates to those of another survey increases the derived luminosity densityby ~30%. we also find potential clustering in the chandra deep field south,supporting overdensities discovered by other surveys. based on a fors2/vltspectrum we additionally present the analysis of the second confirmed lyaemitting galaxy in our sample. we find that it is the brightest lya emittinggalaxy (1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2) at this redshift to date and the secondconfirmed candidate of our survey. both objects exhibit the presence of apossible second lya component redward of the line.

astro-ph;0606622	gabods: the garching-bonn deep survey: vii. probing galaxy bias using  weak gravitational lensing	[abridged] the weak gravitational lensing effect is used to infer matterdensity fluctuations within the field-of-view of the garching-bonn deep survey(gabods). this information is employed for a statistical comparison of thegalaxy distribution to the total matter distribution. the result of thiscomparison is expressed by means of the linear bias factor, b, the ratio ofdensity fluctuations, and the correlation factor $r$ between densityfluctuations. the total galaxy sample is divided into three sub-samples usingr-band magnitudes and the weak lensing analysis is applied separately for eachsub-sample. together with the photometric redshifts from the related combo-17survey we estimate the typical mean redshifts of these samples with$\bar{z}=0.35, 0.47, 0.61$, respectively. for all three samples, a slightgalaxy anti-bias, b~0.8+-0.1, on scales of a few mpc/h is found; the biasfactor shows evidence for a slight scale-dependence. the correlation betweengalaxy and (dark) matter distribution is high, r~0.6+-0.2, indicating anon-linear or/and stochastic biasing relation between matter and galaxies.between the three samples no significant evolution with redshift is found.

astro-ph;0610284	cosmological constraints from combo-17 using 3d weak lensing	we present the first application of the 3d cosmic shear method developed inheavens et al. (2006) and the geometric shear-ratio analysis developed intaylor et al. (2006), to the combo-17 data set. 3d cosmic shear has been usedto analyse galaxies with redshift estimates from two random combo-17 fieldscovering 0.52 square degrees in total, providing a conditional constraint inthe (sigma_8, omega_m) plane as well as a conditional constraint on theequation of state of dark energy, parameterised by a constant w= p/rho c^2. the(sigma_8, omega_m) plane analysis constrained the relation between sigma_8 andomega_m to be sigma_8(omega_m/0.3)^{0.57 +- 0.19}=1.06 +0.17 -0.16, inagreement with a 2d cosmic shear analysis of combo-17. the 3d cosmic shearconditional constraint on w using the two random fields is w=-1.27 +0.64 -0.70.the geometric shear-ratio analysis has been applied to the a901/2 field, whichcontains three small galaxy clusters. combining the analysis from the a901/2field, using the geometric shear-ratio analysis, and the two random fields,using 3d cosmic shear, w is conditionally constrained to w=-1.08 +0.63 -0.58.the errors presented in this paper are shown to agree with fisher matrixpredictions made in heavens et al. (2006) and taylor et al. (2006). when thesemethods are applied to large datasets, as expected soon from surveys such aspan-starrs and vst-kids, the dark energy equation of state could be constrainedto an unprecedented degree of accuracy.

astro-ph;0612066	combo-17 measurements of the effect of environment on the type-dependent  galaxy luminosity function	we have developed a method to calculate overdensities in multicolour surveys,facilitating a direct comparison of the local density contrast measured usinggalaxy samples that have different redshift error distributions, i.e. for redand blue, or bright and faint galaxies, respectively. we calculateoverdensities in small redshift slices (delta z =0.02, which at z=0.3corresponds roughly to delta r_comoving=53 h^-1 mpc) for 9176 galaxies withr&lt;=23.65, m_b(vega)-5log h&lt;=-18, and z&lt;= 0.7, in three combo-17 fields(measuring 31'x 31' each). the mean redshift errors of this sample areapproximately sigma_z/(1+z)~0.015. in the chandra deep field south we identifya region that is underdense by almost a factor 2 compared to the other twofields in the same redshift range (0.25&lt;~ z &lt;~0.4). this can be used for aninvestigation of the variation of the colour-dependent luminosity function withenvironment: we calculate the luminosity function in this redshift range forred sequence and blue cloud galaxies (as defined by bell et al. 04) in each ofthe fields separately. while the luminosity function of the blue galaxiesremains unaffected by different density contrasts, the luminosity function ofthe red galaxies clearly has a more positive faint-end slope in the chandradeep field south as compared to the other two combo-17 fields. the underdensitythere is thus mainly due to a deficiency of faint red galaxies. this result isin qualitative agreement with the trends seen at z=0.1, e.g. in the 2dfgrs(croton et al. 05), or in the sdss (zandivarez et al. 06).

0809.2042	obscured star formation in intermediate-density environments: a spitzer  study of the abell 901/902 supercluster	we explore the amount of obscured star-formation as a function of environmentin the a901/902 supercluster at z=0.165 in conjunction with a field sampledrawn from the a901 and cdfs fields, imaged with hst as part of the stages andgems surveys. we combine the combo-17 near-uv/optical sed with spitzer 24umphotometry to estimate both the unobscured and obscured star formation ingalaxies with mstar&gt;10^{10}msun. we find that the star formation activity inmassive galaxies is suppressed in dense environments, in agreement withprevious studies. yet, nearly 40% of the star-forming galaxies have red opticalcolors at intermediate and high densities. these red systems are notstarbursting; they have star formation rates per unit stellar mass similar toor lower than blue star-forming galaxies. more than half of the redstar-forming galaxies have low ir-to-uv luminosity ratios, relatively highsersic indices and they are equally abundant at all densities. they might begradually quenching their star-formation, possibly but not necessarily underthe influence of gas-removing environmental processes. the other &gt;40% of thered star-forming galaxies have high ir-to-uv luminosity ratios, indicative ofhigh dust obscuration. they have relatively high specific star formation ratesand are more abundant at intermediate densities. our results indicate thatwhile there is an overall suppression in the star-forming galaxy fraction withdensity, the small amount of star formation surviving the cluster environmentis to a large extent obscured, suggesting that environmental interactionstrigger a phase of obscured star formation, before complete quenching.

astro-ph;9812409	did most high-redshift quasars escape detection?	we present follow-up spectroscopy to the calar alto deep imaging survey(cadis), reporting on the quasars in the cadis 16h-field, and includingpreliminary data from two other fields. in this 10' x 10' field we found sixquasars at redshift z&gt;2.2 which are brighter than r=22 mag, while surfacedensities determined in previous surveys are reported to be below one onaverage. this is the highest reported surface density of high-redshift quasarswithin the given limits. we believe this result to be a consequence of themulticolor database and the search technique used in cadis.  our observations further seem to indicate that the density of high-redshiftquasars is also higher than predicted by the luminosity function of warren(1994) by a factor of three, implying that common search methods haveoverlooked the majority of high-redshift quasars at this magnitude level. inparticular, an application of the v/v max test to our preliminary list of agnswith r&lt;22 mag and z&lt;4 yields &lt;v/v max&gt; = 0.51 +-0.06, characterizing ourpreliminary redshift distribution as flat.

0811.1425	the effect of stellar feedback on the formation and evolution of gas and  dust tori in agn	recently, the existence of geometrically thick dust structures in activegalactic nuclei (agn) has been directly proven with the help of mid-infraredinterferometry. the observations are consistent with a two-component model madeup of a geometrically thin and warm central disk, surrounded by a colder,fluffy torus component. in an exploratory study, we investigate one possiblephysical mechanism, which could produce such a structure, namely the effect ofstellar feedback from a young nuclear star cluster on the interstellar mediumin centres of agn. the model is realised with the help of the hydrodynamicscode tramp. we follow the evolution of the interstellar medium by takingdiscrete mass loss and energy ejection due to stellar processes, as well asoptically thin radiative cooling into account. in a post-processing step, wecalculate observable quantities (spectral energy distributions and images) withthe help of the radiative transfer code mc3d. the interplay between injectionof mass, supernova explosions and radiative cooling leads to a two-componentstructure made up of a cold geometrically thin, but optically thick and veryturbulent disk residing in the vicinity of the angular momentum barrier,surrounded by a filamentary structure. the latter consists of cold long radialfilaments flowing towards the disk and a hot tenuous medium in between, whichshows both inwards and outwards directed motions. this modelling is able toreproduce the range of observed neutral hydrogen column densities of a sampleof seyfert galaxies as well as the relation between them and the strength ofthe silicate 10 micron spectral feature. despite being quite crude, our meanseyfert galaxy model is even able to describe the seds of two intermediate typeseyfert galaxies observed with the spitzer space telescope.
