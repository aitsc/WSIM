0706.1433	igr j00234+6141 : a new integral source identified as an intermediate  polar	following an extensive survey of the galactic plane by the integralsatellite, new hard x-ray sources are discovered with a significant fraction ofcataclysmic variables (cvs) among them. we report here the identification ofone of these hard x-ray sources, igr j00234+6141, as an accreting magneticwhite dwarf of intermediate polar type. we analyse the high energy emission ofthe integral source using all available data and provide complementary opticalphotometric and spectroscopic data obtained respectively in august and october2006. based on a refined integral position, we confirm the proposed opticalidentification. we clearly detect the presence of a 564 s periodic opticalmodulation that we identify as the rotation of the white dwarf. the analysis ofthe optical spectrum also demonstrates that the emission lines show amodulation in radial velocity with an orbital period of porb = (4.033 +/-0.005) hr. the two periodicities indicate that igr00234+6141 is a magnetic cvof the intermediate polar type. this is one of the faintest and hardest sourcesof this type detected by integral. this confirms earlier conclusions that ipscontribute significantly to the population of galactic x-ray sources andrepresent a significant fraction of the high energy background.

0901.0314	the new intermediate long bursting source xte j1701-407	xte j1701-407 is a newly discovered x-ray transient source. in this work weinvestigate its flux variability and study the intermediate long and shortbursts discovered by swift on july 17, and 27, 2008, respectively. so far, onlyone intermediate long burst, with a duration of ~18 minutes and ten days latera short burst, have been recorded from xte j1701-407. we analyzed the publicavailable data from swift and rxte, and compared the observed properties of theintermediate long burst with theoretical ignition condition and light curves toinvestigate the possible nuclear burning processes. the intermediate long burstmay have exhibited a photospheric radius expansion, allowing us to derive thesource distance at 6.2 kpc assuming the empirically derived eddingtonluminosity for pure helium. the intermediate long burst decay was best fit byusing two exponential functions with e-folding times of \tau_1=40(3) s and\tau_2=221(9) s. the bursts occurred at a persistent luminosity ofl_{per}=8.3x10e36 erg/s. for the intermediate long burst the mass accretionrate per unit area onto the ns was \dot{m}=4x10e3 g/cm2/s, and the total energyreleased was e_{burst}=3.5x10e40 erg. this corresponds to an ignition columndepth of y_{ign}=1.8x10e9 g/cm2, for a pure helium burning. we find that theenergetics of this burst can be modeled in different ways, as (i) pure heliumignition, as the result of either pure helium accretion or depletion ofhydrogen by steady burning during accumulation, or (ii) as ignition of a thicklayer of hydrogen-rich material in a source with low metallicity. however,comparison of the burst duration with model light curves suggests that hydrogenburning plays a role during the burst, and therefore this source is a lowaccretion rate burster with a low metallicity in the accreted material.

0906.3633	bursting behavior of the galactic center faint x-ray transient grs  1741.9-2853	the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary grs 1741.9-2853 is a known type-iburster of the galactic center. it is transient, faint, and located in a verycrowded region, only 10 arcmin from the supermassive black hole sgr a*.therefore, its bursting behavior has been poorly studied so far. in particular,its persistent emission has rarely been detected between consecutive bursts,due to lack of sensitivity or confusion. this is what made grs 1741.9-2853 oneof the nine "burst-only sources" identified by bepposax a few years ago. thephysical properties of grs 1741.9-2853 bursts are yet of great interest sincewe know very little about the nuclear regimes at stake in low accretion ratebursters. we examine here for the first time several bursts in relation withthe persistent emission of the source, using integral, xmm-newton, and swiftobservations. we investigate the source flux variability and bursting behaviorduring its 2005 and 2007 long outbursts. the persistent luminosity of grs1741.9-2853 varied between ~1.7 and 10.5 10^36 erg s^-1, i.e. 0.9-5.3% of theeddington luminosity. the shape of the spectrum as described by an absorbedpower-law remained with a photon index gamma ~ 2 and a column density $n_{\rmh} ~ 12 10^22 cm^-2 throughout the outbursts. we discovered 11 type-i burstswith integral, and inspected 4 additional bursts: 2 recorded by xmm-newton and2 by swift. from the brigthest burst, we derive an upper limit on the sourcedistance of ~7 kpc. the observed bursts characteristics and source accretionrate suggest pure helium explosions igniting at column depths y_{ign} ~ 0.8-4.810^8 g cm^-1, for typical energy releases of ~1.2-7.4 10^39 erg.

0909.3391	what ignites on the neutron star of 4u 0614+091?	[abridged] the lmxb 4u 0614+091 is a source of sporadic thermonuclear (typei) x-ray bursts. we find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics inserendipitous wide-field x-ray observations by eureca/watch, rxte/asm,bepposax/wfc, hete-2/fregate, integral/ibis/isgri, and swift/bat, as well aspointed observations by rxte/pca and hexte. most of them reach a peak flux of~15 crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a crab. one of the burstsshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. this allows us toevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. the burst durations are between10 sec to 5 min. however, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, afaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. onevery long burst lasted for several hours. this superburst candidate wasfollowed by a normal type-i burst only 19 days later. this is, to ourknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. a superburstin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% l_edd. theintermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4u 0614+091's persistent emissionwas lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one everymonth to 3 months). the average burst rate increased significantly after thisperiod. the maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2weeks. the burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least anappreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donorstar. if the system is an ultra-compact x-ray binary with a co white-dwarfdonor, as has been suggested, this is unexpected. if the bursts are powered byhelium, we find that the energy production per accumulated mass is about 2.5times less than expected for pure helium matter.

1002.3740	the intriguing nature of the high energy gamma ray source xssj12270-4859	the nature of the hard x-ray source xssj12270-4859 is still unclear though itwas claimed to be a magnetic cataclysmic variable. we here present a broad-bandx-ray and gamma ray study based on a recent xmm-newton observation and archivalintegral and rxte data. from the fermi/lat 1-year point source catalogue, wetentatively associate xssj12270-4859 with 1fglj1227.9-4852, a source of highenergy gamma rays with emission up to 10gev. we complement the study with uvphotometry from xmm-newton and ground-based optical and near-ir photometry. thex-ray emission is highly variable showing flares and intensity dips. the x-rayflares consist of flare-dip pairs. flares are also detected in the uv range butnot the dips. aperiodic dipping behaviour is also observed during x-rayquiescence but not in the uv. the 0.2-100kev spectrum is featureless anddescribed by a power law model with gamma=1.7. the 100mev-10gev spectrum isinstead represented by a power law index of 2.45. the luminosity ratio between0.1-100gev and 0.2--100kev is ~0.8, hence the gev emission is a significantcomponent of the total energy output. furthermore, the x-ray spectrum does notgreatly change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence but ithardens during the post-flare dips. optical photometry reveals a period of4.32hr likely related to the binary orbit. near-ir, possibly ellipsoidal,variations are detected. large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins)timescales are found to be non-periodic. the observed variability at allwavelengths and the spectral characteristics strongly favour a low-massatypical low-luminosity x-ray binary and are against a cataclysmic variablenature. the association with a fermi/lat high energy gamma ray source furtherstrengths this interpretation.

1204.3758	characterization of new hard x-ray cataclysmic variables	we aim at characterizing a sample of 9 new hard x-ray selected cataclysmicvariable (cvs), to unambiguously identify them as magnetic systems of theintermediate polar (ip) type. we performed timing and spectral analysis byusing x-ray, and simultaneous uv and optical data collected by xmm-newton,complemented with hard x-ray data provided by integral and swift. the pulsearrival time were used to estimate the orbital periods. the x-ray spectra werefitted using composite models consisting of different absorbing columns andemission components. strong x-ray pulses at the white dwarf (wd) spin periodare detected and found to decrease with energy. most sources are spin-dominatedsystems in the x-rays, though four are beat dominated at optical wavelengths.we estimated the orbital period in all system (except for igr j16500-3307),providing the first estimate for igr j08390-4833, igr j18308-1232, and igrj18173-2509. all x-ray spectra are multi-temperature. v2069 cyg and rxj0636+3535 posses a soft x-ray optically thick component at kt 80 ev. anintense k_alpha fe line at 6.4 kev is detected in all sources. an absorptionedge at 0.76 kev from ovii is detected in igr j08390-4833. the wd masses andlower limits to the accretion rates are estimated. we found all sources to beips. igr j08390-4833, v2069 cyg, and igr j16500-3307 are pure disc accretors,while igr j18308-1232, igr j1509-6649, igr j17195-4100, and rx j0636+3535display a disc-overflow accretion mode. all sources show a temperature gradientin the post-shock regions and a highly absorbed emission from material locatedin the pre-shock flow which is also responsible for the x-ray pulsations.reflection at the wd surface is likely the origin of the fluorescent iron line.there is an increasing evidence for the presence of a warm absorber in ips. theaddition of 2 systems to the subgroup of soft x-ray ips confirms a \sim 30%incidence.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1405.6855	formation of phase lags at the cyclotron energies in the pulse profiles  of magnetized, accreting neutron stars	context: accretion-powered x-ray pulsars show highly energy-dependent andcomplex pulse-profile morphologies. significant deviations from the averagepulse profile can appear, in particular close to the cyclotron line energies.these deviations can be described as energy-dependent phase lags, that is, asenergy-dependent shifts of main features in the pulse profile. aims: using anumerical study we explore the effect of cyclotron resonant scattering onobservable, energy-resolved pulse profiles. methods: we generated theobservable emission as a function of spin phase, using monte carlo simulationsfor cyclotron resonant scattering and a numerical ray-tracing routineaccounting for general relativistic light-bending effects on the intrinsicemission from the accretion columns. results: we find strong changes in thepulse profile coincident with the cyclotron line energies. features in thepulse profile vary strongly with respect to the average pulse profile with theobserving geometry and shift and smear out in energy additionally when assuminga non-static plasma. conclusions: we demonstrate how phase lags at thecyclotron energies arise as a consequence of the effects of angularredistribution of x-rays by cyclotron resonance scattering in a strong magneticfield combined with relativistic effects. we also show that phase lags arestrongly dependent on the accretion geometry. these intrinsic effects will inprinciple allow us to constrain a system's accretion geometry.

0805.1849	are there magnetars in high mass x-ray binaries? the case of supergiant  fast x-ray transients	in this paper we survey the theory of wind accretion in high mass x-raybinaries hosting a magnetic neutron star and a supergiant companion.  we concentrate on the different types of interaction between the inflowingwind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant when accretionof matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; these include theinhibition through the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. expanding on earlierwork, we calculate the expected luminosity for each regime and derive theconditions under which transition from one regime to another can take place. weshow that very large luminosity swings (~10^4 or more on time scales as shortas hours) can result from transitions across different regimes.  the activity displayed by supergiant fast x-ray transients, a recentlydiscovered class of high mass x-ray binaries in our galaxy, has often beeninterpreted in terms of direct accretion onto a neutron star immersed in anextremely clumpy stellar wind. we show here that the transitions across themagnetic and/or centrifugal barriers can explain the variability properties ofthese sources as a results of relatively modest variations in the stellar windvelocity and/or density. according to this interpretation we expect thatsupergiant fast x-ray transients which display very large luminosity swings andhost a slowly spinning neutron star are characterized by magnetar-like fields,irrespective of whether the magnetic or the centrifugal barrier applies.  supergiant fast x-ray transients might thus provide a new opportunity todetect and study magnetars in binary systems.

astro-ph;0309510	ibis preliminary results on cygnus x-1 spectral and temporal  characteristics	we report preliminary results of a broadband spectral and temporal study ofthe black-hole binary cyg x-1 performed with the ibis telescope. cyg x-1 wasthe first pointed celestial target of ibis during the integral performance andverification phase, 2002 nov.-dec., for a total observing time of 2 ms in bothstaring and dithering mode. here, we report on only the staring, on-axis,observation performed in a stable instrument configuration. during theobserving period the source was in its characteristic low/hard state, in whicha few flares and dips have been detected. the ibis/isgri results demonstratethat the integral observatory offers a unique capability for studyingcorrelations between hardness and/or flux in different bands over a wide photonenergy range. one of our new results is finding that the hardness-fluxcorrelation changes the sign twice over the 20-220 kev; first from positive tonegative at 50 kev, and then back to positive at 120 kev. the former changeappears to be due to the spectral curvature introduced by variable comptonreflection. the latter may be due spectral pivoting.

astro-ph;0608250	integral observations of the cosmic x-ray background in the 5-100 kev  range via occultation by the earth	we study the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) in energy range$\sim$5-100 kev. early in 2006 the integral observatory performed a series offour 30ksec observations with the earth disk crossing the field of view of theinstruments. the modulation of the aperture flux due to occultation ofextragalactic objects by the earth disk was used to obtain the spectrum of thecosmic x-ray background(cxb). various sources of contamination were evaluated,including compact sources, galactic ridge emission, cxb reflection by the earthatmosphere, cosmic ray induced emission by the earth atmosphere and the earthauroral emission. the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background in the energyband 5-100 kev is obtained. the shape of the spectrum is consistent with thatobtained previously by the heao-1 observatory, while the normalization is$\sim$10% higher. this difference in normalization can (at least partly) betraced to the different assumptions on the absolute flux from the crab nebulae.  the increase relative to the earlier adopted value of the absolute flux ofthe cxb near the energy of maximum luminosity (20-50 kev) has directimplications for the energy release of supermassive black holes in the universeand their growth at the epoch of the cxb origin.

astro-ph;0701400	on the maximum efficiency of the propeller mass-ejection mechanism	aims. we derive simple estimates of the maximum efficiency with which mattercan be ejected by the propeller mechanism in disk-fed, rotating magneticneutron stars. some binary evolution scenarios envisage that this mechanism isresponsible for expelling to infinity the mass inflowing at a low rate from thecompanion star, therefore limiting the total amount of mass that can beaccreted by the neutron star. methods. we demonstrate that, for typical neutronstar parameters, a maximum of \eta_{pro} &lt; 5.7 (p_{-3})^{1/3} times more matterthan accreted can be expelled through the propeller mechanism at the expensesof the neutron star rotational energy (p_{-3} is the ns spin period in unit of10e-3 s). approaching this value, however, would require a great deal of finetuning in the system parameters and the properties of the interaction of matterand magnetic field at the magnetospheric boundary. results. we conclude thatsome other mechanism must be invoked in order to prevent that too much massaccretes onto the neutron stars of some low mass x-ray binaries.

0809.3642	igrj16479-4514: the first eclipsing supergiant fast x-ray transient?	supergiant fast x-ray transients are a new class of high mass x-ray binariesrecently discovered with integral. hours long outbursts from these sources havebeen observed on numerous occasions at luminosities of ~1e36-1e37 erg/s,whereas their low level activity at ~1e32-1e34 erg/s has not been deeplyinvestigated yet due to the paucity of long pointed observations with highsensitivity x-ray telescopes. here we report on the first long (~32 ks) pointedxmm-newton observation of igr j16479-4514, a member of this new class. thisobservation was carried out in march 2008, shortly after an outburst from thissource, with the main goal of investigating its low level emission and physicalmechanisms that drive the source activity. results from the timing, spectraland spatial analysis of the epic-pn xmm-newton observation show that the x-raysource igrj16479-4514 underwent an episode of sudden obscuration, possibly anx-ray eclipse by the supergiant companion. we also found evidence for a softx-ray extended halo around the source that is most readily interpreted as dueto scattering by dust along the line of sight to igrj16479-4514. we discussthis result in the context of the gated accretion scenarios that have beenproposed to interpret the behaviour of supergiant fast x-ray transient.

0811.0995	hunting for magnetars in high mass x-ray binaries. the case of  supergiant fast x-ray transients	in this paper we summarize some aspects of the wind accretion theory in highmass x-ray binaries hosting a magnetic neutron star and a supergiant companion.in particular, we concentrate on the different types of interaction between theinflowing wind matter and the neutron star magnetosphere that are relevant whenaccretion of matter onto the neutron star surface is largely inhibited; theseinclude inhibition by the centrifugal and magnetic barriers. we show that verylarge luminosity swings (~10^4 or more on time scales as short as hours) canresult from transitions across different regimes. this scenario is then appliedto the activity displayed by supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts), a newclass of high mass x-ray binaries in our galaxy recently discovered withintegral. according to this interpretation we argue that sfxts which displayvery large luminosity swings and host a slowly spinning neutron star areexpected to be characterized by magnetar-like fields. supergiant fast x-raytransients might thus provide a unique opportunity to detect and studyaccreting magnetars in binary systems.
