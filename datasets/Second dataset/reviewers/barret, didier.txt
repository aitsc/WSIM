0902.4238	x-ray timing of stellar mass black holes	x-ray timing observations of accreting stellar mass black holes have shownthat they can produce signals with such short time scales that we must beprobing very close to the innermost stable circular orbit that is predicted bythe theory of general relativity (gr). these signals are quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos), and both the high-frequency variety (hfqpos, which havefrequencies in the 40-450 hz range) as well as the 0.1-10 hz low-frequency typehave the potential to provide tests of gr in the strong field limit. animportant step on the path to gr tests is to constrain the physical black holeproperties, and the straightforward frequency measurements that are possiblewith x-ray timing may provide one of the cleanest measurements of black holespins. while current x-ray satellites have uncovered these phenomenona, thehfqpos are weak signals, and future x-ray timing missions with larger effectivearea are required for testing the candidate theoretical qpo mechanisms. anothermain goal in the study of accreting black holes is to understand the productionof relativistic jets. here, we have also made progress during the past decadeby finding clear connections between the radio emission that traces thestrength of the jet and the properties of the x-ray emission. with new radiocapabilities just coming on-line, continuing detailed x-ray studies ofaccreting black holes is crucial for continuing to make progress.

0907.3223	khz quasi-periodic oscillations in the low-mass x-ray binary 4u 0614+09	we report on a comprehensive analysis of the kilohertz (above 300 hz)quasi-periodic oscillations (khz qpos) detected from the neutron star low-massx-ray binary 4u0614+09 with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). with a muchlarger data set than previously analyzed (all archival data from february 1996up to october 2007), we first investigate the reality of the 1330 hz qporeported by van straaten et al. (2000). this qpo would be of particularinterest since it has the highest frequency reported for any source. a thoroughanalysis of the same observation fails to confirm the detection. on the otherhand, over our extended data set, the highest qpo frequency we measure for theupper khz qpo is at about 1224 hz; a value which is fully consistent with themaximum values observed in similar systems. second, we demonstrate that thefrequency dependence of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower and upperkhz qpos follow the systematic trends seen in similar systems (barret et al.,2006). in particular, 4u0614+09 shows a drop of the quality factor of the lowerkhz qpo above 700 hz. if this is due to an approach to the innermost stablecircular orbit, it implies a neutron star mass of about 1.9 solar masses.finally, when analyzing the data over fixed durations, we have found a gap inthe frequency distribution of the upper qpo, associated with a local minimum ofits amplitude. a similar gap is not present in the distribution of the lowerqpo frequencies, suggesting some cautions when interpreting frequency ratiodistributions, based on the occurrence of the lower qpo only.

0909.2990	on the distribution of frequency ratios of khz qpos	the width (w), root mean squared amplitude (rs) of lower and upper khzquasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) from accreting neutron stars vary withfrequency. similarly, the qpo frequency varies with the source count rate (s).hence, the significance of a qpo, scaling as s x rs^2/w^(1/2) will also dependon frequency. in addition, the significance also scales up with the square rootof the integration time of the fourier power density spectrum (t).consequently, depending on the way data are considered, khz qpos may bedetected only over a limited range of their frequency spans or detectedpredominantly at some frequencies, leading potentially to biases in theobserved distributions of frequencies or frequency ratios. although subject ofmuch controversy, an observed clustering of qpo frequency ratios around 3/2 insco x-1, also seen in other sources, has been previously used as an argumentsupporting resonance based models of neutron star qpos. in this paper, wemeasure how the statistical significance of both khz qpos vary with frequencyfor three prototype neutron star khz qpo sources, namely 4u1636-536, 4u0614+091and sco x-1. as the significance of qpo detection depends on frequency, we showthat in sensitivity-limited observations (as in the case of the rxte/pca), asimultaneous detection of both the lower and upper khz qpos can only beachieved over limited frequency ranges. as a result, even a uniformdistribution of qpo frequencies will lead to peaks (in particular around 3/2)in the histogram of frequency ratios. this implies that the observed clusteringof ratios does not provide any evidence for intrinsically preferred frequencyratios, thus weakening the case for a resonance mechanism at the origin ofneutron star khz qpos.

1001.0567	an intermediate-mass black hole of over 500 solar masses in the galaxy  eso 243-49	ultra-luminous x-ray sources are extragalactic objects located outside thenucleus of the host galaxy with bolometric luminosities &gt;10^39 erg s^-1. theseextreme luminosities - if the emission is isotropic and below the theoretical(i.e. eddington) limit, where the radiation pressure is balanced by thegravitational pressure - imply the presence of an accreting black hole with amass of ~10^2-10^5 times that of the sun. the existence of such intermediatemass black holes is in dispute, and though many candidates have been proposed,none are widely accepted as definitive. here we report the detection of avariable x-ray source with a maximum 0.2-10 kev luminosity of up to 1.2 x 10^42erg s^-1 in the edge-on spiral galaxy eso 243-49, with an implied conservativelower limit of the mass of the black hole of ~500 msun. this finding presentsthe strongest observational evidence to date for the existence of intermediatemass black holes, providing the long sought after missing link between thestellar mass and super-massive black hole populations.

1011.1254	exploring the nature of the brightest hyper-luminous x-ray source	the small subset of hyper-luminous x-ray sources with luminosities in excessof ~1e41 erg/s are hard to explain without the presence of an intermediate massblack hole, as significantly super-eddington accretion and/or very smallbeaming angles are required. the recent discovery of hlx-1, the most luminousobject in this class with a record breaking luminosity of ~1e42 erg/s in thegalaxy eso 243-49, therefore currently provides some of the strongest evidencefor the existence of intermediate mass black holes. hlx-1 is almost an order ofmagnitude brighter than the other hyper-luminous sources, and appears toexhibit x-ray spectral and flux variability similar to galactic stellar massblack hole x-ray binaries. in this paper we review the current state ofknowledge on this intriguing source and outline the results of multi-wavelengthstudies from radio to ultra-violet wavelengths, including imaging andspectroscopy of the recently identified optical counterpart obtained with thevery large telescope. these results continue to support an intermediate massblack hole in excess of 500 msun

1011.4601	the drop of the coherence of the lower khz qpos is also observed in xte  j1701-462	we investigate the quality factor and rms amplitude of the lower khz qposfrom xte j1701-462, a unique x-ray source which was observed in both theso-called z and atoll states. correcting for the frequency drift of the qpo, weshow that, as in all sources for which such a correction can be applied, thequality factor and rms amplitude drops sharply above above a criticalfrequency. for xte j1701-462 this frequency is estimated to be ~800 hz, wherethe quality factor reaches a maximum of ~200 (e.g. a value consistent with theone observed from more classical systems, such as 4u~1636-536). such a drop hasbeen interpreted as the signature of the innermost stable circular orbit, andthat interpretation is consistent with the observations we report here. the khzqpos in the z state are much less coherent and lower amplitude than they are inthe atoll state. we argue that the change of the qpo properties between the twosource states is related to the change of the scale height of the accretiondisk; a prediction of the toy model proposed by barret et al. (2007). as aby-product of our analysis, we also increased the significance of the upper khzqpo detected in the atoll phase up to 4.8 sigma (single trial significance),and show that the frequency separation (266.5+/-13.1 hz) is comparable with theone measured from simultaneous twin qpos the z phase.

1106.0744	discovery of an ultrasoft x-ray transient source in the 2xmm catalog: a  tidal disruption event candidate	we have discovered an ultrasoft x-ray transient source, 2xmmij184725.1-631724, which was detected serendipitously in two xmm-newtonobservations in the direction of the center of the galaxy ic 4765-f01-1504 at aredshift of 0.0353. these two observations were separated by 211 days, with the0.2-10 kev absorbed flux increasing by a factor of about 9. their spectra arebest described by a model dominated by a thermal disk or a single-temperatureblackbody component (contributing &gt;80% of the flux) plus a weak power-lawcomponent. the thermal emission has a temperature of a few tens of ev, and theweak power-law component has a photon index of ~3.5. similar to the black holex-ray binaries in the thermal state, our source exhibits an accretion diskwhose luminosity appears to follow the $l\propto t^4$ relation. this wouldindicate that the black hole mass is about 10^5-10^6 m_sun using thebest-fitting inner disk radius. both xmm-newton observations show variabilityof about 21% on timescales of hours, which can be explained as due to fastvariations in the mass accretion rate. the source was not detected by rosat inan observation in 1992, indicating a variability factor of &gt;64 over longertimescales. the source was not detected again in x-rays in a swift observationin 2011 february, implying a flux decrease by a factor of &gt;12 since the lastxmm-newton observation. the transient nature, in addition to the extremesoftness of the x-ray spectra and the inactivity of the galaxy implied by thelack of strong optical emission lines, makes it a candidate tidal disruptionevent. if this is the case, the first xmm-newton observation would have been inthe rising phase, and the second one in the decay phase.

1112.0535	maximum likelihood fitting of x-ray power density spectra: application  to high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations from the neutron star x-ray  binary 4u1608-522	high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) from weakly magnetizedneutron stars display rapid frequency variability and high coherence withquality factors up to at least 200 at frequencies around 850 hz. theirparameters have been estimated so far from standard min(chi2) fittingtechniques, after combining a large number of power density spectra (pds), asto have the powers normally distributed. accounting for the statisticalproperties of pds, we apply a maximum likelihood method to derive the qpoparameters in the non gaussian regime. the method presented is general, easy toimplement and can be applied to fitting individual pds, several pdssimultaneously or their average, and is obviously not specific to the analysisof khz qpo data. it applies to the analysis of any pds optimized in frequencyresolution and for low frequency variability or pds containing features whoseparameters vary on short timescales, as is the case for khz qpos. it isequivalent to the standard chi^2 minimization fitting when the number of pdsfitted is large. the accuracy, reliability and superiority of the method isdemonstrated with simulations of synthetic pds. we show that the maximumlikelihood estimates of the qpo parameters are asymptotically unbiased, andhave negligible bias when the qpo is reasonably well detected. by contrast, weshow that the standard min(chi2) fitting method gives biased parameters withlarger uncertainties. the maximum likelihood fitting method is applied to asubset of archival rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) data of the neutron starx-ray binary 4u1608-522. we show that the khz qpo parameters can be measured on8 second timescales and that the time evolution of the frequency is consistentwith a random walk. this enables us to estimate the intrinsic quality factor ofthe qpo to be around 260, whereas previous analysis indicated a maximum valuearound 200 (abridged).

1303.0750	soft lags in neutron star khz quasi periodic oscillations: evidence for  reverberation?	high frequency soft reverberation lags have now been detected from stellarmass and super massive black holes. their interpretation involves reflection ofa hard source of photons onto an accretion disk, producing a delayed reflectedemission, with a time lag consistent with the light travel time between theirradiating source and the disk. independently of the location of the clock,the khz quasi-periodic oscillation (qpo) emission is thought to arise from theneutron star boundary layer. here, we search for the signature of reverberationof the khz qpo emission, by measuring the soft lags and the lag energy spectrumof the lower khz qpos from 4u1608-52. soft lags, ranging from ~15 to ~40microseconds, between the 3-8 kev and 8-30 kev modulated emissions are detectedbetween 565 and 890 hz. the soft lags are not constant with frequency and showa smooth decrease between 680 hz and 890 hz. the broad band x-ray spectrum ismodeled as the sum of a disk and a thermal comptonized component, plus a broadiron line, expected from reflection. the spectral parameters follow a smoothrelationship with the qpo frequency, in particular the fitted inner disk radiusdecreases steadily with frequency. both the bump around the iron line in thelag energy spectrum, and the consistency between the lag changes and theinferred changes of the inner disk radius, from either spectral fitting or theqpo frequency, suggest that the soft lags may indeed involve reverberation ofthe hard pulsating qpo source on the disk.

1309.0509	classification of x-ray sources in the xmm-newton serendipitous source  catalog: objects of special interest	we analyze 18 sources that were found to show interesting properties ofperiodicity, very soft spectra and/or large long-term variability in x-rays inour project of classification of sources from the 2xmmi-dr3 catalog but werepoorly studied in the literature, in order to investigate their nature. twohard sources show x-ray periodicities of ~1.62 hr (2xmm j165334.4-414423) and~2.1 hr (2xmm j133135.2-315541) and are probably magnetic cataclysmicvariables. the source 2xmm j123103.2+110648 is an active galactic nucleus (agn)candidate showing very soft x-ray spectra (kt~0.1 kev) and exhibiting anintermittent ~3.8 hr quasi-periodic oscillation. there are six other very softsources (with kt&lt;0.2 kev), which might be in other galaxies with luminositiesbetween ~10^{38}-10^{42} erg/s. they probably represent a diverse group thatmight include objects such as ultrasoft agns and cool thermal disk emissionfrom accreting intermediate-mass black holes. six highly variable sources withharder spectra are probably in nearby galaxies with luminosities above 10^{37}erg/s and thus are great candidates for extragalactic x-ray binaries. one ofthem (2xmmi j004211.2+410429, in m 31) is probably a new-born persistentsource, having been x-ray bright and hard in 0.3--10 kev for at least fouryears since it was discovered to enter an outburst in 2007. three highlyvariable hard sources appear at low galactic latitudes and have maximumluminosities below ~10^{34} erg/s if they are in our galaxy, thus greatcandidates for cataclysmic variables or very faint x-ray transients harboring ablack hole or neutron star. our interpretations of these sources can be testedwith future long-term x-ray monitoring and multi-wavelength observations.

1310.2604	combined analysis of hubble and vlt photometry of the intermediate mass  black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1	in this paper we present a combined analysis of data obtained with the hubblespace telescope (hst), very large telescope (vlt), and swift x-ray telescope(xrt) of the intermediate mass black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1 that were taken 2months apart between september and november 2010. previous separate analyses ofthese data found that they were consistent with an irradiated accretion discwith contribution from either a very young or very old stellar population, andalso indicated that the optical flux of the hlx-1 counterpart could bevariable. such variability could only be attributed to a varying accretiondisc, so simultaneous analysis of all data sets should break the degeneraciesin the model fits. we thus simultaneously fit the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) from near-infrared through to x-ray wavelengths of the twoepochs of data with a model consisting of an irradiated accretion disc and astellar population. we show that this combined analysis rules out an oldstellar population, finding that the sed is dominated by emission from anaccretion disc with moderate reprocessing in the outer disc around anintermediate mass black hole imbedded in a young (20 myr) stellar cluster witha mass of 1e5 msun. we also place an upper limit on the mass of an additionalhidden old stellar population of 1e6 msun. however, optical r-band observationsof hlx-1 obtained with the gemini-south telescope covering part of the decayfrom a later x-ray outburst are consistent with constant optical flux,indicating that the observed variability between the hst and vlt observationscould be spurious caused by differences in the background subtraction appliedto the two optical data sets. in this scenario the contribution of the stellarpopulation, and thus the stellar mass of the cluster, may be higher (abridged).

1409.3248	no time for dead time: timing analysis of bright black hole binaries  with nustar	timing of high-count rate sources with the nustar small explorer missionrequires specialized analysis techniques. nustar was primarily designed forspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates ratherthan for timing analysis of bright objects. the instrumental dead time perevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percentevent-to-event. the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noiselevel in the power density spectrum (pds) that cannot be modeled easily withthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. in thispaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completelyindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain agood proxy of the white noise-subtracted pds. thereafter, one can use a montecarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely afrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent dropof the sensitivity to variability. in this way, most of the standard timinganalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relativeto what would be achieved using more standard techniques. we apply thistechnique to nustar observations of the black hole binaries gx 339-4, cyg x-1and grs 1915+105.

astro-ph;0212173	an xmm-newton observation of the globular cluster omega centauri	we report on a deep xmm-newton epic observation of the globular cluster omegacen performed on august 13th, 2001. we have detected 11 and 27 faint x-raysources in the core and half mass radii, searching down to a luminosity of 1.3x 10^{31} erg s^{-1} in the 0.5-5 kev range. most sources have bolometric x-rayluminosities between ~ 10^{31}-10^{32} erg s^{-1}. we present the color-colorand hardness-intensity diagrams of the source sample, as well as high-qualityepic spectra of the brightest objects of the field; including the two candidatecataclysmic variables (cvs) in the core and the quiescent neutron star low-massx-ray binary candidate. the spectra of the latter objects fully support theirprevious classification. we show that the bulk of sources are hard andspectrally similar to cvs. the lack of soft faint sources might be related tothe absence of millisecond pulsars in the cluster. the xmm-newton observationsreveal the presence of an excess of sources well outside the core of thecluster where several rs cvn binaries have already been found. we have alsoanalyzed a publicly available chandra acis-i observation performed on january24-25th, 2000, to improve the xmm-newton source positions and to search forsource intensity variations between the two data sets. 63 xmm-newton sourceshave a chandra counterpart, and 15 sources within the half-mass radius haveshown time variability. overall, the general properties of the faint x-raysources in omega cen suggest that they are predominantly cvs and activebinaries (rs cvn or by dra).

astro-ph;0301130	simultaneous bepposax and rossi x-ray timing explorer observations of  4u1812-12	4u1812-12 is a faint persistent and weakly variable neutron star x-raybinary. it was observed by bepposax between april 20th and 21st, 2000 in a hardspectral state with a bolometric luminosity of ~2x10^36 ergs/s. its broad bandenergy spectrum is characterized by the presence of a hard x-ray tail extendingabove ~100 kev. it can be represented as the sum of a dominant hard comptonizedcomponent (electron temperature of ~36 kev and optical depth ~3) and a weaksoft component. the latter component which can be fitted with a blackbody ofabout 0.6 kev and equivalent radius of ~2 km is likely to originate from theneutron star surface. we also report on the first measurement of the powerdensity spectrum of the source rapid x-ray variability, as recorded during asimultaneous snapshot observation performed by the rossi x-ray timing explorer.as expected for a neutron star system in such hard spectral state, its powerdensity spectrum is characterized by the presence of a ~0.7 hz low frequencyquasi-periodic oscillation together with three broad noise components, one ofwhich extends above ~200 hz.

astro-ph;0401099	xtra: the fast x-ray timing detector on xeus	the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) has demonstrated that the dynamicalvariation of the x-ray emission from accreting neutron stars and stellar massblack holes is a powerful probe of their strong gravitational fields. at thesame time, the x-ray burst oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency havebeen used to set important constraints on the mass and radius of neutron stars,hence on the equation of state of their high density cores. the x-ray evolvinguniverse spectroscopy mission (xeus), the potential follow-on mission toxmm-newton, will have a mirror aperture more than ten times larger than theeffective area of the rxte proportional counter array (pca). combined with asmall dedicated fast x-ray timing detector in the focal plane (xtra: xeustiming for relativistic astrophysics), this collecting area will provide a leapin timing sensitivity by more than one order of magnitude over the pca forbright sources, and will open a brand new window on faint x-ray sources, owingto the negligible detector background. the use of advanced silicon driftchambers will further improve the energy resolution by a factor of ~6 over thepca, so that spectroscopic diagnostics of the strong field region, such as therelativistically broadened iron line, will become exploitable. by combiningfast x-ray timing and spectroscopy, xtra will thus provide the first realopportunity to test general relativity in the strong gravity field regime andto constrain with unprecedented accuracy the equation of state of matter atsupranuclear density.

astro-ph;0401100	accretion flows around stellar mass black holes and neutron stars	in this review, i summarize the main x-ray/hard x-ray properties of theaccretion flows around black holes and neutron stars based on recent broad-bandspectral and timing observations performed by the bepposax and rossi x-raytiming explorer satellites. emphasizing the spectral and timing similaritiesobserved between black holes and neutron stars, i discuss on the most likelyaccretion geometry and emission processes associated with hard and softspectral states. for black holes, in the hard state, the accretion geometry ismore likely made of a truncated disk and a hot inner flow, in which thermalcomptonization takes place. the truncated disk is likely to be the dominantsource of seed photons, and the site for the production of the reflectioncomponent observed. in soft states, the disk now extends closer to the compactobject and is brighter in x-rays. the hard x-ray emission occurs throughcomptonization of disk photons on a thermal/non-thermal electron distribution,generated in magnetic flares above the accretion disk. for neutron stars,similar accretion geometry and emission mechanisms may apply but theunavoidable radiation from the neutron star surface adds yet another componentin the x-ray spectrum. it also acts as an additional source of cooling for thecomptonizing cloud, leading to softer spectra in neutron stars than in blackholes.

astro-ph;0505402	an abrupt drop in the coherence of the lower kilohertz qpo in 4u  1636-536	using archival data from the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte), we study ina systematic way the variation of the quality factor and amplitude of the lowerand upper khz quasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) in the low-mass x-ray binary4u1636-536, over a frequency range from ~550 hz to ~1200 hz. when representedin a quality factor versus frequency diagram, the upper and lower qpos followtwo different tracks, suggesting that they are distinct phenomena, although notcompletely independent because the frequency difference of the two qpos, whendetected simultaneously, remains within ~60 hz of half the neutron star spinfrequency (at 581 hz). the quality factor of the lower khz qpo increases withfrequency up to a maximum of ~200 at ~850 hz, then drops precipitously to q~50at the highest detected frequencies ~920 hz. a ceiling of the lower qpofrequencies at 920 hz is also clearly seen in a frequency versus count ratediagram.  the quality factor provides a measure of the coherence of the underlyingoscillator. for exponentially damped sinusoidal shots, the highest q observedcorresponds to an oscillator coherence time of ~ 0.1 seconds. all existing qpomodels face challenges in explaining such a long coherence time and thesignificantly different behaviours of the quality factors of the upper andlower qpos reported here. it is therefore difficult to be certain of theimplications of the abrupt change in the lower qpo at ~850 hz. we discussvarious possible causes, including that the drop in coherence is ultimatelycaused by effects related to the innermost stable circular orbit (abridged).

astro-ph;0510094	drop of coherence of the lower kilo-hz qpo in neutron stars: is there a  link with the innermost stable circular orbit?	using all available archival data from the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte), we follow the frequency of the kilo-hz qpos in three low luminosityneutron star low mass x-ray binaries; namely 4u 1636-536, 4u 1608-522, and4u1735-44. following earlier work, we focus our analysis on the lower kilo-hzqpo, for which we study the dependency of its quality factor (q) amplitude as afunction of frequency over a range covering from 500 hz to 1000 hz. aspreviously found for 4u 1636-536, we show that the quality factor of the lowerkilo-hz increases with frequency up to a maximum frequency around 800 hz,beyond which an abrupt drop of its coherence is observed down to a limitingfrequency where the qpo disappears completely. simultaneously the amplitude ofthe qpos is almost constant below the peak frequency and starts to decreasesmoothly afterwards. the peak frequency is 850 hz, 820 hz, 740 hz whereas thelimiting frequency is 920 hz, 900 hz and 830 hz for 4u 1636-536, 4u 1608-522and 4u 1735-44 respectively. a ceiling of the lower qpo frequencies is alsoseen clearly in a frequency versus count rate diagram for all sources. thisbehavior is reproducible within an object and between objects. we suggest herethat the drop of coherence of the lower qpo may be a geometry-related effect,which could be related to the last stable circular orbit.

astro-ph;0605486	the coherence of khz quasi-periodic oscillations in the x-rays from  accreting neutron stars	we study in a systematic way the quality factor of the lower and upper khzqpos in a sample of low luminosity neutron star x-ray binaries, showing bothqpos varying over a wide frequency range. the sample includes 4u 1636-536, 4u1608-522, 4u 1735-44, 4u 1728-34, 4u 1820-303 and 4u 0614+09. we find that allsources except 4u 0614+091 show evidence of a drop in the quality factor oftheir lower khz qpos at high frequency. for 4u 0614+091 only the rising part ofthe quality factor versus frequency curve has been sampled so far. at the sametime, in all sources but 4u 1728-34, the quality factor of the upper kilo-hzqpo increases all the way to the highest detectable frequencies. we show thatthe high-frequency behaviours of both the lower and upper khz qpo qualityfactors are consistent with what is expected if the drop is produced by theapproach of an active oscillating region to the innermost stable circularorbit: the existence of which is a key feature of general relativity in thestrong field regime. within this interpretation, our results implygravitational masses around 2 solar masses for the neutron stars in thosesystems.

astro-ph;0606085	x-ray timing beyond the rossi x-ray timing explorer	with its ability to look at bright galactic x-ray sources withsub-millisecond time resolution, the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte)discovered that the x-ray emission from accreting compact stars showsquasi-periodic oscillations on the dynamical timescales of the strong fieldregion. rxte showed also that waveform fitting of the oscillations resultingfrom hot spots at the surface of rapidly rotating neutron stars constrain theirmasses and radii. these two breakthroughs suddenly opened up a new window onfundamental physics, by providing new insights on strong gravity and densematter. building upon the rxte legacy, in the cosmic vision exercise, testinggeneral relativity in the strong field limit and constraining the equation ofstate of dense matter were recognized recently as key goals to be pursued inthe esa science program for the years 2015-2025. this in turn identified theneed for a large (10 m2 class) aperture x-ray observatory. in recognition ofthis need, the xeus mission concept which has evolved into a single launch l2formation flying mission will have a fast timing instrument in the focal plane.in this paper i will outline the unique science that will be addressed withfast x-ray timing on xeus.

astro-ph;0701312	supporting evidence for the signature of the innermost stable circular  orbit in rossi x-ray data from 4u1636-536	analysis of archival rxte data on neutron stars binaries has shown that forseveral sources the quality factor (q) of the lower kilohertz quasi-periodicoscillations (qpo) drops sharply beyond a certain frequency. this is onepossible signature of the approach to the general relativistic innermost stablecircular orbit (isco), but the implications of such an interpretation forstrong gravity and dense matter are important enough that it is essential toexplore alternate explanations. in this spirit, mendez has recently proposedthat q depends fundamentally on mass accretion rate (as measured by spectralhardness) rather than the frequency of the qpo. we test this hypothesis for4u1636-536 by measuring precisely spectral colors simultaneously with the lowerqpo frequency and q after correction for the frequency drift, over a data setspanning eight years of rxte observations. we find that in this source there isno correlation between q and spectral hardness. in particular, no apparentchanges in hardness are observed when q reaches its maximum before droppingoff. we perform a similar analysis on 4u1608-522; another source showing asharp drop in the quality factor of its lower khz qpo. we find that for thissource, positive and negative correlations are observed between spectralhardness, frequency and q. consequently, if we are to search for a commonexplanation for the sharp drop in the quality factor seen in both sources, thespectral hardness is not a good candidate for the independent variable whereasthe frequency remains. therefore, we conclude that the isco explanation isviable for 4u1636-536, and thus possibly for others.

astro-ph;9509139	models of quiescent black hole neutron star soft x-ray transients	when the mass accretion rate onto a black hole (bh) falls below a criticalrate, ${\dot m}_{crit}\sim \alpha^2 {\dot m}_{edd}$, accretion can occur via ahot optically thin flow where most of the dissipated energy is advected inward.we present such an advection-dominated model for the soft x-ray transient (sxt)a0620-00. this source has a puzzlingly low x-ray luminosity in quiescence,$\sim 6\times 10^{30} ~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, despite a relatively high massaccretion rate $\sim10^{-10} ~m_{\odot}{\rm yr^{-1}}$ deduced from its opticalflux. the accreting gas makes a transition from a standard thin disc at largeradii to an advection-dominated flow at small radii. the transition occurs whenthe effective temperature of the thin disc is $\sim 10^4$ k. because of thevery low accretion efficiency, $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}$, in the inner flow, themodel fits both the optical and x-ray data. we also present models for v404 cygand nova mus 1991 in quiescence. quiescent neutron star (ns) transients areexpected to appear very different from bh systems because the advected energyis re-radiated from the ns surface whereas a bh swallows the advected energy.we discuss models for ns sxts.

astro-ph;9610014	advection-dominated accretion model of the black hole v404 cyg in  quiescence	we have analyzed archival asca data on the soft x-ray transient source v404cyg in quiescence. we find that in the energy range 0.7 to 8.5 kev the spectrumis a hard power-law with a photon spectral index between 1.8 and 2.6 (90%confidence limits). we present a model of v404 cyg in which the accretion flowhas two components: (1) an outer thin disk with a small annular extent, and (2)a large interior region where the flow is advection-dominated. nearly all theradiation in the infrared, optical, uv and x-ray bands is from theadvection-dominated zone; the thin disk radiates primarily in the infraredwhere it contributes about ten percent of the observed flux. the spectrum wecalculate with this model is in excellent agreement with the asca x-ray datapresented here, as well as with previous optical data. moreover, the fit isvery insensitive to the choice of parameters such as black hole mass, orbitalinclination, viscosity coefficient $\alpha$, and magnetic field strength. weconsider the success of the model to be strong support for theadvection-dominated accretion paradigm, and further evidence of the black holenature of v404 cyg. we discuss strategies whereby systems withadvection-dominated accretion could be used to prove the reality of eventhorizons in black holes.

astro-ph;9706100	energy spectra and high frequency oscillations in 4u 0614+091	we investigate the behavior of the high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations(qpos) in 4u 0614+091, combining timing and spectral analysis of rxteobservations. the energy spectra of the source can be described by a power law(alpha ~ 2.8) and a blackbody (kt ~ 1.5), with the blackbody accounting for 10- 20% of the total energy flux. we find a robust correlation of the frequency,nu, of the higher frequency qpo near 1 khz with the flux of the blackbody,f_bb. the slope of this correlation, dlog(nu)/dlog(f_bb), is 0.27 to 0.37. thesource follows the same relation even in observations separated by severalmonths. the qpo frequency does not have a similarly unique correlation with thetotal flux or the flux of the power law component. the rms fraction of thehigher frequency qpo rises with energy from 6.8 +- 1.5 % (3-5 kev) to 21.3 +-4.0 % (10-12 kev). for the lower frequency qpo, however, it is consistent witha constant value of 5.4 +- 0.9 %. the results may be interpreted in terms of abeat frequency model for the production of the high frequency qpos.

astro-ph;9806052	evolution of aql x-1 during the rising phase of its 1998 outburst	we present results from 16 snapshots of aql x-1 with rxte during the risingphase of its recent outburst. the observations were carried out at a typicalrate of once or twice per day. the source shows interesting spectral evolutionduring this period. phenomenologically, it bears remarkable similarities to``atoll'' sources. shortly after the onset of the outburst, the source is seento be in an ``island'' state, but with little x-ray variability. it thenappears to have made a rapid spectral transition (on a time scale less thanhalf a day) to another ``island'' state, where it evolves slightly and staysfor 4 days. in this state, the observed x-ray flux becomes increasinglyvariable as the source brightens. quasi-period oscillation (qpo) in the x-rayintensity is detected in the frequency range 670--870 hz. the qpo frequencyincreases with the x-ray flux while its fractional rms decreases. the qpobecomes undetectable following a transition to a ``banana'' state, where thesource continues its evolution by moving up and down the ``banana'' branch inthe color-color diagram as the flux (presumably, the mass accretion rate)fluctuates around the peak of the outburst. throughout the entire period, thepower density spectrum is dominated by very-low frequency noises. little powercan be seen above ~1 hz, which is different from typical ``atoll'' sources. inthe ``banana'' state, the overall x-ray variability remains low (withfractional rms ~3--4%) but roughly constant. the observed x-ray spectrum issoft with few photons from above $\sim$25 kev, implying the thermal origin ofthe emission. the evolution of both spectral and temporal x-ray properties isdiscussed in the context of disk-instability models.
