0902.1535	chemical enrichment in cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics  simulations	(abridged) we present an implementation of stellar evolution and chemicalfeedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph) simulations. we consider thetimed release of individual elements by both massive (type ii supernovae andstellar winds) and intermediate mass stars (type ia supernovae and asymptoticgiant branch stars). we illustrate the results of our method using a suite ofcosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling,star formation, and galactic winds. radiative cooling is implementedelement-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and wetrack all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling.we contrast two reasonable definitions of the metallicity of a resolutionelement and find that while they agree for high metallicities, there are largedifferences at low metallicities. we argue the discrepancy is indicative of thelack of metal mixing caused by the fact that metals are stuck to particles. weargue that since this is a (numerical) sampling problem, solving it using apoorly constrained physical process such as diffusion could have undesiredconsequences. we demonstrate that the two metallicity definitions result inredshift z = 0 stellar masses that can differ by up to a factor of two, becauseof the sensitivity of the cooling rates to the elemental abundances. we findthat by z = 0 most of the metals are locked up in stars. the gaseous metals aredistributed over a very wide range of gas densities and temperatures. theshock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium has a relatively high metallicity of~ 10^-1 z_sun that evolves only weakly and is therefore an important reservoirof metals.

0905.3554	the origin of extended disk galaxies at z=2	galaxy formation models typically assume that the size and rotation speed ofgalaxy disks are largely dictated by the mass, concentration, and spin of theirsurrounding dark matter haloes. equally important, however, are the fraction ofbaryons in the halo that collect into the central galaxy, as well as the netangular momentum that they are able to retain during its assembly process. weexplore the latter using a set of four large cosmological n-body/gasdynamicalsimulations drawn from the owls (overwhelmingly large simulations) project.these runs differ only in their implementation of feedback from supernovae. wefind that, when expressed as fractions of their virial values, galaxy mass andnet angular momentum are tightly correlated. galaxy mass fractions,m_d=m_gal/m_vir, depend strongly on feedback, but only weakly on halo mass orspin over the halo mass range explored here (m_vir&gt;1e11 h^{-1}m_sun). theangular momentum of a galaxy, j_d=j_gal/j_vir, correlates with m_d in a mannerthat is insensitive to feedback and that deviates strongly from the simple j_d= m_d assumption often adopted in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. them_d-j_d correlation implies that, in a given halo, galaxy disk size is maximalwhen the central galaxy makes up a substantial fraction (~20%-30%) of allbaryons within the virial radius. at z=2, such systems may host gaseous diskswith radial scale lengths as large as those reported for star-forming disks bythe sins survey, even in moderately massive haloes of average spin. extendeddisks at z=2 may thus signal the presence of systems where galaxy formation hasbeen particularly efficient, rather than the existence of haloes with unusuallyhigh spin parameter.

0905.3555	disk galaxies at z=2 in owls	we use the owls (overwhelmingly large simulations) set of cosmologicalnbody/gasdynamical simulations to study the properties of simulated galaxies atz=2. we focus on the effect of supernova feedback from evolving stars on thebaryonic mass and angular momentum content of galaxies that assemble at thecenter of 1e11-3e12 h^{-1}m_\odot halos. our main finding is that the mass andangular momentum of such galaxies are strongly coupled, in a way that isapproximately independent of feedback: varying the feedback implementationleads, in a given halo, to large variations in galaxy mass but leaves thegalaxy mass-angular momentum correlation largely unaltered. in particular, theratio between the angular momentum of a galaxy and that of its surrounding halo(j_d=j_gal/j_vir) correlates closely with the galaxy mass (expressed in unitsof the virial mass of the halo; m_d=m_gal/m_vir). this correlation differssubstantially from the m_d=j_d assumption commonly adopted in semianalyticmodels of galaxy formation. we use these results to infer the sizes of diskgalaxies at z=2 expected in the lcdm scenario and to interpret recentobservations of extended disks at z~2 by the sins collaboration

0906.4350	galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation --i. galaxy  formation as a function of large-scale environment	[abridged] we present the first results of hydrodynamical simulations thatfollow the formation of galaxies to z=0 in spherical regions of radius ~20mpc/h drawn from the millennium simulation. the regions have overdensities thatdeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is therms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20mpc/h at z=1.5. the simulations have massresolution of up to 10^6 msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scaleenvironments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (mpc/h)^3millennium volume. they include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionisingbackground, sne feedback and winds, but no agn. we find that the specific sfrdensity at z &lt;~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to anorder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproducesobservational data. massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in thegoods fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appearin the underdense regions until z~3. these environmental variations are notcaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, butrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment toanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.at all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250km/s. however, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (evenin the absence of agn): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 havemostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically format later times. however, additional feedback is required to limit starformation in massive galaxies at late times.

0909.5196	the physics driving the cosmic star formation history	we investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation (sf) historyusing the more than fifty large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations thattogether comprise the overwhelmingly large simulations (owls) project. wesystematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physicalprocesses are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. generically,we find that sf is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at highredshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases asit is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gasexhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. the higherredshift sf is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters andto a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. the location and heightof the peak in the sf history, and the steepness of the decline towards thepresent, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black holefeedback. mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling bothboost the sf rate at late times. galaxies form stars in a self-regulatedfashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedbackfrom massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling andaccretion. paradoxically, the sf rate is highly insensitive to the assumed sflaw. this can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the sf efficiencyis changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the samerate of production of massive stars. self-regulated feedback from accretingblack holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed sf ratebelow redshift two, although more extreme feedback from sf, for example in theform of a top-heavy imf at high gas pressures, can help.

0910.5723	metal-line emission from the warm-hot intergalactic medium: i. soft  x-rays	emission lines from metals offer one of the most promising ways to detect theelusive warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim; 10^5 k&lt;t&lt;10^7 k), which is thoughtto contain a substantial fraction of the baryons in the low-redshift universe.we present predictions for the soft x-ray line emission from the whim using asubset of cosmological simulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations(owls) project. we use the owls models to test the dependence of the predictedemission on a range of physical prescriptions, such as cosmology, gas coolingand feedback from star formation and accreting black holes. provided thatmetal-line cooling is taken into account, the models give surprisingly similarresults, indicating that the predictions are robust. soft x-ray lines trace thehotter part of the whim (t&gt;10^6 k). we find that the oviii 18.97a is thestrongest emission line, with a predicted maximum surface brightness of ~10^2photon/s/cm^2/sr, but a number of other lines are only slightly weaker. alllines show a strong correlation between the intensity of the observed flux andthe density and metallicity of the gas responsible for the emission. on theother hand, the potentially detectable emission consistently corresponds to thetemperature at which the emissivity of the electronic transition peaks. theemission traces neither the baryonic nor the metal mass. in particular, theemission that is potentially detectable with proposed missions, tracesoverdense (rho&gt;10^2rho_mean) and metal-rich (z&gt;0.1z_sun) gas in and aroundgalaxies and groups. while soft x-ray line emission is therefore not apromising route to close the baryon budget, it does offer the excitingpossibility to image the gas accreting onto and flowing out of galaxies.

0911.2641	the case for agn feedback in galaxy groups	[abridged] the relatively recent insight that energy input from supermassiveblack holes (bhs) can have a substantial effect on the star formation rates(sfrs) of galaxies motivates us to examine its effects on the scale of galaxygroups. at present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significantfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. to explore the effectsof bh feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydrosimulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations project. while bothinclude galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback frombhs. we compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range ofobservational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (l-m-t) scaling relations, k-bandluminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (cbg), sfrs and agesof the cbg, and gas/stellar metallicities. both runs yield entropy profilessimilar to the data, while the run without agn feedback yields highly peakedtemperature profiles, in discord with the observations. energy input from bhssignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 msun,yielding fgas-t and l-t relations that are in agreement with the data. the runwithout agn feedback suffers from the well known overcooling problem; theresulting k-band luminosities are much larger than observed. by contrast, therun that includes bh feedback yields k-band luminosities and cbg sfrs and agesin agreement with current estimates. both runs yield very similar gas-phasemetallicities that match x-ray data, but they predict very different stellarmetallicities. based on the above, galaxy groups provide a compelling case thatbh feedback is a crucial ingredient in the formation of massive galaxies.

1001.3447	impact of baryon physics on dark matter structures: a detailed  simulation study of halo density profiles	the back-reaction of baryons on the dark matter halo density profile is ofgreat interest, not least because it is an important systematic uncertaintywhen attempting to detect the dark matter. here, we draw on a large suite ofhigh resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to systematicallyinvestigate this process and its dependence on the baryonic physics associatedwith galaxy formation. the inclusion of baryons results in significantly moreconcentrated density profiles if radiative cooling is efficient and feedback isweak. the dark matter halo concentration can in that case increase by as muchas 30 (10) per cent on galaxy (cluster) scales. the most significant effectsoccur in galaxies at high redshift, where there is a strong anti-correlationbetween the baryon fraction in the halo centre and the inner slope of both thetotal and the dark matter density profiles. if feedback is weak, isothermalinner profiles form, in agreement with observations of massive, early-typegalaxies. however, we find that agn feedback, or extremely efficient feedbackfrom massive stars, is necessary to match observed stellar fractions in groupsand clusters, as well as to keep the maximum circular velocity similar to thevirial velocity as observed for disk galaxies. these strong feedback modelsreduce the baryon fraction in galaxies by a factor of 3 relative to the casewith no feedback. the agn is even capable of reducing the baryon fraction by afactor of 2 in the inner region of group and cluster haloes. this in turnresults in inner density profiles which are typically shallower than isothermaland the halo concentrations tend to be lower than in the absence of baryons.

1002.3393	metal-line emission from the warm-hot intergalactic medium: ii.  ultraviolet	approximately half the baryons in the local universe are thought to reside inthe warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). emission lines from metals in the uvband are excellent tracers of the cooler fraction of this gas. we presentpredictions for the surface brightness of a sample of uv lines that couldpotentially be observed by the next generation of uv telescopes at z&lt;1. we usea subset of simulations from the owls project to create emission maps and toinvestigate the effect of varying the physical prescriptions for starformation, supernova and agn feedback, chemodynamics and radiative cooling.most models produce results in agreement within a factor of a few, indicatingthat the predictions are robust. of the lines we consider, c iii is thestrongest line, but it typically traces gas colder than 10^5 k. the same istrue for si iv. the second strongest line, c iv, traces circum-galactic gaswith t~10^5 k. o vi and ne viii probe the warmer (t~10^5.5 k and t~10^6 k,respectively) and more diffuse gas that may be a better tracer of the largescale structure. n v emission is intermediate between c iv and o vi. theintensity of all emission lines increases strongly with gas density andmetallicity, and for the bright emission it is tightly correlated with thetemperature for which the line emissivity is highest. in particular, the c iii,c iv, si iv and o vi emission that is sufficiently bright to be potentiallydetectable in the near future (&gt;10^3 photon/s/cm^2/sr), comes from relativelydense (rho&gt;10^2 rho_mean) and metal rich (z&gt;0.1 z_sun) gas. as such, emissionlines are highly biased tracers of the missing baryons and are not an optimaltool to close the baryon budget. however, they do provide a powerful means todetect the gas cooling onto or flowing out of galaxies and groups.

1004.5386	feedback and the structure of simulated galaxies at redshift z=2	we study the properties of simulated high-redshift galaxies usingcosmological n-body/gasdynamical runs from the overwhelmingly large simulations(owls) project. the runs contrast several feedback implementations of varyingeffectiveness: from no-feedback, to supernova-driven winds to powerfulagn-driven outflows. these different feedback models result in large variationsin the abundance and structural properties of bright galaxies at z=2. we findthat feedback affects the baryonic mass of a galaxy much more severely than itsspin, which is on average roughly half that of its surrounding dark matter haloin our runs. feedback induces strong correlations between angular momentumcontent and galaxy mass that leave their imprint on galaxy scaling relationsand morphologies. encouragingly, we find that galaxy disks are common inmoderate-feedback runs, making up typically ~50% of all galaxies at the centersof haloes with virial mass exceeding 1e11 m_sun. the size, stellar masses, andcircular speeds of simulated galaxies formed in such runs have properties thatstraddle those of large star-forming disks and of compact early-type galaxiesat z=2. once the detailed abundance and structural properties of these rareobjects are well established it may be possible to use them to gauge theoverall efficacy of feedback in the formation of high redshift galaxies.

1005.3921	the enrichment history of cosmic metals	we use a suite of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to investigate thechemical enrichment history of the universe. specifically, we trace the originof the metals back in time to investigate when various gas phases were enrichedand by what halo masses. we find that the age of the metals decreases stronglywith the density of the gas in which they end up. at least half of the metalsthat reside in the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) at redshift zero (two)were ejected from galaxies above redshift two (three). the mass of the haloesthat last contained the metals increases rapidly with the gas density. morethan half of the mass in intergalactic metals was ejected by haloes with totalmasses less than 1e11 solar masses and stellar masses less than 1e9 solarmasses. the range of halo masses that contributes to the enrichment is widerfor the hotter part of the igm. by combining the `when' and `by what' aspectsof the enrichment history, we show that metals residing in lower density gaswere typically ejected earlier and by lower mass haloes.

1007.2840	absorption signatures of warm-hot gas at low redshift: ovi	we investigate the origin and physical properties of ovi absorbers at lowredshift (z = 0.25) using a subset of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulationsfrom the overwhelmingly large simulations (owls) project. intervening oviabsorbers are believed to trace shock-heated gas in the warm-hot intergalacticmedium (whim) and may thus play a key role in the search for the missingbaryons in the present-day universe. when compared to observations, thepredicted distributions of the different ovi line parameters (column density,doppler parameter, rest equivalent width) from our simulations exhibit a lackof strong ovi absorbers. this suggests that physical processes on sub-gridscales (e.g. turbulence) may strongly influence the observed properties of ovisystems. we find that the intervening ovi absorption arises mainly in highlymetal-enriched (0.1 &lt;&lt; z/z_sun &lt; 1) gas at typical overdensities of 1 &lt;&lt;rho/&lt;rho&gt; &lt; 100. one third of the ovi absorbers in our simulation are found totrace gas at temperatures t &lt; 10^5 k, while the rest arises in gas at highertemperatures around t =10^5.3 k. the ovi resides in a similar region of(rho,t)-space as much of the shock-heated baryonic matter, but the vastmajority of this gas has a lower metal content and does not give rise todetectable ovi absorption as a consequence of the patchy metal distribution,ovi absorbers in our simulations trace only a very small fraction of the cosmicbaryons (&lt;2 percent) and the cosmic metals. instead, these systems presumablytrace previously shock-heated, metal-rich material from galactic winds that isnow cooling. the common approach of comparing ovi and hi column densities toestimate the physical conditions in intervening absorbers from qso observationsmay be misleading, as most of the hi (and most of the gas mass) is notphysically connected with the high-metallicity patches that give rise to theovi absorption.

1008.4799	gas expulsion by quasar-driven winds as a solution to the over-cooling  problem in galaxy groups and clusters	galaxy groups are not scaled down versions of massive galaxy clusters - thehot gas in groups (known as the intragroup medium, igrm for short) is, onaverage, less dense than the intracluster medium, implying that one or morenon-gravitational processes (e.g., radiative cooling, star formation, and/orfeedback) has had a relatively larger effect on groups. in the present study,we compare a number of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that form part ofthe overwhelmingly large simulations project to isolate and quantify theeffects of cooling and feedback from supernovae (sne) and active galacticnuclei (agn) on the gas. this is achieved by comparing lagrangian thermalhistories of the gas in the different runs, which were all started fromidentical initial conditions. while radiative cooling, star formation, and snfeedback are all necessary ingredients, only runs that also include agnfeedback are able to successfully reproduce the optical and x-ray properties ofgroups and low-mass clusters. we isolate how, when, and exactly what gas isheated by agn. interestingly, we find that the gas that constitutes thepresent-day igrm is that which was not strongly heated by agn. instead, the lowmedian density/high median entropy of the gas in present-day groups is achievedby the ejection of lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies at highredshift (primarily 2 &lt; z &lt; 4). this corresponds to the epoch when supermassiveblack holes accreted most of their mass, typically at a rate that is close tothe eddington limit (i.e., when the black holes are in a `quasar mode').

0709.0292	on the relation between the schmidt and kennicutt-schmidt star formation  laws and its implications for numerical simulations	when averaged over large scales, star formation in galaxies is observed tofollow the empirical kennicutt-schmidt (ks) law for surface densities above aconstant threshold. while the observed law involves surface densities,theoretical models and simulations generally work with volume density laws(i.e. schmidt laws). we derive analytic relations between star formation lawsexpressed in terms of surface densities, volume densities, and pressures and weshow how these relations depend on parameters such as the effective equation ofstate of the multiphase interstellar medium. our analytic relations enable usto implement observed surface density laws into simulations. because theparameters of our prescription for star formation are observables, we are notfree to tune them to match the observations. we test our theoretical frameworkusing high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies that assume aneffective equation of state for the multiphase interstellar medium. we are ableto reproduce the star formation threshold and both the slope and thenormalisation of arbitrary input ks laws without tuning any parameters and withvery little scatter, even for unstable galaxies and even if we use poornumerical resolution. moreover, we can do so for arbitrary effective equationsof state. our prescription therefore enables simulations of galaxies to bypassour current inability to simulate the formation of stars. on the other hand,the fact that we can reproduce arbitrary input thresholds and ks laws, ratherthan just the particular ones picked out by nature, indicates that simulationsthat lack the physics and/or resolution to simulate the multiphase interstellarmedium can only provide limited insight into the origin of the observed starformation laws.

1011.2491	the rates and modes of gas accretion on to galaxies and their gaseous  haloes	(abridged) we study the rate at which gas accretes onto galaxies and haloesand investigate whether the accreted gas was shocked to high temperaturesbefore reaching a galaxy. for this purpose we use a suite of largecosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the owls project. we improve onprevious work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, bydistinguishing accretion onto haloes and galaxies, by including importantfeedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. thespecific rate of gas accretion onto haloes is, like that for dark matter, onlyweakly dependent on halo mass. for halo masses mhalo&gt;&gt;10^11 msun it isrelatively insensitive to feedback processes. in contrast, accretion rates ontogalaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven bysupernovae and active galactic nuclei. galactic winds increase the halo mass atwhich the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude tomhalo~10^12 msun. gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatureseither of order the virial temperature or &lt;~10^5 k. the fraction of gasaccreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-linecooling. it increases with decreasing redshift, but is mostly determined byhalo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10% for ~10^11 msun to greaterthan 90% at 10^13 msun. in contrast, for accretion onto galaxies the cold modeis always significant and the relative contributions of the two accretion modesare more sensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. the majority of starspresent in any mass halo at any redshift were formed from gas accreted in thecold mode, although the hot mode contributes typically over 10% formhalo&gt;~10^11 msun. galaxies, but not necessarily their gaseous haloes, arepredominantly fed by gas that did not experience an accretion shock when itentered the host halo.

1011.5502	the filling factor of intergalactic metals at redshift z=3	observations of quasar absorption line systems reveal that the z=3intergalactic medium (igm) is polluted by heavy elements down to hi opticaldepths tau_hi&lt;&lt;10. what is not yet clear, however, is what fraction of thevolume needs to be enriched by metals and whether it suffices to enrich onlyregions close to galaxies in order to reproduce the observations. we use gasdensity fields derived from large cosmological simulations, together withsynthetic quasar spectra and imposed, model metal distributions to investigatewhat enrichment patterns can reproduce the observed median optical depth of civas a function of tau_hi. our models can only satisfy the observationalconstraints if the z=3 igm was primarily enriched by galaxies that reside inlow-mass (m_tot&lt;10^10 m_sun) haloes that can eject metals out to distances&gt;10^2 kpc. galaxies in more massive haloes cannot possibly account for theobservations as they are too rare for their outflows to cover a sufficientlylarge fraction of the volume. galaxies need to enrich gas out to distances thatare much greater than the virial radii of their host haloes. assuming themetals to be well mixed on small scales, our modeling requires that thefractions of the simulated volume and baryonic mass that are polluted withmetals are, respectively, &gt;10% and &gt;50% in order to match observations.

1102.2526	cosmological simulations of the formation of the stellar haloes around  disc galaxies	we use the galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic)suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation ofstellar spheroids of milky way-mass disc galaxies. the simulations containaccurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star formation,supernova feedback, and chemodynamics, and the large volumes that have beensimulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of ~400 simulated l_* discgalaxies. the simulated galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low-surfacebrightness stellar haloes that extend out to ~100 kpc and beyond. the diffusestellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed aroundthe milky way, m31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surfacebrightness, and metallicity profiles. we show that in situ star formationtypically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r &lt; 30 kpc,whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origininduces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles,which is also present in the observational data. the system-to-system scatterin the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans overa factor of 4. consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shapeand normalisation of the spheroid density profile within r &lt; 30 kpc (e.g., whenfit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). weshow that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formationepoch of the system. dynamically older systems have, on average, largercontributions from in situ star formation, although there is significantsystem-to-system scatter in this relationship. thus, in situ star formationlikely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pureaccretion-based models to reproduce the observed properties of the innerspheroid.

1102.3912	the drop in the cosmic star formation rate below redshift 2 is caused by  a change in the mode of gas accretion and by agn feedback	the cosmic star formation rate is observed to drop sharply after redshiftz=2. we use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulationto investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretionand to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (agn). we find that the dropin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the globalcold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gasconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. here we define cold-mode(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has neverexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 k. in contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaksat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constantthereafter. by the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the globalaccretion rate onto haloes. star formation does not track hot-mode haloaccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. agnfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that enteredhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.consequently, in the absence of agn feedback, gas accreted in the hot modewould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off inthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep.

1104.1174	the effects of galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum: a  challenge for precision cosmology	upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as lsst, euclid, and wfirst, aim tomeasure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. in order tofully exploit these observations, models are needed that, given a set ofcosmological parameters, can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum atthe level of 1% or better for scales corresponding to comoving wave numbers0.1&lt;k&lt;10 h/mpc. we have employed the large suite of simulations from the owlsproject to investigate the effects of various baryonic processes on the matterpower spectrum. in addition, we have examined the distribution of power overdifferent mass components, the back-reaction of the baryons on the cdm, and theevolution of the dominant effects on the matter power spectrum. we find thatsingle baryonic processes are capable of changing the power spectrum by up toseveral tens of per cent. our simulation that includes agn feedback, which weconsider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in previousstudies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduceoptical and x-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease inpower relative to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z=0, from 1% atk~0.3 h/mpc to 10% at k~1 h/mpc and to 30% at k~10 h/mpc. this contradicts thenaive view that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominanteffect only for k&gt;70 h/mpc. therefore, baryons, and particularly agn feedback,cannot be ignored in theoretical power spectra for k&gt;0.3 h/mpc. it will thus benecessary to improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxyformation, or at least to constrain them through auxiliary observations, beforewe can fulfil the goals of upcoming weak lensing surveys.

1105.3729	implementation of feedback in sph: towards concordance of methods	we perform simulations of feedback from supernovae and black holes withsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph). such strong perturbations areinaccurately handled with standard time integration schemes, leading to poorenergy conservation, a problem that is commonly overlooked. we show for thefirst time that, in the absence of radiative cooling, concordance of thermaland kinetic feedback are achieved when using an accurate time integration. inorder to preserve the concordance of feedback methods when using a moreefficient time integration scheme - as for instance the hierarchical time-stepscheme - we implement a modified version of the time-step limiter proposed bysaitoh &amp; makino (2009). we apply the limiter to general test cases, and firstshow that this scheme violates energy conservation up to almost four orders ofmagnitude when energy is injected at random times. to tackle this issue, wefind necessary, not only to ensure a fast information propagation, but also toenforce a prompt response of the system to the energy perturbation. the methodproposed here to handle strong feedback events enables us to achieve energyconservation at percent level in all tests, even if all the available energy isinjected into only one particle. we argue that concordance of feedback methodscan be achieved in numerical simulations only if the time integration schemepreserve a high energy conservation level.

1107.3720	modelling neutral hydrogen in galaxies using cosmological hydrodynamical  simulations	the characterisation of the atomic and molecular hydrogen content ofhigh-redshift galaxies is a major observational challenge that will beaddressed over the coming years with a new generation of radio telescopes. weinvestigate this important issue by considering the states of hydrogen across arange of structures within high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations. additionally, our simulations allow us to investigate thesensitivity of our results to numerical resolution and to sub-grid baryonicphysics (especially feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei). wefind that the most significant uncertainty in modelling the neutral hydrogendistribution arises from our need to model a self-shielding correction inmoderate density regions. future simulations incorporating radiative transferschemes will be vital to improve on our empirical self-shielding threshold.irrespective of the exact nature of the threshold we find that while the atomichydrogen mass function evolves only mildly from redshift two to zero, themolecular hydrogen mass function increases with increasing redshift, especiallyat the high-mass end. interestingly, the weak evolution of the neutral hydrogenmass function is insensitive to the feedback scheme utilised, but the oppositeis true for the molecular gas, which is more closely associated with the starformation in the simulations.

1112.2220	the origin of disks and spheroids in simulated galaxies	in the simplest scenario, disk galaxies form predominantly in halos with highangular momentum and quiet recent assembly history, whereas spheroids are theslowly-rotating remnants of repeated merging events. we explore theseassumptions using one hundred systems with halo masses similar to that of themilky way, identified in a series of cosmological gasdynamical simulationsgimic. at z=0, the simulated galaxies exhibit a wide variety of morphologies,from dispersion-dominated spheroids to pure disk galaxies. surprisingly, thesemorphological features are very poorly correlated with their halo properties:disks form in halos with high and low net spin, and mergers play a negligiblerole in the formation of spheroid stars, most of which form in-situ. moreimportant to morphology is the coherent alignment of the angular momentum ofbaryons that accrete over time to form a galaxy. spheroids tend to form whenthe spin of newly-accreted gas is misaligned with that of the extant galaxy,leading to the episodic formation of stars with different kinematics thatcancel out the net rotation of the system. disks, on the other hand, form outof gas that flows in with similar angular momentum to that of earlier-accretedmaterial. gas accretion from a hot corona thus favours disk formation, whereasgas that flows "cold", often along separate, misaligned filaments, favours theformation of spheroids. in this scenario, most spheroids consist ofsuperpositions of stellar components with distinct kinematics, age, andmetallicity, an arrangement that might survive to the present day given thepaucity of major mergers. since angular momentum is acquired largely atturnaround, morphology is imprinted early by the interplay of the tidal fieldand the shape of the material destined to form the galaxy.

1201.5641	absorption signatures of warm-hot gas at low redshift: broad hi  lyman-alpha absorbers	we investigate the physical state of hi absorbing gas at low redshift (z =0.25) using a subset of cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations from the owlsproject, focusing in particular on broad (b_hi &gt; 40 km/s) hi lyman-alphaabsorbers (blas), which are believed to originate in shock-heated gas in thewarm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). our fiducial model, which includesradiative cooling by heavy elements and feedback by supernovae and activegalactic nuclei, predicts that by z = 0.25 nearly 60 per cent of the gas massends up at densities and temperatures characteristic of the whim and we findthat half of this fraction is due to outflows. the standard hi observables(distribution of hi column densities n_hi, distribution of doppler parametersb_hi, b_hi - n_hi correlation) and the bla line number density predicted by oursimulations are in remarkably good agreement with observations.  blas arise in gas that is hotter, more highly ionised and more enriched thanthe gas giving rise to typical lyman-alpha forest absorbers. the majority ofthe blas arise in warm-hot (log (t/k) ~ 5) gas at low (log delta &lt; 1.5)overdensities. on average, thermal broadening accounts for at least 60 per centof the bla line width, which in turn can be used as a rough indicator of thethermal state of the gas. detectable blas account for only a small fraction ofthe true baryon content of the whim at low redshift. in order to detect thebulk of the mass in this gas phase, a sensitivity at least one order ofmagnitude better than achieved by current ultraviolet spectrographs isrequired. we argue that blas mostly trace gas that has been shock-heated andenriched by outflows and that they therefore provide an important window on apoorly understood feedback process.

1203.5667	simulating galactic outflows with thermal supernova feedback	cosmological simulations make use of sub-grid recipes for the implementationof galactic winds driven by massive stars because direct injection of supernovaenergy in thermal form leads to strong radiative losses, rendering the feedbackinefficient. we argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is amismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and themass of the parent stellar population. because too much mass is heated, thetemperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. we use analyticarguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numericalresolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injectedthermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. we then proposeand test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimumtemperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in bothparticle- and grid-based codes. we use smoothed particle hydrodynamicssimulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in darkmatter haloes with total mass 10^10 and 10^12 h^-1 solar masses. the thermalfeedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive,large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative coolingtemporarily. in accord with expectations derived from analytic arguments, forsufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposedtemperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employingkinetic feedback.

1204.5195	rotation rates, sizes, and star formation efficiencies of a  representative population of simulated disc galaxies	we examine the rotation rates, sizes, and star formation (sf) efficiencies ofa representative population of simulated disc galaxies extracted from thegalaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic) suite ofcosmological hydrodynamic simulations. these simulations include efficient, butenergetically feasible supernova feedback, but have not been tuned in any wayto produce 'realistic' disc galaxies. yet, they generate a large number ofdiscs, without requiring extremely high resolution. over the wide galaxystellar mass range, 9.0 &lt; log10[mstar (msun)] &lt; 10.5, the simulations reproducethe observed tully-fisher relation, the rotation curves of disc galaxies inbins of stellar mass, the mass-size relation of disc galaxies, the opticalrotation to virial circular velocity ratio (vopt/vvir), and the sf efficienciesof disc galaxies as inferred from stacked weak lensing and stacked satellitekinematics observations. they also reproduce the specific star formation ratesof ~l* galaxies but predict too low levels of star formation for low-massgalaxies, which is plausibly due to the finite resolution of the simulations.at higher stellar masses, log10[mstar (\msun)] &gt; 10.6, the simulated galaxiesare too concentrated and have too high sf efficiencies. we conjecture that thisshortcoming reflects the neglect of feedback from accreting supermassive blackholes in these simulations. we conclude that it is possible to generate arepresentative population of disc galaxies that reproduces many of the observedtrends of local disc galaxies using standard numerical hydrodynamic techniquesand a plausible implementation of the "subgrid" astrophysical processes thoughtto be relevant to galaxy formation.

1211.1021	physical properties of simulated galaxy populations at z=2 - i. effect  of metal-line cooling and feedback from star formation and agn	we use hydrodynamical simulations from the owls project to investigate thedependence of the physical properties of galaxy populations at redshift 2 onmetal-line cooling and feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei(agn). we find that if the sub-grid feedback from star formation is implementedkinetically, the feedback is only efficient if the initial wind velocityexceeds a critical value. this critical velocity increases with galaxy mass andalso if metal-line cooling is included. this suggests that radiative lossesquench the winds if their initial velocity is too low. if the feedback isefficient, then the star formation rate is inversely proportional to the amountof energy injected per unit stellar mass formed (which is proportional to theinitial mass loading for a fixed wind velocity). this can be understood if thestar formation is self-regulating, i.e. if the star formation rate (and thusthe gas fraction) increase until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.feedback from agn is efficient at high masses, while increasing the initialwind velocity with gas pressure or halo mass allows one to generate galaxy-wideoutflows at all masses. matching the observed galaxy mass function requiresefficient feedback. in particular, the predicted faint-end slope is too steepunless we resort to highly mass loaded winds for low-mass objects. suchefficient feedback from low-mass galaxies (m_* &lt;&lt; 10^10 msun) also reduces thediscrepancy with the observed specific star formation rates, which are higherthan predicted unless the feedback transitions from highly efficient toinefficient just below the observed stellar mass range.

1211.1670	the first billion years project - iv: proto-galaxies reionising the  universe	the contribution of stars in galaxies to cosmic reionisation depends on thestar formation history in the universe, the abundance of galaxies duringreionisation, the escape fraction of ionising photons and the clumping factorof the inter-galactic medium (igm). we compute the star formation rate andclumping factor during reionisation in a cosmological volume using ahigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulation. we post-process the output withdetailed radiative transfer simulations to compute the escape fraction ofionising photons. together, this gives us the opportunity to assess thecontribution of galaxies to reionisation self-consistently. the strong mass andredshift dependence of the escape fraction indicates that reionisation occurredbetween z=15 and z=10 and was mainly driven by proto-galaxies forming indark-matter haloes with masses between 1e7 and 1e8 solar mass. more massivegalaxies that are rare at these redshifts and have significantly lower escapefractions contribute less photons to the reionisation process than themore-abundant low-mass galaxies. star formation in the low-mass haloes issuppressed by radiative feedback from reionisation, therefore theseproto-galaxies only contribute when the part of the universe they live in isstill neutral. after z~10, massive galaxies become more abundant and providemost of the ionising photons. in addition, we find that population (pop) iiistars are too short-lived and not frequent enough to have a major contributionto reionisation. although the stellar component of the proto-galaxies thatproduce the bulk of ionising photons during reionisation is too faint to bedetected by the james webb space telescope (jwst), these sources are brightestin the h-alpha and ly-alpha recombination lines, which will likely be detectedby jwst in deep surveys.

1211.3120	physical properties of simulated galaxy populations at z=2 - ii. effects  of cosmology, reionization and ism physics	we use hydrodynamical simulations from the owls project to investigate thedependence of the physical properties of galaxy populations at redshift 2 onthe assumed star formation law, the equation of state imposed on the unresolvedinterstellar medium, the stellar initial mass function, the reionizationhistory, and the assumed cosmology. this work complements that of paper i,where we studied the effects of varying models for galactic winds driven bystar formation and agn. the normalisation of the matter power spectrum stronglyaffects the galaxy mass function, but has a relatively small effect on thephysical properties of galaxies residing in haloes of a fixed mass.reionization suppresses the stellar masses and gas fractions of low-massgalaxies, but by z = 2 the results are insensitive to the timing ofreionization. the stellar initial mass function mainly determines the physicalproperties of galaxies through its effect on the efficiency of the feedback,while changes in the recycled mass and metal fractions play a smaller role. ifwe use a recipe for star formation that reproduces the observed star formationlaw independently of the assumed equation of state of the unresolved ism, thenthe latter is unimportant. the star formation law, i.e. the gas consumptiontime scale as a function of surface density, determines the mass of dense,star-forming gas in galaxies, but affects neither the star formation rate northe stellar mass. this can be understood in terms of self-regulation: the gasfraction adjusts until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.

1306.1563	a measurement of galaxy halo mass from the surrounding hi ly{\alpha}  absorption	we measure the dark matter halo masses of z~2.36 uv color-selectedstar-forming galaxies by matching the observed median hi ly{\alpha} absorptionaround them, as observed in the spectra of background qsos, to the absorptionaround haloes above a given mass in cosmological simulations. focusing ontransverse separations 0-2 pmpc and line of sight separations 154-616 km/s, wefind a minimum halo mass of log10(mmin/msun)=11.6(+0.2)(-0.2), which is in goodagreement with published halo mass estimates from clustering analyses. weverified that the measured halo mass is insensitive to a change in thecosmological parameters (wmap1 vs. wmap3) and to the inclusion of strong agnfeedback. one unique strength of this method is that it can be used in narrowfield galaxy-qso surveys, i.e. ~30 x 30 arcseconds. in addition, we find thatthe observed anisotropy in the 2-d hi ly{\alpha} absorption distribution onscales of 1.5-2 pmpc is consistent with being a consequence of large-scale gasinfall into the potential wells occupied by galaxies.

1307.6879	the impact of different physical processes on the statistics of  lyman-limit and damped lyman-alpha absorbers	we compute the z = 3 neutral hydrogen column density distribution functionf(nhi) for 19 simulations drawn from the owls project using a post-processingcorrection for self-shielding calculated with full radiative transfer of theionising background radiation. we investigate how different physical processesand parameters affect the abundance of lyman-limit systems (llss) and dampedlyman-alpha absorbers (dlas) including: i) metal-line cooling; ii) theefficiency of feedback from sne and agn; iii) the effective equation of statefor the ism; iv) cosmological parameters; v) the assumed star formation lawand; vi) the timing of hydrogen reionization . we find that the normalisationand slope, d = d log10 f /d log10 nhi, of f(nhi) in the lls regime are robustto changes in these physical processes. among physically plausible models,f(nhi) varies by less than 0.2 dex and d varies by less than 0.18 for llss.this is primarily due to the fact that these uncertain physical processesmostly affect star-forming gas which contributes less than 10% to f(nhi) in thethe lls column density range. at higher column densities, variations in f(nhi)become larger (approximately 0.5 dex at nhi = 10^22 cm^-2 and 1.0 dex at nhi =10^23 cm^-2) and molecular hydrogen formation also becomes important. many ofthese changes can be explained in the context of self-regulated star formationin which the amount of star forming gas in a galaxy will adjust such thatoutflows driven by feedback balance inflows due to accretion. data and code toreproduce all figures can be found at the following url:https://bitbucket.org/galtay/hi-cddf-owls-1

0801.2770	simulating galactic outflows with kinetic supernova feedback	feedback from star formation is thought to play a key role in the formationand evolution of galaxies, but its implementation in cosmological simulationsis currently hampered by a lack of numerical resolution. we present and test asub-grid recipe to model feedback from massive stars in cosmological smoothedparticle hydrodynamics simulations. the energy is distributed in kinetic formamong the gas particles surrounding recently formed stars. the impact of thefeedback is studied using a suite of high-resolution simulations of isolateddisc galaxies embedded in dark halos with total mass 10^{10} and 10^{12}msol/h. we focus in particular on the effect of pressure forces on windparticles within the disc, which we turn off temporarily in some of our runs tomimic a recipe that has been widely used in the literature. we find that thispopular recipe gives dramatically different results because (ram) pressureforces on expanding superbubbles determine both the structure of the disc andthe development of large-scale outflows. pressure forces exerted by expandingsuperbubbles puff up the disc, giving the dwarf galaxy an irregular morphologyand creating a galactic fountain in the massive galaxy. hydrodynamic dragwithin the disc results in a strong increase of the effective mass loading ofthe wind for the dwarf galaxy, but quenches much of the outflow in the case ofthe high-mass galaxy.

1310.7571	the impact of baryonic processes on the two-point correlation functions  of galaxies, subhaloes and matter	the observed clustering of galaxies and the cross-correlation of galaxies andmass provide important constraints on both cosmology and models of galaxyformation. even though the dissipation and feedback processes associated withgalaxy formation are thought to affect the distribution of matter, essentiallyall models used to predict clustering data are based on collisionlesssimulations. here, we use large hydrodynamical simulations to investigate howgalaxy formation affects the autocorrelation functions of galaxies andsubhaloes, as well as their cross-correlation with matter. we show that thechanges due to the inclusion of baryons are not limited to small scales and areeven present in samples selected by subhalo mass. samples selected by subhalomass cluster ~10% more strongly in a baryonic run on scales r &gt; 1mpc/h, andthis difference increases for smaller separations. while the inclusion ofbaryons boosts the clustering at fixed subhalo mass on all scales, the sign ofthe effect on the cross-correlation of subhaloes with matter can vary withradius. we show that the large-scale effects are due to the change in subhalomass caused by the strong feedback associated with galaxy formation and maytherefore not affect samples selected by number density. however, on scales r &lt;r_vir significant differences remain after accounting for the change in subhalomass. we conclude that predictions for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-mass clusteringfrom models based on collisionless simulations will have errors greater than10% on sub-mpc scales, unless the simulation results are modified to correctlyaccount for the effects of baryons on the distributions of mass and satellites.

1311.1109	the first billion years project: dark matter haloes going from  contraction to expansion and back again	we study the effect of baryons on the inner dark matter profile of the firstgalaxies using the first billion years simulation between z=16-6 before secularevolution sets in. using a large statistical sample from two simulations of thesame volume and cosmological initial conditions, one with and one withoutbaryons, we are able to directly compare haloes with their baryon-freecounterparts, allowing a detailed study of the modifications to the dark matterdensity profile due to the presence of baryons during the first billion yearsof galaxy formation. for each of the ~ 5000 haloes in our sample we quantifythe impact of the baryons using eta, defined as the ratio of dark matter massenclosed in 100 pc in the baryonic run to its counterpart without baryons.during this epoch of rapid growth of galaxies, we find that many haloes ofthese first galaxies show an enhancement of dark matter in the halo centrecompared to the baryon-free simulation, while many others show a deficit. wefind that the mean value of eta is close to unity, but there is a largedispersion, with a standard deviation of 0.677. the enhancement is cyclical intime and tracks the star formation cycle of the galaxy; as gas falls to thecentre and forms stars, the dark matter moves in as well. supernova feedbackthen removes the gas, and the dark matter again responds to the changingpotential. we study three physical models relating the motion of baryons tothat of the dark matter: adiabatic contraction, dynamical friction, and rapidoutflows. abridged, see text for full abstract

1402.4461	the impact of galaxy formation on the total mass, mass profile and  abundance of haloes	we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how theinclusion of physical processes relevant to galaxy formation (star formation,metal-line cooling, stellar winds, supernovae and feedback from active galacticnuclei, agn) change the properties of haloes, over four orders of magnitude inmass. we find that gas expulsion and the associated dark matter (dm) expansioninduced by supernova-driven winds are important for haloes with masses m200 &lt;10^13 msun, lowering their masses by up to 20% relative to a dm-only model. agnfeedback, which is required to prevent overcooling, has a significant impact onhalo masses all the way up to cluster scales (m200 ~ 10^15 msun). baryonicphysics changes the total mass profiles of haloes out to several times thevirial radius, a modification that cannot be captured by a change in the haloconcentration. the decrease in the total halo mass causes a decrease in thehalo mass function of about 20%. this effect can have important consequencesfor abundance matching technique as well as for most semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation. we provide analytic fitting formulae, derived fromsimulations that reproduce the observed baryon fractions, to correct halomasses and mass functions from dm-only simulations. the effect of baryonicphysics (agn feedback in particular) on cluster number counts is about as largeas changing the cosmology from wmap7 to planck, even when a moderately highmass limit of m500 ~ 10^14 msun is adopted. thus, for precision cosmology theeffects of baryons must be accounted for.

1404.3724	bent by baryons: the low mass galaxy-halo relation	the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos is of vital importancefor evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxyformation physics. we show that the widely used method of abundance matchingbased on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two ofits underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lowerrate due to the effect of baryons. in this regime, reliance on dark matter onlysimulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. wefind that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halomasses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching doesnot point to a failure of lcdm, but simply to a failure to account for baryoniceffects. our results also imply that the local group contains only a fewhundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs thatabundance matching would suggest. we show how relations derived from abundancematching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently tocalibrate models of galaxy formation.

1407.7040	the eagle project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and  their environments	we introduce the virgo consortium's eagle project, a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes inrepresentative volumes. we discuss the limitations of such simulations in lightof their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and howthese affect their predictive power. one major improvement is our treatment offeedback from massive stars and agn in which thermal energy is injected intothe gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowingwinds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. becausethe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, wecalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of thegalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.the observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over thefull mass range, $10^8 &lt; m_*/m_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreementclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented forhydrodynamical simulations. we compare our results to a representative set oflow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find goodagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passivefractions, tully-fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxyclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic civ and ovi. whilethe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent withobservations for $m_* \gtrsim 10^9 m_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep atlower masses. the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters ofgalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting ahigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for agn feedback. eagleconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

1409.8297	the effect of baryons on the inner density profiles of rich clusters	we use the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments"(eagle) cosmological simulation to investigate the effect of baryons on thedensity profiles of rich galaxy clusters. we focus on eagle clusters with$m_{200}&gt;10^{14}~m_\odot$ of which we have six examples. the central brightestcluster galaxies (bcgs) in the simulation have steep stellar density profiles,$\rho_*(r) \propto r^{-3}$. stars dominate the mass density for$r&lt;10~\rm{kpc}$, and, as a result, the total mass density profiles are steeperthan the navarro-frenk-white (nfw) profile, in remarkable agreement withobservations. the dark matter halo itself closely follows the nfw form at allresolved radii ($r\gtrsim3.0~\rm{kpc}$). the eagle bcgs have similar surfacebrightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles as the bcgs in thesample of newman et al., which have the most detailed measurements currentlyavailable. after subtracting the contribution of the stars to the centraldensity, newman et al. infer significantly shallower slopes than the nfw value,in contradiction with the eagle results. we discuss possible reasons for thisdiscrepancy, and conclude that an inconsistency between the kinematical modeladopted by newman et al. for their bcgs, which assumes isotropic stellarorbits, and the kinematical structure of the eagle bcgs, in which the orbitalstellar anisotropy varies with radius and tends to be radially biased, couldexplain at least part of the discrepancy.

1501.01311	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: calibration of subgrid  physics and model variations	we present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore theparameter space of the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironments" (eagle) simulation project. four of the simulations follow theevolution of a periodic cube l = 50 cmpc on a side, and each employs adifferent subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with starformation. the relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations eachreproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. three of thesimulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we showanalytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses thatreduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. such losses aregreatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the eagle reference model - byinjecting more energy in higher density gas. this model produces galaxies withthe observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scalingrelations. in the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process ofthe reference model was varied at a time. we find that the properties ofgalaxies with stellar mass &lt;~ m* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar massfunction) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback fromaccretion onto their central black holes. both processes must be efficient inorder to reproduce the observed galaxy population. in general, simulations thathave been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass functionwill still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement thatgalaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range ofobservables.

1501.01967	the first billion years project: the escape fraction of ionizing photons  in the epoch of reionization	proto-galaxies forming in low-mass dark matter haloes are thought to providethe majority of ionizing photons needed to reionize the universe, due to theirhigh escape fractions of ionizing photons. we study how the escape fraction inhigh-redshift galaxies relates to the physical properties of the halo in whichthe galaxies form, by computing escape fractions in more than 75000 haloesbetween redshifts 27 and 6 that were extracted from the first billion yearsproject, high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of galaxyformation. we find that the main constraint on the escape fraction is the gascolumn density in a radius of 10 pc around the stellar populations, causing astrong mass dependence of the escape fraction. the lower potential well inhaloes with virial mass below 1e8 solar mass results in low column densitiesthat can be penetrated by radiation from young stars (age &lt; 5 myr). in haloeswith virial mass above 1e8 solar mass supernova feedback is important, but only30% of the haloes in this mass range have an escape fraction higher than 1%. wefind a large range of escape fractions in haloes with similar properties,caused by different distributions of the dense gas in the halo. this makes itvery hard to predict the escape fraction on the basis of halo properties andresults in a highly anisotropic escape fraction. the strong mass dependence,the large spread and the large anisotropy of the escape fraction may stronglyaffect the topology of reionization and is something current models of cosmicreionization should strive to take into account.

1501.01980	spatially adaptive radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy  formation during cosmological reionization	we present a suite of cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations ofthe assembly of galaxies driving the reionization of the intergalactic medium(igm) at z &gt;~ 6. the simulations account for the hydrodynamical feedback fromphotoionization heating and the explosion of massive stars as supernovae (sne).our reference simulation, which was carried out in a box of size 25 comovingmpc/h using 2 x 512^3 particles, produces a reasonable reionization history andmatches the observed uv luminosity function of galaxies. simulations withdifferent box sizes and resolutions are used to investigate numericalconvergence, and simulations in which either sne or photoionization heating orboth are turned off, are used to investigate the role of feedback from starformation. ionizing radiation is treated using accurate radiative transfer atthe high spatially adaptive resolution at which the hydrodynamics is carriedout. sn feedback strongly reduces the star formation rates (sfrs) over nearlythe full mass range of simulated galaxies and is required to yield sfrs inagreement with observations. photoheating helps to suppress star formation inlow-mass galaxies, but its impact on the cosmic sfr is small. because theeffect of photoheating is masked by the strong sn feedback, it does not imprinta signature on the uv galaxy luminosity function, although we note that ourresolution is insufficient to model star-forming minihaloes cooling throughmolecular hydrogen transitions. photoheating does provide a strong positivefeedback on reionization because it smooths density fluctuations in the igm,which lowers the igm recombination rate substantially. our simulationsdemonstrate a tight non-linear coupling of galaxy formation and reionization,motivating the need for the accurate and simultaneous inclusion of photoheatingand sn feedback in models of the early universe.

1503.04807	molecular hydrogen abundances of galaxies in the eagle simulations	we investigate the abundance of galactic molecular hydrogen (h$_2$) in the"evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle)cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. we assign h$_2$ masses to gas particlesin the simulations in post-processing using two different prescriptions thatdepend on the local dust-to-gas ratio and the interstellar radiation field.both result in h$_2$ galaxy mass functions that agree well with observations inthe local and high-redshift universe. the simulations reproduce the observedscaling relations between the mass of h$_2$ and the stellar mass, starformation rate and stellar surface density. towards high edshifts, galaxies inthe simulations display larger h$_2$ mass fractions, and correspondingly lowerh$_2$ depletion timescales, also in good agreement with observations. thecomoving mass density of h$_2$ in units of the critical density, $\omega_{\rmh_2}$, peaks at $z\approx 1.2-1.5$, later than the predicted peak of the cosmicstar formation rate activity, at $z\approx 2$. this difference stems from thedecrease in gas metallicity and increase in interstellar radiation field withredshift, both of which hamper h$_2$ formation. we find that the cosmic h$_2$budget is dominated by galaxies with $m_{\rm h_2}&gt;10^9\,\rm m_{\odot}$, starformation rates $&gt;10\,\rm m_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$ and stellar masses $m_{\rmstellar}&gt;10^{10}\,\rm m_{\odot}$, which are readily observable in the opticaland near-ir. the match between the h$_2$ properties of galaxies that emerge inthe simulations and observations is remarkable, particularly since h$_2$observations were not used to adjust parameters in eagle.

1503.06065	nifty galaxy cluster simulations i: dark matter &amp; non-radiative models	we have simulated the formation of a galaxy cluster in a $\lambda$cdmuniverse using twelve different codes modeling only gravity and non-radiativehydrodynamics (\art, \arepo, \hydra\ and 9 incarnations of gadget). this rangeof codes includes particle based, moving and fixed mesh codes as well as botheulerian and lagrangian fluid schemes. the various gadget implementations spantraditional and advanced smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (sph) schemes. thegoal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevantcase, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. we compare imagesof the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles ofvarious dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. the underlying gravitationalframework can be aligned very accurately for all the codes allowing a detailedinvestigation of the differences that develop due to the various gas physicsimplementations employed. as expected, the mesh-based codes art and arepo formextended entropy cores in the gas with rising central gas temperatures. thosecodes employing traditional sph schemes show falling entropy profiles all theway into the very centre with correspondingly rising density profiles andcentral temperature inversions. we show that methods with modern sph schemesthat allow entropy mixing span the range between these two extremes and thelatest sph variants produce gas entropy profiles that are essentiallyindistinguishable from those obtained with grid based methods.

1504.04025	the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gas  distributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gasdistributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations. the combination of thesestate-of-the-art hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four ordersof magnitude in halo mass ($11 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/ [h^{-1}m_\odot]) &lt; 15$), awide radial range ($-2.3 &lt; log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc ]) &lt; 1.3$) and redshifts $0 &lt;z &lt; 1$. the shape parameters of the dark matter, stellar and hot gasdistributions follow qualitatively similar trends: they become more aspherical(and triaxial) with increasing halo mass, radius and redshift. we measure themisalignment of the baryonic components (hot gas and stars) of galaxies withtheir host halo as a function of halo mass, radius, redshift, and galaxy type(centrals vs satellites and early- vs late-type). overall, galaxies align wellwith the local distribution of the total (mostly dark) matter. however, thestellar distributions on galactic scales exhibit a median misalignment of about45-50 degrees with respect to their host haloes. this misalignment is reducedto 25-30 degrees in the most massive haloes ($13 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot ]) &lt; 15$). half of the disc galaxies in the eagle simulationshave a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40degrees. we present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probabilitydistribution of galaxy-halo misalignment to enable a straightforward inclusionof our results into models of galaxy formations based on purely collisionlessn-body simulations.

1504.04374	colours and luminosities of z=0.1 simulated galaxies in the eagle  simulations	we calculate the colours and luminosities of redshift z = 0.1 galaxies fromthe eagle simulation suite using the galaxev population synthesis models. wetake into account obscuration by dust in birth clouds and diffuse ism using atwo-component screen model, following the prescription of charlot and fall. wecompare models in which the dust optical depth is constant to models where itdepends on gas metallicity, gas fraction and orientation. the colours of eaglegalaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those ofobserved galaxies. in particular, eagle produces a red sequence of passivegalaxies and a blue cloud of star forming galaxies, with approximately thecorrect fraction of galaxies in each population and with g-r colours within 0.1magnitudes of those observed. luminosity functions from uv to nir wavelengthsdiffer from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resultingfrom a choice between petrosian and kron photometric apertures. despite thegenerally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. theblue cloud of eagle galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than inthe data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction inmassive eagle galaxies. there is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxiescompared to observations. the overall level of agreement with the observedcolour distribution suggests that eagle galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages,metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those ofobserved galaxies.

1509.05056	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: the importance of the  hydrodynamics scheme	we present results from a subset of simulations from the "evolution andassembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle) suite in which theformulation of the hydrodynamics scheme is varied. we compare simulations thatuse the same subgrid models without re-calibration of the parameters butemploying the standard gadget flavour of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)instead of the more recent state-of-the-art anarchy formulation of sph that wasused in the fiducial eagle runs. we find that the properties of most galaxies,including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the detailsof the hydrodynamics solver. however, the star formation rates of the mostmassive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurioussurface tension in the simulation using standard sph. this affects theefficiency with which agn activity can quench star formation in these galaxiesand it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the x-rayemission from these objects. the differences that can be attributed to thehydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lowerresolution. we also find that the use of a time step limiter is important forachieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of thelow-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.

1511.01098	the apostle simulations: solutions to the local group's cosmic puzzles	the local group of galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests ofmodels of cosmic structure formation. for example, observations of the milkyway (mw) and andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement withn-body simulations of the "lambda cold dark matter" ({\lambda}cdm) model: thereare far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos(the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the mostmassive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightestsatellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes ofsatellites" problem). here we present results from apostle (a project ofsimulating the local environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the localgroup (lg) members. applying the eagle code to the lg environment, we find thatour simulations match the observed abundance of lg galaxies, including thesatellite galaxies of the mw and andromeda. due to changes to the structure ofhalos and the evolution in the lg environment, the simulations reproduce theobserved relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individualdwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in theirdark matter profiles. satellite systems form with a range of spatialanisotropies, including one similar to that of the mw, confirming that such aconfiguration is not unexpected in {\lambda}cdm. finally, based on the observedvelocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of themaximum circular velocity for the halos of nine mw dwarf spheroidals.

1511.04909	the distribution of atomic hydrogen in eagle galaxies: morphologies,  profiles, and hi holes	we compare the mass and internal distribution of atomic hydrogen (hi) in 2200present-day central galaxies with m_star &gt; 10^10 m_sun from the 100 mpc eaglereference simulation to observational data. atomic hydrogen fractions arecorrected for self-shielding using a fitting formula from radiative transfersimulations and for the presence of molecular hydrogen using an empirical or atheoretical prescription from the literature. the resulting neutral hydrogenfractions, m_(hi+h2)/m_star, agree with observations to better than 0.1 dex forgalaxies with m_star between 10^10 and 10^11 m_sun. our fiducial, empirical h2model based on gas pressure results in galactic hi mass fractions, m_hi/m_star,that agree with observations from the gass survey to better than 0.3 dex, butthe alternative theoretical h2 formula leads to a negative offset inm_hi/m_star of up to 0.5 dex. visual inspection reveals that most hi disks insimulated hi-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recentaccretion events. many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large hiholes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementationin eagle. the hi mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holesin the hi disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1dex). the presence of large hi holes also makes the radial hi surface densityprofiles somewhat too low in the centre, at \sigma_hi &gt; 1 m_sun pc^-2 (by afactor of &lt;~ 2 compared to data from the bluedisk survey). in the outer region(\sigma_hi &lt; 1 m_sun pc^-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively withobservations. scaled by hi size, the simulated profiles of hi-rich (m_hi &gt;10^9.8 m_sun) and control galaxies (10^9.1 m_sun &gt; m_hi &gt; 10^9.8 m_sun) followeach other closely, as observed.

astro-ph;0402441	quenching cluster cooling flows with recurrent hot plasma bubbles	the observed cooling rate of hot gas in clusters is much lower than thatinferred from the gas density profiles. this suggests that the gas is beingheated by some source. we use an adaptive-mesh refinement code (flash) tosimulate the effect of multiple, randomly positioned, injections of thermalenergy within 50 kpc of the centre of an initially isothermal cluster with massm_200=3x10^(14) msol and kt=3.1 kev. we have performed eight simulations withspherical bubbles of energy generated every 10^8 years, over a total of 1.5gyr. each bubble is created by injecting thermal energy steadily for 10^7years; the total energy of each bubble ranges from 0.1--3x10^(60) erg,depending on the simulation. we find that 2x10^(60) erg per bubble(corresponding to a average power of 6.3x10^(44) erg/s) effectively balancesenergy loss in the cluster and prevents the accumulation of gas below kt=1 kevfrom exceeding the observational limits of 30 msol/yr. this injection rate iscomparable to the radiated luminosity of the cluster, and the required energyand periodic timescale of events are consistent with observations of bubblesproduced by central agn in clusters. the effectiveness of this process dependsprimarily on the total amount of injected energy and the initial location ofthe bubbles, but is relatively insensitive to the exact duty cycle of events.
