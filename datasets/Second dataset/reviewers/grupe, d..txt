0706.1564	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: spectral properties and energetics	observations of gamma ray bursts (grbs) with swift produced the initiallysurprising result that many bursts have large x-ray flares superimposed on theunderlying afterglow. the flares were sometimes intense, had rapid rise anddecay phases, and occurred late relative to the ``prompt'' phase. someremarkable flares are observed with fluence comparable to the prompt grbfluence. many grbs have several flares, which are sometimes overlapping. short,intense, repetitive, and late flaring can be most easily understood within thecontext of the standard fireball model with the internal engine that powers theprompt grb emission in an active state at late times. however, other models forflares have been proposed. flare origin can be investigated by comparing theflare spectra to that of the afterglow and the initial prompt emission. in thiswork, we have analyzed all significant x-ray flares from the first 110 grbsobserved by swift. from this sample 33 grbs were found to have significantx-ray flares, with 77 flares that were detected above the 3$\sigma$ level. inaddition to temporal analysis presented in a companion paper, a variety ofspectral models have been fit to each flare. in some cases, we find that thespectral fits favor a band function model, which is more akin to the promptemission than to that of an afterglow. we find that the average fluence of theflares is 2.4e-7 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.2-10 kev energy band, which isapproximately a factor of ten below the average prompt grb fluence. theseresults, when combined with those presented in the companion paper on temporalproperties of flares, supports the hypothesis that most x-ray flares arelate-time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial grb; not anafterglow related effect.

0901.3417	x-ray absorption and optical extinction in the partially obscured  seyfert nucleus in mrk 1393	we present a detailed study of the x-ray and optical spectra of the luminousseyfert galaxy mrk 1393, which revealed variable partial obscuration of theactive nucleus. the x-ray spectra obtained by xmm-newton and swift showmoderate absorption with a column density around 3x10^21 cm^-2, consistent witha dust-reddening interpretation of the steep balmer decrement seen in recentoptical spectra. the x-ray flux in the 0.5 to 2 kev band during the xmm-newtonobservation in 2005 and swift observation in 2006 was a factor 6 brighter thanthat of the rosat all sky survey in 1991. in the past 4 years, the broadh\alpha line brightened by a factor of 4 accompanied by a decrease in thebalmer decrement. a comparison with literature spectra reveals variations inthe dust extinction on time scales of several years, suggesting that theobscuring material is very close to the active nucleus. these observationsindicate that a dust-to-gas ratio as high as the galactic value can be presentin moderately thick gas in the vicinity of the central engine within a fewparsecs. we suggest that the obscuring material may be debris disrupted fromthe dusty torus.

0906.4882	studying x-ray reprocessing and continuum variability in quasars: pg  1211+143	we present the results from a monitoring campaign of the narrow-lineseyfert~1 galaxy pg 1211+143. the object was monitored with ground-basedfacilities (ubvri photometry; from february to july, 2007) and with swift(x-ray photometry/spectroscopy and uv/optical photometry; between march andmay, 2007). we found pg 1211+143 in a historical low x-ray flux state at thebeginning of the swift monitoring campaign in march 2007. it is seen from thelight curves that while violently variable in x-rays, the quasar shows littlevariations in optical/uv bands. the x-ray spectrum in the low state is similarto other narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies during their low-states and can beexplained by a strong partial covering absorber or by x-ray reflection onto thedisk. with the current data set, however, it is not possible to distinguishbetween both scenarios. the interband cross-correlation functions indicate apossible reprocessing of the x-rays into the longer wavelengths, consistentwith the idea of a thin accretion disk, powering the quasar. the time lagsbetween the x-ray and the optical/uv light curves, ranging from ~2 to ~18 daysfor the different wavebands, scale approximately as ~lambda^(4/3), but appearto be somewhat larger than expected for this object, taking into account itsaccretion disk parameters. possible implications for the location of the x-rayirradiating source are discussed.

1001.1339	suzaku monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548: warm absorber  location and its implication for cosmic feedback	(abridged) we present a two month suzaku x-ray monitoring of the seyfert 1galaxy ngc 5548. the campaign consists of 7 observations. we analyze theresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizingflux variations. despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impingingcontinuum, the soft x-ray spectra of the source show little spectralvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. a detailed timemodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing componentwith high ionization. instead, the models tentatively suggest that theionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changingwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.using the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e &lt;2.0e7 cm-3 for theelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocitycomponent. this implies a large distance from the continuum source (r &gt; 0.033pc). if the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e&gt;9.8e4 cm-3 and r &lt; 3 pc. we discuss our results in terms of two differentscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of theaccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. giventhe large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (mw&gt; 0.08 maccr). the associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in thehost galaxy (&gt;1.2e56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,possibly regulating large scale star formation. the total mass and energyejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,even when extrapolated to quasar luminosities. such feedback would require thatwe are observing the wind before it is fully accelerated.

1005.4933	a panchromatic view of pks 0558-504: an ideal laboratory to study the  disk-jet link	pks 0558-504 is the brightest radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy atx-ray energies. here we present results from the radio, optical, uv, and x-raybands obtained with swift, xmm, and atca during a 10-day monitoring campaign inseptember 2008. the simultaneous coverage at several wavelengths makes itpossible to investigate in detail the broadband spectral energy distribution(sed) and the energetic of this source. the main results can be summarized asfollows. the atca reveals the presence of an extended radio emission in pks0558-504 with two lobe-like structures at ~7" from the bright central source.the extended radio structure and the low value of the radio-loudness similar toradio-quiet seyfert galaxies coupled with constraints from higher energy bandsargue against a jet-dominated emission. the study of the sed, which isdominated by a nearly constant optical-uv emission, supports the conclusionthat pks 0558-504 is accreting at super-eddington rate. this conclusion wasreached assuming m_bh=2.5e8 m_sun, which was obtained with a new scaling methodbased on x-ray spectral variability results. a comparison between the accretionluminosity and the kinetic power associated with the jet suggests that in thissource the accretion power dominates in agreement with the results obtainedfrom radiation-mhd simulations of galactic black holes (gbhs) accreting at theeddington rate. the combined findings from this panchromatic investigationstrongly suggest that pks 0558-504 is a large-scale analog of gbhs in theirhighly accreting intermediate state. importantly, pks 0558-504 may also be theprototype of the parent population of the very radio-loud nls1s recentlydetected at gamma-ray energies.

1112.3965	swift follow-up observations of unclassified asca sources	we present swift follow-up observations of a sample of 35 unclassified faintx-ray sources drawn from the asca galactic centre and plane surveys. our shortpointed xrt observations allow detections down to a limiting 0.3-10 kev flux of~1e-13 erg cm-2 s-1, which translates into a luminosity of ~1e33 erg s-1 for anassumed distance of d=8 kpc. the brightest source in our sample reaches amaximum 0.3-10 kev luminosity of ~2e36 (d/8kpc)^2 erg s-1 during ourobservations. we detect 16 (46%) of the asca sources with the xrt, while 19were not detected during our program. since we are probing the faint end of theasca source populations, we expect a large fraction of the non-detections to bedue to the eddington bias. this is strengthened by the fact that we find theobserved xrt count rates to be predominantly lower than expected based on thereported asca intensities. investigation of the asca properties and long-termx-ray variability leads us to conclude that the non-detections likely includetwo spurious asca detections and three objects that are variable or transientx-ray sources. for the 16 xrt-detected sources we obtain positional accuraciesof ~2-4", which significantly improves upon their asca uncertainties of ~1'. weuse the x-ray spectra and variability to characterise these objects. mostappear to be faint, persistent x-ray emitters that have highly absorbedspectra. based on their x-ray properties we identify three accreting compactobjects: one confirmed (ax j1754.2-2754) and one candidate (ax j1538.3-5541)x-ray binary, and one possible magnetically accreting white dwarf (axj1620.1-5002). furthermore, we use the improved positions of xrt-detectedsources to search for counterparts in simultaneously obtained swift/uvot imagesand possible associations with cataloged sources at various wavelengths. thisreveals three possible main sequence stars amongst our sample.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1210.0855	a blurred reflection interpretation for the intermediate flux state in  mrk 335	as part of a long term monitoring campaign of mrk 335, deep xmm-newtonobservations catch the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) in a complex,intermediate flux interval as the active galaxy is transiting from low- tohigh-flux. other works on these same data examined the general behaviour of thenls1 (grupe et al.) and the conditions of its warm absorber (longinotti etal.). the analysis presented here demonstrates the x-ray continuum and timingproperties can be described in a self-consistent manner adopting a blurredreflection model with no need to invoke partial covering. the rapid spectralvariability appears to be driven by changes in the shape of the primary emitterthat is illuminating the inner accretion disc around a rapidly spinning blackhole (a &gt; 0.7). while light bending is certainly prominent, the rather constantemissivity profile and break radius obtained in our spectral fitting suggestthat the blurring parameters are not changing as would be expected if theprimary source is varying its distance from the disc. instead changes could beintrinsic to the power law component. one possibility is that material in anunresolved jet above the disc falls to combine with material at the base of thejet producing the changes in the primary emitter (spectral slope and flux)without changing its distance from the disc.

1312.4547	prompt emission of grb 121217a from gamma-rays to the nir	the mechanism that causes the prompt-emission episode of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) is still widely debated despite there being thousands of promptdetections. the favoured internal shock model relates this emission tosynchrotron radiation. however, it does not always explain the spectral indicesof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.multi-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate thepossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. we present grb121217a, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (nir) emissionduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the gamma-ray burst opticalnear-infrared detector (grond) in combination with the swift and fermisatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 kev to 100 kev. we determine aphotometric redshift of z=3.1+/-0.1 with a line-of-sight extinction of a_v~0mag, utilising the optical/nir sed. from the afterglow, we determine a bulklorentz factor of gamma~250 and an emission radius of r&lt;10^18 cm. theprompt-emission broadband spectral energy distribution is well fit with abroken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break ate=6.6+/-0.9 kev, which can be interpreted as the maximum injection frequency.self-absorption by the electron population below energies of e_a&lt;6 kev suggesta magnetic field strength of b~10^5 g. however, all the best fit modelsunderpredict the flux observed in the nir wavelengths, which also onlyrebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, instark contrast to the x-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. we present grb121217a one of the few grbs for which there are multi-wavelength observationsof the prompt-emission period and show that it can be understood with asynchrotron radiation model.

1405.1417	asassn-14ae: a tidal disruption event at 200 mpc	asassn-14ae is a candidate tidal disruption event (tde) found at the centerof sdss j110840.11+340552.2 ($d\simeq200$~mpc) by the all-sky automated surveyfor supernovae (asas-sn). we present ground-based and swift follow-upphotometric and spectroscopic observations of the source, finding that thetransient had a peak luminosity of $l\simeq8\times10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and atotal integrated energy of $e\simeq1.7\times10^{50}$ ergs radiated over the$\sim5$ months of observations presented. the blackbody temperature of thetransient remains roughly constant at $t\sim20,000$~k while the luminositydeclines by nearly 1.5 orders of magnitude during this time, a drop that ismost consistent with an exponential, $l\propto e^{-t/t_0}$ with$t_0\simeq39$~days. the source has broad balmer lines in emission at all epochsas well as a broad he ii feature emerging in later epochs. we compare the colorand spectral evolution to both supernovae and normal agn to show that {\name}does not resemble either type of object and conclude that a tde is the mostlikely explanation for our observations. at $z=0.0436$, asassn-14ae is thelowest-redshift tde candidate discovered at optical/uv wavelengths to date, andwe estimate that asas-sn may discover $0.1 - 3$ of these events every year inthe future.

1407.8223	the nustar spectrum of mrk 335: extreme relativistic effects within 2  gravitational radii of the event horizon?	we present 3-50 kev nustar observations of the agn mrk 335 in a very low fluxstate. the spectrum is dominated by very strong features at the energies of theiron line at 5-7 kev and compton hump from 10-30 kev. the source is variableduring the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,which suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorptionscenario. in this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use ofnew relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate thereflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflectionspectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. we find that thespectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest fluxstate spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects ofextreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the eventhorizon. the reflection fraction decreases sharply with increasing flux,consistent with a point source moving up to above 10 rg as the sourcebrightens. we constrain the spin parameter to greater than 0.9 at the 3 sigmaconfidence level. by adding a spin-dependent upper limit on the reflectionfraction to our models, we demonstrate that this can be a powerful way ofconstraining the spin parameter, particularly in reflection dominated states.we also calculate a detailed emissivity profile for the iron line, and findthat it closely matches theoretical predictions for a compact source within afew rg of the black hole.

1409.1244	a partial eclipse of the heart: the absorbed x-ray low state in mrk 1048	we present two new xmm-newton observations of an unprecedented low flux statein the seyfert 1 mrk 1048 (ngc 985), taken in 2013. the x-ray flux below 1 kevdrops by a factor of 4-5, whereas the spectrum above 5 kev is essentiallyunchanged. this points towards an absorption origin for the low state, and weconfirm this with spectral fitting, finding that the spectral differences canbe well modelled by the addition of a partial covering neutral absorber, with acolumn density of $\sim3\times 10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a covering fraction of$\sim0.6$. the optical and uv fluxes are not affected, and indeed aremarginally brighter in the more recent observations, suggesting that only theinner regions of the disk are affected by the absorption event. this indicateseither that the absorption is due to a cloud passing over the inner disk,obscuring the x-ray source but leaving the outer disk untouched, or that theabsorber is dust-free so the uv continuum is unaffected. we use arguments basedon the duration of the event and the physical properties of the absorber toconstrain its size and location, and conclude that it is most likely a smallcloud at $\sim10^{18}$cm from the source.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1410.2330	suzaku observations of mrk 335: confronting partial covering and  relativistic reflection	we report on the deepest x-ray observation of the narrow-line seyfert 1galaxy mrk 335 in the low-flux state obtained with suzaku. the data arecompared to a 2006 high-flux suzaku observation when the source was ~10-timesbrighter. describing the two flux levels self-consistently with partialcovering models would require extreme circumstances, as the source would besubject to negligible absorption during the bright state and ninety-five percent covering with near compton-thick material when dim. blurred reflectionfrom an accretion disc around a nearly maximum spinning black hole (a&gt;0.91,with preference for a spin parameter as high as ~ 0.995) appears more likelyand is consistent with the long-term and rapid variability. measurements of theemissivity profile and spectral modelling indicate the high-flux suzakuobservation of mrk 335 is consistent with continuum-dominated, jet-likeemission (i.e. beamed away from the disc). it can be argued that the ejectamust be confined to within ~25 rg if it does not escape the system. during thelow-flux state the corona becomes compact and only extends to about 5 rg fromthe black hole, and the spectrum becomes reflection-dominated. thelow-frequency lags measured at both epochs are comparable indicating that theaccretion mechanism is not changing between the two flux levels. varioustechniques to study the spectral variability (e.g. principal componentanalysis, fractional variability, difference spectra, and hardness ratioanalysis) indicate that the low-state variability is dominated by changes inthe power law flux and photon index, but that changes in the ionisation stateof the reflector are also required. most notably, the ionisation parameterbecomes inversely correlated with the reflected flux after a long-durationflare-like event during the observation.

0804.2260	observations of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts	swift-xrt observations of the x-ray emission from gamma ray bursts (grbs) andduring the grb afterglow have led to many new results during the past twoyears. one of these exciting results is that approximately 1/3-1/2 of grbscontain detectable x-ray flares. the mean fluence of the x-ray flares is ~10times less than that of the initial prompt emission, but in some cases theflare is as energetic as the prompt emission itself. the flares display fastrises and decays, and they sometimes occur at very late times relative to theprompt emission (sometimes as late as 10^5 s after t_0) with very high peakfluxes relative to the underlying afterglow decay that has clearly begun priorto some flares. the temporal and spectral properties of the flares are found tofavor models in which flares arise due to the same grb internal engineprocesses that spawned the prompt grb emission. therefore, both long and shortgrb internal engine models must be capable of producing high fluences in thex-ray band at very late times.

1501.05951	space telescope and optical reverberation mapping project. ii. swift and  hst reverberation mapping of the accretion disk of ngc 5548	recent intensive swift monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 yielded282 usable epochs over 125 days across six uv/optical bands and the x-rays.this is the densest extended agn uv/optical continuum sampling ever obtained,with a mean sampling rate &lt;0.5 day. approximately daily hst uv sampling wasalso obtained. the uv/optical light curves show strong correlations (r_max =0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. these lagsare well-fit by a \tau propto \lambda^4/3 wavelength dependence, with anormalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05lt-day at 1367 a, assuming a simple face-on model. the u-band shows amarginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, whichcould be due to balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region assuggested by korista and goad. the uv/x-ray correlation is weaker (r_max &lt;0.45) and less consistent over time. this indicates that while swift isbeginning to measure uv/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disktheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationshipwith x-ray variability is less well understood. combining this accretion disksize estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that agndisk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over awide range of masses.

1510.07656	flaring from the supermassive black hole in mrk 335 studied with swift  and nustar	monitoring of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 335 (mrk 335) withthe swift satellite discovered an x-ray flare beginning 2014 august 29. at thepeak, the 0.5-5kev count rate had increased from that in the low flux state bya factor of 10. a target of opportunity observation was triggered with nustar,catching the decline of the flare on 2014 september 20. we present a jointanalysis of swift and nustar observations to understand the cause of thisflare. the x-ray spectrum shows an increase in directly observed continuum fluxand the softening of the continuum spectrum to a photon index of 2.49(-0.07,+0.08) compared to the previous low flux observations. the x-rayspectrum remains well-described by the relativistically blurred reflection ofthe continuum from the accretion disc whose emissivity profile suggests that itis illuminated by a compact x-ray source, extending at most 5.2rg over thedisc. a very low reflection fraction of 0.41 (-0.15,+0.15) is measured,unexpected for such a compact corona. the x-ray flare is, hence, interpreted asarising from the vertical collimation and ejection of the x-ray emitting coronaat a mildly relativistic velocity, causing the continuum emission to be beamedaway from the disc. as the flare subsides, the base of this jet-like structurecollapses into a compact x-ray source that provides the majority of theradiation that illuminates the disc while continuum emission is still detectedfrom energetic particles further out, maintaining the low reflection fraction.

1512.00192	multiwavelength survey of a sample of flat-spectrum radio-loud  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on a multiwavelength survey of a sample of 42 flat-spectrumradio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s). this is the largest knownsample of this type of active galactic nucleus (agn) to date. we found that 17%of sources were detected at high-energy gamma rays (e&gt;100 mev), and 90% atx-rays (0.3-10 kev). the masses of the central black holes are in the range$\sim 10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than the values of blazars. the diskluminosities are about 1-49% of the eddington value, with one outlier at 0.3%,comparable with the luminosities observed in flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). the jet powers are $\sim 10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable with bllac objects, yet relatively smaller than fsrqs. however, once renormalized bythe mass of the central black hole, the jet powers of rlnls1s, bl lacs, andfsrqs are consistent each other, indicating the scalability of the jets. wefound episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours.in some cases, dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as theinterplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk. we concludethat, despite the distinct observational properties, the central engines ofrlnls1s are similar to those of blazars.

astro-ph;0201048	x-ray transient agn and galaxies, and why we need new soft x-ray surveys	x-ray transience is the most extreme form of variability observed in agn ornormal non-active galaxies. while factors of 2-3 on timescales of days to yearsare quite common among agn, x-ray transients appear only once and vanish fromthe x-ray sky years later. the rosat all-sky survey with its sensitivity toenergies down to 0.1 kev was the an ideal tool to discover these sources. x-raytransience in agn or galaxies can be caused by dramatic changes in theaccretion rate of the central black hole or by changes of the properties of theaccretion disk. so far only a handful of sources are known. in order toestimate how often such an event occurs in a galaxy, a new soft x-ray survey isneeded. in these proceedings i describe the currently known x-ray transient agnand galaxies and will argue for a new soft x-ray survey in order to discovermore of these extreme x-ray sources.

astro-ph;0304063	follow-up hst/stis spectroscopy of three candidate tidal disruption  events	large amplitude, high luminosity soft x-ray flares were detected by the rosatall-sky survey in several galaxies with no evidence for seyfert activity intheir ground-based optical spectra. these flares had the properties predictedfor a tidal disruption event by a central supermassive black hole: soft x-rayspectrum, time-scale of months, and large x-ray luminosity (10^42 - 10^44 ergss^-1). in order to evaluate the alternative hypothesis that these flares couldhave been some form of extreme agn variability, we obtained follow-up opticalspectroscopy of three of the flaring galaxies a decade later with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and a narrow slit to search for or placestringent limits on the presence of any persistent seyfert-like emission intheir nuclei. two of the galaxies, rx j1624.9+7554 and rx j1242.6-1119, show noevidence for emission lines or a non-stellar continuum in their hubble spacetelescope (hst) nuclear spectra, consistent with their ground-basedclassification as inactive galaxies. they remain the most convincing as hostsof tidal disruption events. ngc 5905, previously known as a starburst h iigalaxy due to its strong emission lines, has in its inner 0."1 a nucleus withnarrow emission-line ratios requiring a seyfert 2 classification. this weakseyfert 2 nucleus in ngc 5905, which was masked by the many surrounding h iiregions in ground-based spectra, requires a low level of prior non-stellarphotoionization, thus raising some uncertainty about the nature of its x-rayflare, which may or may not have been a tidal disruption event. the absence ofboth broad emission lines and nuclear x-ray absorption in ngc 5905 alsocharacterizes it as a ``true'' seyfert 2 galaxy, yet one that has varied bymore than a factor of 100 in x-rays.

(1998), the black hole mass of ngc 6300 is estimatedto be ~2.8x10^5 mo. taking uncertainty of this method into account, the blackhole mass is less than 10^7 mo. taking the bolometric luminosity of 3.3x10^43erg/s into consideration, this yields an accretion rate of &gt; 0.03 of theeddington value, and comparable with estimates from seyfert 1 galaxies usingthis method. the time variability analysis suggests that ngc 6300 actually hasa seyfert 1 nucleus obscured by a thick matter, and more generally provides anew pillar of support for the unified model of seyfert galaxies based onobscuration.

astro-ph;0508332	evidence for a canonical grb afterglow light curve in the swift/xrt data	we present new observations of the early x-ray afterglows of the first 27gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected with the swift x-ray telescope (xrt). theearly x-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadlyconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay(t^{-alpha} with 3&lt;alpha_1&lt;5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay(0.2&lt;alpha_2&lt;0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1&lt;alpha_3&lt;1.5).these power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,300s&lt;t_{break,1}&lt;500s and 10^3s&lt;t_{break,2}&lt;10^4s. on top of this canonicalbehavior of the early x-ray light curve, many events have superimposed x-rayflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lastingsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the grb. wefind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of theprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to ourline of sight. the first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes placewhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallowflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into theexternal shock. when this energy injection stops, a second break is thenobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). this energy injection increases theenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f&gt;4, and augments thealready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-rayemission.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0510551	xmm-newton observations of bright rosat selected active galactic nuclei  with low intrinsic absorption	we present a sample of twenty-one rosat bright active galactic nuclei (agn),representing a range of spectral classes, and selected for follow-up snap-shotobservations with xmm-newton. the typical exposure was between 5-10 ks. theobjects were primarily selected on the bases of x-ray brightness and not onhardness ratio; thus the sample cannot be strictly defined as a `soft' sample.one of the main outcomes from the xmm-newton observations was that all of theagn, including eleven type 1.8-2 objects, required low levels of intrinsicabsorption (nh &lt; 10^21 cm^-2). the low absorption in type 2 systems is achallenge to account for in the standard orientation-based unification model,and we discuss possible physical and geometrical models which could elucidatethe problem. moreover, there does not appear to be any relation between thestrength and shape of the soft excess, and the spectral classification of theagn in this sample. we further identify a number of agn which deserve deeperobservations or further analysis: for example, the liners ngc 5005 and ngc7331, where optically thin thermal and extended emission is detected, and thenarrow-line seyfert 1 ii zw 177, which shows a broad emission feature at5.8kev.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0601173	x-ray flare in xrf 050406: evidence for prolonged engine activity	we present observations of xrf 050406, the first burst detected by swiftshowing a flare in its x-ray light curve. during this flare, which peaks att_peak ~210s after the bat trigger, a flux variation of (delta f)/f~6 in a veryshort time (delta t)/t_peak&lt;&lt;1 was observed. its measured fluence in the 0.2-10kev band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the promptfluence. we present indications of spectral variations during the flare. weargue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies thatthe central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power withrespect to the prompt emission. the x-ray light curve flattens to a veryshallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supportscontinued central engine activity at late times. this burst is classified as anx-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 kevband, e_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significantflux above ~50 kev and a peak energy e_p&lt;15 kev. xrf 050406 is one of the firstexamples of a well-studied x-ray light curve of an xrf. we show that the mainafterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal grbs. inparticular, x-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now beenseen in both xrfs and grbs. this indicates that a similar mechanism may be atwork for both kinds of events.

astro-ph;0602142	testing the curvature effect and internal origin of gamma-ray burst  prompt emissions and x-ray flares with swift data	the x-ray light curves of many gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) have a very steep-decay component (tail) following theprompt gamma-rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring ata time from ~10^2 up to ~10^5 seconds. based on the assumption that these tailsand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors aredominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present aself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36prompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 grb xrt light curves. our results showthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flaresare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission orthe corresponding x-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation ofthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x-ray flares. ourresults indicate that each x-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of centralengine activity and the grb central engine remains active after the promptemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the grb trigger (e.g. grb050502b &amp; grb 050724). this challenges the conventional central engine modelsand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. we further show thatthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the grbduration. we also identify a minority group of grbs whose combined bat-xrtlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between theprompt emission and the afterglow. these grbs may have an external origin forboth the prompt emission and the afterglow.

astro-ph;0603680	radio-loud narrow-line type 1 quasars	we present the first systematic study of (non-radio-selected) radio-loudnarrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies. cross-correlation of the `catalogue ofquasars and active nuclei' with several radio and optical catalogues led to theidentification of 11 radio-loud nls1 candidates including 4 previously knownones. most of the radio-loud nls1s are compact, steep spectrum sourcesaccreting close to, or above, the eddington limit. the radio-loud nls1s of oursample are remarkable in that they occupy a previously rarely populated regimein nls1 multi-wavelength parameter space. while their [oiii]/h_beta andfeii/h_beta intensity ratios almost cover the whole range observed in nls1galaxies, their radio properties extend the range of radio-loud objects tothose with small widths of the broad balmer lines. among the radio-detectednls1 galaxies, the radio index r distributes quite smoothly up to the criticalvalue of r ~ 10 and covers about 4 orders of magnitude in total. statisticsshow that ~7% of the nls1 galaxies are formally radio-loud while only 2.5%exceed a radio index r &gt; 100. several mechanisms are considered as explanationsfor the radio loudness of the nls1 galaxies and for the lower frequency ofradio-louds among nls1s than quasars. while properties of most sources (with2-3 exceptions) generally do not favor relativistic beaming, the combination ofaccretion mode and spin may explain the observations.

astro-ph;0603773	jet breaks in short gamma-ray bursts. i: the uncollimated afterglow of  grb 050724	we report the results of the \chandra observations of the \swift-discoveredshort gamma-ray burst grb 050724. \chandra observed this burst twice, about twodays after the burst and a second time three weeks later. the first \chandrapointing occurred at the end of a strong late-time flare. about 150 photonswere detected during this 49.3 ks observation in the 0.4-10.0 kev range. thespectral fit is in good agreement with spectral analysis of earlier \swift xrtdata. in the second \chandra pointing the afterglow was clearly detected with 8background-subtracted photons in 44.6 ks. from the combined \swift xrt and\chandra-acis-s light curve we find significant flaring superposed on anunderlying power-law decay slope of $\alpha$=0.98$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$. there isno evidence for a break between about 1 ks after the burst and the last\chandra pointing about three weeks after the burst. the non-detection of a jetbreak places a lower limit of 25$^{\circ}$ on the jet opening angle, indicatingthat the outflow is less strongly collimated than most previously-reported longgrbs. this implies that the beaming corrected energy of grb 050724 is at least$4\times 10^{49}$ ergs.

astro-ph;0702371	the first survey of x-ray flares from gamma ray bursts observed by  swift: temporal properties and morphology	we present the first systematic investigation of the morphological and timingproperties of flares in grbs observed by swift/xrt. we consider a large sampledrawn from all grbs detected by swift, integral and hete-2 prior to 2006 jan31, which had an xrt follow-up and which showed significant flaring. our sampleof 33 grbs includes long and short, at low and high redshift, and a total of 69flares. the strongest flares occur in the early phases, with a clearanti-correlation between the flare peak intensity and the flare time ofoccurrence. fitting each x-ray flare with a gaussian model, we find that themean ratio of the width and peak time is &lt;delta t / t &gt; = 0.13+/-0.10, albeitwith a large scatter. late flares at times &gt; 2000 seconds have long durations,delta t&gt;300 s, and can be very energetic compared to the underlying continuum.we further investigated if there is a clear link between the number of pulsesdetected in the prompt phase by bat and the number of x-ray flares detected byxrt, finding no correlation. however, we find that the distribution ofintensity ratios between successive bat prompt pulses and that betweensuccessive xrt flares is the same, an indication of a common origin forgamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares. all evidence indicates that flares areindeed related to the workings of the central engine and, within the standardfireball scenario, originate from internal shocks rather than external shocks.while all flares can be explained by long-lasting engine activity, 29/69 flaresmay also be explained by refreshed shocks. however, 10 can only be explained byprolonged activity of the central engine.

astro-ph;9710298	new bright soft x-ray selected rosat agn: i. infrared-to-x-ray spectral  energy distributions	we present results of an infrared-to-x-ray study of 76 bright soft x-rayselected seyfert galaxies discovered in the rosat all-sky survey. these objectsare characterized by steep x-ray spectra in the 0.2-2.0 kev bandpass with powerlaw energy spectral indices in the range of 1.3 to 8 and a lack of internalabsorption by neutral hydrogen. our sample selection based on hardness ratioyields a mean x-ray slope of alpha-x = 2.1, steeper than in any other known agnpopulation. at optical wavelengths, the soft agn have significantly bluerspectra than a comparison sample of agn with a canonical, harder x-rayspectrum, whereas the slope between 5500 angstrom and 1 kev is the same. thisis consistent with a more pronounced big blue bump emission component in thesoft x-ray selected agn. the blueness of the optical spectra increases with thesoftness of the x-ray spectra and with the luminosity, saturating at anapproximate f_nu proportional to nu^+0.3 spectrum. such properties are expectedif most of the big blue bump emission originates in a (comptonized) accretiondisk and accretion rate to mass ratio is higher than in agn with a hard x-rayspectrum.

astro-ph;9712149	scattering and absorption in soft x-ray selected agn: an optical  polarization survey	we have surveyed the optical linear polarization of a completely identifiedsample of 43 bright soft-x-ray-selected rosat agn. most (40) of these agn showlow polarization (&lt;1%), and no clear optical reddening. this supports thesuggestion from rapid x-ray variability, disk-like spectral energydistributions, and lack of cold x-ray absorption, that we are viewinga bare agndisk. iras f12397+3333 and iras 13349+2438 show high polarization increasing tothe uv -- clear evidence for scattering. as well as steep, soft-x-ray spectra,they show optical reddening and rapid x-ray variability, but almost no coldx-ray absorption -- a combination that suggests dusty ionized gas along theline-of-sight. brandt et al. suggested and found these `warm absorbers' foriras 13349+2438. iras f12397+3333 is a new candidate. combining our data withthe optical and x-ray spectra of the high polarization narrow-line seyfert 1nuclei (nlsy1s) investigated by goodrich reveals strong correlations amongoptical reddening indicators (such as the optical continuum slope and balmerdecrement), [oiii]/h-beta, and cold intrinsic x-ray absorption. opticalreddening underpredicts the cold x-ray absorption, suggesting dusty warmabsorbers in all the highly polarized agn. the existence of thesescattering-polarized and reddened nlsy1s suggests an orientation unified schemewithin the class of nlsy1s, analogous to that linking seyfert 1 and seyfert 2nuclei.  for some highly polarized and optically selected agn we present new analysisof archival x-ray data, and for the highly polarized agn new opticalspectroscopy is presented in an appendix.
