0907.4989	the cool side of lyman alpha emitters	we extend a previous study of lyman alpha emitters (laes) based onhydrodynamical cosmological simulations, by including two physical processesimportant for laes: (a) lyman alpha and continuum luminosities produced bycooling of collisionally excited hi in the galaxy, (b) dust formation andevolution; we follow these processes on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. hi cooling onaverage contributes 16-18% of the lyman alpha radiation produced by stars, butthis value can be much higher in low mass laes and further increased if the hiis clumpy. the continuum luminosity is instead almost completely dominated bystellar sources. the dust content of galaxies scales with their stellar mass,m_{dust} is proportional to m_*^0.7 and stellar metallicity, z_*, such thatm_{dust} is proportional to z_*^1.7. as a result, the massive galaxies havelyman alpha escape fraction as low as f_alpha=0.1, with a lae-averaged valuedecreasing with redshift such that it is (0.33,0.23) at z =(5.7,6.6). the uvcontinuum escape fraction shows the opposite trend with redshift, possiblyresulting from clumpiness evolution. the model successfully reproduces theobserved lyman alpha and uv luminosity functions at different redshifts and thelyman alpha equivalent width scatter to a large degree, although the observeddistribution appears to be more more extended than the predicted one. wediscuss possible reasons for such tension.

0908.1571	detecting lyman alpha emitters in the sub-millimeter	using the results from a previously developed lyman alpha/continuumproduction/transmission and dust enrichment model for lyman alpha emitters(laes), based on cosmological sph simulations, we assess the detectability oftheir dust-reprocessed sub-millimeter (submm) radiation. as supernovae (ratherthan evolved stars) control dust formation and destruction processes, laes arerelatively dust-poor with respect to local galaxies: they have low dust-to-gasratios (0.05 times the dust-to-gas ratio of the milky way) in spite of theirrelatively high metallicity, which is approximately 10-50% of the solar value.using the derived escape fraction of ultraviolet (uv) continuum photons wecompute the uv luminosity absorbed by dust and re-emitted in the far infrared.the lae submm fluxes correlate with their lyman alpha luminosity: about (3%,1%) at z=(5.7, 6.6) of the laes in our simulated sample (those with with logl_\alpha &gt; 43.1) would have fluxes at 850 micrometer (the optimal band fordetection) in excess of 0.12 mjy and will be therefore detectable at 5 sigmawith alma with an integration time of only 1 hour. such detections would open anew window on the physical conditions prevailing in these most distantgalaxies.

0911.1125	particle energy cascade in the intergalactic medium	we study the development of high energy (e_in &lt; 1tev) cascades produced by aprimary electron of energy e_in injected into the intergalactic medium (igm).to this aim we have developed the new code medea (monte carlo energy depositionanalysis) which includes bremsstrahlung and inverse compton (ic) processes,along with h/he collisional ionizations and excitations, and electron-electroncollisions. the cascade energy partition into heating, excitations andionizations depends primarily on the igm ionized fraction, x_e, but also onredshift, z, due to ic on cmb photons. while bremsstrahlung is unimportantunder most conditions, ic becomes largely dominant at energies e_in &gt; 1mev. themain effect of ic at injection energies e_in &lt; 100mev is a significant boost ofthe fraction of energy converted into low energy photons (h\nu &lt; 10.2ev) whichdo not further interact with the igm. for energies e_in &gt; 1gev cmb photons arepreferentially upscattered within the x-ray spectrum ($h\nu &gt; 10^4ev) and canfree stream to the observer. complete tables of the fractional energydepositions as a function of redshift, e_in and ionized fraction are given. ourresults can be used in many astrophysical contexts, with an obvious applicationrelated to the study of decaying/annihilating dark matter (dm) candidates inthe high-z universe.

1002.0839	the visibility of lyman alpha emitters during reionization	we present the first lyman alpha emitter (lae) study that combines: (i)cosmological sph simulations run using gadget-2, (ii) radiative transfersimulations (crash), and (iii) a previously developed lae model. this completelae model accounts for the intrinsic lae lyman alpha/continuum luminosity, dustenrichment and lyman alpha transmission through the intergalactic medium (igm),to quantify the effects of reionization, dust and velocity fields on the lymanalpha and uv luminosity functions (lf). we find that a model neglecting dustsorely fails to reproduce either the slope or the magnitude of the observedlyman alpha and uv lfs. clumped dust is required to simultaneously fit theobserved uv and lyman alpha lfs, such that the intrinsic lymanalpha-to-continuum luminosity is enhanced by a factor f_alpha/f_c ~ 1.5 (3.7)excluding (including) peculiar velocities. the higher value including velocityfields arises since laes reside in large potential wells and inflows decreasetheir lyman alpha transmission. for the first time, a degeneracy is foundbetween the the ionization state of the igm and the clumping of dust insidehigh-redshift galaxies. the lyman alpha lf at z ~ 5.7 can be well reproduced(to within a 5 sigma error) by a wide range of igm average neutral hydrogenfraction, 3.4/10^3 to 0.16, provided that the increase in the lyman alphatransmission through a more ionized igm is compensated by a decrease in thelyman alpha escape fraction from the galaxy due to dust absorption. thephysical properties of laes are presented, along with a discussion of theassumptions adopted.

1009.1149	the earliest galaxies seen in 21 cm line absorption	we investigate the 21 cm absorption lines produced by non-linear structuresduring the early stage of reionization, i.e. the starless minihalos and thedwarf galaxies. after a detailed modelling of their properties, with particularattention to the coupling physics, we determine their 21 cm absorption lineprofiles. the infalling gas velocity around minihalos/dwarf galaxies stronglyaffects the line shape, and with the low spin temperatures outside the virialradii of the systems, gives rise to horn-like line profiles. the optical depthof a dwarf galaxy is reduced for lines of sight penetrating through its hiiregion, and especially, a large hii region created by a dwarf galaxy withhigher stellar mass and/or a top-heavy initial mass function results in anoptical depth trough rather than an absorption line. we compute syntheticspectra of 21 cm forest for both high redshift quasars and radio afterglows ofgamma ray bursts (grbs). even with the planned ska, radio afterglows of most ifnot all grbs would still be too dim to be the background sources for highresolution (1 khz) observations, but absorption lines can be easily detectedtowards a high-z quasar. broadband observation against grb afterglows can alsobe used to reveal the evolving 21 cm signal from both minihalos and dwarfgalaxies if there was no x-ray background or it was extremely weak, but itbecomes difficult if an early x-ray background existed. hence the 21 cmabsorption could be a powerful probe of the presence/intensity of the x-raybackground and the thermal history of the early universe.

1011.2213	reionization constraints using principal component analysis	using a semi-analytical model developed by choudhury &amp; ferrara (2005) westudy the observational constraints on reionization via a principal componentanalysis (pca). assuming that reionization at z&gt;6 is primarily driven bystellar sources, we decompose the unknown function n_{ion}(z), representing thenumber of photons in the igm per baryon in collapsed objects, into itsprincipal components and constrain the latter using the photoionization rateobtained from ly-alpha forest gunn-peterson optical depth, the wmap7 electronscattering optical depth and the redshift distribution of lyman-limit systemsat z \sim 3.5. the main findings of our analysis are: (i) it is sufficient tomodel n_{ion}(z) over the redshift range 2&lt;z&lt;14 using 5 parameters to extractthe maximum information contained within the data. (ii) all quantities relatedto reionization can be severely constrained for z&lt;6 because of a large numberof data points whereas constraints at z&gt;6 are relatively loose. (iii) the weakconstraints on n_{ion}(z) at z&gt;6 do not allow to disentangle different feedbackmodels with present data. there is a clear indication that n_{ion}(z) mustincrease at z&gt;6, thus ruling out reionization by a single stellar populationwith non-evolving imf, and/or star-forming efficiency, and/or photon escapefraction. the data allows for non-monotonic n_{ion}(z) which may contain sharpfeatures around z \sim 7. (iv) the pca implies that reionization must be 99%completed between 5.8&lt;z&lt;10.3 (95% confidence level) and is expected to be 50%complete at z \approx 9.5-12. with future data sets, like those obtained byplanck, the z&gt;6 constraints will be significantly improved.

1011.6228	cosmic density field reconstruction from ly-alpha forest data	we present a novel, fast method to recover the density field through thestatistics of the transmitted flux in high redshift quasar absorption spectra.the proposed technique requires the computation of the probability distributionfunction of the transmitted flux (p_f) in the ly-alpha forest region and, as asole assumption, the knowledge of the probability distribution function of thematter density field (p_delta). we show that the probability densityconservation of the flux and matter density unveils a flux-density (f-delta)relation which can be used to invert the ly-alpha forest without any assumptionon the physical properties of the intergalactic medium. we test our inversionmethod at z=3 through the following steps: [i] simulation of a sample ofsynthetic spectra for which p_delta is known; [ii] computation of p_f; [iii]inversion of the ly-alpha forest through the f-delta relation. our technique,when applied to only 10 observed spectra characterized by a signal-to noiseratio s/n &gt;= 100 provides an exquisite (relative error epsilon_delta &lt;~ 12 % in&gt;~ 50 % of the pixels) reconstruction of the density field in &gt;~ 90 % of theline of sight. we finally discuss strengths and limitations of the method.

1011.6233	multiscale inference of matter fields and baryon acoustic oscillations  from the ly-alpha forest	we present a novel bayesian method for the joint reconstruction ofcosmological matter density fields, peculiar velocities and power-spectra inthe quasi-nonlinear regime. we study its applicability to the ly-alpha forestbased on multiple quasar absorption spectra. our approach to this problemincludes a multiscale, nonlinear, two-step scheme since the statisticsdescribing the matter distribution depends on scale, being stronglynon-gaussian on small scales (&lt; 0.1 h^{-1} mpc) and closely lognormal on scales&gt;~10 h^{-1} mpc. the first step consists on performing 1d highly resolvedmatter density reconstructions along the line-of-sight towards z~2-3 quasarsbased on an arbitrary non-gaussian univariate model for matter statistics. thesecond step consists on gibbs-sampling based on conditional pdfs. the matterdensity field is sampled in real space with hamiltonian-sampling using thepoisson/gamma-lognormal model, while redshift distortions are corrected withlinear lagrangian perturbation theory. the power-spectrum of the lognormaltransformed variable which is gaussian distributed (and thus close to thelinear regime) can consistently be sampled with the inverse gamma distributionfunction. we test our method through numerical n-body simulations with acomputational volume large enough (&gt; 1 h^{-3} gpc^3) to show that the linearpower-spectra are nicely recovered over scales larger than &gt;~20 h^{-1} mpc,i.e. the relevant range where features imprinted by the baryon-acousticsoscillations (baos) appear.

1101.2449	turbulence in the intergalactic medium	we study supernova-driven galactic outflows as a mechanism for injectingturbulence in the intergalactic medium (igm) far from galaxies. to this aim wefollow the evolution of a 10^13 msun galaxy along its merger tree, withcarefully calibrated prescriptions for star formation and wind efficiencies. atz~3 the majority of the bubbles around galaxies are old (ages &gt;1gyr), i.e. theycontain metals expelled by their progenitors at earlier times; their fillingfactor increases with time reaching about 10% at z&lt;2. the energy deposited bythese expanding shocks in the igm is predominantly in kinetic form (mean energydensity of 1 \mu ev cm^-3, about 2-3 x the thermal one), which is rapidlyconverted in disordered motions by instabilities, finally resulting in a fullydeveloped turbulent spectrum whose evolution is followed through a spectraltransfer function approach. the derived mean igm turbulent doppler parameter,b_t, peaks at z~1 at about 1.5 km/s with maximum b_t = 25 km/s. the shape ofthe b_t distribution does not significantly evolve with redshift but undergoesa continuous shift towards lower b_t values with time, as a result of bubbleaging. we find also a clear trend of decreasing b_t with n_hi and a morecomplex dependence on r_s resulting from the age spread of the bubbles. we haveattempted a preliminary comparison with the data, hampered by the scarcity ofthe latter and by the challenge provided by the subtraction of peculiar andthermal motions. finally we comment on the implications of turbulence forvarious cosmological studies.

1106.1745	probing cosmic star formation up to z = 9.4 with grbs	we propose a novel approach, based on principal components analysis, to theuse of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) as probes of cosmic star formation history (sfh)up to very high redshifts. the main advantage of such approach is to avoid thenecessity of assuming an \textit{ad hoc} parameterization of the sfh. we firstvalidate the method by reconstructing a known sfh from monte carlo-generatedmock data. we then apply the method to the most recent \textit{swift} data ofgrbs with known redshift and compare it against the sfh obtained by independentmethods. the main conclusion is that the level of star formation activity at $z\approx 9.4$ could have been already as high as the present-day one ($\approx0.01 m_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-3}$). this is a factor 3-5 times higher thandeduced from high-$z$ galaxy searches through drop-out techniques. if true,this might alleviate the long-standing problem of a photon-starvingreionization; it might also indicate that galaxies accounting for most of thestar formation activity at high redshift go undetected by even the most deepsearches.

1106.4034	joint qso-cmb constraints on reionization history	based on the work by mitra, choudhury &amp; ferrara (2010), we obtainmodel-independent constraints on reionization from cosmic microwave background(cmb) and qso absorption line data by decomposing the function n_{ion}(z) (thenumber of photons entering the igm per baryon in collapsed objects) into itsprincipal components. the main addition in this work is that for the cmb dataset, we explicitly include the angular power spectra c_l for tt, te and eemodes in our analysis which seem to contain somewhat more information thantaking the electron scattering optical depth tau_{el} as a single data point.using markov chain monte carlo methods, we find that all the quantities relatedto reionization can be severely constrained at z &lt; 6 whereas a broad range ofreionization histories at z &gt; 6 are still permitted by the current data sets.with currently available data from wmap7, we constrain 0.080 &lt; tau_{el} &lt; 0.112(95% cl) and also conclude that reionization is 50% complete between 9.0 &lt;z(q_{hii} = 0.5) &lt; 11.8 (95% cl) and is 99% complete between 5.8 &lt; z(q_{hii} =0.99) &lt; 10.4 (95% cl). with the forthcoming planck data on large-scalepolarization (ignoring effect of foregrounds), the z &gt; 6 constraints will beimproved considerably, e.g., the 2-sigma error on tau_{el} will be reduced to0.009 and the uncertainties on z(q_{hii} = 0.5) and z(q_{hii} = 0.99) would be\sim 1 and 3 (95% cl), respectively. for more stringent constraints onreionization at z &gt; 6, one has to rely on data sets other than cmb. our methodwill be useful in such case since it can be used for non-parametricreconstruction of reionization history with arbitrary data sets.

1109.0297	lyman alpha emitters and lyman break galaxies: dichotomous twins?	(abridged) we extend our previous studies aimed at modeling lyman alphaemitters (laes) to the second population of high redshift sources, lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs), with the final goal of investigating the physical relationshipbetween them at 6 &lt; z &lt;8. we use a set of large (~10^6 mpc^3) cosmological sphsimulations that include a detailed treatment of star formation, feedback,metal enrichment and supernova dust production; these same simulations havealready been shown to successfully reproduce a large number of observedproperties of laes (dayal et al. 2010). we identify lbgs as galaxies with anabsolute ultraviolet (uv) magnitude m_{uv} &lt;= -17, consistent with currentobservational criteria. with no further parameter tuning, the model reproducesthe redshift evolution of the lbg uv luminosity function, stellar massfunction, and star formation rate (sfr) density extremely well, compared to thedata at z~6-8. it predicts a z-independent average beta value of about -2.2,consistent with the most recent observational results. the mean lbg specificsfr increases from 6.7 gyr^-1 at z ~ 6 to 13.9 gyr^-1 at z ~ 8, and is largestfor the smallest lbgs. from a comparison of the simulated lae and lbgpopulations, we find no appreciable differences between them in terms of thestellar masses, ages, sfr, and dust content; only the faintest lbgs with m_{uv}&gt;= -18 (-19) at z ~ 6 (8) do not show an observable lyman alpha line. laeshence represent a luminous lbg subset, whose relative extent depends only onthe adopted equivalent width (ew) selection criteria. further, in line withcurrent observations, we find that the fraction of lbgs showing a lyman alphaline decreases with increasing redshift due to the combined effects of dust andreionization. we conclude with a brief critical model discussion, whichemphasizes the uncertainties inherent to theoretical ew determinations.

1111.3570	data-constrained reionization and its effects on cosmological parameters	we perform an analysis of the recent wmap7 data considering physicallymotivated and viable reionization scenarios with the aim of assessing theireffects on cosmological parameter determinations. the main novelties are: (i)the combination of cmb data with astrophysical results from quasar absorptionline experiments; (ii) the joint variation of both the cosmological andastrophysical [governing the evolution of the free electron fraction x_e(z)]parameters. including a realistic, data-constrained reionization history in theanalysis induces appreciable changes in the cosmological parameter valuesdeduced through a standard wmap7 analysis. particularly noteworthy are thevariations in omega_bh^2 = 0.02258^{+0.00057}_{-0.00056} (wmap7) vs.omega_bh^2$ = 0.02183\pm 0.00054 (wmap7 + astro), and the new constraints forthe scalar spectral index, for which wmap7 + astro excludes theharrison-zel'dovich value n_s=1 at more than 3\sigma. finally, the e.s. opticaldepth value is considerably decreased with respect to the standard wmap7, i.e.\tau_{e}=0.080\pm 0.012. we conclude that the inclusion of astrophysicaldatasets, allowing to robustly constrain the reionization history, in theextraction procedure of cosmological parameters leads to relatively importantdifferences in the final determination of their values.

1111.6637	first stars in damped lyman alpha systems	in order to characterize damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) potentiallyhosting first stars, we present a novel approach to investigate dlas in thecontext of milky way (mw) formation, along with their connection with the mostmetal-poor stars and local dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxies. the merger treemethod previously developed is extended to include inhomogeneous reionizationand metal mixing, and it is validated by matching both the metallicitydistribution function of galactic halo stars and the fe-luminosity relation ofdsph galaxies. the model explains the observed nhi-fe relation of dlas alongwith the chemical abundances of [fe/h] &lt; -2 systems. in this picture, therecently discovered z_abs ~ 2.34 c-enhanced dla (cooke et al. 2011a), pertainsto a new class of absorbers hosting first stars along with second-generationlong-living low-mass stars. these "popiii dlas" are the descendants ofh2-cooling minihalos with mh ~ 10^7 msun, that virialize at z &gt; 8 in neutral,primordial regions of the mw environment and passively evolve after a shortinitial period of star formation. the gas in these systems is warm tg \sim(40-1000) k, and strongly c-enriched by long-living, extremely metal-poor starsof total mass m* \sim 10^{2-4} msun.

1201.3630	molecular hydrogen in lyman alpha emitters	we present a physically motivated model to estimate the molecular hydrogen(h2) content of high-redshift (z~5.7,6.6) lyman alpha emitters (laes) extractedfrom a suite of cosmological simulations. we find that the h2 mass fraction,(f_h2), depends on three main lae physical properties: (a) star formation rate,(b) dust mass, and (c) cold neutral gas mass. at z~5.7, the value of f_h2 peaksand ranges between 0.5-0.9 for intermediate mass laes with stellar mass m_* ~10^{9-10} solar mass, decreasing for both smaller and larger galaxies. however,the largest value of the h2 mass is found in the most luminous laes. thesetrends also hold at z\sim6.6, although, due to a lower dust content,f_h2(z=6.6)\sim0.5 f_h2(z=5.7) when averaged over all laes; they arise due tothe interplay between the h2 formation/shielding controlled by dust and theintensity of the ultraviolet (uv) lyman-werner photo-dissociating radiationproduced by stars. we then predict the carbon monoxide (co) luminosities forsuch laes and check that they are consistent with the upper limits found bywagg et al. (2009) for two z&gt;6 laes. at z\sim(5.7, 6.6), the lowest corotational transition observable for both samples with the actual capabilitiesof atacama large millimeter array (alma) is the co(6-5). we find that atz\sim5.7, about 1-2% of laes, i.e., those with an observed lyman alphaluminosity larger than 10^{43.2} erg/s would be detectable with an integrationtime of 5-10 hours (s/n=5); at z\sim6.6 none of the laes would be detectable inco, even with an alma integration time of 10 hours. we also build the co `fluxfunction', i.e., the number density of laes as a function of theline-integrated co flux, s_co, and show that it peaks at s_co = 0.1 mjy atz\sim5.7, progressively shifting to lower values at higher redshifts. we end bydiscussing the model uncertainties.

1202.3141	supermassive black hole ancestors	we study a model in which supermassive black holes (smbhs) can grow by thecombined action of gas accretion on heavy seeds and mergers of both heavy(m_s^h=10^5 msol) and light (m_s^l = 10^2 msol) seeds. the former result fromthe direct collapse of gas in t_s^h &gt;1.5x10^4k, h_2-free halos; the latter arethe endproduct of a standard h_2-based star formation process. the h_2-freecondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (j_21 &gt; 10^3) lyman-werneruv background produced by both accreting bhs and stars, thus establishing aself-regulated growth regime. we find that this condition is met already at zclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. the keyparameter allowing the formation of smbhs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halosthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy&gt;0.001; smbhas large as 2x10^10 msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.independently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black holemass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that smbhs formedbefore their bulge was in place. the formation of heavy seeds, allowed by thelyman-werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucialto achieve a fast growth of the smbh by merger events in the early phases ofits evolution, i.e. z&gt;7. the uv photon production is largely dominated by starsin galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.interestingly, we find that the final mass of light bhs and of the smbh in thequasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryoncontent has been converted into stars. the smbh growth is dominated at allepochs z &gt; 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at latertimes accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel. we finallydiscuss possible shortcomings of the model.

1202.4770	the physics of the fundamental metallicity relation	we present a simple, redshift-independent analytic model that explains thelocal fundamental metallicity relation (fmr), taking into account the physicalprocesses of star formation, inflow of metal-poor intergalactic medium (igm)gas, and the outflow of metal rich interstellar medium (ism) gas. we show thatthe physics of the fmr can be summarised as follows: for massive galaxies withstellar mass m_* &gt;= 10^11 solar masses, ism metal enrichment due to starformation is compensated by inflow of metal poor igm gas, leading to a constantvalue of the gas metallicity with star formation rate (sfr); outflows arerendered negligible as a result of the large potential wells of these galaxies.on the other hand, as a result of their smaller sfr, less massive galaxiesproduce less heavy elements that are also more efficiently ejected due to theirshallow potential wells; as a result, for a given m_*, the gas metallicitydecreases with sfr. for such galaxies, the outflow efficiency determines boththe slope, and the knee of the metallicity-sfr relation. without changing anyparameters, this simple model is also successfully matched to the gas fraction- gas metallicity relation observed for a sample of about 260 nearby galaxies.

1203.4234	the formation of the extremely primitive star sdss j102915+172927 relies  on dust	the relative importance of metals and dust grains in the formation of thefirst low-mass stars has been a subject of debate. the recently discoveredgalactic halo star sdss j102915+172927 (caffau et al. 2011) has a mass lessthan 0.8 msun and a metallicity of z = 4.5 10^{-5} zsun. we investigate theorigin and properties of this star by reconstructing the physical conditions inits birth cloud. we show that the observed elemental abundance trend of sdssj102915+172927 can be well fitted by the yields of core-collapse supernovaewith metal-free progenitors of 20 msun and 35 msun. using these selectedsupernova explosion models, we compute the corresponding dust yields and theresulting dust depletion factor taking into account the partial destruction bythe supernova reverse shock. we then follow the collapse and fragmentation of astar forming cloud enriched by the products of these sn explosions at theobserved metallicity of sdss j102915+172927. we find that [0.05 - 0.1] msunmass fragments, which then lead to the formation of low-mass stars, can occurprovided that the mass fraction of dust grains in the birth cloud exceeds 0.01of the total mass of metals and dust. this, in turn, requires that at least 0.4msun of dust condense in the first supernovae, allowing for moderatedestruction by the reverse shock. if dust formation in the first supernovae isless efficient or strong dust destruction does occur, the thermal evolution ofthe sdss j102915+172927 birth cloud is dominated by molecular cooling, and only&gt; 8 msun fragments can form. we conclude that the observed properties of sdssj102915+172927 support the suggestion that dust must have condensed in theejecta of the first supernovae and played a fundamental role in the formationof the first low-mass stars.

1207.3803	the escape fraction of ionizing photons from high redshift galaxies from  data-constrained reionization models	the escape fraction, f_{esc}, of ionizing photons from high-redshift galaxiesis a key parameter to understand cosmic reionization and star formationhistory. yet, in spite of many efforts, it remains largely uncertain. wepropose a novel, semi-empirical approach based on a simultaneous match of themost recently determined luminosity functions (lf) of galaxies in the redshiftrange 6 \leq z \leq 10 with reionization models constrained by a large varietyof experimental data. from this procedure we obtain the evolution of thebest-fit values of f_{esc} along with their 2-sigma limits. we find that,averaged over the galaxy population, (i) the escape fraction increases fromf_{esc} = 0.068_{-0.047}^{+0.054} at z=6 to f_{esc} = 0.179_{-0.132}^{+0.331}at z=8; (ii) at z=10 we can only put a lower limit of f_{esc} &gt; 0.146. thus,although errors are large, there is an indication of a 2.6 times increase ofthe average escape fraction from z=6 to z=8 which might partially release the"starving reionization" problem.

1208.6234	the contribution of high redshift galaxies to the near-infrared  background	several independent measurements have confirmed the existence of fluctuations($\delta f_{\rm obs}\approx 0.1 \rm nw/m^{2}/sr$ at $3.6 \rm \mu m$) up todegree angular scales in the source-subtracted near infrared background (nirb)whose origin is unknown. by combining high resolution cosmologicaln-body/hydrodynamical simulations with an analytical model, and by matchinggalaxy luminosity functions (lfs) and the constraints on reionizationsimultaneously, we predict the nirb absolute flux and fluctuation amplitudeproduced by high-$z$ ($z &gt; 5$) galaxies (some of which harboring pop iii stars,shown to provide a negligible contribution). this strategy also allows us tomake an empirical determination of the evolution of ionizing photon escapefraction: we find $f_{\rm esc} = 1$ at $z \ge 11$, decreasing to $\approx 0.05$at $z = 5$. in the wavelength range $1.0-4.5 \rm \mu m$, the predictedcumulative flux is $f =0.2-0.04 \rm nw/m^2/sr$. however, we find that theradiation from high-$z$ galaxies (including those undetected by currentsurveys) is insufficient to explain the amplitude of the observed fluctuations:at $l=2000$, the fluctuation level due to $z &gt; 5$ galaxies is $\delta f =0.01-0.002 \rm nw/m^2/sr$, with a relative wavelength-independent amplitude$\delta f/f = 4$%. the source of the missing power remains unknown. this mightindicate that an unknown component/foreground, with a clustering signal verysimilar to that of high-$z$ galaxies, dominates the source-subtracted nirbfluctuation signal.

1209.0825	dark matter halo environment for primordial star formation	we study the statistical properties (such as shape and spin) of high-z haloslikely hosting the first (popiii) stars with cosmological simulations includingdetailed gas physics. in the redshift range considered ($11 &lt; z &lt; 16$) theaverage sphericity is $&lt;s&gt; = 0.3 \pm 0.1$, and for more than 90% of halos thetriaxiality parameter is $t \lesssim 0.4$, showing a clear preference foroblateness over prolateness. larger halos in the simulation tend to be bothmore spherical and prolate: we find $s \propto m_h^{\alpha_s}$ and $t \proptom_h^{\alpha_t}$, with $\alpha_s \approx 0.128$ and $\alpha_t= 0.276$ at z = 11.the spin distributions of dark matter and gas are considerably different at$z=16$, with the baryons rotating slower than the dark matter. at lowerredshift, instead, the spin distributions of dark matter and gas track eachother almost perfectly, as a consequence of a longer time interval availablefor momentum redistribution between the two components. the spin of both thegas and dark matter follows a lognormal distribution, with a mean value at z=16of $&lt;\lambda&gt; =0.0184$, virtually independent of halo mass. this is in goodagreement with previous studies. using the results of two feedback models (mt1and mt2) by mckee &amp; tan (2008) and mapping our halo spin distribution into apopiii imf, we find that at high-$z$ the imf closely tracks the spin lognormaldistribution. depending on the feedback model, though, the distribution can becentered at $\approx 65 m_\odot$ (mt1) or $\approx 140 m_\odot$ (mt2). at latertimes, model mt1 evolves into a bimodal distribution with a second prominentpeak located at $35-40 m_\odot$ as a result of the non-linear relation betweenrotation and halo mass. we conclude that the dark matter halo properties mightbe a key factor shaping the imf of the first stars.

1209.2120	the nature of dark matter from the global high redshift hi 21 cm signal	we study the imprint of dark matter (dm) annihilation on the global 21 cmsignal from the dark ages to cosmic reionization. motivated by recentobservations, we focus on three dm candidates: (i) a 10 gev bino-likeneutralino (ii) a 200 gev wino and (iii) a 1 tev heavier particle annihilatinginto leptons. for each dm candidate we assume two values for the thermallyaveraged annihilation cross section \sigma v, the standard thermal value \sigmav_th = 3 x 10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 and the maximum value allowed by wmap7 data, \sigmav_max. we include the enhancement of dm annihilations due to collapsedstructures, detailed estimates of energy deposition into the intergalacticmedium (igm), as well realistic prescriptions for astrophysical sources of uvand x-ray radiation. in these models, the additional heat input from dmannihilation suppresses the mean 21cm brightness temperature offset by \deltatb ~ few-100 mk. in particular, the very deep \delta tb ~ -150 mk absorptionfeature at ~20 &lt; z &lt; 25 predicted by popular models of the first galaxies isconsiderably reduced or totally erased by some of the considered dm candidates.such an enhancement in igm heating could come from either dm annihilations or astronger-than-expected astrophysical component (i.e. abundant early x-raysources). however, we find that the two signatures are not degenerate, sincethe dm heating is dominated by halos several orders of magnitude smaller thanthose hosting galaxies, whose fractional abundance evolves more slowlyresulting in a smaller gradient: d \delta tb/d \nu &lt; 4 mk/mhz in the range \nu~60-80 mhz. the detection of such signals by future radio telescopes would beclear evidence of dm energy injection at high-redshifts.

1210.7319	signatures of x-rays in the early universe	[abridged] with their long mean free paths and efficient heating of theintergalactic medium (igm), x-rays could have a dramatic impact on the thermaland ionization history of the universe. we explore this in various signals: (i)reionization history: including x-rays results in an earlier, more extendedreionization. efficient thermal feedback from x-ray heating could yield anextended, ~10% ionized epoch. (ii) reionization morphology: a sizable (~10%)contribution of x-rays to reionization results in a more uniform morphology,though the impact is modest when compared at the same global neutral fraction,xh. however, changes in morphology cannot be countered by increasing the biasof the ionizing sources, making them a robust signature. (iii) the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz) effect: at a fixed reionization history, x-raysdecrease the ksz power at l=3000 by ~0.5 microk^2. our extreme model in whichx-rays dominate reionization is the only one that is marginally consistent withupper limits from the south pole telescope, assuming no thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) - dusty galaxy correlation. since this extreme modelis unlikely, we conclude that there should be a sizable tsz-dusty galaxysignal. (iv) the cosmic 21cm signal: the impact of x-rays on the 21cm powerspectrum during the advanced stages of reionization (xh&lt;0.7) is modest, exceptin extreme, x-ray dominated models. the largest impact of x-rays is to governigm heating. in fact, unless thermal feedback is efficient, the epoch of x-rayheating likely overlaps with the beginning of reionization (xh&gt;0.9). thisresults in a 21cm power spectrum which is ~ 10-100 times higher than obtainedfrom naive estimates ignoring this overlap. however, if thermal feedback isefficient, the resulting extended epoch between x-ray heating and reionizationcould provide a clean probe of the matter power spectrum in emission.

1305.5923	massive black hole factories: supermassive and quasi-star formation in  primordial halos	supermassive stars and quasi-stars (massive stars with a central black hole)are both considered as potential progenitors for the formation of supermassiveblack holes. they are expected to form from rapidly accreting protostars inmassive primordial halos. we explore how long rapidly accreting protostarsremain on the hayashi track, implying large protostellar radii and weakaccretion luminosity feedback. we assess the potential role of energyproduction in the nuclear core, and determine what regulates the evolution ofsuch protostars into quasi-stars or supermassive stars. we follow thecontraction of characteristic mass scales in rapidly accreting protostars, andinfer the timescales for them to reach nuclear densities. we compare thecharacteristic timescales for nuclear burning with those for which the extendedprotostellar envelope can be maintained. we find that the extended envelope canbe maintained up to protostellar masses of 3.6x10^8 \dot{m}^3 solar, where\dot{m} denotes the accretion rate in solar masses per year. we expect thenuclear core to exhaust its hydrogen content in 7x10^6 yrs. if accretion rates\dot{m}&gt;&gt;0.14 can still be maintained at this point, a black hole may formwithin the accreting envelope, leading to a quasi-star. alternatively, theaccreting object will gravitationally contract to become a main-sequencesupermassive star. due to the limited gas reservoir in dark matter halos with10^7 solar masses, the accretion rate onto the central object may drop at latetimes, implying the formation of supermassive stars as the typical outcome ofdirect collapse. however, if high accretion rates are maintained, a quasi-starwith an interior black hole may form.

1402.5675	the brief era of direct collapse black hole formation	it has been proposed that the first, intermediate-mass ($\approx10^{5-6}~m_\odot$) black holes might form through direct collapse of unpollutedgas in atomic-cooling halos exposed to a strong lyman-werner (lw) ornear-infrared (nir) radiation. as these systems are expected to becompton-thick, photons above 13.6 ev are largely absorbed and re-processed intolower energy bands. it follows that direct collapse black holes (dcbhs) arevery bright in the lw/nir bands, typically outshining small high-redshiftgalaxies by more than 10 times. once the first dcbhs form, they then trigger arunaway process of further dcbh formation, producing a sudden rise in theircosmic mass density. the universe enters the "dcbh era" at $z \approx 20$ whena large fraction of atomic-cooling halos are experiencing dcbh formation. bycombining the clustering properties of the radiation sources with monte carlosimulations we show that in this scenario the dcbh mass density rises from$\sim 5$~$m_\odot$ mpc$^{-3}$ at $z\sim 30$ to the peak value $\sim5\times10^5m_\odot$ mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 14$ in our fiducial model. however, theabundance of \textit{active} (accreting) dcbhs drops after $z \sim 14$, as gasin the potential formation sites (unpolluted halos with virial temperatureslightly above $10^4$~k) is photoevaporated. this effect almost completelysuppresses dcbh formation after $z\sim 13$. the dcbh formation era lasts only$\approx 150$ myr, but it might crucially provide the seeds of the supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) powering $z\sim6$ quasars.

1501.00989	simulating the growth of intermediate mass black holes	theoretical models predict that a population of intermediate mass black holes(imbhs) of mass $m_\bullet \approx 10^{4-5} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$ might format high ($z &gt; 10$) redshift by different processes. such objects wouldrepresent the seeds out of which $z &gt; 6$ super-massive black holes (smbhs)grow. we numerically investigate the radiation-hydrodynamic evolution governingthe growth of such seeds via accretion of primordial gas within their parentdark matter halo of virial temperature $t_{vir} \sim 10^4 \, \mathrm{k}$. wefind that the accretion onto a direct collapse black hole (dcbh) of initialmass $m_0=10^5 \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$ occurs at an average rate$\dot{m}_{\bullet} \simeq 1.35 \, \dot{m}_{edd} \simeq 0.1 \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}}$, is intermittent (duty-cycle $ &lt; 50\%$) and lasts $\approx 142 \,\mathrm{myr}$; the system emits on average at super-eddington luminosities,progressively becoming more luminous as the density of the inner mass shells,directly feeding the central object, increases. finally, when $\approx 90\%$ ofthe gas mass has been accreted (in spite of an average super-eddingtonemission) onto the black hole, whose final mass is $\sim 7 \times 10^6 \,\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$, the remaining gas is ejected from the halo due to apowerful radiation burst releasing a peak luminosity $l_{peak}\sim 3\times10^{45} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. the imbh is compton-thick during most ofthe evolution, reaching a column density $n_h \sim 10^{25} \, \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$in the late stages of the simulation. we briefly discuss the observationalimplications of the model.

1502.04125	gravitational waves from direct collapse black holes formation	the possible formation of direct collapse black holes (dcbhs) in the firstmetal-free atomic cooling halos at high redshifts ($z &gt; 10$) is nowadays objectof intense study and several methods to prove their existence are currentlyunder development. the abrupt collapse of a massive ($\sim 10^4 - 10^5 \,\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) and rotating object is a powerful source of gravitationalwaves emission. in this work, we employ modern waveforms and the improvedknowledge on the dcbhs formation rate to estimate the gravitational signalemitted by these sources at cosmological distances. their formation rate isvery high ($\sim 10^4 \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ up to $z\sim20$), but due to a shortduration of the collapse event ($\sim 2-30\, \mathrm{s}$, depending on the dcbhmass) the integrated signal from these sources is characterized by a very lowduty-cycle (${\cal d}\sim 10^{-3}$), i.e. a shot-noise signal. our results showthat the estimated signal lies above the foreseen sensitivity of theultimate-decigo observatory in the frequency range $(0.8-300) \, \mathrm{mhz}$,with a peak amplitude $\omega_{gw} = 1.1 \times 10^{-54}$ at $\nu_{max} = 0.9\, \mathrm{mhz}$ and a peak signal-to-noise ratio $\mathrm{snr}\sim 22$ at $\nu= 20 \, \mathrm{mhz}$. this amplitude is lower than the galactic confusionnoise, generated by binary systems of compact objects in the same frequencyband. for this reason, advanced techniques will be required to separate thissignal from background and foreground noise components. as a proof-of-concept,we conclude by proposing a simple method, based on the auto-correlationfunction, to recognize the presence of a ${\cal d} \ll 1$ signal buried intothe continuous noise. the aim of this work is to test the existence of a largepopulation of high-z dcbhs, by observing the gravitational waves emitted duringtheir infancy.

1504.06296	the chemical evolution of self-gravitating primordial disks	numerical simulations show the formation of self-gravitating primordial disksduring the assembly of the first structures in the universe, in particularduring the formation of pop.~iii and supermassive stars. their subsequentevolution is expected to be crucial to determine the mass scale of the firstcosmological objects, which depends on the temperature of the gas and thedominant cooling mechanism. here, we derive a one-zone framework to explore thechemical evolution of such disks and show that viscous heating leads to thecollisional dissociation of an initially molecular gas. the effect is relevanton scales of 10 au (1000 au) for a central mass of 10 m_sun (10^4 m_sun) at anaccretion rate of 10^{-1} m_sun yr^{-1}, and provides a substantial heat inputto stabilize the disk. if the gas is initially atomic, it remains atomic duringthe further evolution, and the effect of viscous heating is less significant.the additional thermal support is particularly relevant for the formation ofvery massive objects, such as the progenitors of the first supermassive blackholes. the stabilizing impact of viscous heating thus alleviates the need for astrong radiation background as a means of keeping the gas atomic.

1506.04750	the growth efficiency of high-redshift black holes	the observational evidence that super-massive black holes ($m_{\bullet} \sim10^{9-10} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) are already in place less than $1 \,\mathrm{gyr}$ after the big bang poses stringent time constraints on the growthefficiency of their seeds. among proposed possibilities, the formation ofmassive ($\sim 10^{3-6} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) seeds and/or the occurrence ofsuper-eddington ($\dot{m}&gt;\dot{m}_{edd}$) accretion episodes may contribute tothe solution of this problem. in this work we analytically and numericallyinvestigate the accretion flow onto high-redshift ($z \sim 10$) black holes tounderstand the physical requirements favoring rapid and efficient growth. ourmodel identifies a "feeding-dominated" accretion regime and a"feedback-limited" one, the latter being characterized by intermittent (dutycycles ${\cal d} \lesssim 0.5$) and inefficient growth, with recurring outflowepisodes. we find that low-mass seeds ($\lesssim 10^{3-4} \,\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) evolve in the feedback-limited regime, while more massiveseeds ($\gtrsim 10^{5-6} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) grow very rapidly as they arefound in the feeding-dominated regime. in addition to the standard accretionmodel with a fixed matter-energy conversion factor ($\epsilon = 0.1$), we havealso explored slim disk models, appropriate for super-eddington accretion,where radiation is trapped in the disk and the radiative efficiency is reduced($\epsilon \lesssim 0.04$), which may ensure a continuous growth with $\dot{m}\gg \dot{m}_{edd}$ (up to $\sim 300\dot{m}_{edd}$ in our simulations). underthese conditions, outflows play a negligible role and a black hole can accrete$80\%-100\%$ of the gas mass of the host halo ($\sim 10^7 \,\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) in $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{myr}$, while in feedback-limitedsystems we predict that black holes can accrete only up to $\sim 15\%$ of theavailable mass.

1506.05299	shining in the dark: the spectral evolution of the first black holes	massive black hole (mbh) seeds at redshift $z \gtrsim 10$ are now thought tobe key ingredients to explain the presence of the super-massive ($10^{9-10} \,\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$) black holes in place $ &lt; 1 \, \mathrm{gyr}$ after the bigbang. once formed, massive seeds grow and emit copious amounts of radiation byaccreting the left-over halo gas; their spectrum can then provide crucialinformation on their evolution. by combining radiation-hydrodynamic andspectral synthesis codes, we simulate the time-evolving spectrum emerging fromthe host halo of a mbh seed with initial mass $10^5 \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$,assuming both standard eddington-limited accretion, or slim accretion disks,appropriate for super-eddington flows. the emission occurs predominantly in theobserved infrared-submm ($1-1000 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) and x-ray ($0.1 - 100 \,\mathrm{kev}$) bands. such signal should be easily detectable by jwst around$\sim 1 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ up to $z \sim 25$, and by athena (between $0.1$ and$10 \, \mathrm{kev}$, up to $z \sim 15$). ultra-deep x-ray surveys like thechandra deep field south could have already detected these systems up to $z\sim 15$. based on this, we provide an upper limit for the $z \gtrsim 6$ mbhmass density of $\rho_{\bullet} \lesssim 2.5 \times 10^{2} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot}\, mpc^{-3}}$ assuming standard eddington-limited accretion. if accretionoccurs in the slim disk mode the limits are much weaker, $\rho_{\bullet}\lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{m_{\odot} \, mpc^{-3}}$ in the mostconstraining case.

1511.01120	metal enrichment in the reionization epoch	the presence of elements heavier than helium ("metals") is of fundamentalimportance for a large number of astrophysical processes occurring in planet,star and galaxy formation; it also affects cosmic structure formation andevolution in several ways. even a small amount of heavy elements candramatically alter the chemistry of the gas, opening the path to complexmolecules. metals might enhance the ability of the gas to radiate away itsthermal energy, thus favoring the formation of gravitationally bound objects;they can also condensate in a solid phase (dust grains), partly or totallyblocking radiation from luminous sources. finally, they represent usefultracers of energy deposition by stars and probe the physical properties of theenvironment by absorption or emission lines. last, but certainly not least,life -- as we know it on earth -- is tightly related to the presence of atleast some of the heavy elements. in this pedagogical review i will concentrateon the connection between early metal enrichment and cosmic reionization. as wewill see these two processes are intimately connected and their joint studymight turn out to be fundamental in understanding the overall evolution of theuniverse during the first billion years after the big bang, an epochcorresponding to redshifts z&gt;6.

0807.2975	signatures of reionization on lyman alpha emitters	we use a semi-analytic model of lyman alpha emitters (laes) to constrain thereionization history. by considering two physically motivated scenarios inwhich reionization ends either early (erm, z_i ~ 7) or late (lrm, z_i ~ 6), wefix the global value of the igm neutral fraction (e.g. chi_{hi}=3 times10^{-4}, 0.15 at z=6.56 for the erm and lrm, respectively) leaving only thestar formation efficiency and the effective escape fraction of lya photons asfree parameters. the erm fits the observed lae luminosity function (lf) atz=5.7 and 6.56 requiring no redshift evolution or mass dependence of the starformation efficiency, and lae star formation rates (sfr) of 3-103 solarmasses/year, contributing approximately 8% of the cosmic sfr density at z=5.7.the lrm requires a physically uncomfortable drop of approximately 4.5 times inthe sfr of the emitters from z=6.5 to 5.7. thus, the data seem to imply thatthe universe was already highly ionized at z=6.56. the mass-dependent lyatransmissivity is between 0.36-0.51 (erm) and less than 0.26 (lrm) at z=6.56.the lf data at z=4.5 imply an extra lya line damping factor of approximately0.25 possibly due to dust; the presence of a (clumpy) dust component withe(b-v) ~ 0.28 is also required to reproduce the observed large lya equivalentwidths at the same redshift. additional useful information can be extractedfrom the line profile (weighted) skewness, found to be s_w=10-17 angstrom forthe two reionization models, which shows an interesting l_alpha-chi_{hi}anti-correlation, holding under the model assumptions. the shortcomings of themodel and strategies to overcome them are discussed.

astro-ph;0001066	generation of the primordial magnetic fields during cosmological  reionization	we investigate the generation of magnetic field by the biermann battery incosmological ionization fronts, using new simulations of the reionization ofthe universe by stars in protogalaxies. two mechanisms are primarilyresponsible for magnetogenesis: i) the breakout of i-fronts from protogalaxies,and ii) the propagation of i-fronts through the high density neutral filamentswhich are part of the cosmic web. the first mechanism is dominant prior tooverlapping of ionized regions (z ~ 7), whereas the second continues to operateeven after that epoch. however, after overlap the field strength increase islargely due to the gas compression occurring as cosmic structures form. as aconsequence, the magnetic field at z ~ 5 closely traces the gas density, and itis highly ordered on megaparsec scales. the mean mass-weighted field strengthis b_0 ~ 10^{-19} g in the simulation box. there is a relatively well-defined,nearly linear correlation between b_0 and the baryonic mass of virializedobjects, with b_0 ~ 10^{-18} g in the most massive objects (m ~ 10^9 m_sun) inour simulations. this is a lower limit, as lack of numerical resolutionprevents us from following small scale dynamical processes which could amplifythe field in protogalaxies. although the field strengths we compute areprobably adequate as seed fields for a galactic dynamo, the field is too smallto have had significant effects on galaxy formation, on thermal conduction, oron cosmic ray transport in the intergalactic medium. it could, however, beobserved in the intergalactic medium through innovative methods based onanalysis of gamma-ray burst photon arrival times.

astro-ph;0004289	the influence of galactic outflows on the formation of nearby dwarf  galaxies	we show that the gas in growing density perturbations is vulnerable to theinfluence of winds outflowing from nearby collapsed galaxies that have alreadyformed stars. this suggests that the formation of nearby galaxies with massesless than 10^9 solar masses is likely to be suppressed, irrespective of thedetails of galaxy formation. an impinging wind may shock heat the gas of anearby perturbation to above the virial temperature, thereby mechanicallyevaporating the gas, or the baryons may be stripped from the perturbationentirely if they are accelerated to above the escape velocity. we show thatbaryonic stripping is the most effective of these two processes, becauseshock-heated clouds that are too large to be stripped are able to radiativelycool within a sound-crossing time, limiting evaporation. the intergalacticmedium temperatures and star-formation rates required for outflows to have asignificant influence on the formation of low-mass galaxies are consistent withcurrent observations, but may soon be examined directly via associateddistortions in the cosmic microwave background, and with near-infraredobservations from the next generation space telescope, which may detect thesupernovae from early-forming stars.

astro-ph;0004349	mixing metals in the early universe	we investigate the evolution of the metallicity of the intergalactic medium(igm) with particular emphasis on its spatial distribution. we propose thatmetal enrichment occurs as a two step process. first, supernova (sn) explosionseject metals into relatively small regions confined to the surroundings ofstar-forming galaxies. from a comprehensive treatment of blowout we show thatsnae by themselves fail by more than one order of magnitude to distribute theproducts of stellar nucleosynthesis over volumes large enough to pollute thewhole igm to the metallicity levels observed. thus, a additional (but as yetunknown) physical mechanism must be invoked to mix the metals on scalescomparable to the mean distance between the galaxies which are most efficientpollutants. from this simple hypothesis we derive a number of testablepredictions for the evolution of the igm metallicity. specifically, we findthat: (i) the fraction of metals ejected over the star formation history of theuniverse is about 50% at z=0; that is, approximately half of the metals todayare found in the igm; (ii) if the ejected metals were homogeneously mixed withthe baryons in the universe, the average igm metallicity would be &lt;z&gt; ~ 1/25z(solar) at z=3. however, due to spatial inhomogeneities, the mean of thedistribution of metallicities in the diffusive zones has a wide (more than 2orders of magnitude) spread around this value; (iii) if metals become moreuniformly distributed at z &lt; 1, as assumed, at z = 0 the metallicity of the igmis narrowly confined within the range z ~ 0.1 +/- 0.03 z(solar). finally, wepoint out that our results can account for the observed metal content of theintracluster medium.

astro-ph;0005461	detecting the first objects in the mid-ir with ngst	we calculate the expected mid-ir molecular hydrogen line emission from thefirst objects in the universe. due to their low masses, the stellar feedbackfrom massive stars is able to blowaway their gas content and collect it into acooling shell where h_2 rapidly forms and ir roto-vibrational (as for examplethe restframe 2.12 micron) lines carry away a large fraction (up to 10%) of theexplosion energy. the fluxes from these sources are in the range10^{-21}-10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2. the highest number counts are expected in the 20micron band, where about 10^5 sources/deg^2 are predicted at the limiting fluxof 3 \times 10^{-18} erg/s/cm^2. among the planned observational facilities, wefind that the best detection perspectives are offered by ngst, which should beable to reveal about 200 first objects in one hour observation time at itslimiting flux in the above band. therefore, mid-ir instruments appear torepresent perfect tools to trace star formation and stellar feedback in thehigh (z&gt;5) redshift universe.

astro-ph;0010024	cosmological origin of the lowest metallicity halo stars	we explore the predictions of the standard hierarchical clustering scenarioof galaxy formation, regarding the numbers and metallicities of popiii starslikely to be found within our galaxy today. by popiii we shall be referring tostars formed at large redshift ($z&gt;4$), with low metallicities($[z/z_{\odot}]&lt;-2.5$) and in small systems (total mass $\simlt$ $2\times10^{8} m_{\odot}$) that are extremely sensitive to stellar feedback, and whichthrough a prescribed merging history (lacey &amp; cole 1993) end up becoming partof the milky way today. an analytic, extended press-schechter formalism is usedto get the mass functions of halos which will host popiii stars at a givenredshift, and which will end up in milky way sized systems today. each of theseis modeled as a mini galaxy, with a detailed treatment of the dark halostructure, angular momentum distribution, final gas temperature and diskinstabilities, all of which determine the fraction of the baryons which aresubject to star formation. use of new primordial metallicity stellarevolutionary models allows us to trace the history of the stars formed, giveaccurate estimates of their expected numbers today, and their location in$l/l_{\odot}$ vs. $t/k$ hr diagrams. a first comparison with observational datasuggests that the imf of the first stars was increasingly high mass weightedtowards high redshifts, levelling off at $z\simgt 9$ at a characteristicstellar mass scale $m_s=10-15 m_\odot$.

astro-ph;0010158	early metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium by pregalactic  outflows	we assess supernova (sn)-driven pregalactic outflows as a mechanism fordistributing the product of stellar nucleosynthesis over large cosmologicalvolumes prior to the reionization epoch. sn ejecta will escape the grasp ofhalos with virial temperatures t_vir&gt;10^{4.3} k (corresponding to masses m&gt;10^8h^{-1} m_sun at redshift z=9 when they collapse from 2-sigma fluctuations) ifrapid cooling can take place, and a significant fraction of their baryonic massis converted into stars over a dynamical timescale. we study the evolution ofsn-driven bubbles as they blow out from subgalactic halos and propagate intothe intergalactic medium (igm), and show that to lift the halo gas out of thepotential well the energy injection must continue at least until blow-awayoccurs. the collective explosive output of about ten thousands sne per halo atthese early epochs could pollute vast regions of intergalactic space to a meanmetallicity &lt;z&gt;=omega_z/omega_b&gt;0.003 (comparable to the levels observed in thelyman-alpha forest at z=3) without much perturbing the igm hydrodynamically,i.e. producing large variations of the baryons relative to the dark matter. thevolume filling factor of the ejecta is higher than 20% if the star formationefficiency is of order 10%. when the filling factor of the ejecta becomessignificant, enriched material will typically be at a higher adiabat thanexpected from photoionization.

astro-ph;0107095	radiation from the first forming stars	the evolution of radiation emitted during the dynamical collapse ofmetal-free protostellar clouds is investigated within a spherically symmetrichydrodynamical scheme that includes the transfer of radiation and the chemistryof the primordial gas. the cloud centre collapses on a time scale of about10^5-10^6 years, thanks to line cooling from molecular hydrogen (h2). for mostof the collapse time, when the evolution proceeds self-similarly, theluminosity slowly rises up to about 10^36 erg/s and is essentially due to h2 irline emission. later, continuum ir radiation provides an additionalcontribution, which is mostly due to the accretion of an infalling envelopeupon a small hydrostatic protostellar core which develops in the centre. wefollow the beginning of the accretion phase, when the enormous accretion rate(~ 0.1 msun/yr) produces a very high continuum luminosity of about 10^36 erg/s.despite the high luminosities, the radiation field is unable to affect the gasdynamics during the collapse and the first phases of accretion, because theopacity of the infalling gas is too small; this is quite different frompresent-day star formation. we also find that the protostellar evolution issimilar among clouds with different initial configurations, including thoseresulting from 3d cosmological simulations of primordial objects; inparticular, the shape of the molecular spectra is quite universal. finally, webriefly discuss the detectability of this pristine cosmic star formationactivity.

astro-ph;0201342	gamma ray bursts from the first stars: neutrino signals	if the first (popiii) stars were very massive, their final fate is tocollapse into very massive black holes. once a proto-black hole has formed intothe stellar core, accretion continues through a disk. it is widely accepted,although not confirmed, that magnetic fields drive an energetic jet whichproduces a burst of tev neutrinos by photon-meson interaction, and eventuallybreaks out of the stellar envelope appearing as a gamma ray burst (grb). basedon recent numerical simulations and neutrino emission models, we predict theexpected neutrino diffuse flux from these popiii grbs and compare it with thecapabilities of present and planned detectors as amanda and icecube. if beamedinto 1% of the sky, we find that the rate of popiii grbs is $\le 4 \times 10^6$yr$^{-1}$. high energy neutrinos from popiii grbs could dominate the overallflux in two energy bands [$10^4 - 10^5$] gev and [$10^5 - 10^6$] gev ofneutrino telescopes. the enhanced sensitivities of forthcoming detectors in thehigh-energy band (amanda-ii, icecube) will provide a fundamental insight on thecharacteristic explosion energies of popiii grbs and will constitute a uniqueprobe of the the initial mass function (imf) of the first stars and of theredshift $z_f$ marking the metallicity-driven transition from a top-heavy to anormal imf. the current upper limit set by amanda-b10 implies that suchtransition must have occurred not later than $z_f =9.2$ for the most plausiblejet energies. based on such results, we speculate that popiii grbs, if notchocked, could be associated with a new class of events detected by bepposax,the fast x-ray transient (fxts), which are bright x-ray sources, with peakenergies in the 2-10 kev band and durations between 10-200 s.

astro-ph;0201463	early enrichment of the intergalactic medium and its feedback on galaxy  formation	supernova-driven outflows from early galaxies may have had a large impact onthe kinetic and chemical structure of the intergalactic medium (igm). we usethree-dimensional monte carlo cosmological realizations of a simple linearpeaks model to track the time evolution of such metal-enriched outflows andtheir feedback on galaxy formation. we find that at most 30% of the igm byvolume is enriched to values above 10^-3 solar in models that only includeobjects that cool by atomic transitions. the majority of enrichment occursrelatively early (5 &lt; z &lt; 12) and resulting in a mass-averaged cosmologicalmetallicity between 10^-3 and 10^-1.5 solar. the inclusion of population iiiobjects that cool through h2 line emission has only a minor impact on theseresults: increasing the mean metallicity and filling factor by at most a factorof 1.4, and moving the dawn of the enrichment epoch to a redshift ofapproximately 14 at the earliest. thus enrichment by outflowing galaxies islikely to have been incomplete and inhomogeneous, biased to the areas near thestarbursting galaxies themselves. models with a 10% star formation efficiencycan satisfactorily reproduce the nearly constant (2 &lt; z &lt; 5, z approximately3.5 x 10^-4 solar) metallicity of the low column density ly-alpha forestderived by songaila (2001), an effect of the decreasing efficiency of metalloss from larger galaxies. finally, we show that igm enrichment is intimatelytied to the ram-pressure stripping of baryons from neighboring perturbations.this results in the suppression of at least 20% of the dwarf galaxies in themass range 10^8.5 to 10^9.5 solar, in all models with filling factors greaterthan 2%, and an overall suppression of approximately 50% of dwarf galaxies inthe most observationally-favored model.

astro-ph;0204136	what regulates the velocity distribution of interstellar clouds?	kinetic energy stored in ism bulk/turbulent motions is a crucial ingredientto properly describe most properties of observed galaxies. by using monte carlosimulations, we investigate how this energy is injected by supernovae anddissipated via cloud collisions and derive the corresponding ism velocityprobability distribution function (pdf). the functional form of the pdf for themodulus of the velocity dispersion is $$p(v) \propto v^2\exp[-(v/\sigma)^\beta].$$ the power-law index of the pdf depends only on thevalue of the average cloud collision elasticity &lt; \epsilon &gt; as \beta =2\exp(&lt;\epsilon &gt; -1). if \beta and the gas velocity dispersion \sigma areknown, the specific kinetic energy dissipated by collisions is found to be\propto \sigma^2 \ln (2 / \beta)/(\beta-0.947); in steady state, this is equalto the energy input from sne. we predict that in a multiphase, low metallicity(z \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} z_\odot) ism the pdf should be close to amaxwellian (\beta = 2) with velocity dispersion \sigma \simgt 11$ km s\m; inmore metal rich systems (z \simgt 5 \times 10^{-2} z_\odot), instead, we expectto observe almost exponential pdfs. this is in good agreement with a number ofobservations that we review and might explain the different star formationmodes seen in dwarfs and spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0301628	the detectability of the first stars and their cluster enrichment  signatures	we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the detectability of the firststars and their enrichment signatures in galaxy clusters. we show that the meanmetallicity of outflows from objects containing these population iii (popiii)stars is well above the critical transition metallicity (z_cr \sim 10^-4) thatmarks the formation of normal stars. thus the fraction of popiii objects formedas a function of redshift is heavily dependent on the distribution of metalsand fairly independent of the precise value of z_cr. using an analytical modelof inhomogenous structure formation, we study the evolution of popiii objectsas a function of the star formation efficiency, imf, and efficiency of outflowgeneration. for all models, popiii objects tend to be in the 10^6.5-10^7.0solar mass range, just large enough to cool within a hubble time, but smallenough that they are not clustered near areas of previous star formation.although the mean metallicity exceeds z_cr at a redshift of 15 in all models,the peak of popiii star formation occurs at z \sim 10, and such stars continueto form well into the observable range. we discuss the observational propertiesof these objects, some of which may have already been detected in ongoingsurveys of high-redshift lyman-alpha emitters. finally, we combine our popiiidistributions with the yield models of heger and woosley (2002) to study theirimpact on the intracluster medium (icm) in galaxy clusters. we find that popiiistars can contribute no more than 20% of the iron observed in the icm, althoughtheir peculiar elemental yields help to reconcile theoretical models with theobserved fe and si/fe abundances. however, these stars tend to overproduce s/feand their associated sn heating falls far short of the observed level of 1 kevper icm gas particle.

astro-ph;0304473	infrared spectral energy distribution model for extremely young galaxies	the small grain sizes produced by type ii supernova (sn ii) models in young,metal-poor galaxies make the appearance of their infrared (ir) spectral energydistribution (sed) quite different from that of nearby, older galaxies. tostudy this effect, we have developed a model for the evolution of dust contentand the ir sed of low-metallicity, extremely young galaxies based on hirashitaet al. (2002). we find that, even in the intense ultraviolet (uv) radiationfield of very young galaxies, small silicate grains are subject to stochasticheating resulting in a broad temperature distribution and substantial mircontinuum emission. larger carbonaceous grains are in thermal equilibrium at t\simeq 50 - 100k, and they also contribute to the mir. we present the evolutionof seds and ir extinction of very young, low-metallicity galaxies. the irextinction curve is also shown. in the first few myrs, the emission peaks at\lambda \sim 30-50um at later times dust self-absorption decreases the apparentgrain temperatures, shifting the bulk of the emission into the submillimetreband. we successfully apply the model to the ir sed of a low metallicity (1/41z_\odot) dwarf galaxy sbs0335-052. we find the sed, optical properties andextinction of the star forming region to be consistent with a very young andcompact starburst. we also predict the sed of another extremely low-metallicitygalaxy, i zw 18, for future observational tests. some prospects for futureobservations are discussed.

astro-ph;0309127	ultraviolet background radiation from cosmic structure formation	we calculate the contribution to the ultraviolet background (uvb) fromthermal emission from gas shock heated by cosmic structure formation. our maincalculation is based on an updated version of press-schechter theory. it isconsistent with a more empirical estimate based on the observed properties ofgalaxies and the observed cosmic star formation history. thermal uvb emissionis characterized by a hard spectrum extending well beyond 4 ry. the bulk of theradiation is produced by objects in the mass range 10^11-13 m_solar, i.e. largegalaxies and small groups. we compute a composite uvb spectrum due to qso,stellar and thermal components. the ratio of the uvb intensities at the h andhe lyman limits increases from 60 at z=2 to more than 300 at z=6. a comparisonof the resulting photoionization rates to the observed gunn-peterson effect athigh redshifts constrains the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxiesto be less than a few percent. near 1 ry, thermal and stellar emission arecomparable amounting to about 10 %, 20 % and 35 % of the total flux atredshifts of 3, 4.5 and higher, respectively. however, near the ionizationthreshold for heii, the thermal contribution is much stronger. it is comparableto the qso intensity already at redshift ~3 and dominates at redshifts above 4.thermal photons alone are enough to produce and sustain heii reionizationalready at z~6. we discuss the possible implications of our results for thethermal history of the intergalactic medium, in particular for heiireionization.

astro-ph;0311507	early enrichment of quasars by first stars	studies of the broad emission-line regions (blrs) in quasars have revealedsolar or higher enrichment levels up to the highest redshifts. in combinationwith the presence of large amounts of dust in qsos at $z$ about 6, this impliesthat substantial amounts of star formation and nucleosynthesis took place atsignificantly earlier epochs. here, we examine whether a top-heavy stellarinitial mass function (imf) is indicated by current data, by modelling thecontributions from different regions of the imf, including type ia/ii and pairinstability supernovae, to the metal synthesis in blrs. we find that, in orderto reproduce the observations of roughly solar values of n/c and fe/mg in theseobjects, (i) stars with a present-day imf are sufficient, regardless of theirmetallicity, (ii) zero-metallicity stars with a top-heavy imf severelyunderproduce n/c, and (iii) the contribution of type ia sne is not stronglyrequired by the data. therefore, stars of mass about 1-40 $m_\odot$ must haveexisted at $z$ about 10-20, possibly coeval with any hypothesized stars ofmasses exceeding about 100 $m_\odot$ at these epochs. this is in agreement withthe nucleosynthetic abundance pattern detected in extremely metal-poor stars inthe galactic halo.

astro-ph;0408410	the nature of lya blobs: supernova-dominated primordial galaxies	we consider a forming galaxy undergoing multitudinous supernova (sn)explosions, as a possible model of \lya blobs (labs). for this purpose, anultra--high resolution hydrodynamic simulation is performed using $1024^3$ gridpoints, where sn remnants are resolved with sufficient accuracy. it is foundthat multiple sn explosions produce kpc--size expanding hot bubbles, whichdrive cool, dense shells by strong shock. the colliding high--density coolingshells radiate intensive \lya emission, resulting in a high \lya luminosity of$\sim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable to the observed level in labs. also,recently discovered bubbly features in some labs are quite similar to thestructure predicted in the present simulation. furthermore, the resultdemonstrates that labs are representative of evolving primordial galaxies; theycould hold direct information on the early chemical enrichment of galaxies,contrary to present--day galaxies which have undergone intense recycling ofinterstellar matter, thus erasing most of the early chemical history. it turnsout that the metal mixing proceeds in a very inhomogeneous fashion, so thatthere appears a large spread of metallicity, that is,$[{\rm fe/h}] \approx 0{\rm ~to} -5$ or $[{\rm o/h}] \approx 1 {\rm ~to} -4$. hence, the earlygalactic chemical evolution may have proceeded in a different manner from thathitherto considered in one--zone models.

astro-ph;0411187	suppression of dwarf galaxy formation by cosmic shocks	we carry out a numerical study of the effects of supernova-driven shocks ongalaxy formation at z=9. these "cosmic explosions" can have a significantimpact on galaxies forming nearby. we study such interactions in two key cases.in the first case in which the forming galaxy has already virialized, theimpinging shock has only a small effect (&lt; 1% of the gas is removed) and starformation continues relatively unimpeded. however, in the second case in whichthe nearby forming galaxy is at the more diffuse turn-around stage, a largefraction (~70%) of the gas is stripped away from the host dark-matter halo andejected into the intergalactic medium. as the time spent near turn-around ismuch longer than the interval from virialization to galaxy formation due tostrong radiative losses, we expect the second case to be more representative ofthe majority of outflow-galaxy interactions. thus sn-driven pregalacticoutflows may be an efficient mechanism for inhibiting the formation ofneighbouring galaxies at high redshift. we briefly outline the possiblecosmological consequences of this effect.

astro-ph;0501147	igm metal enrichment through dust sputtering	we study the motion of dust grains into the intergalactic medium (igm) aroundredshift z=3, to test the hypothesis that grains can efficiently pollute thegas with metals through sputtering. we use the results available in theliterature for radiation-driven dust ejection from galaxies as initialconditions, and follow the motion onward. via this mechanism, grains areejected into the igm with velocities &gt;100 km/s; as they move supersonically,grains can be efficiently eroded by non-thermal sputtering. however, coulomband collisional drag forces effectively reduce the charged grain velocity.up-to-date sputtering yields for graphite and silicate (olivine) grains havebeen derived using the code trim, for which we provide analytic fits. aftertraining our method on a homogeneous density case, we analyze the grain motionand sputtering in the igm density field as derived from a lambdacdmcosmological simulation at z = 3.27. we found that only large (a &gt;~ 0.1-um)grains can travel up to considerable distances (few times 100 kpc physical)before being stopped. resulting metallicities show a well defined trend withoverdensity delta. the maximum metallicities are reached for 10&lt;delta&lt;100(corresponding to systems, in qso absorption spectra, with 14.5 &lt; log n_hi &lt;16). however the distribution of sputtered metals is very inhomogeneous, withonly a small fraction of the igm volume polluted by dust sputtering (fillingfactors of 18 per cent for si and 6 per cent for c). for the adopted sizedistribution, grains are never completely destroyed; nevertheless, theextinction and gas photo-electric heating effects due to this population ofintergalactic grains are well below current detection limits.

astro-ph;9701058	the survival of interstellar clouds against kelvin-helmholtz  instabilities	we consider the stability of clouds surrounded by a hotter confining mediumwith respect to which they are in motion, against kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities (khi). in the presence of cooling, sound waves are damped bydissipation. whenever cooling times are shorter than sound crossing times, asthey are in the normal interstellar medium, this implies that the instabilitygenerated at the interface of the two media cannot propagate far from theinterface itself. to study how this influences the overall stability, first wederive an analytic dispersion relation for cooling media, separated by a shearlayer. the inclusion of dissipation does not heal the instability, but it isshown that only a small volume around the interface is affected, theperturbation decaying exponentially with distance from the surface; this isconfirmed by numerical simulations. numerical simulations of spherical cloudsmoving in a surrounding intercloud medium by which they are pressure confinedshow that these clouds develop a core/halo structure, with a turbulent halo,and a core in laminar flow nearly unscathed by the khi. the related andpreviously reported ``champagne effect'', whereby clouds seem to explode fromtheir top sides, is cured by the inclusion of radiative losses.

astro-ph;9702143	energy dissipation in interstellar cloud collisions	we present a study of the kinetic energy dissipation in interstellar cloudcollisions. the main aim is to understand the dependence of the elasticity(defined as the ratio of the final to the initial kinetic energy of the clouds)on the velocity and mass ratio of the colliding clouds, magnetic fieldstrength, and gas metallicity for head-on collisions. the problem has beenstudied both analytically and via numerical simulations. we have derived handyanalytical relationships that well approximate the analogous numerical results.the main findings of this work are: (i) the kinetic energy dissipation in cloudcollisions is minimum (i.e. the collision elasticity is maximum) for a cloudrelative velocity $v_r \simeq 30 km s^{-1}$; (ii) the above minimum value isproportional $z l_c^2$, where $z$ is the metallicity and $l_c$ is the cloudsize: the larger is $z l_c^2$ the more dissipative (i.e. inelastic) thecollision will be; (iii) in general, we find that the energy dissipationdecreases when the magnetic field strength, and mass ratio of the clouds areincreased and the metallicity is decreased, respectively. we briefly discussthe relevance of this study to the global structure of the interstellar mediumand to galaxy formation and evolution.

astro-ph;9706208	hydrodynamics of cloud collisions in 2d: the fate of clouds in a  multi-phase medium	we have studied head-on collisions between equal-mass, mildly supersonic(mach number 1.5) hi clouds, in a standard two-phase ism (t_cl = 74 k, n_cl =22 cm^-3, \chi = 100). we explore the role of various factors, including theradiative cooling parameter \eta = t_rad/t_coll (t_coll=r_c/v_c), evolutionarymodifications on the cloud structure (by colliding clouds ``evolved'' throughindependent motion within the intercloud medium (wim)), and the symmetry of theproblem (by colliding initially identical clouds, evolved to different agesbefore impact). the presence of bow shocks and ram pressure from material inthe cloud wake, developed during such evolution through the wim, significantlyalters these interactions with respect to the standard case of non-evolvedclouds.  in general, in our adiabatic collisions the clouds are disrupted and converttheir gas into a few low density contrast clumps. by contrast, for symmetricradiative cases we find that the two clouds coalesce, with almost all theinitial kinetic energy radiated away. on the other hand, for both adiabatic andradiative collisions, asymmetric collisions have a much greater tendency todisrupt the two clouds. fragmentation of the clouds may occur, andinstabilities are in general enhanced. in addition, radiative cooling is lessefficient in our asymmetric interactions, so that those parts of the cloudsthat initially seem to merge are more likely to re-expand and fade into thewim. since the majority of real cloud collisions should be asymmetric for onereason or another, we conclude that most gasdynamical diffuse cloud collisionswill be disruptive, at least in the absence of significant self-gravity or of asignificant magnetic field.

astro-ph;9708197	on the dust extinction in high-z galaxies and the case of extremely red  objects	we present the preliminary results of monte carlo simulations aimed toinvestigate the effects of realistic dust extinction (absorption + scattering)on the colours of high-z galaxies. in this paper, we concentrate on the case ofspheroidal galaxies, and we obtain attenuation curves in the range0.1-1.2$\mu$m for different dust spatial distributions, and for a range ofvalues of the dust optical depth, geometrical thickness and inclination of thedust disk. we find that the resultant curves are strongly dependent on the dustgeometrical distribution and optical depth. a serendipitous finding is that thestrength of the 2200 \aa absorption feature depends not only on the opticaldepth, but also on the dust geometrical distribution. as a first application,we test our results on two high-z galaxies with extremely red colours (hr10 andhr14) in order to infer clues on their ages, dust content and dust spatialdistribution. we confirm that hr10 must be a very dusty galaxy, and we suggestthat its stellar component should be strongly embedded in the dust in order toreproduce the observed extremely red colours.

astro-ph;9801237	starburst-driven mass loss from dwarf galaxies: efficiency and metal  ejection	we model the effects of repeated supernova explosions from starbursts indwarf galaxies on the interstellar medium of these galaxies, taking intoaccount the gravitational potential of their dominant dark matter haloes. weexplore supernova rates from one every 30,000 yr to one every 3 million yr,equivalent to steady mechanical luminosities of l=0.1-10 x 10^38 ergs/s,occurring in dwarf galaxies with gas masses m_g=10^6 - 10^9 solar masses. weaddress in detail, both analytically and numerically, the following threequestions:  1. when do the supernova ejecta blow out of the disk of the galaxy?  2. when blowout occurs, what fraction of the interstellar gas is blown away,escaping the potential of the galactic halo?  3. what happens to the metals ejected from the massive stars of thestarburst? are they retained or blown away?  we give quantitative results for when blowout will or will not occur ingalaxies with 10^6 \leq m_g \leq 10^9 solar masses. surprisingly, we find thatthe mass ejection efficiency is very low for galaxies with mass m_g \geq 10^7solar masses. only galaxies with m_g \leq 10^6 solar masses have theirinterstellar gas blown away, and then virtually independently of l. on theother hand, metals from the supernova ejecta are accelerated to velocitieslarger than the escape speed from the galaxy far more easily than the gas. wefind that for l_38=1, only about 30% of the metals are retained by a 10^9 solarmass galaxy, and virtually none by smaller galaxies. we discuss theimplications of our results for the evolution, metallicity and observationalproperties of dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;9806053	gravitational magnification of pop iii supernovae in hierarchical  cosmological models: ngst perspectives	we study the gravitational lensing magnification produced by the interveningcosmological matter distribution, as deduced from three different hierarchicalmodels (scdm, lcdm, chdm) on very high redshift sources, particularlysupernovae in protogalactic (pop iii) objects. by means of ray-shootingnumerical simulations we find that caustics are more intense and concentratedin scdm models. the magnification probability function presents a moderatedegree of evolution up to $z\approx 5$ (chdm) and $z\approx 7$ (scdm/lcdm). allmodels predict that statistically large magnifications, $\mu \simgt 20$ areachievable, with a probability of the order of a fraction of percent, the scdmmodel being the most efficient magnifier. all cosmologies predict that above$z\approx 4$ there is a 10% chance to get magnifications larger than 3. we haveexplored the observational perspectives for pop iii sne detection with ngstwhen gravitational magnification is taken into account. we find that ngstshould be able to detect and confirm spectroscopically type ii sne up to aredshift of $z \approx 4$ in the j band (for $t_{sn}=25000$ k); this limitcould be increased up to $z\approx 9$ in the k band, allowing for a relativelymoderate magnification. possibly promising strategies to discriminate amongcosmological models using their gl magnification predictions and very high-$z$sne are sketched. finally, we outline and discuss the limitations of our study.

astro-ph;9808174	magnetohydrodynamics of cloud collisions in a multi-phase interstellar  medium	we extend previous studies of the physics of interstellar cloud collisions bybeginning investigation of the role of magnetic fields through 2dmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) numerical simulations. we study head-on collisionsbetween equal mass, mildly supersonic diffuse clouds. we include a moderatemagnetic field and two limiting field geometries, with the field lines parallel(aligned) and perpendicular (transverse) to the colliding cloud motion. weexplore both adiabatic and radiative cases, as well as symmetric and asymmetricones. we also compute collisions between clouds evolved through prior motion inthe intercloud medium and compare with unevolved cases.  we find that: in the (i) aligned case, adiabatic collisions, like their hdcounterparts, are very disruptive, independent of the cloud symmetry. however,when radiative processes are taken into account, partial coalescence takesplace even in the asymmetric case, unlike the hd calculations. in the (ii)transverse case, collisions between initially adjacent unevolved clouds arealmost unaffected by magnetic fields. however, the interaction with themagnetized intercloud gas during the pre-collision evolution produces a regionof very high magnetic energy in front of the cloud. in collisions betweenevolved clouds with transverse field geometry, this region acts like a``bumper'', preventing direct contact between the clouds, and eventuallyreverses their motion. the ``elasticity'', defined as the ratio of the final tothe initial kinetic energy of each cloud, is about 0.5-0.6 in the cases weconsidered. this behavior is found both in adiabatic and radiative cases.

astro-ph;9903331	the escape of ionizing photons from ob associations in disk galaxies:  radiation transfer through superbubbles	by solving the time-dependent radiation transfer problem of stellar radiationthrough evolving superbubbles within a smoothly varying hi distribution, weestimate the fraction of ionizing photons emitted by ob associations thatescapes the hi disk of our galaxy into the halo and intergalactic medium (igm).we consider both coeval star-formation and a gaussian star-formation historywith a time spread sigma_t = 2 myr. we consider both a uniform h i distributionand a two-phase (cloud/intercloud) model, with a negligible filling factor ofhot gas. we find that the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap orattenuate the ionizing flux, so that most of the escaping radiation escapesshortly after the formation of the superbubble. for the coeval star-formationhistory, the total fraction of lyman continuum photons that escape both sidesof the disk in the solar vicinity is f_esc approx 0.15 +/- 0.05. for thegaussian star formation history, f_esc approx 0.06 +/- 0.03, a value roughly afactor of two lower than the results of dove &amp; shull (1994), where superbubbleswere not considered. for a local production rate of ionizing photons psi_lyc =4.95 x 10^7 cm^{-2} s^{-1}, the flux escaping the disk is phi_lyc approx(1.5-3.0) x 10^6 cm^{-2} s^{-1} for coeval and gaussian star formation,comparable to the flux required to sustain the reynolds layer.

astro-ph;9909395	effects of clumping on the observed properties of dusty galaxies	we present monte carlo radiative transfer simulations for spiral galaxiesmodelled as a stellar disk and a two-phase clumpy dust distribution. we dividethe volume occupied by the dust into a three-dimensional grid and assign eachcell a clump or smooth medium status. cell dimension, clump dust mass andspatial distribution are derived from the observed properties of giantmolecular clouds and molecular gas in the galaxy. we produce models for severalvalues of the optical depth and fraction of the interstellar medium residing inclumps. as a general result, clumpy models are less opaque than thecorresponding homogeneous models. for the adopted parameters, the increase inthe fraction of energy that escapes the disk is moderate, resulting in surfacebrightness profiles that are less than one magnitude brighter than those of thehomogeneous models. the effects of clumping are larger for edge-on views of thedisk. this is in contrast with previous preliminary results for clumping in theliterature. we show how differences arise from the different parametrisationand clump distribution adopted. we also consider models in which a fraction ofthe stellar radiation is emitted within the clumps. in this case, galaxies areless transparent than in the case when only dust is clumped. the opacity can beeven higher than in the homogeneous case, depending on the fraction of embeddedstellar emission. we point out the implications of the results for thedetermination of the opacity and dust mass of spiral galaxies.

0812.3151	ultra faint dwarfs: probing early cosmic star formation	we investigate the nature of the newly discovered ultra faint dwarfspheroidal galaxies (uf dsphs) in a general cosmological context simultaneouslyaccounting for various ``classical`` dsphs and milky way properties includingtheir metallicity distribution function (mdf). to this aim we extend the mergertree approach previously developed to include the presence of star-formingminihaloes, and an heuristic prescription for radiative feedback. the modelsuccessfully reproduces both the observed [fe/h]-luminosity relation and themean mdf of ufs. in this picture ufs are the oldest, most dark matter-dominated(m/l &gt; 100) dsphs with a total mass m= 10^{7-8}msun; they are leftovers ofh_2-cooling minihaloes formed at z &gt; 8.5, i.e. before reionization. their mdfis broader (because of a more prolonged sf) and shifted towards lower [fe/h](as a result of a lower gas metallicity at the time of formation) than that ofclassical dsphs. these systems are very ineffectively star-forming, turninginto stars by z=0 only &lt;3% of the potentially available baryons. we provide auseful fit for the star formation efficiency of dsphs.
