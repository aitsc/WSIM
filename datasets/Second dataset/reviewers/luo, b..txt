0901.2929	discovery of the most-distant double-peaked emitter at z=1.369	we report the discovery of the most-distant double-peaked emitter, cxoecdfsj033115.0-275518, at z=1.369. a keck/deimos spectrum shows a clearlydouble-peaked broad mg ii $\lambda2799$ emission line, with fwhm 11000 km/s forthe line complex. the line profile can be well fit by an ellipticalrelativistic keplerian disk model. this is one of a handful of double-peakedemitters known to be a luminous quasar, with excellent multiwavelength coverageand a high-quality x-ray spectrum. cxoecdfs j033115.0-275518 is a radio-loudquasar with two radio lobes (fr ii morphology) and a radio loudness of f_{5ghz}/f_{4400 \aa}~429. the x-ray spectrum can be modeled by a power law withphoton index 1.72 and no intrinsic absorption; the rest-frame 0.5-8.0 kevluminosity is $5.0\times10^{44}$ erg/s. the spectral energy distribution (sed)of cxoecdfs j033115.0-275518 has a shape typical for radio-loud quasars anddouble-peaked emitters at lower redshift. the local viscous energy releasedfrom the line-emitting region of the accretion disk is probably insufficient topower the observed line flux, and external illumination of the disk appears tobe required. the presence of a big blue bump in the sed along with theunexceptional x-ray spectrum suggest that the illumination cannot arise from aradiatively inefficient accretion flow.

1002.3154	identifications and photometric redshifts of the 2 ms chandra deep  field-south sources	[abridged] we present reliable multiwavelength identifications andhigh-quality photometric redshifts for the 462 x-ray sources in the ~2 mschandra deep field-south. source identifications are carried out using deepoptical-to-radio multiwavelength catalogs, and are then combined to createlists of primary and secondary counterparts for the x-ray sources. weidentified reliable counterparts for 446 (96.5%) of the x-ray sources, with anexpected false-match probability of ~6.2%. a likelihood-ratio method is usedfor source matching, which effectively reduces the false-match probability atfaint magnitudes compared to a simple error-circle matching method. weconstruct a master photometric catalog for the identified x-ray sourcesincluding up to 42 bands of uv-to-infrared data, and then calculate theirphotometric redshifts (photo-z's). the reliability of the photo-z's isevaluated using the subsample of 220 sources with secure spectroscopicredshifts. we achieve an accuracy of ~1% [|delta z|/(1+z)] and an outlierfraction of ~1.4% for sources with spectroscopic redshifts. we performed blindtests to derive a more realistic estimate of the photo-z quality for sourceswithout spectroscopic redshifts. we expect there are ~9% outliers for therelatively brighter sources (r&lt;26), and the outlier fraction will increase to~15-25% for the fainter sources (r&gt;26). the typical photo-z accuracy is ~6-7%.the outlier fraction and photo-z accuracy do not appear to have a redshiftdependence (for z~0-4). these photo-z's appear to be the best obtained so farfor faint x-ray sources, and they have been significantly (&gt;50%) improvedcompared to previous estimates of the photo-z's for the x-ray sources in the ~2ms chandra deep field-north and ~1 ms chandra deep field-south.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

1006.4436	radiation pressure, absorption and agn feedback in the chandra deep  fields	the presence of absorbing gas around the central engine of active galacticnuclei (agn) is a common feature of these objects. recent work has looked atthe effect of the dust component of the gas, and how it enhances radiationpressure such that dusty gas can have a lower effective eddington limit thanionised gas. in this work, we use multi-wavelength data and x-ray spectra fromthe 2 ms exposures of the chandra deep field north and chandra deep field southsurveys, to characterise the agn in terms of their eddington ratio and hydrogencolumn density. their distributions are then compared with what is predictedwhen considering the coupling between dust and gas. our final sample consistsof 234 objects from both fields, the largest and deepest sample of agn forwhich this comparison has been made up to date. we find that most of the agn inour sample tend to be found at low eddington ratios (typically between 1e-4 and1e-1) and high column density (&gt;1e22 cm^-2), with black hole masses between~1e8 and 1e9 solar masses. their distribution is in agreement with thatexpected from the enhanced radiation pressure model, avoiding the area where wewould predict the presence of outflows. we also investigate how the balancebetween agn radiation pressure and gravitational potential influences thebehaviour of clouds in the galactic bulge, and describe a scenario where anenhanced radiation pressure can lead to the fundamental plane of blackhole/galaxy scaling relations.

1007.1453	color-magnitude relations of active and non-active galaxies in the  chandra deep fields: high-redshift constraints and stellar-mass selection  effects	[abridged] we extend color-magnitude relations for moderate-luminosity x-rayagn hosts and non-agn galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch in thechandra deep fields. we utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) toassess the role of moderate-luminosity agns in galaxy evolution. first, weconfirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., thereis no apparent color bimodality for agn hosts from z~0-2, but non-agn galaxycolor bimodality exists up to z~3; most agns reside in massive hosts and theagn fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and thecolors of both agn hosts and non-agn galaxies become redder as the stellar massincreases up to z~2-3. second, we point out that it is critical to usemass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of agn hosts andnon-agn galaxies. we show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, agn hostslie in the same cmd region as non-agn galaxies; i.e., there is no specificclustering of agn hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, orthe green valley in between. the agn fraction (~10%) is mostly independent ofhost-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of smbh growth intypical massive galaxies. these results are in contrast to those obtained withnon-mass-matched samples where there is apparent agn clustering in the cmd andthe agn fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. we also find,for mass-matched samples, that the sfrs of agn hosts are typically a factor of~2-3 larger than those of non-agn galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this differencediminishes at z~1-3. our results can be reasonably explained by two mainingredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution ofgalaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity agnfeedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

1102.4714	a compton-thick agn at z~5 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south	we report the discovery of a compton-thick active galactic nucleus (agn) atz=4.76 in the 4 ms chandra deep field south. this object was selected as av-band dropout in hst/acs images and previously recognized as an agn fromoptical spectroscopy. the 4 ms chandra observations show a significant(~4.2sigma) x-ray detection at the v-band dropout position. the x-ray sourcedisplays a hardness ratio of hr=0.23+-0.24, which, for a source at z~5, ishighly suggestive of compton-thick absorption. the source x-ray spectrum isseen above the background level in the energy range of ~0.9-4 kev, i.e., in therest-frame energy range of ~5-23 kev. when fixing the photon index togamma=1.8, the measured column density is n_h=1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5} x 10^{24}cm^{-2}, which is compton-thick. to our knowledge, this is the most distantheavily obscured agn, confirmed by x-ray spectral analysis, discovered so far.the intrinsic (de-absorbed), rest-frame luminosity in the 2-10 kev band is ~2.5x 10^{44} erg s^{-1}, which places this object among type-2 quasars. thespectral energy distribution shows that massive star formation is associatedwith obscured black hole accretion. this system may have then been caughtduring a major co-eval episode of black hole and stellar mass assembly at earlytimes. the measure of the number density of heavily obscured agn at highredshifts will be crucial to reconstruct the bh/galaxy evolution history fromthe beginning.

1106.1443	x-ray spectral constraints for z~2 massive galaxies: the identification  of reflection-dominated active galactic nuclei	we use the 4ms cdf-s survey to place direct x-ray constraints on the ubiquityof z~2 heavily obscured agns in k&lt;22 bzk galaxies. forty seven of the 222 bzkgalaxies in the central region of the cdf-s are detected at x-ray energies, 11of which have hard x-ray spectral slopes (gamma&lt;1) indicating the presence ofheavily obscured agn activity. the other 36 x-ray detected bzk galaxies appearto be relatively unobscured agns and starburst galaxies; we use x-rayvariability analyses over a rest-frame baseline of ~3 years to further confirmthe presence of agn activity in many of these systems. the majority (7 out of11) of the heavily obscured agns have excess ir emission over that expectedfrom star formation (termed "ir-excess galaxies"). however, we find that x-raydetected heavily obscured agns only comprise ~25% of the ir-excess galaxypopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured agns andstarburst galaxies. we find that the typical x-ray spectrum of the heavilyobscured agns is better characterized by a pure reflection model than anabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme compton-thick absorption in somesystems. we verify this result by producing a composite rest-frame 2-20 kevspectrum, which has a similar shape as a reflection-dominated x-ray spectrumand reveals an emission feature at rest-frame energy ~6.4 kev, likely to be dueto fe k. these heavily obscured agns are likely to be the distant analogs ofthe reflection-dominated agns recently identified at z~0 with &gt;10 kevobservatories. on the basis of these analyses we estimate the space density fortypical (intrinsic x-ray luminosities of l_x&gt;1e43 erg/s) heavily obscured andcompton-thick agns at z~2. our space-density constraints are conservative lowerlimits but they are already consistent with the range of predictions from x-raybackground models.

1106.4284	goods-herschel: the far-infrared view of star formation in agn host  galaxies since z~3	we present a study of the infrared properties of x-ray selected, moderateluminosity (lx=10^{42}-10^{44}ergs/s) active galactic nuclei (agns) up to z~3,to explore the links between star formation in galaxies and accretion ontotheir central black holes. we use 100um and 160um fluxes from goods-herschel-the deepest survey yet undertaken by the herschel telescope- and show that in&gt;94 per cent of cases these fluxes are dominated by the host. we find noevidence of any correlation between the x-ray and infrared luminosities ofmoderate agns at any redshift, suggesting that star-formation is decoupled fromnuclear (agn) activity. the star formation rates of agn hosts increase stronglywith redshift; by a factor of 43 from z&lt;0.1 to z=2-3 for agns with the samex-ray luminosities. this increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50increase in the specific star formation rates (ssfrs) of normal, star-forming(main-sequence) galaxies. indeed, the average ssfrs of agn hosts are onlymarginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with thissmall deficit being due to a fraction of agns residing in quiescent (low-ssfr)galaxies. we estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate agns are hosted inmain-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and &lt;10 per centin strongly starbursting galaxies. the fractions of all main sequence galaxiesat z&lt;2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependenton galaxy stellar mass (mstars); rising from a few per cent atmstars~10^{10}msun to &gt;20 per cent at mstars&gt;10^{11}msun. our results indicatethat it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether agalaxy hosts a moderate luminosity agn. we argue that the majority of moderatenuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers,suggesting that disk instabilities could be an important agn feeding mechanism.

1107.3148	"revealing a population of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei at  z=0.5-1 in the chandra deep field-south	(abridged) we identify a numerically significant population of heavilyobscured agns at z~0.5-1 in the chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) and extendedchandra deep field-south by selecting 242 x-ray undetected objects withinfrared-based star formation rates (sfrs) substantially higher (a factor of3.2 or more) than their sfrs determined from the uv after correcting for dustextinction. an x-ray stacking analysis of 23 candidates in the central cdf-sregion using the 4 ms chandra data reveals a hard x-ray signal with aneffective power-law photon index of gamma=0.6_{-0.4}^{+0.3}, indicating asignificant contribution from obscured agns. based on monte carlo simulations,we conclude that 74+-25% of the selected galaxies host obscured agns, withinwhich ~95% are heavily obscured and ~80% are compton-thick (ct; nh&gt;1.5x10^{24}cm^{-2}). the heavily obscured objects in our sample are of moderate intrinsicx-ray luminosity [ ~ (0.9-4)x10^{42} erg/s in the 2-10 kev band]. the spacedensity of the ct agns is (1.6+-0.5)x10^{-4} mpc^{-3}. the z~0.5-1 ct objectsstudied here are expected to contribute ~1% of the total xrb flux in the 10-30kev band, and they account for ~5-15% of the emission in this energy bandexpected from all ct agns according to population-synthesis models. in the 6--8kev band, the stacked signal of the 23 heavily obscured candidates accounts for&lt;5% of the unresolved xrb flux, while the unresolved ~25% of the xrb in thisband can probably be explained by a stacking analysis of the x-ray undetectedoptical galaxies in the cdf-s (a 2.5 sigma stacked signal). we discussprospects to identify such heavily obscured objects using future hard x-rayobservatories.

1108.3229	supermassive black hole growth in starburst galaxies over cosmic time:  constraints from the deepest chandra fields	we present an analysis of deep multiwavelength data for z ~ 0.3-3 starburstgalaxies selected by their 70 um emission in the extended-chandra deepfield-south and extended groth strip. we identify active galactic nuclei (agns)in these infrared sources through their x-ray emission and quantify thefraction that host an agn. we find that the fraction depends strongly on boththe mid-infrared color and rest-frame mid-infrared luminosity of the source,rising to ~ 50-70% at the warmest colors and highest mid-infrared luminosities(corresponding to ultraluminous infrared galaxies), similar to the trends foundlocally. additionally, we find that the agn fraction depends strongly on thestar formation rate of the host galaxy (inferred from the observed 70 umluminosity after subtracting the estimated agn contribution), particularly formore luminous agns (l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/s). at the highest star formation rates (~1000 m_sun/yr), the fraction of galaxies with an x-ray detected agn rises to ~30%, roughly consistent with that found in high-redshift submillimetergalaxies. assuming that the agn fraction is driven by the star formation rate(rather than stellar mass or redshift, for which our sample is largelydegenerate), this result implies that the duty cycle of luminous agn activityincreases with the star formation rate of the host galaxy: specifically, wefind that luminous x-ray detected agns are at least ~ 5-10 times more common insystems with high star formation rates (&gt; 300 m_sun/yr) than in systems withlower star formation rates (&lt; 30 m_sun/yr). lastly, we investigate the ratiobetween the supermassive black hole accretion rate and the growth rate of thehost galaxy and find that, for sources with detected agns and star formation,this ratio in distant starbursts agrees well with that expected from the localscaling relation assuming the black holes and bulges grew at the same epoch.

1201.4391	variability selected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in the 4 ms  chandra deep field-south	the 4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) and other deep x-ray surveys havebeen highly effective at selecting active galactic nuclei (agn). however,cosmologically distant low-luminosity agn (llagn) have remained a challenge toidentify due to significant contribution from the host galaxy. we identifylong-term x-ray variability (~month-years, observed frame) in 20 of 92 cdf-sgalaxies spanning redshifts z~0.08-1.02 that do not meet other agn selectioncriteria. we show that the observed variability cannot be explained by x-raybinary populations or ultraluminous x-ray sources, so the variability is mostlikely caused by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. the variablegalaxies are not heavily obscured in general, with a stacked effectivepower-law photon index of gamma_stack~1.93+/-0.13, and are therefore likelyllagn. the llagn tend to lie a factor of ~6-80 below the extrapolated linearvariability-luminosity relation measured for luminous agn. this may beexplained by their lower accretion rates. variability-independent black-holemass and accretion-rate estimates for variable galaxies show that they sample asignificantly different black-hole mass-accretion rate space, with masses afactor of 2.4 lower and accretion rates a factor of 22.5 lower than variableluminous agn at the same redshift. we find that an empirical model based on auniversal broken power-law psd function, where the break frequency depends onsmbh mass and accretion rate, roughly reproduces the shape, but not thenormalization, of the variability-luminosity trends measured for variablegalaxies and more luminous agn.

1202.0041	the cosmic history of hot gas cooling and radio agn activity in massive  early-type galaxies	we study the x-ray properties of 393 optically selected early-type galaxies(etgs) over the redshift range of z~0.0-1.2 in the chandra deep fields. tomeasure the average x-ray properties of the etg population, we use x-raystacking analyses with a subset of 158 passive etgs (148 of which wereindividually undetected in x-ray). this etg subset was constructed to span theredshift ranges of z = 0.1-1.2 in the ~4 ms cdf-s and ~2 ms cdf-n and z =0.1-0.6 in the ~250 ks e-cdf-s where the contribution from individuallyundetected agns is expected to be negligible in our stacking. we find that 55of the etgs are detected individually in the x-rays, and 12 of these galaxieshave properties consistent with being passive hot-gas dominated systems (i.e.,systems not dominated by an x-ray bright active galactic nucleus; agn). on thebasis of our analyses, we find little evolution in the mean 0.5-2 kev to b-bandluminosity ratio (l_x/l_b proportional to [1 + z]^1.2) since z~1.2, implyingthat some heating mechanism prevents the gas from cooling in these systems. weconsider that feedback from radio-mode agn activity could be responsible forheating the gas. we select radio agns in the etg population using theirfar-infrared/radio flux ratio. our radio observations allow us to constrain theduty cycle history of radio agn activity in our etg sample. we estimate that ifscaling relations between radio and mechanical power hold out to z~1.2 for theetg population being studied here, the average mechanical power from agnactivity is a factor of ~1.4-2.6 times larger than the average radiativecooling power from hot gas over the redshift range z~0-1.2. the excess ofinferred agn mechanical power from these etgs is consistent with that found inthe local universe for similar types of galaxies.

1204.1977	the 4 ms chandra deep field-south number counts apportioned by source  class: pervasive active galactic nuclei and the ascent of normal galaxies	we present 0.5-2 kev, 2-8 kev, 4-8 kev, and 0.5-8 kev cumulative anddifferential number counts (logn-logs) measurements for the recently completed~4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) survey, the deepest x-ray survey todate. we implement a new bayesian approach, which allows reliable calculationof number counts down to flux limits that are factors of ~1.9-4.3 times fainterthan the previously deepest number-counts investigations. in the soft band, themost sensitive bandpass in our analysis, the ~4 ms cdf-s reaches a maximumsource density of ~27,800 deg-2. by virtue of the exquisite x-ray andmultiwavelength data available in the cdf-s, we are able to measure the numbercounts from a variety of source populations (active galactic nuclei [agns],normal galaxies, and galactic stars) and subpopulations (as a function ofredshift, agn absorption, luminosity, and galaxy morphology), and test modelsthat describe their evolution. we find that agns still dominate the x-raynumber counts down to the faintest flux levels for all bands and reach alimiting soft-band source density of ~14,900 deg-2, the highest reliable agnsource density measured at any wavelength. we find that the normal-galaxycounts rise rapidly near the flux limits, and at the limiting soft-band flux,reach source densities of ~12,700 deg-2 and make up 46+/-5% of the total numbercounts. the rapid rise of the galaxy counts toward faint fluxes, andsignificant normal-galaxy contributions to the overall number counts, indicatethat normal galaxies will overtake agns just below the ~4 ms soft-band fluxlimit and will provide a numerically significant new x-ray source population infuture surveys that reach below the ~4 ms sensitivity limit. we show that afuture ~10 ms cdf-s would allow for a significant increase in x-ray detectedsources, with many of the new sources being cosmologically distant (z &gt; 0.6)normal galaxies.

0711.2517	deep-survey constraints on x-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei	luminous x-ray outbursts with variability amplitudes as high as ~1000 havebeen detected from a small number of galactic nuclei. these events are likelyassociated with transient fueling of nuclear supermassive black holes. in thispaper, we constrain x-ray outbursts with harder spectra, higher redshifts, andlower luminosities than have been studied previously. we performed a systematicsurvey of 24668 optical galaxies in the chandra deep fields to search for suchx-ray outbursts; the median redshift of these galaxies is ~0.8. the surveyspans 798 days for the chandra deep field-north, and 1828 days for the chandradeep field-south. no outbursts were found, and thus we set upper limits on therate of such events in the universe, which depend upon the adopted outburstx-ray luminosity. for an outburst with x-ray luminosity $\ga 10^{43}$ ergs/sand a duration of 6 months, the upper limit on its event rate is ~10^{-4}/galaxy/yr, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. compared toprevious survey results, our harder-band and deeper survey suggests that theoutburst rate may increase by a maximum factor of 10 when considering bothobscured x-ray outbursts and redshift evolution from z~0 to z~0.8. our resultsalso suggest that the x-ray luminosity function for moderate-luminosity activegalactic nuclei is not primarily due to stellar tidal disruptions.

1209.0467	tracking down the source population responsible for the unresolved  cosmic 6-8 kev background	using the 4 ms chandra deep field-south (cdf-s) survey, we have identified asample of 6845 x-ray undetected galaxies that dominates the unresolved ~ 20-25%of the 6-8 kev cosmic x-ray background (xrb). this sample was constructed byapplying mass and color cuts to sources from a parent catalog based ongoods-south hst z-band imaging of the central 6'-radius area of the 4 ms cdf-s.the stacked 6-8 kev detection is significant at the 3.9 sigma level, but thestacked emission was not detected in the 4-6 kev band which indicates theexistence of an underlying population of highly obscured active galactic nuclei(agns). further examinations of these 6845 galaxies indicate that the galaxieson the top of the blue cloud and with redshifts of 1 &lt; z &lt; 3, magnitudes of 25&lt; z_850 &lt; 28, and stellar masses of 2e8 &lt; m_star/m_sun &lt; 2e9 make the majoritycontributions to the unresolved 6-8 kev xrb. such a population is seeminglysurprising given that the majority of the x-ray detected agns reside in massive(&gt; ~1e10 m_sun) galaxies. we discuss constraints upon this underlying agnpopulation, supporting evidence for relatively low-mass galaxies hosting highlyobscured agns, and prospects for further boosting the stacked signal.

1209.2132	x-ray bright active galactic nuclei in massive galaxy clusters i: number  counts and spatial distribution	we present an analysis of the x-ray bright point source population in 43massive clusters of galaxies observed with the chandra x-ray observatory. wehave constructed a catalog of 4210 rigorously selected x-ray point sources inthese fields, which span a survey area of 4.2 square degrees. this catalogreveals a clear excess of sources when compared to deep blank-field surveys,which amounts to roughly 1 additional source per cluster, likely activegalactic nuclei (agn) associated with the clusters. the excess sources areconcentrated within the virial radii of the clusters, with the largest excessobserved near the cluster centers. the average radial profile of the excessx-ray sources of the cluster are well described by a power law (n(r) ~ r^\beta)with an index of \beta ~ -0.5. an initial analysis using literature results onthe mean profile of member galaxies in massive x-ray selected clustersindicates that the fraction of galaxies hosting x-ray agn rises with increasingclustercentric radius, being approximately 5 to 10 times higher near the virialradius than in the central regions. this trend is qualitatively similar to thatobserved for star formation in cluster member galaxies.

1210.2521	goods-herschel: radio-excess signature of hidden agn activity in distant  star-forming galaxies	we present here a new spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting approachthat we adopt to select radio-excess sources amongst distant star-forminggalaxies in the goods-herschel (north) field and to reveal the presence ofhidden, highly obscured agn. through extensive sed analysis of 458 galaxieswith radio 1.4 ghz and mid-ir 24 um detections using some of the deepestchandra x-ray, spitzer and herschel infrared, and vla radio data available todate, we have robustly identified a sample of 51 radio-excess agn (~1300deg^-2) out to redshift z~3. these radio-excess agn have a significantly lowerfar-ir/radio ratio (q&lt;1.68) than the typical relation observed for star-forminggalaxies (q~2.2). we find that ~45% of these radio-excess sources have adominant agn component in the mid-ir band, while for the remainders the excessradio emission is the only indicator of agn activity. the fraction ofradio-excess agn increases with x-ray luminosity reaching ~60% atlx~10^44-10^45 erg/s, making these sources an important part of the total agnpopulation. however, almost half (24/51) of these radio-excess agn are notdetected in the deep chandra x-ray data, suggesting that some of these sourcesmight be heavily obscured. we also find that the specific star formation rates(ssfrs) of the radio-excess agn are on average lower that those observed forx-ray selected agn hosts, indicating that our sources are forming stars moreslowly than typical agn hosts, and possibly their star formation isprogressively quenching.

1211.2804	deep chandra monitoring observations of ngc 4649: i. catalog of source  properties	we present the x-ray source catalog for the chandra monitoring observationsof the elliptical galaxy, ngc 4649. the galaxy has been observed with chandraacis-s3 in six separate pointings, reaching a total exposure of 299 ks. thereare 501 x-ray sources detected in the 0.3-8.0 kev band in the mergedobservation or in one of the six individual observations; 399 sources arelocated within the d_25 ellipse. the observed 0.3-8.0 kev luminosities of these501 sources range from 9.3x10^{36} erg/s to 5.4x10^{39} erg/s. the 90%detection completeness limit within the d_25 ellipse is 5.5x10^{37} erg/s.based on the surface density of background active galactic nuclei (agns) anddetection completeness, we expect ~45 background agns among the catalog sources(~15 within the d_25 ellipse). there are nine sources with luminosities greaterthan 10^{39} erg/s, which are candidates for ultraluminous x-ray sources. thenuclear source of ngc 4649 is a low-luminosity agn, with an intrinsic 2.0-8.0kev x-ray luminosity of 1.5x10^{38} erg/s. the x-ray colors suggest that themajority of the catalog sources are low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). we findthat 164 of the 501 x-ray sources show long-term variability, indicating thatthey are accreting compact objects. we discover four transient candidates andanother four potential transients. we also identify 173 x-ray sources (141within the d_25 ellipse) that are associated with globular clusters (gcs) basedon hubble space telescope and ground-based data; these lmxbs tend to be hostedby red gcs. although ngc 4649 has a much larger population of x-ray sourcesthan the structurally similar early-type galaxies, ngc 3379 and ngc 4278, yetthe x-ray source properties are comparable in all three systems.

1211.4033	x-ray and multiwavelength insights into the inner structure of  high-luminosity disc-like emitters	we present x-ray and multiwavelength studies of a sample of eighthigh-luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) with disc-like h\betaemission-line profiles selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release7. these sources have higher redshift (z~0.6) than the majority of the knowndisc-like emitters, and they occupy a largely unexplored space in theluminosity-redshift plane. seven sources have typical agn x-ray spectra withpower-law photon indices of \gamma~1.4-2.0; two of them show some x-rayabsorption (column density n_h~10^{21}-10^{22} cm^{-2}$ for neutral gas). theother source, j0850+4451, has only three hard x-ray photons detected and isprobably heavily obscured (n_h&gt;3x10^{23} cm^{-2}). this object is alsoidentified as a low-ionization broad absorption line (bal) quasar based on mgii \lambda2799 absorption; it is the first disc-like emitter reported that isalso a bal quasar. the ir-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) of theseeight sources are similar to the mean seds of typical quasars with a uv "bump",suggestive of standard accretion discs radiating with high efficiency, whichdiffers from low-luminosity disc-like emitters. studies of the x-ray-to-opticalpower-law slope parameters (\alpha_{ox}) indicate that there is no significantexcess x-ray emission in these high-luminosity disc-like emitters. energybudget analysis suggests that for disc-like emitters in general, the inner discmust illuminate and ionize the outer disc efficiently (~15% of the nuclearionizing radiation is required on average) via direct illumination and/orscattering. warped accretion discs are probably needed for direct illuminationto work in high-luminosity objects, as their geometrically thin inner discsdecrease the amount of direct illumination possible for a flat disc.

1305.3826	unveiling a population of galaxies harboring low-mass black holes with  x-rays	we report the discovery of three low-mass black hole candidates residing inthe centers of low-mass galaxies at z&lt;0.3 in the chandra deep field - southsurvey. these black holes are initially identified as candidate active galacticnuclei based on their x-ray emission in deep chandra observations.multi-wavelength observations are used to strengthen our claim that suchemission is powered by an accreting supermassive black hole. while the x-rayluminosities are low at l_x ~ 10^40 erg s^-1 (and variable in one case), weargue that they are unlikely to be attributed to star formation based onh\alpha or uv-fluxes. optical spectroscopy with keck/deimos and vlt/fors allowsus to (1) measure accurate redshifts, (2) confirm their low stellar host mass,(3) investigate the source(s) of photo-ionization, and (4) estimate extinction.with stellar masses of m* &lt; 3*10^9 m_\sun determined from hst/acs imaging, thehost galaxies are among the lowest mass systems known to host activelyaccreting black holes. we estimate bh masses m_bh ~ 2*10^5 m_\sun based onscaling relations between bh mass and host properties for more luminoussystems. in one case, a broad component of the h\alpha emission-line profile isdetected thus providing a virial mass estimate. black holes in such low-massgalaxies are of considerable interest as the low-redshift analogs to the seedsof the most massive bhs at high redshift which have remained largely elusive todate. our study highlights the power of deep x-ray surveys to uncover suchlow-mass systems.

1306.3500	weak hard x-ray emission from two broad absorption line quasars observed  with nustar: compton-thick absorption or intrinsic x-ray weakness?	we present nustar hard x-ray observations of two x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars, pg 1004+130 (radio loud) and pg 1700+518 (radio quiet).many bal quasars appear x-ray weak, probably due to absorption by the shieldinggas between the nucleus and the accretion-disk wind. the two targets are amongthe optically brightest bal quasars, yet they are known to be significantlyx-ray weak at rest-frame 2-10 kev (16-120 times fainter than typical quasars).we would expect to obtain ~400-600 hard x-ray (&gt;10 kev) photons with nustar,provided that these photons are not significantly absorbed (nh&lt;1e24 cm^{-2}).however, both bal quasars are only detected in the softer nustar bands (e.g.,4-20 kev) but not in its harder bands (e.g., 20-30 kev), suggesting that eitherthe shielding gas is highly compton-thick or the two targets are intrinsicallyx-ray weak. we constrain the column densities for both to be nh~7e24 cm^{-2} ifthe weak hard x-ray emission is caused by obscuration from the shielding gas.we discuss a few possibilities for how pg 1004+130 could have compton-thickshielding gas without strong fe k? line emission; dilution from jet-linkedx-ray emission is one likely explanation. we also discuss the intrinsic x-rayweakness scenario based on a coronal-quenching model relevant to the shieldinggas and disk wind of bal quasars. motivated by our nustar results, we perform achandra stacking analysis with the large bright quasar survey bal quasar sampleand place statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically x-ray weakbal quasars; this fraction is likely 17-40%.

1306.4315	the two dimensional projected spatial distribution of globular clusters:  method and application to ngc4261	we present a new method for the determination of the two-dimensional (2d)projected spatial distribution of globular clusters (gcs) in external galaxies.this method is based on the k-nearest neighbor density estimator of dressler(1980), complemented by montecarlo simulations to establish the statisticalsignificance of the results. we apply this method to ngc4261, a "test galaxy"where significant 2d anisotropy in the gc distribution has been reported. weconfirm that the 2d distribution of gc is not azimuthally isotropic. moreover,we demonstrate that the 2d distribution departures from the average gc radialdistribution results in highly significant spiral-like or broken shellfeatures. overall, the same perturbations are found in "red" and "blue" gcs,but with some differences. in particular, we observe a central feature, roughlyaligned with the minor axis of ngc4261, composed of red and most luminous gcs.blue and fainter gcs are more frequent at large radial distances and follow thespiral-like features of the overall density structure. these results suggest acomplex merging history for ngc4261.

1402.4811	{\it nustar} reveals an intrinsically x-ray weak broad absorption line  quasar in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy markarian 231	we present high-energy (3--30 kev) {\it nustar} observations of the nearestquasar, the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) markarian 231 (mrk 231),supplemented with new and simultaneous low-energy (0.5--8 kev) data from {\itchandra}. the source was detected, though at much fainter levels thanpreviously reported, likely due to contamination in the large apertures ofprevious non-focusing hard x-ray telescopes. the full band (0.5--30 kev) x-rayspectrum suggests the active galactic nucleus (agn) in mrk 231 is absorbed by apatchy and compton-thin (n$_{\rm h} \sim1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\times10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$) column. the intrinsic x-ray luminosity (l$_{\rm 0.5-30kev}\sim1.0\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{1}$) is extremely weak relative to thebolometric luminosity where the 2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity ratio is$\sim$0.03% compared to the typical values of 2--15%. additionally, mrk 231 hasa low x-ray-to-optical power law slope ($\alpha_{\rm ox}\sim-1.7$). it is alocal example of a low-ionization broad absorption line (lobal) quasar that isintrinsically x-ray weak. the weak ionizing continuum may explain the lack ofmid-infrared [o iv], [ne v], and [ne vi] fine-structure emission lines whichare present in sources with otherwise similar agn properties. we argue that theintrinsic x-ray weakness may be a result of the super-eddington accretionoccurring in the nucleus of this ulirg, and may also be naturally related tothe powerful wind event seen in mrk 231, a merger remnant escaping from itsdusty cocoon.

1403.2491	nustar j033202-2746.8: direct constraints on the compton reflection in a  heavily obscured quasar at z~2	we report nustar observations of nustar j033202-2746.8, a heavily obscured,radio-loud quasar detected in the extended chandra deep field-south, thedeepest layer of the nustar extragalactic survey (~400 ks, at its deepest).nustar j033202-2746.8 is reliably detected by nustar only at e&gt;8 kev and has avery flat spectral slope in the nustar energy band (gamma=0.55^{+0.62}_{-0.64};3-30 kev). combining the nustar data with extremely deep observations bychandra and xmm-newton (4 ms and 3 ms, respectively), we constrain thebroad-band x-ray spectrum of nustar j033202-2746.8, indicating that this sourceis a heavily obscured quasar (n_h=5.6^{+0.9}_{-0.8}x10^23 cm^-2) withluminosity l_{10-40 kev}~6.4x10^44 erg s^-1. although existing optical andnear-infrared (near-ir) data, as well as follow-up spectroscopy with the keckand vlt telescopes, failed to provide a secure redshift identification fornustar j033202-2746.8, we reliably constrain the redshift z=2.00+/-0.04 fromthe x-ray spectral features (primarily from the iron k edge). the nustarspectrum shows a significant reflection component (r=0.55^{+0.44}_{-0.37}),which was not constrained by previous analyses of chandra and xmm-newton dataalone. the measured reflection fraction is higher than the r~0 typicallyobserved in bright radio-loud quasars such as nustar j033202-2746.8, which hasl_{1.4 ghz}~10^27 w hz^-1. constraining the spectral shape of agn, includingbright quasars, is very important for understanding the agn population, and canhave a strong impact on the modeling of the x-ray background. our results showthe importance of nustar in investigating the broad-band spectral properties ofquasars out to high redshift.

1403.3078	nustar and xmm-newton observations of luminous, heavily obscured,  wise-selected quasars at z ~ 2	we report on a nustar and xmm-newton program that has observed a sample ofthree extremely luminous, heavily obscured wise-selected agn at z~2 in a broadx-ray band (0.1 - 79 kev). the parent sample, selected to be faint orundetected in the wise 3.4um (w1) and 4.6um (w2) bands but bright at 12um (w3)and 22um (w4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called w1w2-dropoutsacross the extragalactic sky. optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts ofz~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-ir luminosities of l(6um)~6e46erg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed l(bol)~1e14 l(sun). thecorresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard x-ray luminosities are l(2-10)~4e45erg/s for typical quasar templates. these are amongst the most luminous agnknown, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line regionand the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um. wedesigned our x-ray observations to obtain robust detections for gas columndensities n(h)&lt;1e24 /cm2. in fact, the sources prove to be fainter than thesepredictions. two of the sources were observed by both nustar and xmm-newton,with neither being detected by nustar and one being faintly detected byxmm-newton. a third source was observed only with xmm-newton, yielding a faintdetection. the x-ray data require gas column densities n(h)&gt;1e24 /cm2, implyingthe sources are extremely obscured, consistent with compton-thick, luminousquasars. the discovery of a significant population of heavily obscured,extremely luminous agn does not conform to the standard paradigm of a recedingtorus, in which more luminous quasars are less likely to be obscured. if alarger sample conforms with this finding, then this suggests an additionalsource of obscuration for these extreme sources.

1404.5620	nustar and xmm-newton observations of ngc 1365: extreme absorption  variability and a constant inner accretion disk	we present a spectral analysis of four coordinated nustar+xmm-newtonobservations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. these exhibit an extreme level ofspectral variability, which is primarily due to variable line-of-sightabsorption, revealing relatively unobscured states in this source for the firsttime. despite the diverse range of absorption states, each of the observationsdisplays the same characteristic signatures of relativistic reflection from theinner accretion disk. through time-resolved spectroscopy we find that thestrength of the relativistic iron line and the compton reflection hump relativeto the intrinsic continuum are well correlated, as expected if they are twoaspects of the same broadband reflection spectrum. we apply self-consistentdisk reflection models to these time-resolved spectra in order to constrain theinner disk parameters, allowing for variable, partially covering absorption toaccount for the vastly different absorption states observed. each of the fourobservations is treated independently to test the consistency of the resultsobtained for the black hole spin and the disk inclination, which should notvary on observable timescales. we find both the spin and the inclinationdetermined from the reflection spectrum to be consistent, confirming ngc 1365hosts a rapidly rotating black hole; in all cases the dimensionless spinparameter is constrained to be a* &gt; 0.97 (at 90% statistical confidence orbetter).

1406.3345	the 2-79 kev x-ray spectrum of the circinus galaxy with nustar,  xmm-newton and chandra: a fully compton-thick agn	the circinus galaxy is one of the nearest obscured agn, making it an idealtarget for detailed study. combining archival chandra and xmm-newton data withnew nustar observations, we model the 2-79 kev spectrum to constrain theprimary agn continuum and to derive physical parameters for the obscuringmaterial. chandra's high angular resolution allows a separation of nuclear andoff-nuclear galactic emission. in the off-nuclear diffuse emission we findsignatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutralfe lines. this compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of thenuclear flux in the fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclearemission above 30 kev. the new analysis no longer supports a prominenttransmitted agn component in the observed band. we find that the nuclearspectrum is consistent with compton-scattering by an optically-thick torus,where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\gamma = 2.2-2.4$,the torus has an equatorial column density of $n_{\rm h} =(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic agn $2-10$ kev luminosity is$(2.3-5.1)\times 10^{42}$ erg/s. these values place circinus along the samerelations as unobscured agn in accretion rate-vs-$\gamma$ and $l_x$-vs-$l_{ir}$phase space. nustar's high sensitivity and low background allow us to study theshort time-scale variability of circinus at x-ray energies above 10 kev for thefirst time. the lack of detected variability favors a compton-thick absorber,in line with the the spectral fitting results.

1407.1844	nustar unveils a compton-thick type 2 quasar in mrk 34	we present nustar 3-40 kev observations of the optically selected type 2quasar (qso2) sdss j1034+6001 or mrk 34. the high-quality hard x-ray spectrumand archival xmm-newton data can be fitted self-consistently with areflection-dominated continuum and strong fe kalpha fluorescence line withequivalent-width &gt;1 kev. prior x-ray spectral fitting below 10 kev showed thesource to be consistent with being obscured by compton-thin column densities ofgas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns frommultiwavelength data. nustar now enables a direct measurement of this column,and shows that nh lies in the compton-thick (ct) regime. the new data also showa high intrinsic 2-10 kev luminosity of l_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast toprevious low-energy x-ray measurements for which l_{2-10}&lt;~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.x-ray selection below 10 kev does not pick up this source as an intrinsicallyluminous obscured quasar). both the obscuring column and the intrinsic powerare about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-nustarx-ray spectral fitting. mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' ct qso2 and is thenearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local ctquasar ngc6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strongstar-formation. for typical x-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretionluminosity of mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infraredluminosity. x-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related tostar-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3kev, favoring photionization instead.

1407.8181	x-ray bright active galactic nuclei in massive galaxy clusters iii: new  insights into the triggering mechanisms of cluster agn	we present the results of a new analysis of the x-ray selected activegalactic nuclei (agn) population in the vicinity of 135 of the most massivegalaxy clusters in the redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 observed with chandra.with a sample of more than 11,000 x-ray point sources, we are able to measure,for the first time, evidence for evolution in the cluster agn population beyondthe expected evolution of field agn. our analysis shows that overall numberdensity of cluster agn scales with the cluster mass as $\sim m_{500}^{-1.2}$.there is no evidence for the overall number density of cluster member x-ray agndepending on the cluster redshift in a manner different than field agn, northere is any evidence that the spatial distribution of cluster agn (given inunits of the cluster overdensity radius r_500) strongly depends on the clustermass or redshift. the $m^{-1.2 \pm 0.7}$ scaling relation we measure isconsistent with theoretical predictions of the galaxy merger rate in clusters,which is expected to scale with the cluster velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, as $\sim \sigma^{-3}$ or $\sim m^{-1}$. this consistency suggests that agn inclusters may be predominantly triggered by galaxy mergers, a result that isfurther corroborated by visual inspection of hubble images for 23spectroscopically confirmed cluster member agn in our sample. a merger-drivenscenario for the triggering of x-ray agn is not strongly favored by studies offield galaxies, however, suggesting that different mechanisms may be primarilyresponsible for the triggering of cluster and field x-ray agn.

1408.3633	weak hard x-ray emission from broad absorption line quasars: evidence  for intrinsic x-ray weakness	we report nustar observations of a sample of six x-ray weak broad absorptionline (bal) quasars. these targets, at z=0.148-1.223, are among the opticallybrightest and most luminous bal quasars known at z&lt;1.3. however, theirrest-frame 2 kev luminosities are 14 to &gt;330 times weaker than expected fortypical quasars. our results from a pilot nustar study of two low-redshift balquasars, a chandra stacking analysis of a sample of high-redshift bal quasars,and a nustar spectral analysis of the local bal quasar mrk 231 have alreadysuggested the existence of intrinsically x-ray weak bal quasars, i.e., quasarsnot emitting x-rays at the level expected from their optical/uv emission. theaim of the current program is to extend the search for such extraordinaryobjects. three of the six new targets are weakly detected by nustar with &lt;45counts in the 3-24 kev band, and the other three are not detected. the hardx-ray (8-24 kev) weakness observed by nustar requires compton-thick absorptionif these objects have nominal underlying x-ray emission. however, a softstacked effective photon index ({\gamma}~1.8) for this sample disfavorscompton-thick absorption in general. the uniform hard x-ray weakness observedby nustar for this and the pilot samples selected with &lt;10 kev weakness alsosuggests that the x-ray weakness is intrinsic in at least some of the targets.we conclude that the nustar observations have likely discovered a significantpopulation (&gt;33%) of intrinsically x-ray weak objects among the bal quasarswith significantly weak &lt;10 kev emission. we suggest that intrinsically x-rayweak quasars might be preferentially observed as bal quasars.

1408.5414	the nustar view of nearby compton-thick agn: the cases of ngc 424, ngc  1320 and ic 2560	we present x-ray spectral analyses for three seyfert 2 active galacticnuclei, ngc 424, ngc 1320, and ic 2560, observed by nustar in the 3-79 kevband. the high quality hard x-ray spectra allow detailed modeling of thecompton reflection component for the first time in these sources. usingquasi-simultaneous nustar and swift/xrt data, as well as archival xmm-newtondata, we find that all three nuclei are obscured by compton-thick material withcolumn densities in excess of ~5 x $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and that their x-rayspectra above 3 kev are dominated by reflection of the intrinsic continuum oncompton-thick material. due to the very high obscuration, absorbed intrinsiccontinuum components are not formally required by the data in any of thesources. we constrain the intrinsic photon indices and the column density ofthe reflecting medium through the shape of the reflection spectra. usingarchival multi-wavelength data we recover the intrinsic x-ray luminositiesconsistent with the broadband spectral energy distributions. our results areconsistent with the reflecting medium being an edge-on clumpy torus with arelatively large global covering factor and overall reflection efficiency ofthe order of 1%. given the unambiguous confirmation of the compton-thick natureof the sources, we investigate whether similar sources are likely to be missedby commonly used selection criteria for compton-thick agn, and explore thepossibility of finding their high-redshift counterparts.

1501.03506	ultra-deep catalog of x-ray groups in the extended chandra deep field  south	ultra-deep observations of ecdf-s with chandra and xmm-newton enable a searchfor extended x-ray emission down to an unprecedented flux of $2\times10^{-16}$ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. we present the search for the extended emission onspatial scales of 32$^{\prime\prime}$ in both chandra and xmm data, covering0.3 square degrees and model the extended emission on scales of arcminutes. wepresent a catalog of 46 spectroscopically identified groups, reaching aredshift of 1.6. we show that the statistical properties of ecdf-s, such aslogn-logs and x-ray luminosity function are broadly consistent with lcdm, withthe exception that dn/dz/d$\omega$ test reveals that a redshift range of$0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5$ in ecdf-s is sparsely populated. the lack of nearby structure,however, makes studies of high-redshift groups particularly easier both inx-rays and lensing, due to a lower level of clustered foreground. we presentone and two point statistics of the galaxy groups as well as weak-lensinganalysis to show that the detected low-luminosity systems are indeed low-masssystems. we verify the applicability of the scaling relations between the x-rayluminosity and the total mass of the group, derived for the cosmos survey tolower masses and higher redshifts probed by ecdf-s by means of stacked weaklensing and clustering analysis, constraining any possible departures to bewithin 30% in mass. abridged.

1510.04477	the hard x-ray emission of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240 as  observed by nustar	we present a broad-band (~0.3-70 kev) spectral and temporal analysis ofnustar observations of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240, combined witharchival chandra, xmm-newton and bepposax data. ngc 6240 is a galaxy in arelatively early merger state with two distinct nuclei separated by ~1."5.previous chandra observations have resolved the two nuclei, showing that theyare both active and obscured by compton-thick material. although they cannot beresolved by nustar, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the nustar data atenergies &gt;10 kev, we clearly detect, for the first time, both the primary andthe reflection continuum components. the nustar hard x-ray spectrum isdominated by the primary continuum piercing through an absorbing column densitywhich is mildly optically thick to compton scattering (tau ~ 1.2, n_h ~ 1.5 x10^(24) cm^-2). we detect moderate hard x-ray (&gt; 10 kev) flux variability up to20% on short (15-20 ksec) timescales. the amplitude of the variability ismaximum at ~30 kev and is likely to originate from the primary continuum of thesouthern nucleus. nevertheless, the mean hard x-ray flux on longer timescales(years) is relatively constant. moreover, the two nuclei remain compton-thick,although we find evidence of variability of the material along the line ofsight with column densities n_h &lt;~ 2 x 10^(23) cm-2 over long (~3-15 years)timescales. the observed x-ray emission in the nustar energy range is fullyconsistent with the sum of the best-fit models of the spatially resolvedchandra spectra of the two nuclei.

1511.04183	the nustar extragalactic surveys: the number counts of active galactic  nuclei and the resolved fraction of the cosmic x-ray background	we present the 3-8 kev and 8-24 kev number counts of active galactic nuclei(agn) identified in the nustar extragalactic surveys. nustar has now resolvedapproximately 35% of the x-ray background in the 8-24 kev band, directlyidentifying agn with obscuring columns up to 1e25 / cm2. in the softer 3-8 kevband the number counts are in general agreement with those measured byxmm-newton and chandra over the flux range 5e-15 &lt; s(3 - 8 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt;1e-12 probed by nustar. in the hard 8-24 kev band nustar probes fluxes over therange 2e-14 &lt; s(8-24 kev)/(erg/cm2/s) &lt; 1e-12, a factor of approximately 100fainter than previous measurements covering this energy range. the slope of the8-24 kev number counts closely matches predictions from agn populationsynthesis models that account for the shape and intensity of the diffuse cosmicx-ray background. this directly confirms the existence of a population ofobscured and/or hard x-ray sources inferred from the shape of the integrateddiffuse cosmic x-ray background. the measured nustar counts lie significantlyabove simple extrapolations of the swift/bat 15-55 kev number counts measuredat higher fluxes, s(15-55 kev) &gt; 1e-11 erg/cm2/s, for any realistic agnspectral model. the most natural explanation for the difference is an evolutionin the agn poulation between the very local objects seen by bat and the moredistant (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1) nustar sample that is not accounted for in the currentmodels.

1511.04184	the nustar extragalactic surveys: first direct measurements of the &gt;10  kev x-ray luminosity function for active galactic nuclei at z&gt;0.1	we present the first direct measurements of the rest-frame 10-40 kev x-rayluminosity function (xlf) of active galactic nuclei (agns) based on a sample of94 sources at 0.1 &lt; z &lt;3, selected at 8-24 kev energies from sources in thenustar extragalactic survey program. our results are consistent with the strongevolution of the agn population seen in prior, lower-energy studies of the xlf.however, different models of the intrinsic distribution of absorption, whichare used to correct for selection biases, give significantly differentpredictions for the total number of sources in our sample, leading to small,systematic differences in our binned estimates of the xlf. adopting a modelwith a lower intrinsic fraction of compton-thick sources and a largerpopulation of sources with column densities n_h ~ 10^{23-24} /cm2 or a modelwith stronger compton reflection component (with a relative normalization of r~ 2 at all luminosities) can bring extrapolations of the xlf from 2-10 kev intoagreement with our nustar sample. ultimately, x-ray spectral analysis of thenustar sources is required to break this degeneracy between the distribution ofabsorbing column densities and the strength of the compton reflection componentand thus refine our measurements of the xlf. furthermore, the models thatsuccessfully describe the high-redshift population seen by nustar tend toover-predict previous, high-energy measurements of the local xlf, indicatingthat there is evolution of the agn population that is not fully captured by thecurrent models.

1511.04185	the nustar extragalactic surveys: overview and catalog from the cosmos  field	to provide the census of the sources contributing to the x-ray backgroundpeak above 10 kev, nustar is performing extragalactic surveys using athree-tier "wedding cake" approach. we present the nustar survey of the cosmosfield, the medium sensitivity and medium area tier, covering 1.7 deg2 andoverlapping with both chandra and xmm-newton data. this survey consists of 121observations for a total exposure of ~3 ms. to fully exploit these data, wedeveloped a new detection strategy, carefully tested through extensivesimulations. the survey sensitivity at 20% completeness is 5.9, 2.9 and 6.4 x10^-14 erg/cm2/s in the 3-24 kev, 3-8 kev and 8-24 kev bands, respectively. bycombining detections in 3 bands, we have a sample of 91 nustar sources with10^42 -10^45.5 erg/s luminosities and redshift z=0.04-2.5. thirty two sourcesare detected in the 8-24 kev band with fluxes ~100 times fainter than sourcesdetected by swift-bat. of the 91 detections, all but four are associated with achandra and/or xmm-newton point-like counterpart. one source is associated withan extended lower energy x-ray source. we present the x-ray (hardness ratio andluminosity) and optical-to-x-ray properties. the observed fraction of candidatecompton-thick agn measured from the hardness ratio is between 13-20%. wediscuss the spectral properties of nustar j100259+0220.6 (id 330) at z=0.044,with the highest hardness ratio in the entire sample. the measured columndensity exceeds 10^24 /cm2, implying the source is compton-thick. this sourcewas not previously recognized as such without the &gt;10 kev data.

1511.04186	the nustar extragalactic surveys: initial results and catalog from the  extended chandra deep field south	we present initial results and the source catalog from the nustar survey ofthe extended chandra deep field south (hereafter, ecdfs) - currently thedeepest contiguous component of the nustar extragalactic survey program. thesurvey covers the full ~30 arcmin x 30 arcmin area of this field to a maximumdepth of ~360 ks (~220 ks when corrected for vignetting at 3-24 kev), reachingsensitivity limits of ~1.3 x 10^-14 erg/cm2/s (3-8 kev), ~3.4 x 10^-14erg/cm2/s (8-24 kev) and ~3.0 x 10^-14 erg/cm2/s (3-24 kev). fifty four (54)sources are detected over the full field, although five of these are found tolie below our significance threshold once contaminating flux from neighboring(i.e., blended) sources is taken into account. of the remaining 49 that aresignificant, 19 are detected in the 8-24 kev band. the 8-24 kev to 3-8 kev bandratios of the twelve sources that are detected in both bands span the range0.39-1.7, corresponding to a photon index range of gamma ~ 0.5-2.3, with amedian photon index of 1.70 +/- 0.52. the redshifts of the 49 sources in ourmain sample span the range z = 0.21-2.7, and their rest-frame 10-40 kevluminosities (derived from the observed 8-24 kev fluxes) span the range l(10-40kev) ~ (0.7-300) x 10^43 erg/s, sampling below the "knee" of the x-rayluminosity function out to z ~ 0.8-1. finally, we identify one nustar sourcethat has neither a chandra nor an xmm-newton counterpart, but that showsevidence of nuclear activity at infrared wavelengths, and thus may represent agenuine, new x-ray source detected by nustar in the ecdfs.

0806.3968	the chandra deep field-south survey: 2 ms source catalogs	we present point-source catalogs for the ~2 ms exposure of the chandra deepfield-south (cdf-s); this is one of the two most-sensitive x-ray surveys everperformed. the survey covers an area of ~436 arcmin^2 and reaches on-axissensitivity limits of ~1.9x10^{-17} and ~1.3x10^{-16} ergs/cm^2/s for the0.5-2.0 and 2-8 kev bands, respectively. four hundred and sixty-two x-ray pointsources are detected in at least one of three x-ray bands that were searched;135 of these sources are new compared to the previous ~1 ms cdf-s detections.source positions are determined using centroid and matched-filter techniques;the median positional uncertainty is ~0.36". the x-ray-to-optical flux ratiosof the newly detected sources indicate a variety of source types; ~55% of themappear to be active galactic nuclei while ~45% appear to be starburst andnormal galaxies. in addition to the main chandra catalog, we provide asupplementary catalog of 86 x-ray sources in the ~2 ms cdf-s footprint that wascreated by merging the ~250 ks extended chandra deep field-south with thecdf-s; this approach provides additional sensitivity in the outer portions ofthe cdf-s. a second supplementary catalog that contains 30 x-ray sources wasconstructed by matching lower significance x-ray sources to bright opticalcounterparts (r&lt;23.8); the majority of these sources appear to be starburst andnormal galaxies. the total number of sources in the main and supplementarycatalogs is 578. r-band optical counterparts and basic optical and infraredphotometry are provided for the x-ray sources in the main and supplementarycatalogs. we also include existing spectroscopic redshifts for 224 of the x-raysources.

astro-ph;0505425	evolutionary consequences of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei	deep surveys of {\em chandra} and {\em hst} (hubble space telescope) showthat active galactic nucleus (agn) populations are changing with hard x-rayluminosities. this arises an interesting question whether the dusty torus isevolving with the central engines. we assemble a sample of 50 radio-quiet pgquasars to tackle this problem. the covering factors of the dusty tori can beestimated from the multiwavelength continuum. we find they are stronglycorrelated with the hard x-ray luminosity. interestingly this correlationagrees with the fraction of type ii agns discovered by {\em chandra} and {\emhst}, implying strong evidence for that the agn population changing resultsfrom the evolution of the tori. we also find that the frequencies of the dipsaround 1$\mu$m in the continuum correlate with the covering factors in thepresent sample, indicating the dip frequencies are adjusted by the coveringfactors. in the scenario of fueling black hole from the torus, the coveringfactor is a good and the dip frequency is a potential indicator of the torusevolution.
