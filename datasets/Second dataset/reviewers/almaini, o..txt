0901.2810	the distribution of agn in a large sample of galaxy clusters	we present an analysis of the x-ray point source populations in 182 chandraimages of galaxy clusters at z&gt;0.1 with exposure time &gt;10 ksec, as well as 44non-cluster fields. analysis of the number and flux of these sources, using adetailed pipeline to predict the distribution of non-cluster sources in eachfield, reveals an excess of x-ray point sources associated with the galaxyclusters. a sample of 148 galaxy clusters at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.9, with no other nearbyclusters, show an excess of 230 cluster sources in total, an average of ~1.5sources per cluster. the lack of optical data for these clusters limits thephysical interpretation of this result, as we cannot calculate the fraction ofcluster galaxies hosting x-ray sources. however, the fluxes of the excesssources indicate that over half of them are very likely to be agn, and theradial distribution shows that they are quite evenly distributed over thecentral 1 mpc of the cluster, with almost no sources found beyond this radius.we also use this pipeline to successfully reproduce the results of previousstudies, particularly the higher density of sources in the central 0.5 mpc of afew cluster fields, but show that these conclusions are not generally valid forthis larger sample of clusters. we conclude that some of these differences maybe due to the sample properties, such as the size and redshift of the clustersstudied, or a lack of publications for cluster fields with no excess sources.this paper also presents the basic x-ray properties of the galaxy clusters, andin subsequent papers in this series the dependence of the agn population onthese cluster properties will be evaluated.  in addition the properties of over 9500 x-ray point sources in the fields ofgalaxy clusters are tabulated in a separate catalogue available online.

0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0707.1517	environmental dependence of agn activity in the supercluster a901/2	we present xmm data for the supercluster a901/2, at z ~ 0.17, which iscombined with deep imaging and 17-band photometric redshifts (from the combo-17survey), 2df spectra and spitzer 24um data, to identify agn in thesupercluster. the 90ksec xmm image contains 139 point sources, of which 11 areidentified as supercluster agn with l_x(0.5-7.5kev) &gt; 1.7x10^41 erg/cm2/s. thehost galaxies have m_r &lt; -20 and only 2 of 8 sources with spectra could havebeen identified as agn by the detected optical emission lines. using a largesample of 795 supercluster galaxies we define control samples of massivegalaxies with no detected agn. the local environments of the agn and controlsamples differ at &gt;98 per cent significance. the agn host galaxies liepredominantly in areas of moderate projected galaxy density and with more localblue galaxies than the control sample, with the exception of one very brighttype i agn very near the centre of a cluster. these environments are similarto, but not limited to, cluster outskirts and blue groups. despite the largenumber of potential host galaxies, no agn are found in regions with the highestgalaxy density (excluding some cluster cores where emission from the icmobscures moderate luminosity agn). agn are also absent from the areas withlowest galaxy density. we conclude that the prevalence of cluster agn is linkedto their environment.

0912.0039	x-ray groups and clusters of galaxies in the subaru-xmm deep field	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in subaru-xmm deep  field. we reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 kev band of2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest xmm-newton contiguousraster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. cluster candidates areidentified through a wavelet detection of extended x-ray emission. the redsequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. we report onthe progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. inaddition, 3 sources are identified as x-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in3 further sources, x-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significantfraction of the total flux of the source. in the area covered by nir data, ouridentification success rate achieves 86%. we detect a number of radio galaxieswithin our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies wecompute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. wecompare the cluster detection statistics in the sxdf with the predictions ofconcordance cosmology and current knowledge of the x-ray cluster properties,concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required inorder to match the prediction of the model and the data. this conclusion stillneeds verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.

1005.5176	a near-infrared morphological comparison of high-redshift submm and  radio galaxies: massive star-forming discs vs relaxed spheroids	we present deep, high-quality k-band images of complete subsamples ofpowerful radio and sub-mm galaxies at z=2. the data were obtained in the bestavailable seeing at ukirt and gemini north, with integration times scaled toensure that comparable rest-frame surface brightness levels are reached for allgalaxies. we fit two-dimensional axi-symmetric galaxy models to determinegalaxy morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths &gt; 4000a, varyingluminosity, axial ratio, half-light radius, and sersic index. we find that,while some images show evidence of galaxy interactions, &gt;95% of the rest-frameoptical light in all galaxies is well-described by these simple models. we alsofind a clear difference in morphology between these two classes of galaxy; fitsto the individual images and image stacks reveal that the radio galaxies aremoderately large (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=8.4+-1.1kpc; median r{1/2}=7.8), de vaucouleursspheroids (&lt;n&gt; = 4.07+-0.27; median n=3.87), while the sub-mm galaxies appearto be moderately compact (&lt;r{1/2}&gt;=3.4+-0.3kpc; median r{1/2}=3.1kpc)exponential discs (&lt;n&gt;=1.44+-0.16; median n=1.08). we show that the z=2 radiogalaxies display a well-defined kormendy relation but that, while larger thanother recently-studied high-z massive galaxy populations, they are still ~1.5times smaller than their local counterparts. the scalelengths of the starlightin the sub-mm galaxies are comparable to those reported for the molecular gas.their sizes are also similar to those of comparably massive quiescent galaxiesat z&gt;1.5. in terms of stellar mass surface density, the majority of the radiogalaxies lie within the locus defined by local ellipticals. in contrast, whilebest modelled as discs, most of the sub-mm galaxies have higher stellar massdensities than local galaxies, and appear destined to evolve into present-daymassive ellipticals.

0704.2136	the colour selection of distant galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey  early data release	we investigate colour selection techniques for high redshift galaxies in theukidss ultra deep survey early data release (uds edr). combined with very deepsubaru optical photometry, the depth (k_ab = 22.5) and area (0.62 deg^2) of theuds edr allows us to investigate optical/near-ir selection using a large sampleof over 30,000 objects. by using the b-z, z-k colour-colour diagram (the bzktechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z &gt; 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pbzk and sbzkrespectively). our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in bzk diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z &lt; 1.4. we also compare the bzk technique with ther-k colour selection of extremely red objects (eros) and the j-k selection ofdistant red galaxies (drgs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. we find that the majority of drgs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also eros. since previous studies have found that drgs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these drg/ero galaxieshave seds consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or agn at z &lt; 2.finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pbzk galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z &gt; 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.

1008.5244	the stellar mass function of the most massive galaxies at 3&lt;=z&lt;5 in the  ukidss ultra deep survey	we have analysed a sample of 1292 4.5 micron-selected galaxies at z&gt;=3, over0.6 square degrees of the ukirt infrared deep survey (ukidss) ultra deep survey(uds). using photometry from the u band through 4.5 microns, we have obtainedphotometric redshifts and derived stellar masses for our sources. only two ofour galaxies potentially lie at z&gt;5. we have studied the galaxy stellar massfunction at 3&lt;=z&lt;5, based on the 1213 galaxies in our catalogue with [4.5]&lt;=24.0. we find that: i) the number density of m &gt; 10^11 msun galaxies increasedby a factor &gt; 10 between z=5 and 3, indicating that the assembly rate of thesegalaxies proceeded &gt; 20 times faster at these redshifts than at 0&lt;z&lt;2; ii) theschechter function slope alpha is significantly steeper than that displayed bythe local stellar mass function, which is both a consequence of the steeperfaint end and the absence of a pure exponential decline at the high-mass end;iii) the evolution of the comoving stellar mass density from z=0 to 5 can bemodelled as log10 (rho_m) =-(0.05 +/- 0.09) z^2 - (0.22 -/+ 0.32) z + 8.69. at3&lt;=z&lt;4, more than 30% of the m &gt; 10^11 msun galaxies would be missed by opticalsurveys with r&lt;27 or z&lt;26. thus, our study demonstrates the importance of deepmid-ir surveys over large areas to perform a complete census of massivegalaxies at high z and trace the early stages of massive galaxy assembly.

1104.2904	agn environments at z&lt;1.5 in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we investigate the environments of both x-ray and radio-loud agn within theukidss ultra-deep survey (uds) using deep infrared selection to sample thegalaxy density field in the redshift range 1.0 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.5. using angularcross-correlation techniques we find that both x-ray and radio-loud agnpreferentially reside in overdense environments. we also find that both typesof agn cluster more strongly with those galaxies classified as `passive' ratherthan those that are actively star-forming. we infer clustering scale lengthscomparable to those of passive red galaxies, suggesting that typical agn atthese epochs reside in dark-matter halos of mass m &gt;~ 10^13 m_sun. a closerlook at the small-scale environments of the agn reveals that the neighbouringgalaxies of radio-loud agn have u-b colours more skewed towards the`green-valley' and the red sequence, whereas the neighbours of x-ray agn showno difference to the general galaxy population. this suggests that althoughboth agn types live in overdense environments, the radio-loud agn may bepreferentially located in more evolved cluster cores, in a similar environmentto low-powered radio agn in the local universe.

1110.1722	a remarkably high fraction of strong ly_alpha emitters amongst luminous  redshift 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 lyman break galaxies in the ukidss ultra-deep survey	we present spectroscopic confirmation of ten highly luminous (l &gt;= 2l*) lymanalpha emitters in the redshift range 6.01&lt;z&lt;6.49 (nine galaxies and one agn),initially drawn from a sample of fourteen z_phot &gt;= 6 lyman break galaxies(lbgs) selected from an area of 0.25 square degrees within the ukidssultra-deep survey (uds). overall, our high rate of spectroscopic confirmation(&gt;= 71%) and low rate of contamination provides a strong vindication of thephotometric redshift analysis used to define the original sample. byconsidering star-formation rate estimates based on the ly_alpha and uvcontinuum luminosity we conclude that our sample is consistent with a ly_alphaescape fraction of ~25%. moreover, after careful consideration of the potentialuncertainties and biases, we find that 40%-50% of our sample of l &gt;= 2l*galaxies at 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 display strong ly_alpha emission (rest-frame equivalentwidth &gt;= 25 angs), a fraction which is a factor of ~2 higher than previouslyreported for l &lt;= l* galaxies at z~6. our results suggest that, as the epoch ofreionization is approached, it is plausible that the ly_alpha emitter fractionamongst luminous (l &gt;=2 l*) lbgs shows a similarly sharp increase to thatobserved in their lower-luminosity (l &lt;= l*) counterparts.

0710.3136	on the evolution of clustering of 24um-selected galaxies	this paper investigates the clustering properties of a complete sample of1041 24um-selected sources brighter than f[24um]=400 ujy in the overlappingregion between the swire and ukidss uds surveys. we have concentrated on thetwo (photometric) interval ranges z=[0.6-1.2] (low-z sample) and z&gt;1.6 (high-zsample) as it is in these regions were we expect the mid-ir population to bedominated by intense dust-enshrouded activity such as star formation and blackhole accretion. investigations of the angular correlation function produce acorrelation length are r0~15.9 mpc for the high-z sample and r0~8.5 mpc for thelow-z one. comparisons with physical models reveal that the high-z sources areexclusively associated with very massive (m&gt;~10^{13} m_sun)haloes, comparableto those which locally host groups-to-clusters of galaxies, and are very commonwithin such (rare) structures. conversely, lower-z galaxies are found to residein smaller halos (m_min~10^{12} m_sun) and to be very rare in such systems.while recent studies have determined a strong evolution of the 24um luminosityfunction between z~2 and z~0, they cannot provide information on the physicalnature of such an evolution. our clustering results instead indicate that thisis due to the presence of different populations of objects inhabiting differentstructures, as active systems at z&lt;~1.5 are found to be exclusively associatedwith low-mass galaxies, while very massive sources appear to have concludedtheir active phase before this epoch. finally, we note that the small-scaleclustering data seem to require steep profiles for the distribution of galaxieswithin their halos. this is suggestive of close encounters and/or mergers whichcould strongly favour both agn and star-formation activity.

1201.3609	improved constraints on the expansion rate of the universe up to z~1.1  from the spectroscopic evolution of cosmic chronometers	we present new improved constraints on the hubble parameter h(z) in theredshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopicevolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. we extract a largesample of early-type galaxies (\sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys,spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.42). weselect the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving andwithout signature of ongoing star formation. those galaxies can be used asstandard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by jimenez &amp; loeb (2002),whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probesh(z). we analyze the 4000 {\aa} break (d4000) as a function of redshift, usestellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependenceof the differential age evolution on the differential d4000, and estimate thehubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors.we provide 8 new measurements of h(z) (see tab. 4), and determine its change inh(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z\sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on h(z) at z \neq 0 with aprecision comparable with the one achieved for the hubble constant (about 5-6%at z \sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) which is crucialto distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. these measurements havebeen tested to best match a \lambda cdm model, clearly providing astatistically robust indication that the universe is undergoing an acceleratedexpansion. this method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constraina variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g.euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \sim 2.

1205.4058	the sizes, masses and specific star-formation rates of massive galaxies  at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5: strong evidence in favour of evolution via minor mergers	we report the results of a comprehensive study of the relationship betweengalaxy size, stellar mass and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) at redshifts1.3&lt;z&lt;1.5. based on a mass complete (m_star &gt;= 6x10^10 msun), spectroscopicsample from the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), with accurate stellar-massmeasurements derived from spectro photometric fitting, we find that at z~1.4the location of massive galaxies on the size-mass plane is determined primarilyby their ssfr. at this epoch we find that massive galaxies which are passive(ssfr &lt;= 0.1 gyr^-1) follow a tight size-mass relation, with half-light radii afactor f=2.4+/-0.2 smaller than their local counterparts. moreover, amongst thepassive sub-sample we find no evidence that the off-set from the localsize-mass relation is a function of stellar population age. based on asub-sample with dynamical mass estimates we also derive an independent estimateof f=2.3+/-0.3 for the typical growth in half-light radius between z~1.4 andthe present day. focusing on the passive sub-sample, we conclude that toproduce the necessary evolution predominantly via major mergers would requirean unfeasible number of merger events and over populate the high-mass end ofthe local stellar mass function. in contrast, we find that a scenario in whichmass accretion is dominated by minor mergers can produce the necessaryevolution, whereby an increase in stellar mass by a factor of ~2, accompaniedby an increase in size by a factor of ~3.5, is sufficient to reconcile thesize-mass relation at z~1.4 with that observed locally. finally, we note that asignificant fraction (44+/-12%) of the passive galaxies in our sample have adisk-like morphology, providing additional evidence that separate physicalprocesses are responsible for the quenching of star-formation and themorphological transformation of massive galaxies (abridged).

1207.2727	the ages, masses and star-formation rates of spectroscopically confirmed  z~6 galaxies in candels	we report the results of a study exploring the stellar populations of 13luminous (l&gt;l*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval5.5&lt;z&lt;6.5, all with wfc3/ir and irac imaging from the hst/candels andspitzer/seds surveys. based on fitting the observed photometry with sedtemplates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and aself consistent treatment of lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derivedstellar masses lie within the range 10^9 msun &lt; m*&lt; 10^10 msun and are robustto within a factor of two. in contrast, we confirm previous reports that theages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. although thebest-fitting models for three objects have ages &gt;= 300 myr, the degeneraciesintroduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actuallyrequire a &gt;300 myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, weobserve a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy sedtemplate with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects withblue uv-slopes but red uv-to-optical colours. to break this tension we exploresed fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) andallow for nebular emission. on average, the inclusion of nebular emission leadsto lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higherspecific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausiblestellar ages. however, based on our sed modelling, we find no strong evidencefor extremely young ages in our sample (&lt;50 myr). finally, considering all ofthe different star-formation histories explored, we find that the medianbest-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 myr and that the objects with thetightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 myr (abridged).

1311.5761	rest-frame ultra-violet spectra of massive galaxies at z=3: evidence of  high-velocity outflows	galaxy formation models invoke the presence of strong feedback mechanismsthat regulate the growth of massive galaxies at high redshifts. in this paperwe aim to: (1) confirm spectroscopically the redshifts of a sample of massivegalaxies selected with photometric redshifts z &gt; 2.5; (2) investigate theproperties of their stellar and interstellar media; (3) detect the presence ofoutflows, and measure their velocities. to achieve this, we analysed deep,high-resolution (r~2000) fors2 rest-frame uv spectra for 11 targets. weconfirmed that 9 out of 11 have spectroscopic redshifts z &gt; 2.5. we alsoserendipitously found two mask fillers at redshift z &gt; 2.5, which originallywere assigned photometric redshifts 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. in the four highest-qualityspectra we derived outflow velocities by fitting the absorption line profileswith models including multiple dynamical components. we found stronglyasymmetric, high-ionisation lines, from which we derived outflow velocitiesranging from 480 to 1518 km/s. the two galaxies with highest velocity showsigns of agn. we revised the spectral energy distribution fitting u-bandthrough 8 micron photometry, including the analysis of a power-law componentsubtraction to identify the possible presence of active galactic nuclei (agn).the revised stellar masses of all but one of our targets are &gt;1e10 msun, withfour having stellar masses &gt; 5e10 msun. three galaxies have a significantpower-law component in their spectral energy distributions, which indicatesthat they host agn. we conclude that massive galaxies are characterised bysignificantly higher velocity outflows than the typical lyman break galaxies atz ~ 3. the incidence of high-velocity outflows (~40% within our sample) is alsomuch higher than among massive galaxies at z &lt; 1, which is consistent with thepowerful star formation and nuclear activity that most massive galaxies displayat z &gt; 2.

1312.3329	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: ultraluminous star-forming galaxies  in a z=1.6 cluster	we analyse new scuba-2 submillimeter and archival spire far-infrared imagingof a z=1.62 cluster, cl0218.3-0510, which lies in the ukidss/uds field of thescuba-2 cosmology legacy survey. combining these tracers of obscured starformation activity with the extensive photometric and spectroscopic informationavailable for this field, we identify 31 far-infrared/submillimeter-detectedprobable cluster members with bolometric luminosities &gt;1e12 lo and show that byvirtue of their dust content and activity, these represent some of the reddestand brightest galaxies in this structure. we exploit cycle-1 alma submillimetercontinuum imaging which covers one of these sources to confirm theidentification of a scuba-2-detected ultraluminous star-forming galaxy in thisstructure. integrating the total star-formation activity in the central regionof the structure, we estimate that it is an order of magnitude higher (in amass-normalised sense) than clusters at z~0.5-1. however, we also find that themost active cluster members do not reside in the densest regions of thestructure, which instead host a population of passive and massive, redgalaxies. we suggest that while the passive and active populations havecomparable near-infrared luminosities at z=1.6, m(h)~-23, the subsequentstronger fading of the more active galaxies means that they will evolve intopassive systems at the present-day which are less luminous than the descendantsof those galaxies which were already passive at z~1.6 (m(h)~-20.5 andm(h)~-21.5 respectively at z~0). we conclude that the massive galaxy populationin the dense cores of present-day clusters were already in place at z=1.6 andthat in cl0218.3-0510 we are seeing continuing infall of less extreme, butstill ultraluminous, star-forming galaxies onto a pre-existing structure.

1411.5025	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: alma resolves the rest-frame  far-infrared emission of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present high-resolution (0.3'') alma 870um imaging of 52 sub-millimetergalaxies (smgs) in the ultra deep survey (uds) field and investigate the sizeand morphology of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) emission on 2-10kpc scales. wederive a median intrinsic angular size of fwhm=0.30$\pm$0.04'' for the 23 smgsin the sample detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (snr) &gt;10. using thephotometric redshifts of the smgs we show that this corresponds to a medianphysical half-light diameter of 2.4$\pm$0.2kpc. a stacking analysis of the smgsdetected at an snr &lt;10 shows they have sizes consistent with the 870um-brightsmgs in the sample. we compare our results to the sizes of smgs derived fromother multi-wavelength studies, and show that the rest-frame ~250um sizes ofsmgs are consistent with studies of resolved 12co (j=3-2 to 7-6) emissionlines, but that sizes derived from 1.4ghz imaging appear to be approximatelytwo times larger on average, which we attribute to cosmic ray diffusion. therest-frame optical sizes of smgs are around four times larger than thesub-millimeter sizes, indicating that the star formation in these galaxies iscompact relative to the pre-existing stellar distribution. the size of thestarburst region in smgs is consistent with the majority of the star formationoccurring in a central region, a few kpc in extent, with a median starformation rate surface density of 90$\pm$30msol/yr/kpc$^2$, which may suggestthat we are witnessing an intense period of bulge growth in these galaxies.

1412.5180	stellar masses from the candels survey: the goods-south and uds fields	we present the public release of the stellar mass catalogs for the goods-sand uds fields obtained using some of the deepest near-ir images available,achieved as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey (candels) project. we combine the effort from ten different teams, whocomputed the stellar masses using the same photometry and the same redshifts.each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, andparameter grid. the combination of results using the same underlying stellarisochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and otherchoices. thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test theeffect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar massestimate. the choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have thelargest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largestdistributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range largerthan 0.1 dex). on the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimatesare relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the starformation history. the inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra doesnot have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factorof 2 for ~80% of the sample). nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsampleof young galaxies (age &lt; 100 myr), especially in particular redshift ranges(e.g., 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4, 3.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.6, and 5.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.5), can be seriouslyoverestimated (by up to a factor of 10 for &lt; 20 myr sources) if nebularcontribution is ignored.

0804.3471	a new measurement of the evolving near-infrared galaxy luminosity  function out to z~4: a continuing challenge to theoretical models of galaxy  formation	we present the most accurate measurement to date of cosmological evolution ofthe near-infrared galaxy luminosity function, from the local universe out toz~4. the analysis is based on a large and highly complete sample of galaxiesselected from the first data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey.exploiting a master catalogue of k- and z-band selected galaxies over an areaof 0.7 square degrees, we analyse a sample of ~50,000 galaxies, all withreliable photometry in 16-bands from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.the unique combination of large area and depth provided by the ultra deepsurvey allows us to trace the evolution of the k-band luminosity function withunprecedented accuracy. in particular, via a maximum likelihood analysis weobtain a simple parameterization for the luminosity function and itscosmological evolution, including both luminosity and density evolution, whichprovides an excellent description of the data from z =0 up to z~4. we finddifferential evolution for galaxies dependent on galaxy luminosity, revealingonce again the ``down-sizing behaviour'' of galaxy formation. finally, wecompare our results with the predictions of the latest theoretical models ofgalaxy formation, based both on semi-analytical prescriptions, and on fullhydrodynamical simulations.

0805.1335	the luminosity function, halo masses and stellar masses of luminous  lyman-break galaxies at redshifts 5&lt;z&lt;6	we present the results of a study of a large sample of luminous (z'{ab}&lt;26)lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the redshift interval 4.7&lt;z&lt;6.3, selected from acontiguous 0.63 square degree area covered by the ukidss ultra deep survey(uds) and the subaru xmm-newton survey (sxds). utilising the large areacoverage and the excellent available optical+nearir data, we use a photometricredshift analysis to derive a new, robust, measurement of the bright end (l&gt;l*)of the uv-selected luminosity function at high redshift. when combined withliterature studies of the fainter lbg population, our new sample providesimproved constraints on the luminosity function of redshift 5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs over theluminosity range 0.1l*&lt;l&lt;10l*. a maximum likelihood analysis returnsbest-fitting schechter function parameters of m*_1500=-20.73, phi*=0.0009mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.66 for the luminosity function at z=5, and m*_1500 =-20.04, phi*=0.0018 mpc^-3 and alpha=-1.71 at z=6. in addition, an analysis ofthe angular clustering properties of our lbg sample demonstrates that luminous5&lt;z&lt;6 lbgs are strongly clustered (r_0 = 8.1 mpc), and are consistent with theoccupation of dark matter halos with masses of ~10^{11.5-12.0} msun. moreover,by stacking the available multi-wavelength imaging data for the high-redshiftlbgs it is possible to place useful constraints on their typical stellar mass.the results of this analysis suggest that luminous lbgs at 5&lt;z&lt;6 have anaverage stellar mass of ~10^10 msun, consistent with the results of theclustering analysis assuming plausible values for the ratio of stellar to darkmatter. finally, by combining our luminosity function results with those of thestacking analysis we derive estimates of ~1x10^7 msun mpc^-3 and 4x10^6 msunmpc^-3 for the stellar mass density at z~5 and z~6 respectively.

1507.00350	the formation history of massive cluster galaxies as revealed by carla	we use a sample of 37 of the densest clusters and protoclusters across $1.3\le z \le 3.2$ from the clusters around radio-loud agn (carla) survey to studythe formation of massive cluster galaxies. we use optical $i'$-band andinfrared 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images to statistically select sources withinthese protoclusters and measure their median observed colours; $\langlei'-[3.6] \rangle$. we find the abundance of massive galaxies within theprotoclusters increases with decreasing redshift, suggesting these objects mayform an evolutionary sequence, with the lower redshift clusters in the samplehaving similar properties to the descendants of the high redshiftprotoclusters. we find that the protocluster galaxies have an approximatelyunevolving observed-frame $i'-[3.6]$ colour across the examined redshift range.we compare the evolution of the $\langle i'-[3.6] \rangle$ colour of massivecluster galaxies with simplistic galaxy formation models. taking the fullcluster population into account, we show that the formation of stars within themajority of massive cluster galaxies occurs over at least 2gyr, and peaks at $z\sim 2$-3. from the median $i'-[3.6]$ colours we cannot determine the starformation histories of individual galaxies, but their star formation must havebeen rapidly terminated to produce the observed red colours. finally, we showthat massive galaxies at $z&gt;2$ must have assembled within 0.5gyr of themforming a significant fraction of their stars. this means that few massivegalaxies in $z&gt;2$ protoclusters could have formed via dry mergers.

astro-ph;0001179	a deep rosat survey xv. the average qso spectrum and its evolution	using a sample of 165 x-ray selected qsos from seven deep rosat fields weinvestigate the x-ray spectral properties of an ``average''radio-quiet broadline qso as a function of redshift. the qso stacked spectra, in the observers0.1-2 kev band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.2 apparentlyharden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seenin other qso samples. in contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 kev band show nosignificant variation in spectral index with redshift. this suggests thepresence of a spectral upturn at low energies (&lt;0.5 kev). indeed, while at highredshifts (z&gt;1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to thedata over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a secondcomponent at low energies, a `soft excess'. inclusion of a simple model for thesoft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kt~100 ev), results in a significantimprovement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for allredshift bins. this power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, withthose of nearby agn in the 2-10 kev band, suggesting that the same intrinsicpower-law slope may continue from 10 kev down to below 0.5 kev. we caution thatthere is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent areal physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a largedispersion in spectral indices. regardless of the origin of the soft excess,the average qso spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the x-raybackground: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift qso aresignificantly steeper than the spectrum of the x-ray background extending thespectral paradox into the soft 0.1-2 kev x-ray band.

astro-ph;0006427	x-ray absorption and rapid variability of the dwarf seyfert nucleus of  ngc4395	we report the detection of an absorbed central x-ray source and its strong,rapid variability in ngc4395, the least luminous seyfert nucleus known. thex-ray source exhibits a number of flares with factors of 3-4 flux changesduring a half day asca observation. such x-ray variability is in constrast tothe behaviour of other low luminosity active galaxies. it provides furthersupport for an accreting black hole model rather than an extreme stellarprocess in accounting for the nuclear activity of ngc4395. the soft x-rayemission below 3 kev is strongly attenuated by absorption. the energy spectrumin this absorption band shows a dramatic change in response to the variation incontinuum luminosity. a variable warm absorber appears to be an explanation forthe spectral change. the absorption-corrected 2-10 kev luminosity is 4e39 erg/sfor a source distance of 2.6 mpc, and at 1 kev is one order of magnitude aboveprevious rosat estimates. our x-ray results infer the nuclear source of ngc4395to be a scaled-down version of higher luminosity seyfert nuclei, with anintermediate mass (10^4-10^5 msun) black hole, unlike the nearby low luminosityactive galaxies in which underfed massive black holes are suspected to reside.

astro-ph;0010483	starburst activity in a rosat narrow emission-line galaxy	we present multiwaveband photometric and optical spectropolarimetricobservations of the r=15.9 narrow emission line galaxy r117_a which lies on theedge of the error circle of the rosat x-ray source r117 (from mchardy et al1998). the overall spectral energy distribution of the galaxy is well modelledby a combination of a normal spiral galaxy and a moderate-strength burst ofstar formation. the far infra-red and radio emission is extended along themajor axis of the galaxy, indicating an extended starburst.  on positional grounds, the galaxy is a good candidate for the identificationof r117 and the observed x-ray flux is very close to what would be expectedfrom a starburst of the observed far infra-red and radio fluxes. although anobscured high redshift qso cannot be entirely ruled out as contributing somefraction of the x-ray flux, we find no candidates to k=20.8 within the x-rayerrorbox and so conclude that r117_a is responsible for a large fraction, ifnot all, of the x-ray emission from r117.  searches for indicators of an obscured agn in r117_a have so far provennegative; deep spectropolarimetric observations show no signs of broad lines toa limit of one per cent and, for the observed far infra-red and radio emission,we would expect a ten times greater x-ray flux if the overall emission werepowered by an agn. we therefore conclude that the x-ray emission from r117 isdominated by starburst emission from the galaxy r117_a.

astro-ph;0108400	the coincidence and angular clustering of chandra and scuba sources	we explore the relationship between the hard x-ray and sub-mm populationsusing deep chandra observations of a large, contiguous scuba survey. inagreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap issmall. of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only oneis coincident with a chandra source. the resulting limits imply that themajority of scuba sources are not powered by agn, unless the central engine isobscured by compton-thick material with a low (&lt;1 per cent) scatteredcomponent. furthermore, since chandra detects only ~5 per cent of scubasources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. the x-rayupper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburstsed at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of scuba sources lie at z&gt;1even if they are purely starburst galaxies. despite the low detection rate, wefind evidence for strong angular clustering between the x-ray and sub-mmpopulations. the implication is that agn and scuba sources trace the samelarge-scale structure but do not generally coincide. if bright sub-mm sourcesrepresent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for agiven galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from theperiod of observable quasar activity.

astro-ph;0210248	obscured agn from the elais deep x-ray survey	the sources discovered in deep hard x-ray surveys with 2-8 kev fluxes of10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 make up the bulk of the x-ray background at theseenergies. we present here detailed multi-wavelength observations of three suchsources from the elais deep x-ray survey. the observations include sensitivenear-infrared spectroscopy with the subaru telescope and x-ray spectralinformation from the chandra x-ray observatory. the sources observed all haveoptical-to-near-ir colours redder than an unobscured quasar and comprise areddened quasar, a radio galaxy and an optically-obscured agn. the reddenedquasar is at a redshift z=2.61 and shows a very large x-ray absorbing column ofn_h approx 3.10^23 cm^-2. this contrasts with the relatively small amount ofdust reddening, implying a gas-to-dust ratio along the line-of-sight a hundredtimes greater than that of the milky way. the radio galaxy at z=1.57 shows onlynarrow emission lines, but has a surprisingly soft x-ray spectrum. the softnessof this spectrum either indicates an unusually low gas-to-dust ratio for theabsorbing medium or x-ray emission related to the young radio source. the hostgalaxy is extremely red (r-k=6.4) and its optical/near-ir spectrum is best fitby a strongly reddened (a_v~2) starburst. the third x-ray source discussed isalso extremely red (r-k=6.1) and lies in a close grouping of three other r-k&gt;6galaxies. no emission or absorption lines were detected from this object, butits redshift (and that of one of the nearby galaxies) are constrained bysed-fitting to be just greater than z=1. the extremely red colours of these twogalaxies can be accounted for by old stellar populations. these observationsillustrate the diverse properties of hard x-ray selected agn.

astro-ph;0403679	the search for agn in distant galaxy clusters	we are undertaking the first systematic study of the prevalence of agnactivity in a large sample of high redshift galaxy clusters. local clusterscontain mainly red elliptical galaxies, and have little or no luminous agnactivity. however, recent studies of some moderate to high redshift clustershave revealed significant numbers of luminous agn within the cluster. thiseffect may parallel the butcher-oemler effect - the increase in the fraction ofblue galaxies in distant clusters compared to local clusters. our aim is toverify and quantify recent evidence that agn activity in dense environmentsincreases with redshift, and to evaluate the significance of this effect. ascluster agn are far less prevalent than field sources, a large sample of over120 cluster fields at z &gt; 0.1 has been selected from the chandra archives andis being analysed for excess point sources. the size of the excess, the radialdistribution and flux of the sources and the dependence of these on clusterredshift and luminosity will reveal important information about the triggeringand fueling of agn.

astro-ph;0409723	mid-infrared sources in the elais deep x-ray survey	we present a cross-correlation of the european large area iso survey (elais)with the elais deep x-ray survey of the n1 and n2 fields. there are 7 chandrapoint sources with matches in the elais final analysis 15um catalogue, out of atotal of 28 extragalactic iso sources present in the chandra fields. five ofthese are consistent with agn giving an agn fraction of ~19 per cent in the15um flux range 0.8-6 mjy. we have co-added the hard x-ray fluxes of theindividually-undetected iso sources and find a low significance detectionconsistent with star formation in the remaining population. we combine ourpoint source cross-correlation fraction with the xmm-newton observations of thelockman hole and chandra observations of the hubble deep field north toconstrain source count models of the mid-infrared galaxy population. the lowdust-enshrouded agn fraction in elais implied by the number ofcross-identifications between the elais mid-infrared sample and the chandrapoint sources is encouraging for the use of mid-infrared surveys to constrainthe cosmic star formation history, provided there are not further largeundetected populations of compton-thick agn.

astro-ph;0410632	sub-mm detection of a high redshift type 2 qso	we report on the first scuba detection of a type 2 qso at z=3.660 in thechandra deep field south. this source is x-ray absorbed, shows only narrowemission lines in the optical spectrum and is detected in the sub-mm: it is theideal candidate in an evolution scheme for agn (e.g. fabian (1999); page et al.(2004)) of an early phase corresponding to the main growth of the host galaxyand formation of the central black hole. the overall photometry (from the radioto the x-ray energy band) of this source is well reproduced by the spectralenergy distribution (sed) of ngc 6240, while it is incompatible with thespectrum of a type 1 qso (3c273) or a starburst galaxy (arp 220). its sub-mm(850 \mu m) to x-ray (2 kev) spectral slope (alpha_sx) is close to thepredicted value for a compton-thick agn in which only 1% of the nuclearemission emerges through scattering. using the observed flux at 850 \mu m wehave derived a sfr=550--680 m$_odot/yr and an estimate of the dust mass,m$_dust=4.2 10^8 m_odot

astro-ph;0603608	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey early data release	this paper defines the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss) early datarelease (edr). ukidss is a set of five large near-infra-red surveys defined bylawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the uk infra-red telescope(ukirt) wide field camera (wfcam). the programme began in may 2005 and has anexpected duration of seven years. each survey uses some or all of the broadbandfilter complement zyjhk. the edr is the first public release of data to theeuropean southern observatory (eso) community. all worldwide releases occurafter a delay of 18 months from the eso release. the edr provides a smallsample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of ukidss), that is a lowerlimit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. in addition, anedr+ dataset contains all edr data plus extra data of similar quality, but forareas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).the first large data release, dr1, will occur in mid-2006. we provide detailsof the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric andphotometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. we summarise thedata coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for eachsurvey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from thewfcam science archive.

astro-ph;0604426	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss)	we describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of theukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss), a seven year sky survey which began inmay 2005, using the ukirt wide field camera. it is a portfolio of five surveycomponents covering various combinations of the filter set zyjhk and h_2. thelarge area survey, the galactic clusters survey, and the galactic plane surveycover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of k~18; the deepextragalactic survey covers 35 square degrees to k~21, and the ultra deepsurvey covers 0.77 square degrees to k~23. summed together ukidss is 12 timeslarger in effective volume than the 2mass survey. the prime aim of ukidss is toprovide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however drivenby a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintestsub-stellar objects; to discover population ii brown dwarfs, if they exist; todetermine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; todetermine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure fromz=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and tomap the milky way through the dust, to several kpc. the survey data are beinguniformly processed, and released in stages through the wfcam science archive(wsa : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). before the formal survey began, ukirt andthe ukidss consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of smallscience verification (sv) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera.we show some results from these sv projects in order to demonstrate the likelypower of the eventual complete survey. finally, using the data from the firstdata release we assess how well ukidss is meeting its design targets so far.

astro-ph;0606116	the discovery of a significant sample of massive galaxies at redshifts 5  &lt; z &lt; 6 in the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we have exploited the large area coverage of the combined ukidss ultra deepsurvey (uds) and subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) to search for brightlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z &gt;= 5. using the availableoptical+near-infrared photometry to efficiently exclude low-redshiftcontaminants, we identify nine z &gt;= 5 lbg candidates brighter than z'=25(ab)within the 0.6 square degree overlap region between the uds early data release(edr) and the optical coverage of the sxds. accounting for selectionincompleteness, we estimate the corresponding surface density of z &gt;= 5 lbgswith z'&lt;=25(ab) to be 0.005+/-0.002 per square arcmin. modelling of theoptical+near-infrared photometry constrains the candidates' redshifts to lie inthe range 5.1 &lt; z &lt; 5.9, and provides estimates for their stellar masses.although the stellar mass estimates are individually uncertain, a stackinganalysis suggests that the typical stellar mass of the lbg candidates is&gt;~5x10^10 msun which, if confirmed, places them amongst the most massivegalaxies currently known at z &gt;= 5. it is found that lambda cdm structureformation can produce sufficient numbers of dark matter halos at z &gt;= 5 toaccommodate our estimated number density of massive lbgs for plausible valuesof sigma_8 and the ratio of stellar to dark matter. moreover, it is found thatrecent galaxy formation models can also account for the existence of suchmassive galaxies at z &gt;= 5. finally, no evidence is found for the existence oflbgs with stellar masses in excess of ~3x10^11 msun at this epoch, despite thelarge co-moving volume surveyed.

astro-ph;0607242	aegis: the diversity of bright near-ir selected distant red galaxies	we use deep and wide near infrared (nir) imaging from the palomar telescopecombined with deep2 spectroscopy and hubble space telescope (hst) and chandraspace telescope imaging to investigate the nature of galaxies that are red innir colors. we locate these `distant red galaxies' (drgs) through the color cut(j-k)_{vega} &gt; 2.3 over 0.7 deg^{2}, where we find 1010 drg candidates down tok_s = 20.5. we combine 95 high quality spectroscopic redshifts with photometricredshifts from brijk photometry to determine the redshift and stellar massdistributions for these systems, and morphological/structural and x-rayproperties for 107 drgs in the extended groth strip. we find that many bright(j-k)_{vega}&gt;2.3 galaxies with k_s&lt;20.5 are at redshifts z&lt;2, with 64% between1&lt;z&lt;2. the stellar mass distributions for these galaxies is broad, ranging from10^{9}-10^{12} m_solar, but with most z&gt;2 systems massive with m_*&gt;10^{11}m_solar. hst imaging shows that the structural properties and morphologies ofdrgs are also diverse, with the majority elliptical/compact (57%), and theremainder edge-on spirals (7%), and peculiar galaxies (29%). the drgs at z &lt;1.4 with high quality spectroscopic redshifts are generally compact, with smallhalf light radii, and span a range in rest-frame optical properties. thespectral energy distributions for these objects differ from higher redshiftdrgs: they are bluer by one magnitude in observed (i-j) color. a pure ir colorselection of high redshift populations is not sufficient to identify uniquepopulations, and other colors, or spectroscopic redshifts are needed to producehomogeneous samples.

astro-ph;0609287	the evolution of the near-ir galaxy luminosity function and colour  bimodality up to z ~ 2 from the ukidss ultra deep survey early data release	we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near-infraredgalaxy luminosity function, derived from the analysis of a new sample of\~22,000 k(ab) &lt; 22.5 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees fromthe early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey (uds). our study hasexploited the multi-wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the newukidss wfcam k and j-band imaging, the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey and thespitzer-swire survey. the unique combination of large area and depth providedby this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and hasallowed us, for the first time, to trace the evolution of the brightest sourcesout to z~2 with good statistical accuracy.  in agreement with previous studies we find that the characteristic luminosityof the near-infrared luminosity function brightens by 1 magnitude between z=0and z~2, while the total density decreases by a factor ~2. using the rest-frame(u-b) colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies, we confirm theclassic luminosity-dependent colour bimodality at z&lt;1. however, the strength ofthe colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, andseems to disappear by z&gt;1.5. due to the large size of our sample we are able toinvestigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxypopulations. it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies(m_k &lt; -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sourcesdominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&lt;1. incontrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease inspace density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominatethe bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z&gt;1.

0809.2677	the clustering and abundance of star-forming and passive galaxies at $z  \sim 2$	we use the ukidss ultra-deep survey (uds), currently the deepest panoramicnear infra-red survey, together with deep subaru optical imaging to measure theclustering, number counts and luminosity function of galaxies at $z\sim 2$selected using the bzk selection technique. we find that both star-forming(sbzk) and passive (pbzk) galaxies, to a magnitude limit of $k_{ab} &lt; 23$, arestrongly clustered. the passive galaxies are the most strongly clusteredpopulation, with scale lengths of $r_0 = 15.0^{+1.9}_{-2.2}$h$^{-1}$mpccompared with $r_0 = 6.75^{+0.34}_{-0.37}$h$^{-1}$mpc for star-forminggalaxies. the direct implication is that passive galaxies inhabit the mostmassive dark-matter halos, and are thus identified as the progenitors of themost massive galaxies at the present day. in addition, the pbzks exhibit asharp flattening and potential turn-over in their number counts, in agreementwith other recent studies. this plateau cannot be explained by the effects ofincompleteness. we conclude that only very massive galaxies are undergoingpassive evolution at this early epoch, consistent with the downsizing scenariofor galaxy evolution. assuming a purely passive evolution for the pbzks fromtheir median redshift to the present day, their luminosity function suggeststhat only $\sim 2.5 %$ of present day massive ellipticals had a pbzk as a mainprogenitor.

astro-ph;9803289	do nuclear starbursts obscure the x-ray background?	we propose a model for the source of the x-ray background (xrb) in which lowluminosity active nuclei (l&lt;10^43 erg/s) are obscured by nuclear starburstswithin the inner 100pc. the obscuring material covers most of the sky as seenfrom the central source, rather than being distributed in a toroidal structure,and hardens the averaged x-ray spectrum by photoelectric absorption. the gas isturbulent with velocity dispersion of a few 100 km/s and cloud-cloud collisionslead to copious star formation. although supernovae tend to produce outflows,most of the gas is trapped in the gravity field of the starforming clusteritself and the central black hole. a hot (t=10^6-10^7 k) virialised phase ofthis gas, comprising a few per cent of the total obscuring material, feeds thecentral engine of 10^7 solar masses through bondi accretion, at a sub-eddingtonrate appropriate for the luminosity of these objects. if starburst-obscuredobjects give rise to the residual xrb, then only 10 per cent of the accretionin active galaxies occurs close to the eddington limit in unabsorbed objects.

astro-ph;9810413	asca observations of deep rosat fields iv.ir and hard x-ray observations  of an obscured high-redshift qso	we use ukirt and asca observations to determine the nature of a high redshift(z=2.35) narrow-line agn, previously discovered by almaini et al. (1995). theukirt observations show a broad halpha line while no hbeta line is detected.this together with the red colour (b-k=5.4) suggest that our object is amoderately obscured qso (av&gt;3), in optical wavelengths. the asca data suggest ahard spectrum, probably due to a large obscuring column, with a photon index of1.93 (+0.62, -0.46), nh~10^23. the combined asca and rosat data again suggest aheavily obscured spectrum (nh~10^23 or av~100). in this picture, the rosat softx-ray emission may arise from electron scattering, in a similar fashion tolocal seyfert 1.9. then, there is a large discrepancy between the moderatereddening witnessed by the ir and the large x-ray absorbing column. this couldbe possibly explained on the basis of e.g. high gas metallicities or assumingthat the x-ray absorbing column is inside the dust sublimation radius. analternative explanation can be obtained when we allow for variability betweenthe rosat and asca observations. then the best fit spectrum is still flat, 1.35(+0.16, -0.14), but with low intrinsic absorption in better agreement with their data, while the rosat normalization is a factor of two below the ascanormalization. this object may be one of the bright examples of a type-ii qsopopulation at high redshift, previously undetected in optical surveys. the hardx-ray spectrum of this object suggests that such a population could make asubstantial contribution to the x-ray background.

astro-ph;9903178	the agn contribution to deep submillimetre surveys and the far-infrared  background	a great deal of interest has been generated recently by the results of deepsubmillimetre surveys, which in principle allow an unobscured view ofdust-enshrouded star formation at high redshift. the extragalactic far-infraredand submillimetre backgrounds have also been detected, providing furtherconstraints on the history of star formation. in this paper we estimate thefraction of these backgrounds and source counts which could be explained byagn. the relative fractions of obscured and unobscured objects are constrainedby the requirement that they fit the spectrum of the cosmic x-ray background.on the assumption that the spectral energy distributions of high redshift agnare similar to those observed locally, we find that one can explain at least10-20 per cent of the 850 micron scuba sources at 1mjy and a similar fractionof the far-infrared/submillimetre background. the exact contribution depends onthe assumed cosmology and the space density of agn at high redshift (z&gt;3), butwe conclude that active nuclei will be present in a significant (though notdominant) fraction of the faint scuba sources. this fraction could besignificantly higher if a large population of agn are highly obscured(compton-thick) at x-ray wavelengths.
