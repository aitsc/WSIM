0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0707.1517	environmental dependence of agn activity in the supercluster a901/2	we present xmm data for the supercluster a901/2, at z ~ 0.17, which iscombined with deep imaging and 17-band photometric redshifts (from the combo-17survey), 2df spectra and spitzer 24um data, to identify agn in thesupercluster. the 90ksec xmm image contains 139 point sources, of which 11 areidentified as supercluster agn with l_x(0.5-7.5kev) &gt; 1.7x10^41 erg/cm2/s. thehost galaxies have m_r &lt; -20 and only 2 of 8 sources with spectra could havebeen identified as agn by the detected optical emission lines. using a largesample of 795 supercluster galaxies we define control samples of massivegalaxies with no detected agn. the local environments of the agn and controlsamples differ at &gt;98 per cent significance. the agn host galaxies liepredominantly in areas of moderate projected galaxy density and with more localblue galaxies than the control sample, with the exception of one very brighttype i agn very near the centre of a cluster. these environments are similarto, but not limited to, cluster outskirts and blue groups. despite the largenumber of potential host galaxies, no agn are found in regions with the highestgalaxy density (excluding some cluster cores where emission from the icmobscures moderate luminosity agn). agn are also absent from the areas withlowest galaxy density. we conclude that the prevalence of cluster agn is linkedto their environment.

0911.1158	the morphology of passively evolving galaxies at z ~ 2 from hst/wfc3  deep imaging in the hubble ultradeep field	we present near-ir images, obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst) andthe wfc3/ir camera, of six passive and massive galaxies at redshift 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.4(ssfr&lt;10^{-2} gyr^{-1}; stellar mass m~10^{11} m_{sun}), selected from thegreat observatories origins deep survey (goods). these images, which have aspatial resolution of ~1.5 kpc, provide the deepest view of the opticalrest-frame morphology of such systems to date. we find that the light profileof these galaxies is regular and well described by a sersic model with indextypical of today's spheroids. their size, however, is generally much smallerthan today's early types of similar stellar mass, with four out of six galaxieshaving r_e ~ 1 kpc or less, in quantitative agreement with previous similarmeasures made at rest-frame uv wavelengths. the images reach limiting surfacebrightness mu~26.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the f160w bandpass; yet, there is noevidence of a faint halo in the galaxies of our sample, even in their stackedimage. we also find that these galaxies have very weak "morphologicalk-correction" between the rest-frame uv (from the acs z-band), and therest--frame optical (wfc3 h-band): the sersic index, physical size and overallmorphology are independent or only mildly dependent on the wavelength, withinthe errors.

1002.3158	a spitzer-selected galaxy cluster at z=1.62	we report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z=1.62 located in the spitzerwide-area infrared extragalactic survey xmm-lss field. this structure wasselected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red spitzer/irac colors,satisfying [3.6]-[4.5] &gt; -0.1 ab mag. photometric redshifts derived from subaruxmm deep survey (bviz-bands), ukirt infrared deep survey-ultra-deep survey(ukidss-uds, jk-bands), and from the spitzer public uds survey (3.6-8.0 micron)show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ~ 1.6that is more than 20 sigma above the mean at this redshift. we obtained opticalspectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using imacs on themagellan telescope. we measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the rangez=1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin (&lt;1.4 mpc) of the astrometric center of thecluster. a posteriori analysis of the xmm data in this field reveal a weak (4sigma) detection in the [0.5-2 kev] band compatible with the expected thermalemission from such a cluster. the color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies inthis cluster shows a prominent red-sequence, dominated by a population of redgalaxies with (z-j) &gt; 1.7 mag. the photometric redshift probabilitydistributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z=1.62, coincidentwith the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. the rest-frame (u-b) color andscatter of galaxies on the red-sequence are consistent with a meanluminosity-weighted age of 1.2 +/- 0.1 gyr, yielding a formation redshift z_f =2.35 +/- 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star-formation periodin these galaxies.

0707.4484	hst and spitzer imaging of red and blue galaxies at z~2.5: a correlation  between size and star formation activity from compact quiescent galaxies to  extended star forming galaxies	we present hst nicmos+acs and spitzer irac+mips observations of 41 galaxiesat 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 in the fires ms1054 field with red and blue rest-frame opticalcolors. about half of the galaxies are very compact (effective radii r_e &lt; 1kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths, the others are extended (1&lt; r_e &lt; 10kpc). for reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12 arcsec at z=2.5 in the adoptedcosmology. we separate actively star forming galaxies from quiescent galaxiesby modeling their rest-frame uv-nir seds. the star forming galaxies span thefull range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e&lt;2kpc. in theredshift range where mips 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiateddust emission (z&lt;2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the smallquiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded starformation or agn activity. the inferred surface mass densities and velocitydispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in localgalaxies. the galaxies follow a kormendy relation (between surface brightnessand size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brightersurface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift ofz_f~5. this paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formationactivity and size at z~2.5, and the existence of a significant population ofmassive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiablecounterparts in the local universe.

1011.2764	the simple survey: observations, reduction, and catalog	we present the spitzer irac/musyc public legacy survey in the extendedcdf-south (simple), which consists of deep irac observations covering the~1,600 arcmin^2 area surrounding goods-s. the limiting magnitudes of the simpleirac mosaics typically are 23.8, 23.6, 21.9, and 21.7, at 3.6 um, 4.5 um, 5.8um, and 8.0 um, respectively (5-sigma total point source magnitudes in ab). thesimple irac images are combined with the 10'x15' goods irac mosaics in thecenter. we give detailed descriptions of the observations, data reduction, andproperties of the final images, as well as the detection and photometry methodsused to build a catalog. using published optical and near-infrared data fromthe multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc), we construct an irac-selectedcatalog, containing photometry in ubvriz'jhk, [3.6 um], [4.5 um], [5.8 um], and[8.0 um]. the catalog contains 43,782 sources with s/n &gt; 5 at 3.6 um, 19,993 ofwhich have 13-band photometry. we compare this catalog to the publiclyavailable musyc and fireworks catalogs and discuss the differences. using ahigh signal-to-noise sub-sample of 3,391 sources with ([3.6] + [4.5])/2 &lt; 21.2,we investigate the star formation rate history of massive galaxies out to z ~1.8. we find that at z ~ 1.8 at least 30% +/-7% of the most massive galaxies(mstar &gt; 10^11 msol) are passively evolving, in agreement with earlier resultsfrom surveys covering less area.

1012.0305	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south - radio and  mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre galaxies	we present radio and infrared (3.6-24um) counterparts to submillimetregalaxies (smgs) detected in the extended chandra deep field south with thelaboca 870-um bolometer camera on the 12-m atacama pathfinder experiment. usingthe very large array at 1.4ghz and spitzer we have identified securecounterparts to 79 of the 126 smgs (snr&gt;3.7, s_870&gt;4.4mjy) in the field, 62 viatheir radio and/or 24-um emission, the remainder using a colour-flux cut onirac 3.6- and 5.8-um sources chosen to maximise the number of secure,coincident radio and 24-um counterparts. in constructing our radio catalogue,we have corrected for the effects of `flux boosting', then used the correctedflux densities to estimate the redshifts of the smgs based on the radio/submmspectral indices. the effect of the boosting correction is to increase themedian redshift by 0.2 resulting in a value of z=2.2 (+0.7-0.8) (1-sigmaerrors) for the secure radio counterparts, in agreement with other studies,both spectroscopic and photometric.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1107.2591	insights on the formation, evolution, and activity of massive galaxies  from ultra-compact and disky galaxies at z=2-3	we present our results on the structure and activity of massive galaxies atz=1-3 using one of the largest (166 with m_star&gt;=5e10 m_sun) and most diversesamples of massive galaxies derived from the goods-nicmos survey: (1) sersicfits to deep nic3/f160w images indicate that the rest-frame optical structuresof massive galaxies are very different at z=2-3 compared to z~0. approximately40% of massive galaxies are ultra-compact (r_e&lt;=2 kpc), compared to less than1% at z~0. furthermore, most (~65%) systems at z=2-3 have a low sersic indexn&lt;=2, compared to ~13% at z~0. we present evidence that the n&lt;=2 systems atz=2-3 likely contain prominent disks, unlike most massive z~0 systems. (2)there is a correlation between structure and star formation rates (sfr). themajority (~85%) of non-agn massive galaxies at z=2-3, with sfr high enough toyield a 5 sigma (30 micro jy) 24 micron spitzer detection have low n&lt;=2. suchn&lt;=2 systems host the highest sfr. (3) the frequency of agn is ~40% at z=2-3.most (~65%) agn hosts have disky (n&lt;=2) morphologies. ultra-compact galaxiesappear quiescent in terms of both agn activity and star formation. (4) largestellar surface densities imply massive galaxies at z=2-3 formed via rapid,highly dissipative events at z&gt;2. the large fraction of n&lt;=2 disky systemssuggests cold mode accretion complements gas-rich major mergers at z&gt;2. inorder for massive galaxies at z=2-3 to evolve into present-day massive e/s0s,they need to significantly increase (n, r_e). dry minor and major mergers mayplay an important role in this process.

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1108.3229	supermassive black hole growth in starburst galaxies over cosmic time:  constraints from the deepest chandra fields	we present an analysis of deep multiwavelength data for z ~ 0.3-3 starburstgalaxies selected by their 70 um emission in the extended-chandra deepfield-south and extended groth strip. we identify active galactic nuclei (agns)in these infrared sources through their x-ray emission and quantify thefraction that host an agn. we find that the fraction depends strongly on boththe mid-infrared color and rest-frame mid-infrared luminosity of the source,rising to ~ 50-70% at the warmest colors and highest mid-infrared luminosities(corresponding to ultraluminous infrared galaxies), similar to the trends foundlocally. additionally, we find that the agn fraction depends strongly on thestar formation rate of the host galaxy (inferred from the observed 70 umluminosity after subtracting the estimated agn contribution), particularly formore luminous agns (l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/s). at the highest star formation rates (~1000 m_sun/yr), the fraction of galaxies with an x-ray detected agn rises to ~30%, roughly consistent with that found in high-redshift submillimetergalaxies. assuming that the agn fraction is driven by the star formation rate(rather than stellar mass or redshift, for which our sample is largelydegenerate), this result implies that the duty cycle of luminous agn activityincreases with the star formation rate of the host galaxy: specifically, wefind that luminous x-ray detected agns are at least ~ 5-10 times more common insystems with high star formation rates (&gt; 300 m_sun/yr) than in systems withlower star formation rates (&lt; 30 m_sun/yr). lastly, we investigate the ratiobetween the supermassive black hole accretion rate and the growth rate of thehost galaxy and find that, for sources with detected agns and star formation,this ratio in distant starbursts agrees well with that expected from the localscaling relation assuming the black holes and bulges grew at the same epoch.

1110.3821	caught in the act: the assembly of massive cluster galaxies at z=1.62	we present the recent merger history of massive galaxies in aspectroscopically-confirmed proto-cluster at z=1.62. using hst wfc3near-infrared imaging from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels), we select cluster galaxies and z ~ 1.6 field galaxieswith m_star &gt;= 3 x 10^10 m_sun, and determine the frequency of double nuclei orclose companions with projected separations less than 20 kpc co-moving andstellar mass ratios between 1:1 and roughly 10:1. we find that four out of fivespectroscopically-confirmed massive proto-cluster galaxies have double nuclei,and 42 +13/-25 % of all m_star &gt;= 3 x 10^10 m_sun cluster candidates are eitherin close pair systems or have double nuclei. in contrast, only 4.5 +/- 2.6% ofthe field galaxies are in close pair/double nuclei systems. the implied mergerrate per massive galaxy in the proto-cluster is 3-10 times higher than themerger rate of massive field galaxies at z ~ 1.6, depending upon the assumedmass ratios. close pairs in the cluster have minor merger stellar mass ratios(m_primary:m_satellite ~ 6:1), while the field pairs are typically majormergers with stellar mass ratios between 1:1 and 4:1. at least half of thecluster mergers are dissipationless, as indicated by their red colors and low24 micron fluxes. two of the double-nucleated cluster members have x-raydetected agn with l_x &gt; 10^43 erg/s, and are strong candidates for dual oroffset super-massive black holes. we conclude that the massive z = 1.62proto-cluster galaxies are undergoing accelerated assembly relative to thefield population, and discuss the implications for galaxy evolution inproto-cluster environments.

0711.1902	mid-infrared spectroscopy of lensed galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3: the nature of  sources near the mips confusion limit	we present spitzer/irs mid-infrared spectra for 15 gravitationally lensed, 24micron--selected galaxies, and combine the results with 4 additional very faintgalaxies with irs spectra in the literature. the median intrinsic 24 micronflux density of the sample is 130 microjy, enabling a systematic survey of thespectral properties of the very faint 24 micron sources that dominate thenumber counts of spitzer cosmological surveys. six of the 19 galaxy spectra(32%) show the strong mid-ir continuua expected of agn; x-ray detectionsconfirm the presence of agn in three of these cases, and reveal agns in twoother galaxies. these results suggest that nuclear accretion may contributemore flux to faint 24 micron--selected samples than previously assumed. almostall the spectra show some aromatic (pah) emission features; the measuredaromatic flux ratios do not show evolution from z=0. in particular, the highs/n mid-ir spectrum of smm j163554.2+661225 agrees remarkably well withlow--redshift, lower--luminosity templates. we compare the rest-frame 8 micronand total infrared luminosities of star--forming galaxies, and find that thebehavior of this ratio with total ir luminosity has evolved modestly from z=2to z=0. since the high aromatic--to--continuum flux ratios in these galaxiesrule out a dominant contribution by agn, this finding implies systematicevolution in the structure and/or metallicity of infrared sources withredshift. it also has implications for the estimates of star forming ratesinferred from 24 micron measurements, in the sense that at z ~2, a givenobserved frame 24 micron luminosity corresponds to a lower bolometricluminosity than would be inferred from low-redshift templates of similarluminosity at the corresponding rest wavelength.

0712.0033	the environment on few mpc scales of infrared luminous galaxies at  redshifts z~1	we investigate the environment of infrared luminous galaxies (l$_{ir}$[8-1000$\mu $m$] &gt;10^{11}$l$_{\sun}$). we focus on the redshift range 0.7 $\leq$ z$\leq$ 1, where these galaxies dominate the star formation activity and play asignificant role in galaxy evolution. we employ mips 24$\mu$m data to identifyinfrared galaxies in the extended groth strip (egs). we use a local densityindicator to probe the environment on few mpc scales and a group membercatalog, both of which make use of the deep2 spectroscopic redshift catalog, toquantify the environment of these galaxies.  we find that the local environment of lirgs and ulirgs is intermediatebetween that of blue and red galaxies. lirgs and ulirgs avoid underdenseenvironments and inhabit local environments that are more dense on average thanthose of other deep2 galaxies at similar redshifts. however, when thecomparison sample of the non-ir deep2 galaxies is restricted to have the samerange of stellar mass, color, or luminosity as the ir--galaxies, there is nolonger any significant difference in environment; the ir-galaxies follow thesame trends in the color-environment and luminosity-environment relationsobserved at z$\sim$1.  we also find that about 30% of the lirgs and ulirgs belong to groups,associated with a minimum dark matter halo of6$\times10^{12}$m$_{\odot}$h$^{-1}$. the group members constitute 20 % of thesources responsible for the ir star formation rate density and comoving energydensity at z$\sim$1.

0712.3121	the host galaxies and black holes of typical z~0.5-1.4 agn	we study the stellar and star formation (sf) properties of the host galaxiesof 58 x-ray selected agn in the goods portion of the chandra deep field south(cdf-s) region at z~0.5-1.4. the agn are selected such that their rest-frame uvto near-ir seds are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the agn emission 'contamination'. this agnpopulation comprises approximately 50% of the x-ray selected agn at theseredshifts. using models of stellar and dust emission we model their seds toderive stellar masses (m*) and total (uv+ir) star formation rates (sfr). agnreside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. theircharacteristic stellar masses (m*~7.8x10^10 msun and m*~1.2x10^11 msun atmedian z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of thex-ray selected agn population at these redshifts, and are intermediate betweenthose of local type 2 agn and high redshift (z~2) agn. the inferred black holemasses (mbh~ 2x10^8 msun) of typical agn are similar to those of opticallyidentified quasars at similar redshifts. since the agn in our sample are muchless luminous (l(2-10kev)&lt;10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical agn have loweddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). this suggests that, at least at intermediatez, the cosmic agn 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristicstellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. finallythere is no strong evidence in agn host galaxies for either highly suppressedsf (expected if agn played a role in quenching sf) or elevated sf when comparedto mass selected (i.e., irac-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses andredshifts. this may be explained by the fact that galaxies with m*~5x 10^10 -5x10^11 msun are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here.

1304.4227	discovery of lyman break galaxies at z~7 from the zfourge survey	star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;6 are likely responsible for thereionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of thesegalaxies. we present three candidates for z~7 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) froma 155 arcmin^2 area in the candels/cosmos field imaged by the deep fourstargalaxy evolution (zfourge) survey. the fourstar medium-band filters provide theequivalent of r~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 lbgsand brown dwarf stars. the distinction between stars and galaxies based on anobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using hst imaging; thereexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (fwhm~0.5-1 kpc) that isindistinguishable from a point source. the medium-band filters provide narrowerredshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. the uvluminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent withprevious studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (muv -21.6 mag)from z~7 to z~5. fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, wepredict lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest lbgs, and find thatthe presence of a lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux therebychanging the constraints on stellar masses and uv spectral slopes. thisillustrates the limitations of deriving lbg properties using only broad-bandphotometry. the derived specific star-formation rates for the bright lbgs are~13 per gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity lbgs, implying that thestar-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

1306.2634	detecting massive galaxies at high redshift using the dark energy survey	the dark energy survey (des) will be unprecedented in its ability to probeexceptionally large cosmic volumes to relatively faint optical limits.primarily designed for the study of comparatively low redshift (z&lt;2) galaxieswith the aim of constraining dark energy, an intriguing byproduct of the surveywill be the identification of massive (&gt;10^(12.0) m_sun) galaxies at z&gt;~4. thiswill greatly improve our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve. by bothpassively evolving the low redshift mass function and extrapolating theobserved high redshift mass function, we find that such galaxies should be rarebut nonetheless present at early times, with predicted number densities of~0.02 deg^-2. the unique combination of depth and coverage that des provideswill allow the identification of such galaxies should they exist - potentiallyidentifying hundreds of such sources. we then model possible high redshiftgalaxies and determine their detectability using the des filter sets anddepths. we model sources with a broad range stellar properties and find thatfor these galaxies to be detected they must be either sufficiently young, highmass and/or relatively dust free (e(b-v)&lt;0.45) - with these parameters jointlyaffecting each galaxy's detectability. we also propose colour-colour selectioncriteria for the identification of both pristine and dusty sources and findthat, although contamination fractions will be high, the most reliablecandidate massive high redshift galaxies are likely to be identifiable in thedes data through prioritisation of colour-selected sources.

1309.5384	spectroscopic needs for imaging dark energy experiments: photometric  redshift training and calibration	large sets of objects with spectroscopic redshift measurements will be neededfor imaging dark energy experiments to achieve their full potential, servingtwo goals:_training_, i.e., the use of objects with known redshift to developand optimize photometric redshift algorithms; and_calibration_, i.e., thecharacterization of moments of redshift (or photo-z error) distributions.better training makes cosmological constraints from a given experimentstronger, while highly-accurate calibration is needed for photo-z systematicsnot to dominate errors. in this white paper, we investigate the required scopeof spectroscopic datasets which can serve both these purposes for ongoing andnext-generation dark energy experiments, as well as the time required to obtainsuch data with instruments available in the next decade. large time allocationson kilo-object spectrographs will be necessary, ideally augmented by infraredspectroscopy from space. alternatively, precision calibrations could beobtained by measuring cross-correlation statistics using samples of brightobjects from a large baryon acoustic oscillation experiment such as desi. wealso summarize the additional work on photometric redshift methods needed toprepare for ongoing and future dark energy experiments.

1311.5559	candels+3d-hst: compact sfgs at z~2-3, the progenitors of the first  quiescent galaxies	we analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive(log(m/msun)&gt;10) compact star-forming galaxies (sfgs) at 2&lt;z&lt;3 to explorewhether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2. theoptical/nir and far-ir spitzer/herschel colors indicate that most compact sfgsare heavily obscured. nearly half (47%) host an x-ray bright agn. in contrast,only about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host agns. compact sfgshave centrally-concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similarto quiescent galaxies, and are thus strikingly different from other sfgs. mostcompact sfgs lie either within the sfr-m main sequence (65%) or below (30%), onthe expected evolutionary path towards quiescent galaxies. these results showconclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas anddust, quenching star formation. using extensive hst photometry from candels andgrism spectroscopy from the 3d-hst survey, we model their stellar populationswith either exponentially declining (tau) star formation histories (sfhs) orphysically-motivated sfhs drawn from semi-analytic models (sams). sams predictlonger formation timescales and older ages ~2 gyr, which are nearly twice asold as the estimates of the tau models. while both models yield good sed fits,sam sfhs better match the observed slope and zero point of the sfr-m mainsequence. some low-mass compact sfgs (log(m/msun)=10-10.6) have younger agesbut lower ssfrs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that thelow-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. if the progenitors of compactsfgs are extended sfgs, state-of-the-art sams show that mergers and diskinstabilities are both able to shrink galaxies, but disk instabilities are morefrequent (60% versus 40%) and form more concentrated galaxies. we confirm thisresult via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.

(2) for m&gt;=1e9 msunsystems, the average star formation rate (sfr) of strongly disturbed systems isonly modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies, in agreement withrecent simulations. in fact, over z~0.24 to 0.80, strongly disturbed systemsonly account for a small fraction (&lt;~30%) of the total sfr density. thissuggests that the behaviour of the cosmic sfr density over the last sevenbillion years is predominantly shaped by normal galaxies.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1503.00722	the role of bulge formation in the homogenization of stellar populations  at $z\sim2$ as revealed by internal color dispersion in candels	we use data from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations ofgalaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. we use theinternal color dispersion (icd), measured between the rest-frame uv and opticalbands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellarpopulations. the icd shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologiesof the galaxies. galaxies with the largest variation in their stellarpopulations as evidenced by high icd have disk-dominated morphologies (withs\'{e}rsic indexes $&lt; 2$) and stellar masses between $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot}&lt; 11$. there is a marked decrease in the icd as the stellar mass and/orthe s\'ersic index increases. by studying the relations between the icd andother galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, anddust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellarpopulations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-formingclumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. this phase reaches a peak forgalaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/ m_\odot}&lt; 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. in contrast,galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher s\'{e}rsic index ($n&gt; 2$) show reduced icd values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellarpopulations. this indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulgealong with a star forming disk, typical of hubble sequence galaxies, this ismost common for stellar masses $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot} &lt; 11$ and when thebulge component remains relatively small ($n&lt;2$).

1511.01988	radio galaxies in zfourge/nmbs: no difference in the properties of  massive galaxies with and without radio-agn out to z = 2.25	in order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass-distribution, someprocess must be responsible for the suppression of star-formation in the mostmassive of galaxies. commonly active galactic nuclei (agn) are invoked tofulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic ofmuch debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression andenhancement of star-formation in agn hosts. using the zfourge and nmbs galaxysurveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited(m$_{\odot}$ $\ge$ 10$^{10.5}$ m$_{\odot}$), high-luminosity (l$_{1.4}$ $&gt;$10$^{24}$ w hz$^{-1}$) sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei to aredshift of z = 2.25. in contrast to low redshift studies, which associateradio-agn activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z $&gt;$ 1.5radio-agn are hosted by star-forming galaxies. indeed, the stellar populationsof radio-agn are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistentwith the non-agn mass-similar galaxy population. interestingly, we find theradio-agn fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 $\le$ z $&lt;$2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-agn duty cycle has little dependence onredshift or galaxy type. we do however see a strong relation between theradio-agn fraction and stellar mass, with radio-agn becoming rare below $\sim$10$^{10.5}$ m$_{\odot}$ or a halo-mass of 10$^{12}$ m$_{\odot}$. this halo-massthreshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-agnfeedback at this mass limit. despite this we find that radio-agn hoststar-formation rates are consistent with the non-agn mass-similar galaxysample, suggesting that while radio-agn are in the right place to suppressstar-formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible fordoing so.

astro-ph;0506462	infrared luminosity functions from the chandra deep field south : the  spitzer view on the history of dusty star formation at 0&lt;z&lt;1	we analyze a sample of ~2600 mips/spitzer 24mic sources brighter than ~80mujyand located in the chandra deep field south to characterize the evolution ofthe comoving infrared (ir) energy density of the universe up to z~1. usingpublished ancillary optical data we first obtain a nearly complete redshiftdetermination for the 24mic objects associated with r&lt;24 counterparts at z&lt;1.we find that the 24mic population at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 is dominated by ``luminousinfrared galaxies'' (i.e., 10^11 l_sol &lt; l_ir &lt; 10^12 l_sol), the counterpartsof which appear to be also luminous at optical wavelengths and tend to be moremassive than the majority of optically-selected galaxies. we finally derive15mic and total ir luminosity functions (lfs) up to z~1. in agreement with theprevious results from iso and scuba and as expected from the mips source numbercounts, we find very strong evolution of the contribution of the ir-selectedpopulation with lookback time. pure evolution in density is firmly excluded bythe data, but we find considerable degeneracy between strict evolution inluminosity and a combination of increases in both density and luminosity (l*_irprop. to (1+z)^{3.2_{-0.2}^{+0.7}}, phi*_ir prop. to(1+z)^{0.7_{-0.6}^{+0.2}}). our results imply that the comoving ir energydensity of the universe evolves as (1+z)^(3.9+/-0.4) up to z~1 and thatgalaxies luminous in the infrared (i.e., l_ir &gt; 10^11 l_ir) are responsible for70+/-15% of this energy density at z~1. taking into account the contribution ofthe uv luminosity evolving as (1+z)^~2.5, we infer that these ir-luminoussources dominate the star-forming activity beyond z~0.7. the uncertaintiesaffecting these conclusions are largely dominated by the errors in thek-corrections used to convert 24mic fluxes into luminosities.

astro-ph;0511507	infrared power-law galaxies in the chandra deep field south: agn and  ulirgs	we investigate the nature of a sample of 92 spitzer/mips 24 micron selectedgalaxies in the cdfs, showing power law-like emission in the spitzer/irac 3.6-8micron bands. the main goal is to determine whether the galaxies not detectedin x-rays (47% of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population ofobscured agn not detected even in deep x-ray surveys. the majority of the irpower-law galaxies are ulirgs at z&gt;1, and those with lirg-like ir luminositiesare usually detected in x-rays. the optical to ir spectral energy distributions(seds) of the x-ray detected galaxies are almost equally divided between ablagn sed class (similar to an optically selected qso) and a nlagn sed (similarto the blagn sed but with an obscured uv/optical continuum). a small fractionof seds resemble warm ulirg galaxies (e.g., mrk231). most galaxies not detectedin x-rays have seds in the nlagn+ulirg class as they tend to be opticallyfainter, and possibly more obscured. moreover, the ir power-law galaxies haveseds significantly different from those of high-z (z_sp&gt;1) ir (24 micron)selected and optically bright (vvds i_ab&lt;=24) star-forming galaxies whose sedsshow a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron. the galaxies detected inx-rays have 2-8 kev rest-frame luminosities typical of agn. the galaxies notdetected in x-rays have global x-ray to mid-ir sed properties that make themgood candidates to contain ir bright x-ray absorbed agn. if all these sourcesare actually obscured agn, we would observe a ratio of obscured to unobscured24 micron detected agn of 2:1, whereas models predict a ratio of up to 3:1.additional studies using spitzer to detect x-ray-quiet agn are likely to findmore such obscured sources.

astro-ph;0602198	the agn contribution to the mid-ir emission of luminous infrared  galaxies	we determine the contribution of agn to the mid-ir emission of luminousinfrared galaxies (lirgs) at z&gt;0.6 by measuring the mid-ir dust continuum slopeof 20,039 mid-ir sources. the 24 micron sources are selected from aspitzer/mips survey of the noao deep wide-field survey bo\"otes field and havecorresponding 8 micron data from the irac shallow survey. there is a clearbimodal distribution in the 24 micron to 8 micron flux ratio. the x-raydetected sources fall within the peak corresponding to a flat spectrum innufnu, implying that it is populated by agn-dominated lirgs, whereas the peakcorresponding to a higher 24 micron to 8 micron flux ratio is likely due tolirgs whose infrared emission is powered by starbursts. the 24 micron emissionis increasingly dominated by agn at higher 24 micron flux densities (f_24): theagn fraction of the z&gt;0.6 sources increases from ~9% at f_24 ~ 0.35 mjy to74+/-20% at f_24 ~ 3 mjy in good agreement with model predictions. deep 24micron, small area surveys, like goods, will be strongly dominated by starburstgalaxies. agn are responsible for ~ 3-7% of the total 24 micron background.

astro-ph;0604530	evidence for tp-agb stars in high redshift galaxies, and their effect on  deriving stellar population parameters	we explore the effects of stellar population models on estimating starformation histories, ages and masses of high redshift galaxies. the focus is onthe thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) phase of stellarevolution, whose treatment is a source of major discrepancy among differentevolutionary population synthesis. in particular, besides the models usuallyadopted in the literature, we use models (by maraston 2005), in which thecontribution of the tp-agb phase is observationally calibrated and is thedominant source of near-ir energy for stellar populations in the age range 0.2to 2 gyr. we use a sample of high-z galaxies in the hudf, with spectroscopicredshifts, and spitzer irac and mips photometry from goods. we find that thetp-agb phase plays a key role in the interpretation of spitzer data for high-zgalaxies, when the rest-frame near-ir is sampled. when fitting without dustreddening, the models with the empirically-calibrated tp-agb phase alwaysreproduce better the observed spectral energy distributions (seds). allowingfor dust reddening improves the fits with literature models in some cases. inboth cases, the results from maraston models imply younger ages by factors upto 6 and lower stellar masses (by ~60 % on average). the observed strengths ofthe mguv spectral feature compare better to the predicted ones in the case ofthe maraston models, implying a better overall consistency of sed fitting.finally, we find that photometric redshifts improve significantly using thesemodels on the seds extending over the irac bands. this work provides the firstdirect evidence of tp-agb stars in the primeval universe.

astro-ph;0609002	does the agn unified model evolve with redshift? utilizing the x-ray  background to predict the mid-infrared emission of agn	deep x-ray surveys by chandra and xmm-newton have resolved about 80% of the2-10 kev cosmic extragalactic x-ray background (cxrb) into point sources, themajority of which are obscured agn. the obscuration might be connected toprocesses within the host galaxy, possibly the star-formation rate. here, weuse the results of cxrb synthesis calculations as input to detailed cloudysimulations in order to predict the evolution of agn properties at severalmid-ir wavelengths. computations were performed for three different evolutionsof the agn type 2/type 1 ratio between z=0 and 1: where the ratio increased as(1+z)^{0.9}, as (1+z)^{0.3} and one with no redshift evolution. models werecalculated with the inner radius of the absorbing gas and dust at 1 pc or at 10pc. comparing the results of the calculations to combined x-ray and spitzerdata of agn shows that the predicted spectral energy distributions are a gooddescription of average agns found in the deep surveys. the existing dataindicates that the mid-ir emission from an average agn is best described bymodels where the attenuating material is ~10 pc from the central engine. wepresent the expected spitzer cumulative number count distributions and theevolution of the total agn (type 1 + type 2) luminosity function (lf) betweenz=0 and 1 at rest-frame 8 microns and 30 microns for the three evolutionaryscenarios. the mid-ir agn lf will be an excellent tool to measure the evolutionof the covering factor of the gas and dust from z~0 to 1.

astro-ph;0701775	on the contribution of agn to the cosmic background radiation	we present the results of calculations of the cosmic agn background spectrumfrom 3 kev (4\times 10^{-4} microns) to 1000 microns. these computations makeuse of the measured x-ray luminosity function and its evolution, as well asfits from synthesis models of the cosmic x-ray background (cxb) to predict theagn contribution to the cosmic infrared background (cirb) for different modelsof the location and distribution of the absorbing material. by comparing ourresults to observational constraints we conclude that the current deep spitzersurveys can account for the entire agn contribution to the cirb at 24 microns,but these agn are almost all compton-thin. in fact, the calculations show thatcompton-thick agn are a small fraction of the cirb for \lambda &lt; 100 microns.for this reason, the most efficient method of identifying the compton-thick agnpopulation is through hard x-ray imaging at energies &gt;~ 40 kev. selection ofagn based on their rest-frame near-ir colors will miss low luminosity type 2agn due to contamination from the host galaxy. finally, the agn that dominatethe cxb must have star formation rates &lt; 100 m_{sun} yr^{-1}, consistent withthem having similar properties as the sources which dominate the cirb at z ~1.including the estimated re-radiated emission from star formation, agn and theirhost galaxies may contribute ~30% of the cirb at 70 microns, dropping to ~10%at 24 microns and ~1% at 1-10 microns.

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.

astro-ph;0703056	star formation in aegis field galaxies since z=1.1 . staged galaxy  formation, and a model of mass-dependent gas exhaustion	we analyze star formation (sf) as a function of stellar mass (m_*) andredshift z in the all wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis), for star-forming field galaxies with m_* &gt;~ 10^10 m_sun out to z=1.1.the data indicate that the high specific sf rates (sfr) of many less massivegalaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolvedgalaxies. they rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominantsf episode of galaxies, after which sf gradually declines on gyr timescales toz=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's m_*. with decreasing mass, this onset ofmajor sf shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (stagedgalaxy formation). this process may be an important component of the``downsizing'' phenomenon. we find that the predominantly gradual decline ofsfr (noeske et al. 2007, this volume) can be reproduced by exponential sfhistories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longere-folding times tau, and a later onset of sf (z_f). our model can provide afirst parametrization of sfr as a function of m_* and z, and quantifymass-dependences of tau and z_f, from direct observations of m_* and sfr up toz&gt;1. the observed evolution of sf in galaxies can plausibly reflect thedominance of gradual gas exhaustion. the data are also consistent with thehistory of cosmological accretion onto dark matter halos.
