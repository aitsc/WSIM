0707.0999	the census of nuclear activity of late-type galaxies in the virgo  cluster	the first spectroscopic census of agns associated to late-type galaxies inthe virgo cluster is carried on by observing 213 out of a complete set of 237galaxies more massive than m_dyn&gt;10^{8.5} solar masses. among them, 77 areclassified as agns (including 21 transition objects, 47 liners and 9 seyferts),and comprize 32% of the late-type galaxies in virgo. due to spectroscopicincompleteness at most 21 agns are missed in the survey, so that the fractionwould increase up to 41%. using corollary near-ir observations, that enable usto estimate galaxies dynamical masses, it is found that agns are hostedexclusively in massive galaxies, i.e. m_dyn\gsim 10^{10} solar masses. theirfrequency increases steeply with the dynamical mass from zero atm_dyn\approx10^{9.5} solar masses to virtually 1 at m_dyn&gt;10^{11.5} solarmasses. these frequencies are consistent with the ones of low luminosity agnsfound in the general field by the sdss. massive galaxies that harbor agnscommonly show conspicuous r-band star-like nuclear enhancements. converselythey often, but not necessarily contain massive bulges. few well known agns(e.g. m61, m100, ngc4535) are found in massive sc galaxies with little or nobulge. the agn fraction seems to be only marginally sensitive to galaxyenvironment. we infer the black hole masses using the known scaling relationsof quiescent black holes. no black holes lighter than $\sim 10^6$ \msol arefound active in our sample.

0908.3564	evolutionary paths to and from the red sequence: star formation and hi  properties of transition galaxies at z~0	(abridged) we investigate the properties of galaxies between the blue and thered sequence (i.e., the transition region) by combining uv and nir imaging tohi line observations for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. we confirmthe existence of a tight relation between colour and hi-fraction across all therange of colours, although outside the blue cloud this trend becomes graduallyweaker. transition galaxies are divided into two different families, accordingto their atomic hydrogen content. hi-deficient galaxies are the majority oftransition galaxies in our sample. they are found in high density environmentsand all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formationvia gas stripping. however, while the migration from the blue cloud isrelatively quick (i.e., &lt;=1 gyr), a longer amount of time (a few gyr at least)seems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the redsequence. at all masses, migrating hi-deficient galaxies are mainly disks,implying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusterscannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence athigh-redshift. conversely, hi-normal transition galaxies are a moreheterogeneous population. a fraction of these objects show evidence foraccretion/minor-merging events suggesting that at least part of the hireservoir has an external origin. the detailed evolution of such systems isstill unclear, but our analysis suggests that some galaxies might have migratedback from the red sequence after accretion events. our study clearly shows thevariety of evolutionary paths leading to the transition region and suggeststhat the transition galaxies may not be always associated with systems quicklymigrating from the blue to the red sequence.

0910.3521	high mass star formation in normal late-type galaxies: observational  constraints to the imf	we use halpha and fuv galex data for a large sample of nearby objects tostudy the high mass star formation activity of normal late-type galaxies. thedata are corrected for dust attenuation using the most accurate techniques atpresent available, namely the balmer decrement and the total far-infrared tofuv flux ratio. the sample shows a highly dispersed distribution in the halphato fuv flux ratio indicating that two of the most commonly used star formationtracers give star formation rates with uncertainties up to a factor of 2-3. thehigh dispersion is due to the presence of agn, where the uv and the halphaemission can be contaminated by nuclear activity, highly inclined galaxies, forwhich the applied extinction corrections are probably inaccurate, or starburstgalaxies, where the stationarity in the star formation history required fortransforming halpha and uv luminosities into star formation rates is notsatisfied. excluding these objects we reach an uncertainty of ~50% on the sfr.the halpha to fuv flux ratio increases with their total stellar mass. iflimited to normal star forming galaxies, however, this relationship reduces toa weak trend that might be totally removed using different extinctioncorrection recipes. in these objects the halpha to fuv flux ratio seems alsobarely related with the fuv-h colour, the h band effective surface brightness,the total star formation activity and the gas fraction. the data are consistentwith a kroupa and salpeter initial mass function in the high mass stellar rangeand imply, for a salpeter imf, that the variations of the slope cannot exceed0.25, from g=2.35 for massive galaxies to g=2.60 in low luminosity systems. weshow however that these observed trends, if real, can be due to the differentmicro history of star formation in massive galaxies with respect to dwarf.

1001.0980	diffuse far-infrared and ultraviolet emission in the ngc4435/4438  system: tidal stream or galactic cirrus?	we report the discovery of diffuse far-infrared and far-ultraviolet emissionprojected near the interacting pair ngc4435/4438, in the virgo cluster. thisfeature spatially coincides with a well known low surface-brightness opticalplume, usually interpreted as tidal debris. if extragalactic, this stream wouldrepresent not only one of the clearest examples of intracluster dust, but alsoa rare case of intracluster molecular hydrogen and large-scale intraclusterstar formation. however, the ultraviolet, far-infrared, hi and co emission aswell as the dynamics of this feature are extremely unusual for tidal streamsbut are typical of galactic cirrus clouds. in support to the cirrus scenario,we show that a strong spatial correlation between far-infrared andfar-ultraviolet cirrus emission is observed across the center of the virgocluster, over a scale of several degrees. this study demonstrates how dramaticgalactic cirrus contamination can be, even at optical and ultravioletwavelengths and at high galactic latitudes. if ignored, the presence of diffuselight scattered by galactic dust clouds could significantly bias ourinterpretation of low surface-brightness features and diffuse light observedaround galaxies and in clusters of galaxies.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1102.1316	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics). i: the uv  luminosity function of the central 12 sq.deg	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics) is a complete blindsurvey of the virgo cluster covering about 40 sq. deg. in the far uv (fuv,lambda_eff=1539a, delta-lambda=442a) and about 120 sq. deg. in the near uv(nuv, lambda_eff=2316a, delta-lambda=1060a). the goal of the survey is to studythe ultraviolet (uv) properties of galaxies in a rich cluster environment,spanning a wide luminosity range from giants to dwarfs, and regardless of priorknowledge of their star formation activity. the uv data will be combined withthose in other bands (optical: ngvs; far-infrared - submm: hevics; hi: alfalfa)and with our multizone chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution tomake a complete and exhaustive study of the effects of the environment on theevolution of galaxies in high density regions. we present here the scientificobjectives of the survey, describing the observing strategy and brieflydiscussing different data reduction techniques. using uv data already in-handfor the central 12 sq. deg. we determine the fuv and nuv luminosity functionsof the virgo cluster core for all cluster members and separately for early- andlate-type galaxies and compare it to the one obtained in the field and othernearby clusters (coma, a1367). this analysis shows that the fuv and nuvluminosity functions of the core of the virgo clusters are flatter (alpha about-1.1) than those determined in coma and a1367. we discuss the possible originof this difference

1103.5889	the effect of the environment on the hi scaling relations	we use a volume-, magnitude-limited sample of nearby galaxies to investigatethe effect of the environment on the hi scaling relations. we confirm that thehi-to-stellar mass ratio anti correlates with stellar mass, stellar masssurface density and nuv-r colour across the whole range of parameters coveredby our sample (10^9 &lt;m*&lt;10^11 msol, 7.5 &lt;mu*&lt;9.5 msol kpc^-2, 2&lt;nuv-r&lt;6 mag).these scaling relations are also followed by galaxies in the virgo cluster,although they are significantly offset towards lower gas content.interestingly, the difference between field and cluster galaxies graduallydecreases moving towards massive, bulge-dominated systems. by comparing ourdata with the predictions of chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxyevolution, we show that starvation alone cannot explain the low gas content ofvirgo spirals and that only ram-pressure stripping is able to reproduce ourfindings. finally, motivated by previous studies, we investigate the use of aplane obtained from the relations between the hi-to-stellar mass ratio, stellarmass surface density and nuv-r colour as a proxy for the hi deficiencyparameter. we show that the distance from the `hi gas fraction plane' can beused as an alternative estimate for the hi deficiency, but only if carefullycalibrated on pre-defined samples of `unperturbed' systems.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

1204.0785	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga) ii: dust and  gas in andromeda	we present an analysis of the dust and gas in andromeda, using herschelimages sampling the entire far-infrared peak. we fit a modified-blackbody modelto ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140pc and findthat a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. wefind no significant long-wavelength excess above this model suggesting there isno cold dust component. we show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially,increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10kpc,consistent with the metallicity gradient. in the 10kpc ring the average beta is~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the milky way (mw). however,in contrast to the mw, we find significant radial variations in beta, whichincreases from 1.9 at 10kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1kpc and then decreases to1.7 in the center. the dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10kpc ring(ranging from 17-20k), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30k. within3.1kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 micronflux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominantsource of dust heating there. at larger radii, there is a weak correlationbetween the star formation rate and dust temperature. we find no evidence for'dark gas' in m31 in contrast to recent results for the mw. finally, weobtained an estimate of the co x-factor by minimising the dispersion in thegas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9+/-0.4)x10^20 cm^-2 [k kms^-1]^-1.

1206.1130	the galex view of the herschel reference survey - ultraviolet structural  properties of nearby galaxies	we present galex far-ultraviolet (fuv) and near-ultraviolet (nuv) as well assdss g, r, i photometry and structural parameters for the herschel referencesurvey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies in differentenvironments. we use this unique dataset to investigate the ultraviolet (uv)structural scaling relations of nearby galaxies and to determine how theproperties of the uv disk vary with atomic hydrogen content and environment. wefind a clear change of slope in the stellar mass vs. effective surfacebrightness relation when moving from the optical to the uv, with more massivegalaxies having brighter optical but fainter uv surface brightnesses thansmaller systems. a similar change of slope is also seen in the radius vs.surface brightness relation. by comparing our observations with the predictionsof a simple multi-zone chemical model of galaxy evolution, we show that thesefindings are a natural consequence of a much more efficient inside-out growthof the stellar disk in massive galaxies. we confirm that isophotal radii arealways a better proxy for the size of the stellar/star-forming disk thaneffective quantities and we show that the extent of the uv disk (normalized tothe optical size) is strongly correlated to the integrated hi gas fraction.this relation still holds even when cluster spirals are considered, withhi-deficient systems having less extended star-forming disks than hi-normalgalaxies. interestingly, the star formation in the inner part of hi-deficientgalaxies is significantly less affected by the removal of the atomic hydrogen,as expected in a simple ram-pressure stripping scenario. these results suggestthat it is the amount of hi that regulates the growth of the star-forming diskin the outskirts of galaxies.

1207.4191	the role of cold gas and environment on the stellar mass - metallicity  relation of nearby galaxies	we investigate the relationship between stellar mass, metallicity and gascontent for a magnitude- and volume-limited sample of 260 nearby late-typegalaxies in different environments, from isolated galaxies to virgo clustermembers. we derive oxygen abundance estimates using new integrated, drift-scanoptical spectroscopy and the base metallicity calibrations of kewley &amp; ellison(2008). combining these measurements with ultraviolet to near-infraredphotometry and hi 21 cm line observations, we examine the relations betweenstellar mass, metallicity, gas mass fraction and star formation rate. we findthat, at fixed stellar mass, galaxies with lower gas fractions typically alsopossess higher oxygen abundances. we also observe a relationship between gasfraction and metal content, whereby gas-poor galaxies are typically moremetal-rich, and demonstrate that the removal of gas from the outskirts ofspirals increases the observed average metallicity by approximately 0.1 dex.although some cluster galaxies are gas-deficient objects, statistically thestellar-mass metallicity relation is nearly invariant to the environment, inagreement with recent studies. these results indicate that internalevolutionary processes, rather than environmental effects, play a key role inshaping the stellar mass-metallicity relation. in addition, we presentmetallicity estimates based on observations of 478 nearby galaxies.

1208.4256	variations in the galactic star formation rate and density thresholds  for star formation	the conversion of gas into stars is a fundamental process in astrophysics andcosmology. stars are known to form from the gravitational collapse of denseclumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it has been proposed that theresulting star formation rate is proportional to either the amount of massabove a threshold gas surface density, or the gas volume density. thesestar-formation prescriptions appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in ourmilky way galaxy's disk as well as in distant galaxies where the star formationrates are often much larger. the inner 500 pc of our galaxy, the centralmolecular zone (cmz), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surfacedensity molecular gas in the milky way, providing an environment where thevalidity of star-formation prescriptions can be tested. here we show that byseveral measures, the current star formation rate in the cmz is anorder-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently acceptedprescriptions. in particular, the region 1 deg &lt; l &lt; 3.5 deg, |b| &lt; 0.5 degcontains ~10^7 msun of dense molecular gas -- enough to form 1000 orion-likeclusters -- but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is onlyequivalent to that in orion. in addition to density, another property ofmolecular clouds, such as the amplitude of turbulent motions, must be includedin the star-formation prescription to predict the star formation rate in agiven mass of molecular gas.

0801.2113	the origin of dwarf ellipticals in the virgo cluster	we study the evolution of dwarf (l_h &lt; 10^{9.6} l_ho) star forming andquiescent galaxies in the virgo cluster by comparing their uv to radiocentimetric properties to the predictions of multizone chemo-spectrophotometricmodels of galaxy evolution especially tuned to take into account theperturbations induced by the interaction with the cluster intergalactic medium.our models simulate one or multiple ram pressure stripping events and galaxystarvation. models predict that all star forming dwarf galaxies entering thecluster for the first time loose most, if not all, of their atomic gas content,quenching on short time scales (&lt; 150 myr) their activity of star formation.these dwarf galaxies soon become red and quiescent, gas metal-rich objects withspectrophotometric and structural properties similar to those of dwarfellipticals. young, low luminosity, high surface brightness star forminggalaxies such as late-type spirals and bcds are probably the progenitors ofrelatively massive dwarf ellipticals, while it is likely that low surfacebrightness magellanic irregulars evolve into very low surface brightnessquiescent objects hardly detectable in ground based imaging surveys. the smallnumber of dwarf galaxies with physical properties intermediate between those ofstar forming and quiescent systems is consistent with a rapid (&lt; 1 gyr)transitional phase between the two dwarf galaxies populations. these results,combined with statistical considerations, are consistent with the idea thatmost of the dwarf ellipticals dominating the faint end of the virgo luminosityfunction were initially star forming systems, accreted by the cluster andstripped of their gas by one or subsequent ram pressure stripping events.

1402.3597	dust spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies: an insight from  the herschel reference survey	we gather infrared (ir) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (spitzer,wise, iras and herschel) for all of the hrs galaxies. draine &amp; li (2007) modelsare fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefullyremoved. we find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain allof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 micronsrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of thephoto-dissociation regions to the ir sed. the sed models tend to systematicallyunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low masssystems. we provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimumintensity of the interstellar radiation field (isrf), the fraction of pah, therelative contribution of pdr and evolved stellar population to the dustheating, the $m_{dust}$ and the $l_{ir}$. for a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated propertiesof galaxies, such as $m_*$, sfr, metallicity, h$\alpha$ and h-band surfacebrightness, and the fuv attenuation. a good correlation between the fraction ofpah and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the pah emission ingalaxies with low metallicities. the intensity of the irsf and the h-band andh$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dustcomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and thediffuse evolved population. we use these results to provide a new set of irtemplates calibrated with herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a meansed template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. for thesame purpose, we put our sample on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram. the templates arecompared to the most popular ir sed libraries, enlightening a large discrepancybetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.

1409.1815	the identification of dust heating mechanisms in nearby galaxies using  herschel 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness ratios	we examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightnessratios within 24 nearby (&lt;30 mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with theherschel space observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emittingat these wavelengths. the analysis consisted of both qualitative andquantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 micron ratios to h alphaand 24 micron surface brightnesses, which trace the light from star formingregions, and 3.6 micron emission, which traces the light from the older stellarpopulations of the galaxies. we find broad variations in the heating mechanismsfor the dust. in one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at&lt;=160 microns (and in rare cases potentially at &lt;=350 microns) originates fromdust heated by star forming regions. in another subset, we found that theemission at &gt;=250 microns (and sometimes at &gt;=160 microns) originates from dustheated by the older stellar population. in the rest of the sample, either theresults are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contributeequally to the global dust heating. the observed variations in dust heatingmechanisms does not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emissionand radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dusttemperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability indust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.

1410.3931	the sami galaxy survey: towards a unified dynamical scaling relation for  galaxies of all types	we take advantage of the first data from the sydney-aao multi-object integralfield (sami) galaxy survey to investigate the relation between the kinematicsof gas and stars, and stellar mass in a comprehensive sample of nearbygalaxies. we find that all 235 objects in our sample, regardless of theirmorphology, lie on a tight relation linking stellar mass ($m_{*}$) to internalvelocity quantified by the $s_{0.5}$ parameter, which combines the contributionof both dispersion ($\sigma$) and rotational velocity ($v_{rot}$) to thedynamical support of a galaxy ($s_{0.5}=\sqrt{0.5v_{rot}^{2}+\sigma^{2}}$). ourresults are independent of the baryonic component from which $\sigma$ and$v_{rot}$ are estimated, as the $s_{0.5}$ of stars and gas agree remarkablywell. this represents a significant improvement compared to the canonical$m_{*}$ vs. $v_{rot}$ and $m_{*}$ vs. $\sigma$ relations. not only is no samplepruning necessary, but also stellar and gas kinematics can be usedsimultaneously, as the effect of asymmetric drift is taken into account once$v_{rot}$ and $\sigma$ are combined. our findings illustrate how thecombination of dispersion and rotational velocities for both gas and stars canprovide us with a single dynamical scaling relation valid for galaxies of allmorphologies across at least the stellar mass range8.5$&lt;log(m_{*}/m_{\odot})&lt;$11. such relation appears to be more general and atleast as tight as any other dynamical scaling relation, representing a uniquetool for investigating the link between galaxy kinematics and baryonic content,and a less biased comparison with theoretical models.

1411.3960	the herschel virgo cluster survey. xviii. star-forming dwarf galaxies in  a cluster environment	to assess the effects of the cluster environment on the different componentsof the interstellar medium, we analyse the fir-submm properties of a sample ofstar-forming dwarf (sfd) galaxies detected by the herschel virgo cluster survey(hevics). we determine dust masses and dust temperatures by fitting a modifiedblack body (mbb) function to the spectral energy distributions (seds). stellarand gas masses, star formation rates (sfrs), and metallicities are obtainedfrom the analysis of a set of ancillary data. dust is detected in 49 out of 140optically identified dwarfs covered by the hevics field; considering onlydwarfs brighter than $m_b$ = 18 mag, this gives a detection rate of 43%. afterevaluating different emissivity indices, we find that the fir-submm seds arebest-fit by $\beta$=1.5, with a median dust temperature $t_d$ = 22.4 k.assuming $\beta$=1.5, 67% of the 23 galaxies detected in all five herschelbands show emission at 500 $\mu$m in excess of the mbb model. the excess isinversely correlated with sfr and stellar masses. to study the variations inthe global properties of our sample due to environmental effects, we comparethe virgo sfds to other herschel surveys, such as kingfish, the dwarf galaxysurvey (dgs), and the hevics bright galaxy catalogue (bgc). we explore therelations between stellar mass and hi fraction, specific sfr, dust fraction,gas-to-dust ratio over a wide range of stellar masses. highly hi-deficientvirgo dwarf galaxies are mostly characterised by quenched star formationactivity and lower dust fractions giving hints for dust stripping in clusterdwarfs. however, we find that the fraction of dust removed has to be less thanthat of the hi component. since the virgo sfds are likely to be crossing thecluster for the first time, a longer timescale might be necessary to strip themore centrally concentrated dust distribution.

1505.03150	ngc4370: a case study for testing our ability to infer dust distribution  and mass in nearby galaxies	a fraction of the early-type galaxy population hosts a prominent dust lane.methods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imagingdata usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dustmasses derived from the observed fir emission. high-quality optical data fromthe next generation virgo cluster survey (ngvs) and fir/submm observations fromthe herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics) allow us to revisit previous methodsto determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones. we aim toderive the dust mass in ngc 4370 from both optical and fir data, andinvestigate the need to invoke a putative diffuse dust component. we createcolor and attenuation maps, which are converted to approximate dust mass mapsbased on simple dust geometries. dust masses are also derived from sed fits tofir/submm observations. finally, inverse radiative transfer fitting isperformed to investigate more complex dust geometries. the empirical methodsapplied to the optical data yield lower limits of 3.4e5 solar masses, an orderof magnitude below the total dust masses derived from sed fitting. in contrast,radiative transfer models yield dust masses which are slightly lower, but fullyconsistent with the fir-derived mass. dust is more likely to be distributed ina ring around the centre of ngc 4370 as opposed to an exponential disc or asimple foreground screen. moreover, using inverse radiative transfer fitting,we are able to constrain most of the parameters describing these geometries.the resulting dust masses are high enough to account for the dust observed atfir/submm wavelengths, so that no diffuse dust component needs to be invoked.we furthermore caution for the interpretation of dust masses and optical depthsbased on optical data alone, using overly simplistic star-dust geometries andthe neglect of scattering effects.

1507.05432	linking dust emission to fundamental properties in galaxies: the  low-metallicity picture	in this work, we aim at providing a consistent analysis of the dustproperties from metal-poor to metal-rich environments by linking them tofundamental galactic parameters. we consider two samples of galaxies: the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs) and kingfish, totalling 109 galaxies, spanning almost 2 dexin metallicity. we collect infrared (ir) to submillimetre (submm) data for bothsamples and present the complete data set for the dgs sample. we model theobserved spectral energy distributions (sed) with a physically-motivated dustmodel to access the dust properties. using a different sed model (modifiedblackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage atsubmm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factortwo to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligiblesystematic modelling uncertainties. for eight galaxies in our sample, we find arather small excess at 500 microns (&lt; 1.5 sigma). we find that the dust sed oflow-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths comparedto more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. thepah mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be drivenmostly by the specific star-formation rate, ssfr, with secondary effects frommetallicity. the correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-irluminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.the dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studiedtrend of decreasing ratio for decreasing ssfr. the relation is more complex forhighly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemicalevolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio). dust growthprocesses in the ism play a key role in the dust mass build-up with respect tothe stellar content at high ssfr and low metallicity.

1509.05171	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics). vi: the uv  luminosity function of the virgo cluster and its surrounding regions	we use the galex data of the guvics survey to construct the nuv luminosityfunction of the virgo cluster over ~ 300 deg.2, an area covering the clusterand its surrounding regions up to ~ 1.8 virial radii. the nuv luminosityfunction is also determined for galaxies of different morphological type andnuv-i colour, and for the different substructures within the cluster. theseluminosity functions are robust vs. statistical corrections since based on asample of 833 galaxies mainly identified as cluster members with spectroscopicredshift (808) or high-quality optical scaling relations (10). we fit theseluminosity functions with a schechter function, and compare the fittedparameters with those determined for other nearby clusters and for the field.the faint end slope of the virgo nuv luminosity function (alpha = -1.19), heresampled down to ~ nuv = -11.5 mag, is significantly flatter than the onemeasured in other nearby clusters and similar to the field one. similarly m* =-17.56 is one-to-two magnitudes fainter than measured in coma, a1367, theshapley supercluster, and the field. these differences seem due to the quiteuncertain statistical corrections and the small range in absolute magnitudesampled in these clusters. we do not observe strong systematic differences inthe overall nuv luminosity function of the core of the cluster with respect tothat of its periphery. we notice, however, that the relative contribution ofred-to-blue galaxies at the faint end is inverted, with red quiescent objectsdominating the core of the cluster and star forming galaxies dominating beyondone virial radius. these observational evidences are discussed in the frameworkof galaxy evolution in dense environments.

0807.3282	the origin of the mu_e - m_b and kormendy relations in dwarf elliptical  galaxies	the present work is aimed at studying the distribution of galaxies ofdifferent types and luminosities along different structural scaling relationsto see whether massive and dwarf ellipticals have been shaped by the sameformation process. this exercise is here done by comparing the distribution ofvirgo cluster massive and dwarf ellipticals and star forming galaxies along theb band effective surface brightness and effective radius vs. absolute magnituderelations and the kormendy relation to the predictions of models tracing theeffects of ram-pressure stripping on disc galaxies entering the clusterenvironment and galaxy harassment. dwarf ellipticals might have been formedfrom low luminosity, late-type spirals that recently entered into the clusterand lost their gas because of a ram-pressure stripping event, stopping theiractivity of star formation. the perturbations induced by the abrupt decrease ofthe star formation activity are sufficient to modify the structural propertiesof disc galaxies into those of dwarf ellipticals. galaxy harassment induce atruncation of the disc and generally an increase of the effective surfacebrightness of the perturbed galaxies. the lack of dynamical simulations ofperturbed galaxies spanning a wide range in luminosity prevents us to drive anyfirm conclusion on a possible harassment-induced origin of the low surfacebrightness dwarf elliptical galaxy population inhabiting the virgo cluster.although the observed scaling relations are consistent with the idea that thedistribution of elliptical galaxies along the mentioned scaling relation isjust due to a gradual variation with luminosity of the sersic index n, thecomparison with models indicates that dwarf ellipticals might have been formedby a totally different process than giant ellipticals

astro-ph;0603826	witnessing galaxy preprocessing in the local universe: the case of a  star-bursting group falling into abell 1367	we present a multiwavelength analysis of a compact group of galaxiesinfalling at high speed into the dynamically young cluster abell 1367. peculiarmorphologies and unusually high halpha emission are associated with two giantgalaxies and at least ten dwarfs/extragalactic hii regions, making this groupthe region with the highest density of star formation activity ever observed inthe local clusters. moreover halpha imaging observations reveal extraordinarycomplex trails of ionized gas behind the galaxies, with projected lengthsexceeding 150 kpc. these unique cometary trails mark the gaseous trajectory ofgalaxies, witnessing their dive into the hot cluster intergalactic medium.under the combined action of tidal forces among group members and theram-pressure by the cluster ambient medium, the group galaxies were fragmentedand the ionized gas was blown out. the properties of this group suggest thatenvironmental effects within infalling groups may have represented apreprocessing step of the galaxy evolution during the high redshift clusterassembly phase.

astro-ph;0607452	the arecibo galaxy environment survey: precursor observations of the ngc  628 group	the arecibo galaxy environment survey (ages) is one of several hi surveysutilising the new arecibo l-band feed array (alfa) fitted to the 305m radiotelescope at arecibo. the survey is specifically designed to investigatevarious galactic environments to higher sensitivity, higher velocity resolutionand higher spatial resolution than previous fully sampled, 21 cm multibeamsurveys. the emphasis is on making detailed observations of nearby objectsalthough the large system bandwidth (100 mhz) will allow us to quantify the hiproperties over a large instantaneous velocity range.  in this paper we describe the survey and its goals and present the resultsfrom the precursor observations of a 5 degree x 1 degree region containing thenearby (~10 mpc) ngc 628 group. we have detected all the group galaxies in theregion including the low mass (m{hi}~10^7mo) dwarf, dw0137+1541 (briggs, 1986).the fluxes and velocities for these galaxies compare well with previouslypublished data. there is no intra-group neutral gas detected down to a limitingcolumn density of 2x10^{18}cm^{-2}. in addition to the group galaxies we havedetected 22 galaxies beyond the ngc 628 group, 9 of which are previouslyuncatalogued.(abridged)

astro-ph;0609020	the fate of spiral galaxies in clusters: the star formation history of  the anemic virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4569	we present a new method for studying the star formation history of late-type,cluster galaxies undergoing gas starvation or a ram-pressure stripping event bycombining bidimensional multifrequency observations with multi-zones models ofgalactic chemical and spectrophotometricevolution. this method is applied tothe virgo cluster anemic galaxy ngc 4569. we extract radial profiles fromrecently obtained uv galex images at 1530 and 2310 a, from visible and near-irnarrow (halpha) and broad band images at different wavelengths (u, b, g, v, r,i, z, j, h, k), from spitzer irac and mips images and from atomic and moleculargas maps. the model in the absence of interaction (characterized by itsrotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed h bandlight profile and by the halpha rotation curve. we can reconstruct the observedtotal-gas radial-density profile and the light surface-brightness profiles atall wavelengths in a ram-pressure stripping scenario by making simpleassumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of ngc 4569 inside thecluster. the observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gasinfall, thus mimicing starvation. gas removal is required, which is moreefficient in the outer disk, inducing a radial quenching in the star formationactivity, as observed and reproduced by the model. this observational result,consistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy-cluster igm interactionis able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitationalperturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticulars inclusters.

0811.1554	galaxies appear simpler than expected	galaxies are complex systems the evolution of which apparently results fromthe interplay of dynamics, star formation, chemical enrichment, and feedbackfrom supernova explosions and supermassive black holes. the hierarchical theoryof galaxy formation holds that galaxies are assembled from smaller pieces,through numerous mergers of cold dark matter. the properties of an individualgalaxy should be controlled by six independent parameters including mass,angular-momentum, baryon-fraction, age and size, as well as by the accidents ofits recent haphazard merger history. here we report that a sample of galaxiesthat were first detected through their neutral hydrogen radio-frequencyemission, and are thus free of optical selection effects, shows fiveindependent correlations among six independent observables, despite having awide range of properties. this implies that the structure of these galaxiesmust be controlled by a single parameter, although we cannot identify thisparameter from our dataset. such a degree of organisation appears to be at oddswith hierarchical galaxy formation, a central tenet of the cold dark matterparadigm in cosmology.
