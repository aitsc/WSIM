0908.3824	search for gravitational-wave bursts associated with gamma-ray bursts  using data from ligo science run 5 and virgo science run 1	we present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts associatedwith 137 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) that were detected by satellite-basedgamma-ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo sciencerun. the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007october 1, and most of the grb triggers were from the swift satellite. thesearch uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account thedifferent locations and orientations of the interferometers at the threeligo-virgo sites. we find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signalsassociated with this sample of grbs. using simulated short-duration (&lt;1 s)waveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational wavesassociated with each grb. we also place lower bounds on the distance to eachgrb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves,with typical limits of d ~ 15 mpc (e_gw^iso / 0.01 m_o c^2)^1/2 for emission atfrequencies around 150 hz, where the ligo-virgo detector network has bestsensitivity. we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of theseresults, and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo-virgoruns.

0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1208.3368	high-redshift cool-core galaxy clusters detected via the  sunyaev--zel'dovich effect in the south pole telescope survey	we report the first investigation of cool-core properties of galaxy clustersselected via their sunyaev--zel'dovich (sz) effect. we use 13 galaxy clustersuniformly selected from 178 deg^2 observed with the south pole telescope (spt)and followed up by the chandra x-ray observatory. they form an approximatelymass-limited sample (&gt; 3 x 10^14 m_sun h^-1_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 &lt; z &lt;1.1. using previously published x-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare twoproxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (csb) andcuspiness ({\alpha}). we find that csb is better constrained. we measure csbfor the spt sample and find several new z &gt; 0.5 cool-core clusters, includingtwo strong cool cores. this rules out the hypothesis that there are no z &gt; 0.5clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4{\sigma} level. thefraction of strong cool-core clusters in the spt sample in this redshift regimeis between 7% and 56% (95% confidence). although the spt selection function issignificantly different from the x-ray samples, the high-z csb distribution forthe spt sample is statistically consistent with that of x-ray-selected samplesat both low and high redshifts. the cool-core strength is inversely correlatedwith the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the x-ray centroid,providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength ofthe cluster. larger sz-selected samples will be crucial in understanding theevolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.

1312.3015	measurement of galaxy cluster integrated comptonization and mass scaling  relations with the south pole telescope	we describe a method for measuring the integrated comptonization (ysz) ofclusters of galaxies from measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect inmultiple frequency bands and use this method to characterize a sample of galaxyclusters detected in south pole telescope (spt) data. we test this method onsimulated cluster observations and verify that it can accurately recovercluster parameters with negligible bias. in realistic simulations of anspt-like survey, with realizations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy,point sources, and atmosphere and instrumental noise at typical spt-sz surveylevels, we find that ysz is most accurately determined in an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size. we demonstrate the utility of this method tomeasure ysz and to constrain mass scaling relations using x-ray mass estimatesfor a sample of 18 galaxy clusters from the spt-sz survey. measuring ysz withina 0.75' radius aperture, we find an intrinsic log-normal scatter of 21+/-11% inysz at a fixed mass. measuring ysz within a 0.3 mpc projected radius(equivalent to 0.75' at the survey median redshift z = 0.6), we find a scatterof 26+/-9%. prior to this study, the spt observable found to have the lowestscatter with mass was cluster detection significance. we demonstrate, from bothsimulations and spt observed clusters, that ysz measured within an aperturecomparable to the spt beam size is equivalent, in terms of scatter with clustermass, to spt cluster detection significance.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1412.7823	baryon content of massive galaxy clusters (0.57 &lt; z &lt; 1.33)	we study the stellar, brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) and intracluster medium(icm) masses of 14 south pole telescope (spt) selected galaxy clusters withmedian redshift $z=0.9$ and median mass $m_{500}=6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. weestimate stellar masses for each cluster and bcg using six photometric bandsspanning the range from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared observed with thevlt, hst and spitzer. the icm masses are derived from chandra and xmm-newtonx-ray observations, and the virial masses are derived from the sptsunyaev-zel'dovich effect signature.  at $z=0.9$ the bcg mass $m_{\star}^{\textrm{bcg}}$ constitutes $0.12\pm0.01$%of the halo mass for a $6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$ cluster, and this fractionfalls as $m_{500}^{-0.58\pm0.07}$. the cluster stellar mass function has acharacteristic mass $m_{0}=10^{11.0\pm0.1}m_{\odot}$, and the number ofgalaxies per unit mass in clusters is larger than in the field by a factor$1.65\pm0.2$. both results are consistent with measurements on group scales andat lower redshift. we combine our spt sample with previously published samplesat low redshift that we correct to a common initial mass function and forsystematic differences in virial masses. we then explore mass and redshifttrends in the stellar fraction (fstar), the icm fraction (ficm), the coldbaryon fraction (fc) and the baryon fraction (fb). at a pivot mass of$6\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$ and redshift $z=0.9$, the characteristic values arefstar=$1.1\pm0.1$%, ficm=$9.6\pm0.5$%, fc=$10.4\pm1.2$% and fb=$10.7\pm0.6$%.these fractions all vary with cluster mass at high significance, indicatingthat higher mass clusters have lower fstar and fc and higher ficm and fb. whenaccounting for a 15% systematic virial mass uncertainty, there is nostatistically significant redshift trend at fixed mass in these baryonfractions.

1504.03002	wide-field lensing mass maps from des science verification data:  methodology and detailed analysis	weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distributionof the projected mass density across the sky. these "mass maps" provide apowerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and darkmatter. in this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed fromshear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the dark energy survey (des)science verification (sv) data. we compare the distribution of mass with thatof the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. the overdensities inthe reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of opticallydetected clusters. we demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids alongthe line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of thecluster photometric redshifts. we cross-correlate the mass map with aforeground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data. our measurementgives results consistent with mock catalogs from n-body simulations thatinclude the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy,lensing, and photo-z catalogs. the statistical significance of thecross-correlation is at the 6.8-sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. amajor goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from avariety of sources, including psf and photo-z uncertainties. we make mapsderived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find theprincipal components. we find that the contribution of systematics to thelensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. in this work,we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the des; thetools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied toforthcoming larger datasets from the survey.

1512.04317	the xxl survey: i. scientific motivations - xmm-newton observing plan -  follow-up observations and simulation programme	we present the xxl survey, the largest xmm programme totaling some 6.9 ms todate and involving an international consortium of roughly 100 members. the xxlsurvey covers two extragalactic areas of 25 deg2 each at a point-sourcesensitivity of ~ 5e-15 erg/sec/cm2 in the [0.5-2] kev band (completenesslimit). the survey's main goals are to provide constraints on the dark energyequation of state from the space-time distribution of clusters of galaxies andto serve as a pathfinder for future, wide-area x-ray missions. we reviewscience objectives, including cluster studies, agn evolution, and large-scalestructure, that are being conducted with the support of approximately 30follow-up programmes. we describe the 542 xmm observations along with theassociated multi-lambda and numerical simulation programmes. we give a detailedaccount of the x-ray processing steps and describe innovative tools beingdeveloped for the cosmological analysis. the paper provides a thoroughevaluation of the x-ray data, including quality controls, photon statistics,exposure and background maps, and sky coverage. source catalogue constructionand multi-lambda associations are briefly described. this material will be thebasis for the calculation of the cluster and agn selection functions, criticalelements of the cosmological and science analyses. the xxl multi-lambda dataset will have a unique lasting legacy value for cosmological and extragalacticstudies and will serve as a calibration resource for future dark energy studieswith clusters and other x-ray selected sources. with the present article, werelease the xmm xxl photon and smoothed images along with the correspondingexposure maps. the xmm xxl observation list (table b.1) is available inelectronic form at the cds. the present paper is the first in a seriesreporting results of the xxl-xmm survey.

1512.04535	cross-correlation of gravitational lensing from des science verification  data with spt and planck lensing	we measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and ofthe cosmic microwave background (cmb). the effects of gravitational lensing ondifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same massfluctuations. we use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the darkenergy survey (des) science verification data and overlapping cmb lensing fromthe south pole telescope (spt) and planck. the des source galaxies have amedian redshift of $z_{\rm med} {\sim} 0.7$, while the cmb lensing kernel isbroad and peaks at $z{\sim}2$. the resulting cross-correlation is maximallysensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\sim}0.44$. assuming the planck 2015best-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the des$\times$spt cross-power is found tobe $a = 0.88 \pm 0.30$ and that from des$\times$planck to be $a = 0.86 \pm0.39$, where $a=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. these areconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\sigma$ and $2.2 \sigma$ respectively. we demonstrate that our results arerobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shearmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and cmblensing systematics. significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes wouldincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate avalue of $a = 1.08 \pm 0.36$ for des$\times$spt when we correct theobservations with a simple ia model. with three measurements of thiscross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliableevidence for any deviation from the expected lcdm level of cross-correlation,given the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact ofsystematic errors, particularly ias. we provide forecasts for the expectedsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year des survey and spt-3g.
