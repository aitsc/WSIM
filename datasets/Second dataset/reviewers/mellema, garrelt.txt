0903.2760	non-parametric foreground subtraction for 21cm epoch of reionization  experiments	an obstacle to the detection of redshifted 21cm emission from the epoch ofreionization (eor) is the presence of foregrounds which exceed the cosmologicalsignal in intensity by orders of magnitude. we argue that in principle it wouldbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data todetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advanceand then fitting its parameters. non-parametric fits often suffer from otherproblems, however. we discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,wp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. after outlining the principlesof wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. we then apply wpsmoothing to a synthetic data cube for the lofar eor experiment. theperformance of wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able torecover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakageof power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and toanother non-parametric method (smoothing splines). we find that wp smoothing issuperior to smoothing splines for our application, and is competitive withparametric methods even though in the latter case we may choose the functionalform of the fit with advance knowledge of the simulated foregrounds. finally,we discuss how the quality of the fit is affected by the frequency resolutionand range, by the characteristics of the cosmological signal and by edgeeffects.

0905.2920	cosmological radiative transfer comparison project ii: the  radiation-hydrodynamic tests	the development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to followgas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution ofmany problems in numerical astrophysics. such fluid flows are highly complex,rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against whichnumerical codes can be tested. an alternative validation procedure is tocompare different methods against each other on common problems, in order toassess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for themethods. previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiativetransfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). this is thesecond paper of the cosmological radiative transfer (rt) comparison project, inwhich we compare 9 independent rt codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of anh ii region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (i-front) in a 1/r^2density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniformdense clump. results show a broad agreement between the different methods andno big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certainlevel of maturity and reliability. however, many details still do differ, andvirtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in onerespect or another, with the majority of the results. this underscores the factthat no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particularfeatures which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

0906.5159	a physical model of lyman alpha emitters	we present a simple physical model for populating dark matter halos withlyman alpha emiiters(laes) and predict the physical properties of laes atz~3-7. the central tenet of this model is that the ly-alpha luminosity isproportional to the star formation rate (sfr) which is directly related to thehalo mass accretion rate. the only free parameter in our model is then thestar-formation efficiency (sfe). an efficiency of 2.5% provides the best-fit tothe ly-alpha luminosity function (lf) at redshift z=3.1, and we use this sfe toconstruct ly-alpha lfs at other redshifts. our model reproduce the ly-alphalfs, stellar ages, sfr ~1-10; msun/yr, stellar masses ~ 10^7-10^8 msun and theclustering properties of laes at z~3-7. we find the spatial correlation lengthsro ~ 3-6 mpc/h, in agreement with the observations. finally, we estimate thefield-to-field variation ~ 30% for current volume and flux limited surveys,again consistent with observations. our results suggest that the starformation, and hence ly-alpha emission in laes is powered by the accretion ofnew material, and that the physical properties of laes do not evolvesignificantly over a wide range of redshifts. relating the accreted mass,rather than the total mass of halos, to the ly-alpha luminosity of laesnaturally gives rise to the duty cycle of laes.

0907.5179	cross-correlation study between the cosmological 21-cm signal and the  kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	the universe's epoch of reionization (eor) can be studied using a number ofobservational probes that provide complementary or corroborating information.each of these probes suffers from its own systematic and statisticaluncertainties. it is therefore useful to consider the mutual information thatthese data sets contain. in this paper we present a cross-correlation studybetween the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect (ksz) -- produced by thescattering of cmb photons off free electrons produced during the reionizationprocess -- and the cosmological 21cm signal -- which reflects the neutralhydrogen content of the universe, as a function of redshift. the study iscarried out using a simulated reionization history in 100mpc/h scale n-bodysimulations with radiative transfer. in essence we find that the two probesanti-correlate. the significance of the anti-correlation signal depends on theextent of the reionization process, wherein extended histories result in a muchstronger signal compared to instantaneous cases. unfortunately however, oncethe primary cmb fluctuations are included into our simulation they serve as asource of large correlated noise that renders the cross-correlation signalinsignificant, regardless of the reionization scenario.

1003.0965	power spectrum extraction for redshifted 21-cm epoch of reionization  experiments: the lofar case	one of the aims of the low frequency array (lofar) epoch of reionization(eor) project is to measure the power spectrum of variations in the intensityof redshifted 21-cm radiation from the eor. the sensitivity with which thispower spectrum can be estimated depends on the level of thermal noise andsample variance, and also on the systematic errors arising from the extractionprocess, in particular from the subtraction of foreground contamination. wemodel the extraction process using realistic simulations of the cosmologicalsignal, the foregrounds and noise, and so estimate the sensitivity of the lofareor experiment to the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum. detection of emissionfrom the eor should be possible within 360 hours of observation with a singlestation beam. integrating for longer, and synthesizing multiple station beamswithin the primary (tile) beam, then enables us to extract progressively moreaccurate estimates of the power at a greater range of scales and redshifts. wediscuss different observational strategies which compromise between depth ofobservation, sky coverage and frequency coverage. a plan in which lowerfrequencies receive a larger fraction of the time appears to be promising. wealso study the nature of the bias which foreground fitting errors induce on theinferred power spectrum, and discuss how to reduce and correct for this bias.the angular and line-of-sight power spectra have different merits in thisrespect, and we suggest considering them separately in the analysis of lofardata.

1005.3139	reionization of the local group of galaxies	we present the first detailed structure formation and radiative transfersimulations of the reionization history of our cosmic neighbourhood. to thisend, we follow the formation of the local group of galaxies and nearby clustersby means of constrained simulations, which use the available observationalconstraints to construct a representation of those structures which reproducestheir actual positions and properties at the present time. we find that thereionization history of the local group is strongly dependent on the assumedphoton production efficiencies of the ionizing sources, which are still poorlyconstrained. if sources are relatively efficient, i.e. the process is'photon-rich', the local group is primarily ionized externally by the nearbyclusters. alternatively, if the sources are inefficient, i.e. reionization is'photon-poor' the local group evolves largely isolated and reionizes itself.the mode of reionization, external vs. internal, has important implications forthe evolution of our neighbourhood, in terms of e.g. its satellite galaxypopulations and primordial stellar populations. this therefore provides animportant avenue for understanding the young universe by detailed studies ofour nearby structures.

1006.2016	topology and sizes of hii regions during cosmic reionization	we use the results of large-scale simulations of reionization to exploremethods for characterizing the topology and sizes of hii regions duringreionization. we use four independent methods for characterizing the sizes ofionized regions. three of them give us a full size distribution: thefriends-of-friends (fof) method, the spherical average method (spa) and thepower spectrum (ps) of the ionized fraction. these latter three methods arecomplementary: while the fof method captures the size distribution of the smallscale h ii regions, which contribute only a small amount to the totalionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measurefor the average size of the h ii regions constituting the main contribution tothe ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining moredetails on the size distribution. our fourth method for characterizing thesizes of the h ii regions is the average size which results if we divide thetotal volume of the h ii regions by their total surface area, (i.e. 3v/a),computed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding minkowski functionals ofthe ionized fraction field. to characterize the topology of the ionizedregions, we calculate the evolution of the euler characteristic. we find thatthe evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization isconsistent with inside-out reionization of a gaussian density field. we usethese techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on somebasic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibilityof haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass forsources to form. we find that suppression of ionizing sources within ionizedregions slows the growth of h ii regions, and also changes their sizedistribution. additionally, the topology of simulations including suppressionis more complex.

1008.3914	2d genus topology of 21-cm differential brightness temperature during  cosmic reionization	a novel method to characterize the topology of the early-universeintergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic reionization is presented. the21-cm radiation background from high redshift is analyzed through thecalculation of the 2-dimensional (2d) genus. the radiative transfer ofhydrogen-ionizing photons and ionization-rate equations are calculated in asuite of numerical simulations under various input parameters. the 2d genus iscalculated from the mock 21-cm images of the high-redshift universe. weconstruct the 2d genus curve by varying the threshold differential brightnesstemperature, and compare this to the 2d genus curve of the underlying densityfield. we find that (1) the 2d genus curve reflects the evolutionary track ofcosmic reionization and (2) the 2d genus curve can discriminate between certainreionization scenarios and thus indirectly probe the properties ofradiation-sources. choosing the right beam shape of a radio antenna is crucialfor this analysis. to this end, the square kilometre array (ska) is found to bea suitable apparatus for this analysis in terms of sensitivity, even thoughsome deterioration of the data for this purpose is unavoidable under theplanned size of the antenna core.

1104.2094	redshift space distortion of the 21cm background from the epoch of  reionization i: methodology re-examined	the peculiar velocity of the intergalactic gas responsible for the cosmic21cm background from the epoch of reionization and beyond introduces ananisotropy in the three-dimensional power spectrum of brightness temperaturefluctuations. measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is apromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. however,previous attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity oronly approximated it crudely. this paper re-examines the effects of peculiarvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment andaddressing several issues for the first time. (1) we show that properlyaccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the igm found by previouswork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) theapproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightnesstemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the powerspectrum on all scales. (3) the observed power spectrum in redshift-spaceremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properlyaccounts for the redshift-space distortion. however, results that take fullaccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accuratein the limit of high spin temperature. (4) the linear theory for redshift-spacedistortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumberrange, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) we describe and test two numerical schemesto calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporatepeculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately. oneis particle-based, the other grid-based, and while the former is most accurate,we demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and canachieve sufficient accuracy.

1107.4772	can 21-cm observations discriminate between high-mass and low-mass  galaxies as reionization sources?	the prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on theintergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leadsus to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing whichtypes of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. we attempt to answerthis by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations ofreionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningfulpredictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving allatomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 m_solar. we focus here on predictions ofthe 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable ofdistinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one inwhich both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how theseresults depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. we find that 21-cmfluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation eor/21-cm radiointerferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization byhigh-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.some reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolutionand thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization historyand 21-cm pdf distributions. we find that the skewness of the 21-cm pdfdistribution smoothed over lofar-like window shows a clear feature correlatedwith the rise of the rms due to patchiness. measurements of the meanphotoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions beingstudied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases.

1109.1284	light cone effect on the reionization 21-cm power spectrum	observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral hydrogen during theepoch of reionization (eor) are considered to constitute the most promisingtool to probe that epoch. one of the major goals of the first generation of lowfrequency radio telescopes is to measure the 3d 21-cm power spectrum. however,the 21-cm signal could evolve substantially along the line of sight (los)direction of an observed 3d volume, since the received signal from differentplanes transverse to the los originated from different look-back times andcould therefore be statistically different. using numerical simulations weinvestigate this so-called light cone effect on the spherically averaged 3d21-cm power spectrum. for this version of the power spectrum, we find that theeffect mostly `averages out' and observe a smaller change in the power spectrumcompared to the amount of evolution in the mean 21-cm signal and its rmsvariations along the los direction. nevertheless, changes up to 50% at largescales are possible. in general the power is enhanced/suppressed at large/smallscales when the effect is included. the cross-over mode below/above which thepower is enhanced/suppressed moves toward larger scales as reionizationproceeds. when considering the 3d power spectrum we find it to be anisotropicat the late stages of reionization and on large scales. the effect is dominatedby the evolution of the ionized fraction of hydrogen during reionization andincluding peculiar velocities hardly changes these conclusions. we presentsimple analytical models which explain qualitatively all the features we see inthe simulations.

1203.0517	prospects of observing a quasar hii region during the epoch of  reionization with redshifted 21cm	we present a study of the impact of a bright quasar on the redshifted 21cmsignal during the epoch of reionization (eor). using three differentcosmological radiative transfer simulations, we investigate if quasars arecapable of substantially changing the size and morphology of the h ii regionsthey are born in. we choose stellar and quasar luminosities in a way that isfavourable to seeing such an effect. we find that even the most luminous of ourquasar models is not able to increase the size of its native h ii regionsubstantially beyond those of large h ii regions produced by clustered stellarsources alone. however, the quasar h ii region is found to be more spherical.we next investigate the prospects of detecting such h ii regions in theredshifted 21cm data from the low frequency array (lofar) by means of a matchedfilter technique. we find that h ii regions with radii ~ 25 comoving mpc orlarger should have a sufficiently high detection probability for 1200 hours ofintegration time. although the matched filter can in principle distinguishbetween more and less spherical regions, we find that when including realisticsystem noise this distinction can no longer be made. the strong foregrounds arefound not to pose a problem for the matched filter technique. we alsodemonstrate that when the quasar position is known, the redshifted 21cm datacan still be used to set upper limits on the ionizing photon rate of thequasar. if both the quasar position and its luminosity are known, theredshifted 21 cm data can set new constrains on quasar lifetimes.

1206.4028	on the use of ly-alpha emitters as probes of reionization	we use numerical simulations to study the effects of the patchiness of apartly reionized intergalactic medium (igm) on the observability of ly-alphaemitters (laes) at high redshifts (z ~ 6). we present a new model that dividesthe ly-alpha radiative transfer into a (circum-)galactic and an extragalactic(igm) part, and investigate how the choice of intrinsic line model affects theigm transmission results. we use our model to study the impact of neutralhydrogen on statistical observables such as the ly-alpha restframe equivalentwidth (rew) distribution, the lae luminosity function and the two-pointcorrelation function. we find that if the observed changes in lae luminosityfunctions and equivalent width distributions between z ~ 6 and z ~ 7 are to beexplained by an increased igm neutral fraction alone, we require an extremelylate and rapid reionization scenario, where the universe was ~ 40 % ionized atz = 7, ~ 50 % ionized at z = 6.5 and ~ 100 % ionized at z = 6. this is inconflict with other observations, suggesting that intrinsic lae evolution at z&gt; 6 cannot be completely neglected. we show how the two-point correlationfunction can provide more robust constraints once future observations obtainlarger lae samples, and provide predictions for the sample sizes needed to telldifferent reionization scenarios apart.

1206.5007	detecting the rise and fall of the first stars by their impact on cosmic  reionization	the intergalactic medium was reionized before redshift z~6, most likely bystarlight which escaped from early galaxies. the very first stars formed whenhydrogen molecules (h2) cooled gas inside the smallest galaxies, minihalos ofmass between 10^5 and 10^8 solar masses. although the very first stars beganforming inside these minihalos before redshift z~40, their contribution has, todate, been ignored in large-scale simulations of this cosmic reionization. herewe report results from the first reionization simulations to include thesefirst stars and the radiative feedback that limited their formation, in avolume large enough to follow the crucial spatial variations that influencedthe process and its observability. we show that, while minihalo stars stoppedfar short of fully ionizing the universe, reionization began much earlier withminihalo sources than without, and was greatly extended, which boosts theintergalactic electron-scattering optical depth and the large-anglepolarization fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background significantly.although within current wmap uncertainties, this boost should be readilydetectable by planck. if reionization ended as late as z_ov&lt;~7, as suggested byother observations, planck will thereby see the signature of the first stars athigh redshift, currently undetectable by other probes.

0711.2944	effect of the intergalactic environment on the observability of ly-alpha  emitters during reionization	observations of high-redshift ly-alpha sources are a major tool for studyingthe high-redshift universe. we discuss the effect of the reionizingintergalactic medium on the observability of ly-alpha sources based on largesimulations of early structure formation with radiative transfer. this takesinto account self-consistently the reionization history, density, velocity andionization structures and nonlinear source clustering. we find that all fieldsare highly anisotropic and as a consequence there are very large variations inopacity among the different lines-of-sight. the velocity effects, from bothinfall and source peculiar velocity are most important for the luminoussources, affecting the line profile and depressing the bright end of theluminosity function. the line profiles are generally asymmetric and the linecenters of the luminous sources are always absorbed due to the high density ofthe local igm. for both luminous and average sources the damping wing effectsare of similar magnitude and remain significant until fairly late.  the ionizing flux in the ionized patch surrounding a high density peak isgenerally strongly dominated, particularly at late times, by the cluster offaint sources, rather than the central massive galaxy. the igm absorption doesnot change appreciably the correlation function of sources at high redshift.our derived luminosity function assuming constant mass-to-light ratio providesan excellent match to the shape of the observed luminosity function at z=6.6with faint-end slope of alpha=-1.5. the resulting mass-to-light ratio impliesthat the majority of sources responsible for reionization are too faint to beobserved by the current surveys.

1209.6069	the inhomogenous reionization of the inter-galactic medium by metal-poor  globular clusters	we present detailed radiative transfer simulations of the reionizationhistory of the milky way by metal-poor globular clusters. we identify potentialmetal-poor globular cluster candidates within the aquarius simulation usingdark matter halo velocity dispersions. we calculate the local ionization fieldsvia a photon-conserving, three dimensional non-equilibrium chemistry code andallow the model to propagate through to the present day. the key feature of themodel is that globular cluster formation is suppressed if the local gas isionized.  we find that our spatial treatment of the ionization field leads todrastically different numbers and spatial distributions when compared to modelswhere globular cluster formation is simply truncated at a given redshift. wefind that it is possible for metal-poor globular clusters to have formed viathe dark matter halo formation channel as our secondary model (delayedformation) combined with truncation at z = 10 produces radial distributionsstatistically consistent with that of the milky way metal-poor globularclusters.  if globular clusters do indeed form within high-redshift dark matter halos,if only in-part, their contributions to the reionization of the local (i.e. 2^3h^-3 mpc^3 centred on the host galaxy) volume and mass by redshift 10 could beas high as 98% and 90%, respectively. in our photon poorest model, thiscontribution drops to 60% and 50%. the surviving clusters in all models have anarrow average age range (mean = 13.34 gyr, \sigma = 0.04 gyr) consistent withcurrent ages estimates of the milky way metal-poor globular clusters.  we also test a simple dynamical destruction model and estimate that ~60% ofall metal-poor globular clusters formed at high redshift have since beendestroyed via tidal interactions with the host galaxy.

0712.1356	character and detectability of the dark ages and the epoch of  reionization: the view from the simulations	direct detection of the dark ages and the epoch of reionization  (eor) is among the main scientific objectives of all current and futurelow-frequency radio facilities. in this paper we summarize and discuss recentresults, based on state-of-the-art numerical simulations, regarding thefundamental eor properties and its observability with current and future radioarrays, like the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), the low frequencyarray (lofar), the 21-cm array (21cma), the murchison widefield array (mwa) andthe square kilometre array (ska). results show that the optimal observationalfrequencies for statistical detection are 140-160 mhz. the signals are stronglynon-gaussian at late times. the correlation widths between 21-cm maps atneighbouring frequencies are short, of order 300-800 khz, which should helpwith the cleaning of the strong foregrounds. direct comparison of theresolutions and expected sensitivities of gmrt and mwa indicate that theiroptimal sensitivity ranges are similar, at scales k~0.2-0.4 h/mpc, however, allelse being equal the former should require shorter integration times due to itssignificantly larger collecting area.

1301.3607	the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect as a probe of the physics of  cosmic reionization: the effect of self-regulated reionization	we calculate the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) temperature fluctuations induced by the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz)effect from the epoch of reionization (eor). we use detailed n-body+radiativetransfer simulations to follow inhomogeneous reionization of the intergalacticmedium (igm). for the first time we take into account the "self-regulation" ofreionization: star formation in low-mass dwarf galaxies (10^8 m_\sun \lesssim m\lesssim 10^9 m_\sun) or minihalos (10^5 m_\sun \lesssim m \lesssim 10^8m_\sun) is suppressed if these halos form in the regions that were alreadyionized or lyman-werner dissociated. some previous work suggested that theamplitude of the ksz power spectrum from the eor can be described by atwo-parameter family: the epoch of half ionization and the duration ofreionization. however, we argue that this picture applies only to simple formsof the reionization history which are roughly symmetric about thehalf-ionization epoch. in self-regulated reionization, the universe begins tobe ionized early, maintains a low level of ionization for an extended period,and then finishes reionization as soon as high-mass atomically-cooling halosdominate. while inclusion of self-regulation affects the amplitude of the kszpower spectrum only modestly (\sim 10 %), it can change the duration ofreionization by a factor of more than two. we conclude that the simpletwo-parameter family does not capture the effect of a physical, yet complex,reionization history caused by self-regulation. when added to thepost-reionization ksz contribution, our prediction for the total ksz powerspectrum is below the current upper bound from the south pole telescope.therefore, the current upper bound on the ksz effect from the eor is consistentwith our understanding of the physics of reionization.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

0705.0530	dependence of the local reionization history on halo mass and  environment: did virgo reionize the local group?	the reionization of the universe has profound effects on the way galaxiesform and on their observed properties at later times. of particular importanceis the relative timing of the reionization history of a region and its haloassembly history, which can affect the nature of the first stars formed in thatregion, the properties and radial distribution of its stellar halo, globularcluster population and its satellite galaxies. we distinguish two basic casesfor the reionization of a halo - internal reionization, whereby the starsforming in situ reionize their host galaxy, and external reionization, wherebythe progenitor of a galaxy is reionized by external radiation before its ownstars are able to form in sufficient numbers. we use a set of large-scaleradiative transfer and structure formation simulations, based on cosmologiesderived from both wmap 1-year and wmap 3-year data, to evaluate the meanreionization redshifts and the probability of internal/external reionizationfor local group-like systems, galaxies in the field and central cd galaxies inclusters. we find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on theunderlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on thehalo mass. there is a rapid transition between predominantly external andpredominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 msun(corresponding roughly to l*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this beingreionized preferentially from distant sources. we provide a fit for thereionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful toparameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation oncosmological scales. we find no statistical correlation between thereionization history of field galaxies and their environment.

1310.7463	simulating cosmic reionization: how large a volume is large enough?	we present the largest-volume (425 mpc/h=607 mpc on a side) full radiativetransfer simulation of cosmic reionization to date. we show that there issignificant additional power in density fluctuations at very large scales. wesystematically investigate the effects this additional power has on theprogress, duration and features of reionization, as well as on selectedreionization observables. we find that comoving simulation volume of ~100 mpc/hper side is sufficient for deriving a convergent mean reionization history, butthat the reionization patchiness is significantly underestimated. we usejackknife splitting to quantify the convergence of reionization properties withsimulation volume for both mean-density and variable-density sub-regions. wefind that sub-volumes of ~100 mpc/h per side or larger yield convergentreionization histories, except for the earliest times, but smaller volumes of~50 mpc/h or less are not well converged at any redshift. reionization historymilestones show significant scatter between the sub-volumes, of delta z=0.6-1for ~50 mpc/h volumes, decreasing to delta z=0.3-0.5 for ~100 mpc/h volumes,and $\delta z$~0.1 for ~200 mpc/h volumes. if we only consider mean-densitysub-regions the scatter decreases, but remains at delta z~0.1-0.2 for thedifferent size sub-volumes. consequently, many potential reionizationobservables like 21-cm rms, 21-cm pdf skewness and kurtosis all show goodconvergence for volumes of ~200 mpc/h, but retain considerable scatter forsmaller volumes. in contrast, the three-dimensional 21-cm power spectra atlarge scales (k&lt;0.25 h/mpc) do not fully converge for any sub-volume size.these additional large-scale fluctuations significantly enhance the 21-cmfluctuations, which should improve the prospects of detection considerably,given the lower foregrounds and greater interferometer sensitivity at higherfrequencies.

1401.4172	constraining the epoch of reionization with the variance statistic:  simulations of the lofar case	several experiments are underway to detect the cosmic redshifted 21-cm signalfrom neutral hydrogen from the epoch of reionization (eor). due to their verylow signal-to-noise ratio, these observations aim for a statistical detectionof the signal by measuring its power spectrum. we investigate the extraction ofthe variance of the signal as a first step towards detecting and constrainingthe global history of the eor. signal variance is the integral of the signal'spower spectrum, and it is expected to be measured with a high significance. wedemonstrate this through results from a simulation and parameter estimationpipeline developed for the low frequency array (lofar)-eor experiment. we showthat lofar should be able to detect the eor in 600 hours of integration usingthe variance statistic. additionally, the redshift ($z_r$) and duration($\delta z$) of reionization can be constrained assuming a parametrization. weuse an eor simulation of $z_r = 7.68$ and $\delta z = 0.43$ to test thepipeline. we are able to detect the simulated signal with a significance of 4standard deviations and extract the eor parameters as $z_r =7.72^{+0.37}_{-0.18}$ and $\delta z = 0.53^{+0.12}_{-0.23}$ in 600 hours,assuming that systematic errors can be adequately controlled. we further showthat the significance of detection and constraints on eor parameters can beimproved by measuring the cross-variance of the signal by cross-correlatingconsecutive redshift bins.

1402.0508	light cone effect on the reionization 21-cm signal ii: evolution,  anisotropies and observational implications	measurements of the hi 21-cm power spectra from the reionization epoch willbe influenced by the evolution of the signal along the line-of-sight directionof any observed volume. we use numerical as well as semi-numerical simulationsof reionization in a cubic volume of 607 mpc across to study this so-calledlight cone effect on the hi 21-cm power spectrum. we find that the light coneeffect has the largest impact at two different stages of reionization: one whenreionization is $\sim 20\%$ and other when it is $\sim 80\%$ completed. we finda factor of $\sim 4$ amplification of the power spectrum at the largest scaleavailable in our simulations. we do not find any significant anisotropy in the21-cm power spectrum due to the light cone effect. we argue that for the powerspectrum to become anisotropic, the light cone effect would have to make theionized bubbles significantly elongated or compressed along the line-of-sight,which would require extreme reionization scenarios. we also calculate thetwo-point correlation functions parallel and perpendicular to the line-of-sightand find them to differ. finally, we calculate an optimum frequency bandwidthbelow which the light cone effect can be neglected when extracting powerspectra from observations. we find that if one is willing to accept a $10 \%$error due to the light cone effect, the optimum frequency bandwidth for $k=0.056 \, \rm{mpc}^{-1}$ is $\sim 7.5$ mhz. for $k = 0.15$ and $0.41 \,\rm{mpc}^{-1}$ the optimum bandwidth is $\sim 11$ and $\sim 16$ mhzrespectively.

1509.02277	the wedge bias in reionization 21-cm power spectrum measurements	a proposed method for dealing with foreground emission in upcoming 21-cmobservations from the epoch of reionization is to limit observations to anuncontaminated window in fourier space. foreground emission can be avoided inthis way, since it is limited to a wedge-shaped region in $k_{\parallel},k_{\perp}$ space. however, the power spectrum is anisotropic owing toredshift-space distortions from peculiar velocities. consequently, the 21-cmpower spectrum measured in the foreground avoidance window---which samples onlya limited range of angles close to the line-of-sight direction---differs fromthe full spherically-averaged power spectrum which requires an average over\emph{all} angles. in this paper, we calculate the magnitude of this "wedgebias" for the first time. we find that the bias is strongest at high redshifts,where measurements using foreground avoidance will over-estimate the powerspectrum by around 100 per cent, possibly obscuring the distinctive rise andfall signature that is anticipated for the spherically-averaged 21-cm powerspectrum. in the later stages of reionization, the bias becomes negative, andsmaller in magnitude ($\lesssim 20$ per cent). the effect shows only a weakdependence on spatial scale and reionization topology.

1509.03464	predictions for the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum observable with  lofar and subaru	the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum is expected to be one of the promisingprobes of the epoch of reionization (eor), as it could offer information aboutthe progress of reionization and the typical scale of ionized regions atdifferent redshifts. with upcoming observations of 21cm emission from the eorwith the low frequency array (lofar), and of high redshift lyalpha emitters(laes) with subaru's hyper suprime cam (hsc), we investigate the observabilityof such cross-power spectrum with these two instruments, which are bothplanning to observe the elais-n1 field at z=6.6. in this paper we use n-body +radiative transfer (both for continuum and lyalpha photons) simulations atredshift 6.68, 7.06 and 7.3 to compute the 3d theoretical 21cm-galaxycross-power spectrum, as well as to predict the 2d 21cm-galaxy cross-powerspectrum expected to be observed by lofar and hsc. once noise and projectioneffects are accounted for, our predictions of the 21cm-galaxy cross-powerspectrum show clear anti-correlation on scales larger than ~ 60 h$^{-1}$ mpc(corresponding to k ~ 0.1 h mpc$^{-1}$), with levels of significance p=0.04 atz=6.6 and p=0.048 at z=7.3. on smaller scales, instead, the signal iscompletely contaminated.

1509.07518	effects of the sources of reionization on 21-cm redshift-space  distortions	the observed 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization will be distortedalong the line-of-sight by the peculiar velocities of matter particles. theseredshift-space distortions will affect the contrast in the signal and will alsomake it anisotropic. this anisotropy contains information about thecross-correlation between the matter density field and the neutral hydrogenfield, and could thus potentially be used to extract information about thesources of reionization. in this paper, we study a collection of simulatedreionization scenarios assuming different models for the sources ofreionization. we show that the 21-cm anisotropy is best measured by thequadrupole moment of the power spectrum. we find that, unless the properties ofthe reionization sources are extreme in some way, the quadrupole moment evolvesvery predictably as a function of global neutral fraction. this predictabilityimplies that redshift-space distortions are not a very sensitive tool fordistinguishing between reionization sources. however, the quadrupole moment canbe used as a model-independent probe for constraining the reionization history.we show that such measurements can be done to some extent by first-generationinstruments such as lofar, while the ska should be able to measure thereionization history using the quadrupole moment of the power spectrum to greataccuracy.

1511.01040	efficient photo-heating algorithms in time-dependent photo-ionization  simulations	we present an extension to the time-dependent photo-ionization code c$^2$-rayto calculate photo-heating in an efficient and accurate way. in c$^2$-ray, thethermal calculation demands relatively small time-steps for accurate results.we describe two novel methods to reduce the computational cost associated withsmall time-steps, namely, an adaptive time-step algorithm and an asynchronousevolution approach. the adaptive time-step algorithm determines an optimaltime-step for the next computational step. it uses a fast ray-tracing scheme toquickly locate the relevant cells for this determination and only use thesecells for the calculation of the time-step. asynchronous evolution allowsdifferent cells to evolve with different time-steps. the asynchronized clocksof the cells are synchronized at the times where outputs are produced. by onlyevolving cells which may require short time-steps with these short time-stepsinstead of imposing them to the whole grid, the computational cost of thecalculation can be substantially reduced. we show that our methods work wellfor several cosmologically relevant test problems and validate our results bycomparing to the results of another time-dependent photo-ionization code.

1512.03836	the large-scale observational signatures of low-mass galaxies during  reionization	observations of the epoch of reionization give us clues about the nature andevolution of the sources of ionizing photons, or early stars and galaxies. wepresent a new suite of structure formation and radiative transfer simulationsfrom the prace4lofar project designed to investigate whether the mechanism ofradiative feedback, or the suppression of star formation in ionized regionsfrom uv radiation, can be inferred from these observations. our source halomass extends down to $10^8 m_\odot$, with sources in the mass range $10^8$ to$10^9 m_\odot$ expected to be particularly susceptible to feedback fromionizing radiation, and we vary the aggressiveness and nature of thissuppression. not only do we have four distinct source models, we also includetwo box sizes (67 mpc and 349 mpc), each with two grid resolutions. this suiteof simulations allows us to investigate the robustness of our results. all ofour simulations are broadly consistent with the observed electron-scatteringoptical depth of the cosmic microwave background and the neutral fraction andphotoionization rate of hydrogen at $z\sim6$. in particular, we investigate theredshifted 21-cm emission in anticipation of upcoming radio interferometerobservations. we find that the overall shape of the 21-cm signal and variousstatistics are robust to the exact nature of source suppression, the box size,and the resolution. there are some promising model discriminators in thenon-gaussianity and small-scale power spectrum of the 21-cm signal.

astro-ph;0607517	self-regulated reionization	recently, we have presented the first large-scale radiative transfersimulations of reionization. here we present new simulations which extend thesource halo mass range downward to 10^8m_solar, to capture the full range ofhalo masses thought to be primarily responsible for reionization by their starformation following atomic hydrogen radiative cooling and gravitationalcollapse. haloes below about 10^9m_solar, however, are subject to jeans-massfiltering in the ionized regions, which suppresses their baryonic content andtheir ability to release ionizing radiation. by including these smaller-masshaloes but accounting for their suppression, too, we find that reionization is``self-regulating,'' as follows. as the mean ionized fraction rises, so doesthe fraction of the volume within which suppression occurs. hence, the degreeof suppression is related to the mean ionized fraction. since low-mass haloeswith high emissivity achieve a given mean ionized fraction earlier than dothose with low efficiency, jeans-mass filtering compensates for the differencein the emissivity of the suppressible haloes in these two cases. as a result,in the presence of lower-mass source haloes, reionization begins earlier, butthe later stages of reionization and the time of overlap are dictated by theefficiency of the higher-mass haloes, independent of the efficiency of thesuppressible, lower-mass haloes. reionization histories consistent with currentobservational constraints are shown to be achievable with standard stellarsources in haloes above 10^8m_solar. neither minihalos nor exotic sources arerequired, and the phenomenon of ``double reionization'' previously suggesteddoes not occur.

astro-ph;0702099	current models of the observable consequences of cosmic reionization and  their detectability	a number of large current experiments aim to detect the signatures of thecosmic reionization at redshifts z&gt;6. their success depends crucially onunderstanding the character of the reionization process and its observableconsequences and designing the best strategies to use. we use large-scalesimulations of cosmic reionization to evaluate the reionization signatures atredshifted 21-cm and small-scale cmb anisotropies in the best current model forthe background universe, with fundamental cosmological parameters given by wmap3-year results (wmap3). we find that the optimal frequency range for observingthe ``global step'' of the 21-cm emission is 120-150 mhz, while statisticalstudies should aim at 140-160 mhz, observable by gmrt. somestrongly-nongaussian brightness features should be detectable at frequencies upto ~190 mhz. in terms of sensitivity-signal trade-off relatively lowresolutions, corresponding to beams of at least a few arcminutes, arepreferable. the cmb anisotropy signal from the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovicheffect from reionized patches peaks at tens of muk at arcminute scales and hasan rms of ~1 muk, and should be observable by the atacama cosmology telescopeand the south pole telescope. we discuss the various observational issues andthe uncertainties involved, mostly related to the poorly-known reionizationparameters and, to a lesser extend, to the uncertainties in the backgroundcosmology.

astro-ph;9410057	numerical models and our understanding of aspherical planetary nebulae	the status of numerical hydrodynamical models for planetary nebulae isreviewed. since all of the numerical work is based on the interacting windsmodel, we start with a description of this model and give an overview of theearly analytical and numerical models. subsequently we address the numericalmodels which include radiation effects, first of all the ones which neglect anyeffects of stellar evolution. these `constant environment' models are shown toclosely match typical observed nebulae, both in images and kinematic data. thisshows that the basic generalized interacting winds model gives a gooddescription of the situation in aspherical pne. next we discuss models that doinclude the effects of stellar and fast wind evolution. this introduces severalnew effects, the most important of which are the formation of a surroundingattached envelope, and the modification of the expansion of the nebula, whichhelps in creating aspherical pne very early on in their evolution. theionization of the slow wind also leads to a gradual smoothing out of itsaspherical character, working against aspherical pne forming in later stages.finally we discuss some applications of the model to nebular problems.

astro-ph;9410084	hot bubble and slow wind dynamics in pne (radiation-gasdynamics of pne  v)	this paper looks into various aspects brought to light by numerical work onthe generalized interacting winds model for planetary nebulae. first, adetailed comparison between radiative and non-radiative models is made, showingthat one's naive expectations of the effects of radiative heating and coolingare not always true. secondly, we consider the evolution of the slow wind afterit has gotten ionized. it is found that the initial aspherical densitydistribution is smoothed out after ionization, thus requiring the asphericalnebula to be formed within the first few thousand years of pn evolution.thirdly, the nature of the flow in the hot bubble is investigated. both one andtwo-dimensional numerical models show strong signs of instabilities orturbulent flow in the hot bubble. although observationally hard to prove ordisprove this turbulent structure is critically examined. it is found thatalthough the turbulence is not a numerical artifact, the full three-dimensionalpicture will most definitely differ from what is found in two dimensions. theimplications for the interpretation of the models are discussed. finally, theissue of the soft x-ray emission from pne is considered. it is found that softx-rays originate mainly from the thin interface between the hot bubble and theactual nebula.

0809.2428	detection and extraction of signals from the epoch of reionization using  higher order one-point statistics	detecting redshifted 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the earlyuniverse promises to give direct constraints on the epoch of reionization(eor). it will, though, be very challenging to extract the cosmological signal(cs) from foregrounds and noise which are orders of magnitude larger.fortunately, the signal has some characteristics which differentiate it fromthe foregrounds and noise, and we suggest that using the correct statistics maytease out signatures of reionization. we generate mock datacubes simulating theoutput of the low frequency array (lofar) eor experiment. these cubes combinerealistic models for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds and the noise withthree different simulations of the cs. we fit out the foregrounds, which aresmooth in the frequency direction, to produce residual images in each frequencyband. we denoise these images and study the skewness of the one-pointdistribution in the images as a function of frequency. we find that, undersufficiently optimistic assumptions, we can recover the main features of theredshift evolution of the skewness in the 21cm signal. we argue that some ofthese features - such as a dip at the onset of reionization, followed by a risetowards its later stages - may be generic, and give us a promising route to astatistical detection of reionization.

astro-ph;9606142	hydrodynamical models of outflow collimation in ysos	we explore the physics of time-dependent hydrodynamic collimation of jetsfrom young stellar objects (ysos). using parameters appropriate to ysos we havecarried out high resolution hydrodynamic simulations modeling the interactionof a central wind with an environment characterized by a moderate opening angletoroidal density distribution. the results show that the the wind/environmentinteraction produces strongly collimated supersonic jets. the jet is composedof shocked wind gas. using analytical models of wind blown bubble evolution weshow that the scenario studied here should be applicable to ysos and can, inprinciple, initiate collimation on the correct scales (r ~ 100 au). thesimulations reveal a number of time-dependent non-linear features notanticipated in previous analytical studies including: a prolate wind shock; achimney of cold swept-up ambient material dragged into the bubble cavity; aplug of dense material between the jet and bow shocks. we find that thecollimation of the jet occurs through both de laval nozzles and focusing of thewind via the prolate wind shock. using an analytical model for shock focusingwe demonstrate that a prolate wind shock can, by itself, produce highlycollimated supersonic jets.

astro-ph;9704172	the formation of bipolar planetary nebulae	using a radiation-hydrodynamics code i follow the formation of planetarynebulae around stars of different mass. because a more massive central starevolves much faster than a lower mass one, it is to be expected that this willaffect the formation of the pn. for the stars i use the evolutionary tracks forremnants with masses of 0.605 m0 and 0.836 m0, taken from bloecker (1995). theagb wind is assumed to be concentrated in a thin disk, which in models withoutevolving stars leads to the formation of a bipolar nebula. i find that in thecase of the 0.836 m0 remnant the nebula indeed acquires a bipolar shape,whereas for the 0.605 m0 remnant the shape is more elliptical. the reason forthis is the time it takes to ionize the agb material; if this happenssufficiently slowly the density distribution in the agb wind will be smoothedout, leading to more elliptical shapes. if it happens quickly, the originaldensity distribution (in this case a thin disk) is hardly affected. this resultsuggests that lower mass central stars will less easily produce bipolarnebulae, which is supported by observations.

astro-ph;9710205	photo-evaporation of clumps in planetary nebulae	we study the evolution of dense neutral clumps located in the outer parts ofplanetary nebulae. these clumps will be photo-ionized by the ionizing radiationfrom the central star and change their structure in the process. the maineffect of the ionization process is the setting up of a photo-evaporation flowand a shock running through the clump. once this shock has moved through theentire clump it starts to accelerate because of the `rocket effect'. thiscontinues until the entire clump has been photo-ionized. we present an analyticmodel for the shock and accelerating phases and also the results of numericalsimulations which include detailed microphysics. we find a good match betweenthe analytic description and the numerical results and use the numericalresults to produce some of the clump's observational characteristics atdifferent phases of its evolution. we compare the results with the propertiesof the fast moving low ionization knots (ansae or fliers) seen in a number ofplanetary nebulae. we find that the models match many of the kinematic andemission properties of fliers.

astro-ph;9710255	outflow collimation in young stellar objects	in this paper we explore the effect of radiative losses on purelyhydrodynamic jet collimation models applicable to young stellar objects (ysos).in our models aspherical bubbles form from the interaction of a central ysowind with an aspherical circum-protostellar density distribution. building on aprevious non-radiative study (frank &amp; mellema 1996) we demonstrate thatsupersonic jets are a natural and robust consequence of aspherical wind-blownbubble evolution. the simulations show that the addition of radiative coolingmakes the hydrodynamic collimation mechanisms studied by frank &amp; mellema (1996)more effective. an unexpected result is the production of cool, dense jetsforming through conical converging flows at the poles of the bubbles. forsteady winds the formation of these jets occurs early in the bubble evolution.at later times we find that the dynamical and cooling time scales for the jetmaterial become similar. since observations of yso jets show considerablevariability in the jet beam we present a simple one-dimensional (1-d) model forthe evolution of a variable wind interacting with an accreting environment.these models indicate that, in the presence of a varying protostellar wind, thehydrodynamic collimation processes studied in our simulations can produce cooljets with sizes and time scales consistent with observations.

0810.1531	radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the photoionisation of  magnetised globules	we present the first three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamicsimulations of the photoionisation of a dense, magnetised molecular globule byan external source of ultraviolet radiation. we find that, for the case of astrong ionising field, significant deviations from the non-magnetic evolutionare seen when the initial magnetic field threading the globule has anassociated magnetic pressure that is greater than one hundred times the gaspressure. in such a strong-field case, the photoevaporating globule will adopta flattened or "curled up" shape, depending on the initial field orientation,and magnetic confinement of the ionised photoevaporation flow can lead torecombination and subsequent fragmentation during advanced stages of theglobule evolution. we find suggestive evidence that such magnetic effects maybe important in the formation of bright, bar-like emission features in h iiregions. we include simple but realistic fits to heating and cooling rates inthe neutral and molecular gas in the vicinity of a high-mass star cluster andshow that the frequently used isothermal approximation can lead to anoverestimate of the importance of gravitational instability in the radiativelyimploded globule. for globules within 2 parsecs of a high-mass star cluster, wefind that heating by stellar x rays prevents the molecular gas from coolingbelow 50 k.
