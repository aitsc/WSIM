0902.3168	detection of star formation in the unusually cold giant molecular cloud  g216	the giant molecular cloud g216-2.5, also known as maddalena's cloud or themaddalena-thaddeus cloud, is distinguished by an unusual combination of highgas mass (1-6 x 10^5) solar masses, low kinetic temperatures (10 k), and thelack of bright far infrared emission. although star formation has been detectedin neighboring satellite clouds, little evidence for star formation has beenfound in the main body of this cloud. using a combination of mid-infraredobservations with the irac and mips instruments onboard the spitzer spacetelescope, and near-ir images taken with the flamingos camera on the kpno2.1-meter, we identify a population of 41 young stars with disks and 33protostars in the center of the cloud. most of the young stellar objects arecoincident with a filamentary structure of dense gas detected in cs (2-1).these observations show that the main body of g216 is actively forming stars,although at a low stellar density comparable to that found in the taurus cloud.

0903.2775	kinematics of the orion nebula cluster: velocity substructure and  spectroscopic binaries	we present a kinematic study of the orion nebula cluster based upon radialvelocities measured by multi-fiber echelle spectroscopy at the 6.5 meter mmtand magellan telescopes. velocities are reported for 1613 stars, withmulti-epoch data for 727 objects as part of our continuing effort to detect andanalyze spectroscopic binaries. we confirm and extend the results of furesz etal. showing that the onc is not relaxed, consistent with its youth, and thatthe stars generally follow the position-velocity structure of the moderatedensity gas in the region, traced by $^{13}$co. the additional radialvelocities we have measured enable us to probe some discrepancies betweenstellar and gaseous structure which can be attributed to binary motion and theinclusion of non-members in our kinematic sample. our multi-epoch data allow usto identify 89 spectroscopic binaries; more will be found as we continuemonitoring. our results reinforce the idea that the onc is a cluster information, and thus provides a valuable testing ground for theory. inparticular, our observations are not consistent with the quasi-equilibrium orslow contraction models of cluster formation, but are consistent with coldcollapse models.

0904.1244	a spectroscopic study of young stellar objects in the serpens cloud core  and ngc 1333	we present spectral observations of 130 young stellar objects (ysos) in theserpens cloud core and ngc 1333 embedded clusters. the observations consist ofnear-ir spectra in the h and k-bands, from spex on the irtf and far-red spectra(6000 - 9000 a) from hectospec on the mmt. these ysos were identified inprevious spitzer and chandra observations, and the evolutionary classes of theysos were determined from the spitzer mid-ir photometry. with these spectra, wesearch for corroborating evidence for the pre-main sequence nature of theobjects, study the properties of the detected emission lines as a function ofevolutionary class, and obtain spectral types for the observed ysos. bycomparing the positions of the ysos in the hr diagrams with the pre-mainsequence tracks of baraffe (1998), we determine ages of the embedded sourcesand study the relative ages of the ysos with and without optically thickcircumstellar disks. the apparent isochronal ages of the ysos in both clustersrange from less than 1 myr to 10 myr, with most objects below 3 myr. theobserved distribution of ages for the class ii and class iii objects arestatistically indistinguishable. we examine the spatial distribution andextinction of the ysos as a function of their isochronal ages. we find thesources &lt; 3 myr to be concentrated in the molecular cloud gas while the oldersources are spatially dispersed and are not deeply embedded. nonetheless, thesources with isochronal ages &gt; 3 myr show all the characteristics of youngstellar objects in their spectra, their ir spectral energy distributions, andtheir x-ray emission.

0904.3279	a vlt/naco study of star formation in the massive embedded cluster rcw  38	we present adaptive optics (ao) near-infrared (jhks) observations of thedeeply embedded massive cluster rcw 38 using naco on the vlt. narrowband aoobservations centered at wavelengths of 1.28, 2.12, and 2.17 micron were alsoobtained. the area covered by these observations is about 0.5 pc square,centered on the o star rcw 38 irs2. we use the jhks colors to identify youngstars with infrared excess. through a detailed comparison to a nearby controlfield, we find that most of the 337 stars detected in all three infrared bandsare cluster members (~317), with essentially no contamination due to backgroundor foreground sources. five sources have colors suggestive of deeply embeddedprotostars, while 53 sources are detected at ks only; their spatialdistribution with respect to the extinction suggests they are highly reddenedcluster members. detectable ks-band excess is found toward 29 +/- 3 % of thestars. for comparison to a similar area of orion observed in the near-infrared,mass and extinction cuts are applied, and the excess fractions redetermined.the resulting excesses are then 25 +/- 5 % for rcw 38, and 42 +/- 8 % fororion. rcw 38 irs2 is shown to be a massive star binary with a projectedseparation of ~500 au. two regions of molecular hydrogen emission are revealedthrough the 2.12 micron imaging. one shows a morphology suggestive of aprotostellar jet, and is clearly associated with a star only detected at h andks, previously identified as a highly obscured x-ray source. three spatiallyextended cometary-like objects, suggestive of photoevaporating disks, areidentified, but only one is clearly directly influenced by rcw 38 irs2. a kingprofile provides a reasonable fit to the cluster radial density profile and anearest neighbor distance analysis shows essentially no sub-clustering.

0906.0201	a spitzer survey of young stellar clusters within one kiloparsec of the  sun: cluster core extraction and basic structural analysis	we present a uniform mid-infrared imaging and photometric survey of 36 young,nearby, star-forming clusters and groups using {\it spitzer} irac and mips. wehave confidently identified and classified 2548 young stellar objects usingrecently established mid-infrared color-based methods. we have devised andapplied a new algorithm for the isolation of local surface density enhancementsfrom point source distributions, enabling us to extract the overdense cores ofthe observed star forming regions for further analysis. we have compiledseveral basic structural measurements of these cluster cores from the data,such as mean surface densities of sources, cluster core radii, and aspectratios, in order to characterize the ranges for these quantities. we find thata typical cluster core is 0.39 pc in radius, has 26 members with infraredexcess in a ratio of class ii to class i sources of 3.7, is embedded in a$a_k$=0.8 mag cloud clump, and has a surface density of 60 pc$^{-2}$. weexamine the nearest neighbor distances among the ysos in several ways,demonstrating similarity in the spacings between class ii and class i sourcesbut large member clusters appear more dense than smaller clusters. wedemonstrate that near-uniform source spacings in cluster cores are common,suggesting that simple jeans fragmentation of parsec-scale cloud clumps may bethe dominant process governing star formation in nearby clusters and groups.finally, we compare our results to other similar surveys in the literature anddiscuss potential biases in the data to guide further interpretation.

0906.0364	spitzer/irac limits to planetary companions of fomalhaut and epsilon  eridani	fomalhaut and epsilon eridani are two young, nearby stars that possessextended debris disks whose structures suggest the presence of perturbingplanetary objects. with its high sensitivity and stable point spread function,spitzer/irac is uniquely capable of detecting cool, jupiter-like planetarycompanions whose peak emission is predicted to occur near 4.5 um. we report ondeep irac imaging of these two stars, taken at 3.6 and 4.5 um using subarraymode and in all four channels in wider-field full array mode. observationsacquired at two different telescope roll angles allowed faint surroundingobjects to be separated from the stellar diffraction pattern. no companioncandidates were detected at the reported position of fomalhaut b with 3 sigmamodel-dependent mass upper limits of 3 mj (for an age of 200 myr). aroundepsilon eridani we instead set a limit of 4 and &lt;1 mj (1 gyr model age) at theinner and outer edge of the sub-millimeter debris ring, respectively. theseresults are consistent with non-detections in recent near-infrared imagingsearches, and set the strongest limits to date on the presence of planetsoutside epsilon eridani sub-millimeter ring.

0906.2428	chandra and spitzer imaging of the infrared cluster in ngc 2071	we present results of a sensitive chandra x-ray observation and spitzermid-ir observations of the infrared cluster lying north of the ngc 2071reflection nebula in the orion b molecular cloud. we focus on the dense clustercore known as ngc 2071-ir which contains at least nine ir sources within a 40 x40 arcsecond region. this region shows clear signs of active star formationincluding powerful molecular outflows, herbig-haro objects, and both oh and h2omasers. we use spitzer irac images to aid in x-ray source identification and todetermine yso classes using mid-ir colors. spitzer irac colors show that theluminous source irs 1 is a class i protostar. irs 1 is believed to be driving apowerful bipolar molecular outflow and may be an embedded b-type star or itsprogenitor. its x-ray spectrum reveals a fluorescent fe emission line at 6.4kev, arising in cold material near the protostar. the line is present even inthe absence of large flares, raising questions about the nature of the ionizingmechanism responsible for producing the 6.4 kev fluorescent line. chandra alsodetects x-ray sources at or near the positions of irs 2, irs 3, irs 4, and irs6 and a variable x-ray source coincident with the radio source vla 1, locatedjust 2 arcsec north of irs 1. no ir data are yet available to determine a ysoclassification for vla 1, but its high x-ray absorption shows that it is evenmore deeply-embedded than irs 1, suggesting that it could be an even younger,less-evolved protostar.

0707.2537	a combined spitzer and chandra survey of young stellar objects in the  serpens cloud core	we present spitzer and chandra observations of the nearby (~260 pc) embeddedstellar cluster in the serpens cloud core. we observed, using spitzer's iracand mips instruments, in six wavelength bands from 3 to 70 ${\mu}m$, to detectthermal emission from circumstellar disks and protostellar envelopes, and toclassify stars using color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions(seds). these data are combined with chandra observations to examine theeffects of circumstellar disks on stellar x-ray properties. young disklessstars were also identified from their increased x-ray emission. we haveidentified 138 ysos in serpens: 22 class 0/i, 16 flat spectrum, 62 class ii, 17transition disk, and 21 class iii stars; 60 of which exhibit x-ray emission.our primary results are the following: 1.) ten protostars detected previouslyin the sub-millimeter are detected at lambda &lt; 24 microns, seven at lambda &lt; 8microns, 2.) the protostars are more closely grouped than more evolved ysos(median separation : ~0.024 pc, and 3.) the luminosity and temperature of thex-ray emitting plasma around these ysos does not show any significantdependence on evolutionary class. we combine the infrared derived values of akand x-ray values of nh for 8 class iii objects and find that the column densityof hydrogen gas per mag of extinctions is less than half the standardinterstellar value, for ak &gt; 1. this may be the result of grain growth throughcoagulation and/or the accretion of volatiles in the serpens cloud core.

1001.0978	the mass distributions of starless and protostellar cores in gould belt  clouds	using data from the scuba legacy catalogue (850 um) and spitzer spacetelescope (3.6 - 70 um), we explore dense cores in the ophiuchus, taurus,perseus, serpens, and orion molecular clouds. we develop a new method todiscriminate submillimeter cores found by scuba as starless or protostellar,using point source photometry from spitzer wide field surveys. first, weidentify infrared sources with red colors associated with embedded youngstellar objects (ysos). second, we compare the positions of theseyso-candidates to our submillimeter cores. with these identifications, weconstruct new, self-consistent starless and protostellar core mass functions(cmfs) for the five clouds. we find best fit slopes to the high-mass end of thecmfs of -1.26 +/- 0.20, -1.22 +/- 0.06, -0.95 +/- 0.20, and -1.67 +/- 0.72 forophiuchus, taurus, perseus, and orion, respectively. broadly, these slopes areeach consistent with the -1.35 power-law slope of the salpeter imf at highermasses, but suggest some differences. we examine a variety of trends betweenthese cmf shapes and their parent cloud properties, potentially finding acorrelation between the high-mass slope and core temperature. we also find atrend between core mass and effective size, but we are very limited bysensitivity. we make similar comparisons between core mass and size with visualextinction (for a_v &gt;= 3) and find no obvious trends. we also predict thenumbers and mass distributions of cores that future surveys with scuba-2 maydetect in each of these clouds.

1103.0781	the highly dynamic behavior of the innermost dust and gas in the  transition disk variable lrll 31	we describe extensive synoptic multi-wavelength observations of thetransition disk lrll 31 in the young cluster ic 348. we combined four epochs ofirs spectra, nine epochs of mips photometry, seven epochs of cold-mission iracphotometry and 36 epochs of warm mission irac photometry along with multi-epochnear-infrared spectra, optical spectra and polarimetry to explore the nature ofthe rapid variability of this object. we find that the inner disk, as traced bythe 2-5micron excess stays at the dust sublimation radius while the strength ofthe excess changes by a factor of 8 on weekly timescales, and the 3.6 and4.5micron photometry shows a drop of 0.35 magnitudes in one week followed by aslow 0.5 magnitude increase over the next three weeks. the accretion rate, asmeasured by pabeta and brgamma emission lines, varies by a factor of five withevidence for a correlation between the accretion rate and the infrared excess.while the gas and dust in the inner disk are fluctuating the central star staysrelatively static. our observations allow us to put constraints on the physicalmechanism responsible for the variability. the variabile accretion, and wind,are unlikely to be causes of the variability, but both are effects of the samephysical process that disturbs the disk. the lack of periodicity in ourinfrared monitoring indicates that it is unlikely that there is a companionwithin ~0.4 au that is perturbing the disk. the most likely explanation iseither a companion beyond ~0.4 au or a dynamic interface between the stellarmagnetic field and the disk leading to a variable scale height and/or warpingof the inner disk.

1107.0966	a correlation between surface densities of young stellar objects and gas  in eight nearby molecular clouds	we report the discovery and characterization of a power law correlationbetween the local surface densities of spitzer-identified, dusty young stellarobjects and the column density of gas (as traced by near-ir extinction) ineight molecular clouds within 1 kpc and with 100 or more known ysos. thiscorrelation, which appears in data smoothed over size scales of ~1 pc, variesin quality from cloud to cloud; those clouds with tight correlations, monr2 andophiuchus, are fit with power laws of slope 2.67 and 1.87, respectively. thespread in the correlation is attributed primarily to local gas disruption bystars that formed there or to the presence of very young sub-regions at theonset of star formation. we explore the ratio of the number of class ii toclass i sources, a proxy for the star formation age of a region, as a functionof gas column density; this analysis reveals a declining class ii to class iratio with increasing column density. we show that the observed star-gascorrelation is consistent with a star formation law where the star formationrate per area varies with the gas column density squared. we also propose asimple picture of thermal fragmentation of dense gas in an isothermal,self-gravitating layer as an explanation for the power law. finally, we brieflycompare the star gas correlation and its implied star formation law with otherrecent proposed of star formation laws at similar and larger size scales fromnearby star forming regions.

0710.1860	spitzer observations of ngc 1333: a study of structure and evolution in  a nearby embedded cluster	we present a comprehensive analysis of structure in the young, embeddedcluster, ngc 1333 using members identified with spitzer and 2mass photometrybased on their ir-excess emission. in total, 137 members are identified in thisway, composed of 39 protostars and 98 more evolved pre-main sequence stars withdisks. of the latter class, four are transition/debris disk candidates. thefraction of exposed pre-main sequence stars with disks is 83% +/- 11%, showingthat there is a measurable diskless pre-main sequence population. the sourcesin each of the class i and class ii evolutionary states are shown to have verydifferent spatial distributions relative to the distribution of the dense gasin their natal cloud. however, the distribution of nearest neighbor spacingsamong these two groups of sources are found to be quite similar, with a strongpeak at spacings of 0.045 pc. radial and azimuthal density profiles and surfacedensity maps computed from the identified ysos show that ngc 1333 is elongatedand not strongly centrally concentrated, confirming previous claims in theliterature. we interpret these new results as signs of a low velocitydispersion, extremely young cluster that is not in virial equilibrium.

1202.1553	infrared variability of evolved protoplanetary disks: evidence for scale  height variations in the inner disk	we present the results of a multi-wavelength multi-epoch survey of fiveevolved protoplanetary disks in the ic 348 cluster that show significantinfrared variability. using 3-8micron and 24micron photometry along with5-40micron spectroscopy from the spitzer space telescope, as well asground-based 0.8-5micron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy and near-infraredphotometry, covering timescales of days to years, we examine the variability inthe disk, stellar and accretion flux. we find substantial variations (10-60%)at all infrared wavelengths on timescales of weeks to months for all of theseyoung stellar objects. this behavior is not unique when compared to othercluster members and is consistent with changes in the structure of the innerdisk, most likely scale height fluctuations on a dynamical timescale. previousobservations, along with our near-infrared photometry, indicate that thestellar fluxes are relatively constant; stellar variability does not appear todrive the large changes in the infrared fluxes. based on our near-infraredspectroscopy of the pa-beta and br-gamma lines we find that the accretion ratesare variable in most of the evolved disks but the overall rates are probablytoo small to cause the infrared variability. we discuss other possible physicalcauses for the variability, including the influence of a companion, magneticfields threading the disk, and x-ray flares.

1204.1535	luminosity functions of spitzer identified protostars in nine nearby  molecular clouds	we identify protostars in spitzer surveys of nine star-forming molecularclouds within 1 kpc: serpens, perseus, ophiuchus, chamaeleon, lupus, taurus,orion, cep ob3, and mon r2, which combined host over 700 protostar candidates.our diverse cloud sample allows us to compare protostar luminosity functions inthese varied environments. we combine photometry from 2mass j, h, and ks bandsand spitzer irac and mips 24 micron bands to create 1 - 24 micron spectralenergy distributions (seds). using protostars from the c2d survey withwell-determined bolometric luminosities (lbol), we derive a relationshipbetween lbol, l_mir (integrated from 1 - 24 microns), and sed slope.estimations of lbol for protostar candidates are combined to create luminosityfunctions for each cloud. contamination due to edge-on disks, reddened class iisources, and galaxies is estimated and removed from the luminosity functions.we find that luminosity functions for high mass star forming clouds peak near 1lsun and show a tail extending toward luminosities above 100 lsun. theluminosity functions of the low mass star forming clouds do not exhibit acommon peak, however the combined luminosity function of these regions peaksbelow 1 lsun. finally, we examine the luminosity functions as a function of thelocal surface density of ysos. in the orion molecular cloud, we find asignificant difference between the luminosity functions of protostars inregions of high and low stellar density, the former of which is biased towardmore luminous sources. this may be the result of primordial mass segregation,although this interpretation is not unique. we compare our luminosity functionsto those predicted by models and find that our observed luminosity functionsare best matched by models which invoke competitive accretion, although we donot find strong agreement of the high mass star forming clouds with any of themodels.

1208.0135	herschel far-infrared photometric monitoring of protostars in the orion  nebula cluster	we have obtained time series observations of the orion nebula cluster at 70microns and 160 microns from the herschel/pacs photometer. this represents thefirst wide-field far-infrared photometric monitoring of a young star formingregion. the acquired 35'x35' maps show complex extended structures, withunprecedented details, that trace the interaction between the molecular gas andthe young hot stars. we detect 43 protostars, most of which are situated alongthe integral-shaped filament extending from the orion nebula, through omc2 andto omc3. we present high-reliability light curves for some of these objectsusing the first six epochs of our observing program spread over 6 weeks. wefind amplitude variations in excess of 20% for a fraction of the detectedprotostars over periods as short as a few weeks. this is inconsistent with thedynamical time-scales of cool far-ir emitting material that orbits at hundredsof au from the protostar, and it suggests that the mechanism(s) responsible forthe observed variability originates from the inner region of the protostars,likely driven by variable mass accretion.

1209.3826	the spitzer space telescope survey of the orion a &amp; b molecular clouds -  part i: a census of dusty young stellar objects and a study of their mid-ir  variability	we present a survey of the orion a and b molecular clouds undertaken with theirac and mips instruments onboard spitzer. in total, five distinct fields weremapped covering 9 sq. degrees in five mid-ir bands spanning 3-24 microns. thesurvey includes the orion nebula cluster, the lynds 1641, 1630 and 1622 darkclouds, and the ngc 2023, 2024, 2068 and 2071 nebulae. these data are mergedwith the 2mass point source catalog to generate a catalog of eight bandphotometry. we identify 3479 dusty young stellar objects (ysos) in the orionmolecular clouds by searching for point sources with mid-ir colors indicativeof reprocessed light from dusty disks or infalling envelopes. the ysos aresubsequently classified on the basis of their mid-ir colors and their spatialdistributions are presented. we classify 2991 of the ysos as pre-main sequencestars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. most of the sources wereobserved with irac in 2-3 epochs over 6 months; we search for variabilitybetween the epochs by looking for correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5micron bands. we find that 50% of the dusty ysos show variability. thevariations are typically small (0.2 mag.) with the protostars showing a higherincidence of variability and larger variations. the observed correlationsbetween the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron variability suggests that we areobserving variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in theaccretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.

1211.2234	herschel/pacs spectroscopic survey of protostars in orion: the origin of  far-infrared co emission	we present far-ir (57-196 mu) spectra of 21 protostars in the orion molecularclouds, obtained with the photodetector array camera and spectrometer (pacs)onboard the herschel space observatory, as part of the herschel orion protostarsurvey (hops) program. we analyzed the co emission lines (j_up = 14-46) in thepacs spectra, extracted within a projected distance of &lt;= 2000 au centered onthe protostar. the total luminosity of the co lines observed with pacs (l(co))is found to increase with increasing l_bol. the co rotational temperatureimplied by the line ratios increases with j, and at least 3-4 rotationaltemperature components are required to fit the observed rotational diagram. therotational temperature components are remarkably invariant between protostarsand show no dependence on l_bol, t_bol or envelope density, implying that ifthe emitting gas is in lte, the co emission must arise in multiple temperaturecomponents that remain independent of l_bol over two orders of magnitudes. theobserved co emission can also be modeled as arising from a single temperaturegas component or from a medium with a power-law temperature distribution; bothof these require sub-thermally excited molecular gas at low densities (n(h_2)&lt;= 10^6 cm^-3) and high temperatures (t &gt;= 2000 k). our results suggest thatthe contribution from pdrs along the envelope cavity walls is unlikely to bethe dominant component of the co emission observed with pacs. instead, the"universality" of the rotational temperatures and the observed correlationbetween l(co) and l_bol can most easily be explained if the observed coemission originates in shock-heated, hot (t &gt;= 2000 k), sub-thermally excited(n(h_2) &lt;= 10^6 cm^-3) molecular gas. post-shock gas at these densities is morelikely to be found within the outflow cavities along the molecular outflow oralong the cavity walls at radii &gt;= several 100-1000 au.

1212.1171	evidence for environmental dependence of the upper stellar initial mass  function in orion a	we extend our previous study of the stellar population of l1641, thelower-density star-forming region of the orion a cloud south of the dense orionnebula cluster (onc), with the goal of testing whether there is a statisticallysignificant deficiency of high-mass stars in low-density regions. previously,we compared the observed ratio of low-mass stars to high-mass stars withtheoretical models of the stellar initial mass function (imf) to infer adeficiency of the highest-mass stars in l1641. we expand our population studyto identify the intermediate mass (late b to g) l1641 members in an attempt tomake a more direct comparison with the mass function of the nearby onc. thespectral type distribution and the k-band luminosity function of l1641 aresimilar to those of the onc (hillenbrand 1997; muench et al. 2002), butproblems of incompleteness and contamination prevent us from making a detailedtest for differences. we limit our analysis to statistical tests of the ratioof high-mass to low-mass stars, which indicate a probability of only 3% thatthe onc and the southern region of l1641 were drawn from the same population,supporting the hypothesis that the upper mass end of the imf is dependent onenvironmental density.

1212.1731	kinks and dents in protoplanetary disks: rapid infrared variability as  evidence for large structural perturbations	we report on synoptic observations at 3.6 and 4.5micron of young stellarobjects in ic 348 with 38 epochs covering 40 days. we find that among thedetected cluster members, 338 at [3.6] and 269 at both [3.6] and [4.5], manyare variable on daily to weekly timescales with typical fluctuations of ~0.1mag. the fraction of variables ranges from 20% for the diskless pre-mainsequence stars to 60% for the stars still surrounded by infalling envelopes. wealso find that stars in the exposed cluster core are less variable than thestars in the dense, slightly younger, south-western ridge. this trend persistseven after accounting for the underlying correlation with infrared sed type,suggesting that the change in variable fraction is not simply a reflection ofthe change in relative fraction of class i vs. class ii sources across thecloud, but instead reflects a change in variability with age. we also see astrong correlation between infrared variability and x-ray luminosity among theclass ii sources. the observed variability most likely reflects large changesin the structure of the inner wall located at the dust sublimation radius. weexplore the possibility that these structural perturbations could be caused bya hot spot on the star heating dust above the sublimation temperature, causingit to evaporate rapidly, and increasing the inner radius for a portion of thedisk. under a number of simplifying assumptions we show that this model canreproduce the size and timescale of the 3.6 and 4.5micron fluctuations.regardless of its source, the infrared variability indicates that the innerdisk is not a slowly evolving entity, but instead is a bubbling, warped, dentedmass of gas and dust whose global size and shape fluctuate in a matter of days.

0801.0492	the formation of distributed and clustered stars in molecular clouds	during the last two decades, the focus of star formation research has shiftedfrom understanding the collapse of a single dense core into a star to studyingthe formation hundreds to thousands of stars in molecular clouds. in thischapter, we overview recent observational and theoretical progress towardunderstanding star formation on the scale of molecular clouds and complexes,i.e the macrophysics of star formation. we begin with an overview of recentsurveys of young stellar objects (ysos) in molecular clouds and embeddedclusters, and we outline an emerging picture of cluster formation. we thendiscuss the role of turbulence to both support clouds and create dense,gravitationally unstable structures, with an emphasis on the role of magneticfields (in the case of distributed stars) and feedback (in the case ofclusters) to slow turbulent decay and mediate the rate and density of starformation. the discussion is followed by an overview of how gravity andturbulence may produce observed scaling laws for the properties of molecularclouds, stars and star clusters, and how the observed, low star formation ratemay result from self regulated star formation. we end with some concludingremarks, including a number of questions to be addressed by future observationsand simulations.

1308.5151	dense molecular cocoons in the massive protocluster w3 irs5: a test case  for models of massive star formation	[context] two competing models describe the formation of massive stars inobjects like the orion trapezium. in the turbulent core accretion model, theresulting stellar masses are directly related to the mass distribution of thecloud condensations. in the competitive accretion model, the gravitationalpotential of the protocluster captures gas from the surrounding cloud for whichthe individual cluster members compete. [aims] with high resolutionsubmillimeter observations of the structure, kinematics, and chemistry of theproto-trapezium cluster w3 irs5, we aim to determine which mode of starformation dominates. [methods] we present 354 ghz submillimeter arrayobservations at resolutions of 1"-3" (1800-5400 au) of w3 irs5. ......[results] the observations show five emission peaks (smm1-5). smm1 and smm2contain massive embedded stars (~20 msun); smm3-5 are starless or containlow-mass stars (&lt;8 msun). the inferred densities are high, &gt;= 10^7 cm^-3, butthe core masses are small, 0.2-0.6 msun. the detected molecular emissionreveals four different chemical zones. ...... [conclusions] the proto-trapeziumcluster w3 irs5 is an ideal test case to discriminate between models of massivestar formation. either the massive stars accrete locally from their localcores; in this case the small core masses imply that w3 irs5 is at the very endstages (1000 yr) of infall and accretion, or the stars are accreting from theglobal collapse of a massive, cluster forming core. we find that the observedmasses, densities and line widths observed toward w3 irs 5 and the surroundingcluster forming core are consistent with the competitive accretion of gas atrates of macc~10^-4 msun yr^-1 by the massive young forming stars. ......

1403.3396	on the nature of the deeply embedded protostar omc-2 fir 4	we use mid-infrared to submillimeter data from the spitzer, herschel, andapex telescopes to study the bright sub-mm source omc-2 fir 4. we find a pointsource at 8, 24, and 70 $\mu$m, and a compact, but extended source at 160, 350,and 870 $\mu$m. the peak of the emission from 8 to 70 $\mu$m, attributed to theprotostar associated with fir 4, is displaced relative to the peak of theextended emission; the latter represents the large molecular core the protostaris embedded within. we determine that the protostar has a bolometric luminosityof 37 lsun, although including more extended emission surrounding the pointsource raises this value to 86 lsun. radiative transfer models of theprotostellar system fit the observed sed well and yield a total luminosity ofmost likely less than 100 lsun. our models suggest that the bolometricluminosity of the protostar could be just 12-14 lsun, while the luminosity ofthe colder (~ 20 k) extended core could be around 100 lsun, with a mass ofabout 27 msun. our derived luminosities for the protostar omc-2 fir 4 are indirect contradiction with previous claims of a total luminosity of 1000 lsun(crimier et al 2009). furthermore, we find evidence from far-infrared molecularspectra (kama et al. 2013, manoj et al. 2013) and 3.6 cm emission (reipurth etal 1999) that fir 4 drives an outflow. the final stellar mass the protostarwill ultimately achieve is uncertain due to its association with the largereservoir of mass found in the cold core.

0803.1019	the disk population of the chamaeleon i star-forming region	we present a census of circumstellar disks in the chamaeleon i star-formingregion. using the infrared array camera and the multiband imaging photometeronboard the spitzer space telescope, we have obtained images of chamaeleon i at3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 um. to search for new disk-bearing members of thecluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors inthese data. through this work, we have discovered four new members ofchamaeleon i with spectral types of m4, m6, m7.5, and l0. the first threeobjects are highly embedded (a_j~5) and reside near known protostars,indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster(&lt;1 myr). the l0 source is the coolest known member of chamaeleon i. itsluminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 m_sun, making it the least massivebrown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. tocharacterize the disk population in chamaeleon i, we have classified theinfrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that areencompassed by the spitzer images. through these classifications, we find thatthe disk fraction in chamaeleon i is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3m_sun. these data are similar to the disk fraction of ic 348, which is a densercluster at the same age as chamaeleon i. however, the disk fraction at m&gt;1m_sun is significantly higher in chamaeleon i than in ic 348 (65% vs. 20%),indicating longer disk lifetimes in chamaeleon i for this mass range. thus,low-density star-forming regions like chamaeleon i may offer more time forplanet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters.

astro-ph;0111086	high-mass stars as early signpost of cluster formation	the connection between high-mass stars and young stellar clusters has beenwell established by near-ir observations showing young massive stars in hiiregions surrounded by clusters of lower mass stars. mm-wave observations showthat these clusters form in approx. 1000 msol dense cores. interestingly, themm-wave observations of very active cluster-forming regions also reveal thepresence of seemingly quiescent dense massive cores, which contain few signs ofongoing star formation. in the w3 main region we find an approx. 1000 msol massdense core which contains no mid-ir or cm-continuum sources. near-ir imaginghas failed to detect any embedded sources. yet, we suggest that this region isat an early stage of cluster formation. this is given support by comparativeobservations of the ngc 6334 gmc. here, we find another quiescent massive 1000msol core without mid-ir sources, hii regions, or a detectable near-ir cluster.motivated by the presence of ch3oh and h2o masers in this ir-quiet core, wehave searched for and detected a bipolar outflow driven by a young massive stardeeply embedded in the core. the presence of an embedded high-mass starstrengthens our arguments that ir-quiet cores are at an early stage of clusterformation. we propose that masers and outflows from very deeply embedded (andconsequently ir-quiet) high-mass stars are among the first incipient signpostsof cluster formation in massive cores. accordingly, we have undertaken a sestsurvey of 46 ch3oh maser clusters which are not coincident with iras sources orhii regions. from this sample, we detected outflows in transitions of siotoward 15 of the maser clusters. these sources have now been observed at 1200micron with simba, the 37-multichannel bolometer at sest. each one isassociated with a bright 1 mm point source.

astro-ph;0411445	spectroscopic confirmation of the least massive known brown dwarf in  chamaeleon	we present spectroscopy of two candidate substellar members of the chamaeleoni star-forming region. the candidates, which were identified photometrically byoasa, tamura, &amp; sugitani, have been observed at 1-2.5 micron duringcommissioning of the gemini near-infrared spectrograph. the late-type nature ofone of the candidates, ots 44, is confirmed through the detection of strongsteam absorption bands. the other object, ots 7, exhibits no late-type featuresand is likely a background star or galaxy. the gravity-sensitive shape of theh- and k-band continua demonstrate that ots 44 is a young, pre-main-sequenceobject rather than a field dwarf. we measure a spectral type of m9.5 for ots 44based on a comparison of its spectrum to data for optically-classified younglate-type objects. because ots 44 is the coolest and faintest object withconfirmed membership in chamaeleon i, it is very likely the least massive knownmember of the cluster. by comparing the position of ots 44 on the h-r diagramto the evolutionary models of chabrier &amp; baraffe, we infer a mass of ~0.015m_sun. although this estimate is uncertain by at least a factor of two, ots 44is nevertheless one of the least massive free-floating brown dwarfs confirmedspectroscopically to date.

astro-ph;0504086	the vega debris disk -- a surprise from spitzer	we present high spatial resolution mid- and far-infrared images of the vegadebris disk obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips).the disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than foundpreviously. the radius of the disk is at least 43" (330 au), 70"(543 au), and105" (815 au) in extent at 24, 70 and 160 um, respectively. the disk images arecircular, smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths. the radialsurface brightness profiles imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11"+/-2" (86au). assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, thedisk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk, viewedface-on, with the surface particle number density following an r^-1 power law.the disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models usinggrains of sizes ~1 to ~50 um. we find that a ring, containing grains largerthan 180 um and at radii of 86-200 au from the star, can reproduce the observed850 um flux, while its emission does not violate the observed mips profiles.this ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodiesanalogous to our own kuiper belt. cascades of collisions starting withencounters amongthese large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that isblown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detectits thermal emission. the dust production rate is &gt;~10^15 g/s based on the mipsresults. this rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for thedust to be produced in a steady state throughout vega's life. instead, wesuggest that the disk we imaged is ephemeral and that we are witnessing theaftermath of a large and relatively recent collisional event, and subsequentcollisional cascade.

astro-ph;0505323	irac observations of taurus pre-main sequence stars	we present infrared photometry obtained with the irac camera on the spitzerspace telescope of a sample of 82 pre-main sequence stars and brown dwarfs inthe taurus star-forming region. we find a clear separation in some iraccolor-color diagrams between objects with and without disks. a few``transition'' objects are noted, which correspond to systems in which theinner disk has been evacuated of small dust. separating pure disk systems fromobjects with remnant protostellar envelopes is more difficult at iracwavelengths, especially for objects with infall at low rates and large angularmomenta. our results generally confirm the irac color classification schemeused in previous papers by allen et al. and megeath et al. to distinguishbetween protostars, t tauri stars with disks, and young stars without (inner)disks. the observed irac colors are in good agreement with recent improved diskmodels, and in general accord with models for protostellar envelopes derivedfrom analyzing a larger wavelength region. we also comment on a few taurusobjects of special interest. our results should be useful for interpreting iracresults in other, less well-studied star-forming regions.

astro-ph;0507139	absolute calibration of the infrared array camera on the spitzer space  telescope	the infrared array camera (irac) on the spitzer space telescope is absolutelycalibrated by comparing photometry on a set of a stars near the north eclipticpole to predictions based on ground-based observations and a stellar atmospheremodel. the brightness of point sources is calibrated to an accuracy of 3%,relative to models for a star stellar atmospheres, for observations performedand analyzed in the same manner as the calibration stars. this includescorrections for location of the star in the array and the location if thecentroid within the peak pixel. long-term stability of the irac photometry wasmeasured by monitoring the brightness of a dwarfs and k giants (near the northecliptic pole) observed several times per month; the photometry is stable to1.5% (rms) over a year. intermediate-time-scale stability of the iracphotometry was measured by monitoring at least one secondary calibrator (nearthe ecliptic plane) every 12 hr while irac is in nominal operations; theintermediate-term photometry is stable with a 1% dispersion (rms). one of thesecondary calibrators was found to have significantly time-variable (5%)mid-infrared emission, with period (7.4 days) matching the optical light curve;it is possibly a cepheid variable.

astro-ph;0603096	the structure and evolution of young stellar clusters	we examine the properties of embedded clusters within 1 kiloparsec using newdata from the spitzer space telescope, as well as recent results from 2mass andother ground-based near-infrared surveys. we use surveys of entire molecularclouds to understand the range and distribution of cluster membership, size andsurface density. the spitzer data demonstrate clearly that there is a continuumof star- forming environments, from relative isolation to dense clusters. thenumber of members of a cluster is correlated with the cluster radius, such thatthe average surface density of clusters having a few to a thousand membersvaries by a factor of only a few. the spatial distributions ofspitzer-identified young stellar objects frequently show elongation, lowdensity halos, and sub-clustering. the spatial distributions of protostarsresemble the distribution of dense molecular gas, suggesting that theirmorphologies result directly from the fragmentation of the natal gas. we alsoexamine the effects of the cluster environments on star and planet formation.although far-uv and extreme-uv radiation from massive stars can truncate disksin a few million years, fewer than half of the young stars in our sample(embedded clusters within 1 kpc) are found in regions of strong fuv and euvfields. typical volume densities and lifetimes of the observed clusters suggestthat dynamical interactions are not an important mechanism for truncating diskson solar system size scales.

astro-ph;0604104	a correlation between pre-main sequence stellar rotation rates and irac  excesses in orion	early observations of t tauri stars suggested that stars with evidence ofcircumstellar accretion disks rotated slower than stars without such evidence,but more recent results are not as clear. near-ir circumstellar diskindicators, though the most widely available, are subject to uncertainties thatcan result from inner disk holes and/or the system inclination. mid-infraredobservations are less sensitive to such effects, but until now, theseobservations have been difficult to obtain. the spitzer space telescope noweasily enables mid-infrared measurements of large samples of pms stars coveringa broad mass range in nearby star-forming regions. megeath and collaboratorssurveyed the orion molecular clouds (~1 myr) with the irac instrument (3.6,4.5, 5.8, 8 microns) as part of a joint irac and mips gto program. we examinethe relationship between rotation and spitzer mid-ir fluxes for ~900 stars inorion for stars between 3 and 0.1 msun. we find in these spitzer data theclearest indication to date that stars with longer periods are more likely thanthose with short periods to have ir excesses suggestive of disks.

astro-ph;0703777	infrared extinction toward nearby star-forming regions	we present an independent estimate of the interstellar extinction law for thespitzer irac bands as well as a first attempt at extending the law to the24micron mips band. the source data for these measurements are observations offive nearby star-forming regions: the orion a cloud, ngc 2068/71, ngc 2024/23,serpens and ophiuchus. color excess ratios e(h-ks)/e(ks-[lambda]) were measuredfor stars without infrared excess dust emission from circumstellardisks/envelopes.  for four of these five regions, the extinction laws are similar at allwavelengths and differ systematically from a previous determination of theextinction law, which was dominated by the diffuse ism, derived for the iracbands. this difference could be due to the difference in the dust properties ofthe dense molecular clouds observed here and those of the diffuse ism. theextinction law at longer wavelengths toward the ophiuchus region lies betweenthat to the other four regions studied here and that for the ism. in addition,we extended our extinction law determination to 24micron for serpens and ngc2068/71 using spitzer mips data. we compare these results against several isoextinction law determinations, although in each case there are assumptionswhich make absolute comparison uncertain. however, our work confirms arelatively flatter extinction curve from 4 - 8micron than the previouslyassumed standard, as noted by all of these recent studies. the extinction lawat 24micron is consistent with previous measurements and models, although thereare relatively large uncertainties.
