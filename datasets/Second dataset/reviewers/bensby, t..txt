0903.3044	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. detailed abundance analysis of ogle-2008-blg-209s	aims. our aims are twofold. first we aim to evaluate the robustness andaccuracy of stellar parameters and detailed elemental abundances that can bederived from high-resolution spectroscopic observations of microlensed dwarfand subgiant stars. we then aim to use microlensed dwarf and subgiant stars toinvestigate the abundance structure and chemical evolution of the milky waybulge. [abridged] methods. we present a detailed elemental abundance analysisof ogle-2008-blg-209s, the source star of a new microlensing event towards thebulge, for which we obtained a high-resolution spectrum with the mikespectrograph on the magellan clay telescope. we have performed four differentanalyses of ogle-2008-blg-209s. [abridged] we have also re-analysed threeprevious microlensed dwarf stars ogle-2006-blg-265s, moa-2006-blg-099s, andogle-2007-blg-349s with the same method. this homogeneous data set, althoughsmall, enables a direct comparison between the different stellar populations.results. we find that ogle-2008-blg-209s is a subgiant star that has ametallicity of [fe/h] ~-0.33. it possesses [alpha/fe] enhancements similar towhat is found for bulge giant stars at the same metallicity, and what also isfound for nearby thick disc stars at the same metallicity. in contrast, theprevious three microlensing dwarf stars have very high metallicities,[fe/h]&gt;+0.4, and more solar-like abundance ratios, i.e. [alpha/fe]~0. thedecrease in the [alpha/fe] ratio with [fe/h] is the typical signature ofenrichment from low and intermediate mass stars. we furthermore find that theresults for the four bulge stars, in combination with results from studies ofgiant stars in the bulge, seem to favour a secular formation scenario for thebulge.

0906.2235	ogle-2009-blg-076s - the most metal-poor dwarf star in the galactic  bulge	measurements based on a large number of red giant stars suggest a broadmetallicity distribution function (mdf) for the galactic bulge, centered on[fe/h]=-0.1. however, recently, a new opportunity emerged to utilize temporaryflux amplification (by factors of ~100 or more) of faint dwarf stars in thebulge that are gravitationally lensed, making them observable withhigh-resolution spectrographs during a short observational window.surprisingly, of the first 6 stars measured, 5 have [fe/h]&gt;+0.30, suggesting ahighly skewed mdf, inconsistent with observations of giant stars. here wepresent a detailed elemental abundance analysis of ogle-2009-blg-076s, based ona high-resolution spectrum obtained with the uves spectrograph at the eso verylarge telescope. our results indicate it is the most metal-poor dwarf star inthe bulge yet observed, with [fe/h]=-0.76. our results argue against a strongselection effect disfavoring metal-poor microlensed stars. it is possible thatsmall number statistics is responsible for the giant/dwarf bulge mdfdiscrepancy. should this discrepancy survive when larger numbers of bulge dwarfstars (soon to be available) are analyzed, it may require modification of ourunderstanding of either bulge formation models, or the behavior of metal-richgiant stars.

0911.5076	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. ii. ages, metallicities, detailed elemental abundances,  and connections to the galactic thick disc	the bulge is the least understood major stellar population of the milky way.most of what we know about the formation and evolution of the bulge comes frombright giant stars. the underlying assumption that giants represent all thestars, and accurately trace the chemical evolution of a stellar population, isunder debate. in particular, recent observations of a few microlensed dwarfstars give a very different picture of the evolution of the bulge from thatgiven by the giant stars. [abridged] we perform a detailed elemental abundanceanalysis of dwarf stars in the galactic bulge, based on high-resolution spectrathat were obtained while the stars were optically magnified duringgravitational microlensing events. [abridged] we present detailed elementalabundances and stellar ages for six new dwarf stars in the galactic bulge.combining these with previous events, here re-analysed with the same methods,we study a homogeneous sample of 15 stars, which constitute the largest sampleto date of microlensed dwarf stars in the galactic bulge. we find that thestars span the full range of metallicities from [fe/h]=-0.72 to +0.54, and anaverage metallicity of &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.08+/-0.47, close to the average metallicitybased on giant stars in the bulge. furthermore, the stars follow well-definedabundance trends, that for [fe/h]&lt;0 are very similar to those of the localgalactic thick disc. this suggests that the bulge and the thick disc have had,at least partially, comparable chemical histories. at sub-solar metallicitieswe find the bulge dwarf stars to have consistently old ages, while atsuper-solar metallicities we find a wide range of ages. using the new age andabundance results from the microlensed dwarf stars we investigate possibleformation scenarios for the bulge.

1004.2833	the first chemical abundance analysis of k giants in the inner galactic  disc	the elemental abundance structure of the galactic disc has been extensivelystudied in the solar neighbourhood using long-lived stars such as f and gdwarfs or k and m giants. these are stars whose atmospheres preserve thechemical composition of their natal gas clouds, and are hence excellent tracersof the chemical evolution of the galaxy. as far as we are aware, there are nosuch studies of the inner galactic disc, which hampers our ability to constrainand trace the origin and evolution of the milky way. therefore, we aim in thisstudy to establish the elemental abundance trend(s) of the disc(s) in the innerregions of the galaxy. based on equivalent width measurements inhigh-resolution spectra obtained with the mike spectrograph on the magellan iitelescope on las campanas in chile, we determine elemental abundances for 44k-type red giant stars in the inner galactic disc, located at galactocentricdistances of 4-7\,kpc. the analysis method is identical to the one recentlyused on red giant stars in the galactic bulge and in the nearby thin and thickdiscs, enabling us to perform a truly differential comparison of the differentstellar populations. we present the first detailed elemental abundance study ofa significant number of red giant stars in the inner galactic disc. we findthat these inner disc stars show the same type of chemical and kinematicaldichotomy as the thin and thick discs show in the solar neighbourhood. theabundance trends of the inner disc agree very well with those of the nearbythick disc, and also to those of the bulge. the chemical similarities betweenthe bulge and the galactic thick disc stellar populations indicate that theyhave similar chemical histories, and any model trying to understand theformation and evolution of either of the two should preferably incorporate bothof them.

1008.3161	a possible signature of terrestrial planet formation in the chemical  composition of solar analogs	recent studies have shown that the elemental abundances in the sun areanomalous when compared to most (about 85%) nearby solar twin stars. comparedto its twins, the sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those withcondensation temperatures tc&gt;900k) relative to volatiles (tc&lt;900k). thisfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurredmore efficiently around the sun compared with the majority of solar twins.furthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundancepatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrialplanets. in this work we analyze abundance results from six large independentstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject thisobservational finding. we show that the elemental abundances derived for solaranalogs in these six studies are consistent with the tc trend suggested as aplanet formation signature. the same conclusion is reached when those resultsare averaged heterogeneously. we also investigate the dependency of theabundances with first ionization potential (fip), which correlates well withtc. a trend with fip would suggest a different origin for the abundancepatterns found, but we show that the correlation with tc is statistically moresignificant. we encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogsand late f-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formationsignature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. finally,we examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two starshosting super-earth like planets contradict the planet formation signaturehypothesis. instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two starsare fully compatible with our hypothesis.

1009.5792	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. iii. detection of lithium in the metal-poor bulge dwarf  moa-2010-blg-285s	context: in order to study the evolution of li in the galaxy it is necessaryto observe dwarf or subgiant stars. abridged although li has been extensivelystudied in the galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertaindetection of li in an unevolved bulge star. aims: our aim with this study is toprovide the first clear detection of li in the galactic bulge, based on ananalysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial li abundance.methods: we have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulgedwarf star moa-2010-blg-285s using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noisespectrum obtained with the uves spectrograph at the vlt when the object wasoptically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visualmagnification a~550 during observation). the lithium abundance was determinedthrough synthetic line profile fitting of the 7li resonance doublet line at670.8 nm. the results have been corrected for departures from lte. results:moa-2010-blg-285s is, at [fe/h]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detectedso far in the galactic bulge. its old age (12.5 gyr) and enhanced [alpha/fe]ratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. thisstar represents the first unambiguous detection of li in a metal-poor dwarfstar in the galactic bulge. we find an nlte corrected li abundance of loge(li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for galactic disk and halodwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. conclusion: our resultsshow that there are no signs of li enrichment or production in the galacticbulge during its earliest phases. observations of li in other galaxies (omegacen) and other components of the galaxy suggest further that the spite plateauis universal.

1011.6156	optical atmospheric extinction over cerro paranal	aims: the present study was conducted to determine the optical extinctioncurve for cerro paranal under typical clear-sky observing conditions, with anaccuracy of 0.01 mag/airmass. methods: the extinction curve of paranal wasobtained through low-resolution spectroscopy of 8 spectrophotometric standardstars observed with fors1 mounted at the 8.2 m very large telescope, covering aspectral range 3300-8000 a. a total of 600 spectra were collected on more than40 nights distributed over six months, from october 2008 to march 2009. theaverage extinction curve was derived using a global fit algorithm, whichallowed us to simultaneously combine all the available data. the mainatmospheric parameters were retrieved using the lblrtm radiative transfer code,which was also utilised to study the impact of variability of the mainmolecular bands of o2, o3, and h2o, and to estimate their column densities.results: in general, the extinction curve of paranal appears to conform tothose derived for other astronomical sites in the atacama desert, like la sillaand cerro tololo. however, a systematic deficit with respect to the extinctioncurve derived for cerro tololo before the el chichon eruption is detected below4000 a. we attribute this downturn to a non standard aerosol composition,probably revealing the presence of volcanic pollutants above the atacamadesert. an analysis of all spectroscopic extinction curves obtained since 1974shows that the aerosol composition has been evolving during the last 35 years.the persistence of traces of non meteorologic haze suggests the effect ofvolcanic eruptions, like those of el chichon and pinatubo, lasts severaldecades. the usage of the standard ctio and la silla extinction curvesimplemented in iraf and midas produce systematic over/under-estimates of theabsolute flux.

1106.1914	a first constraint on the thick disk scale length: differential radial  abundances in k giants at galactocentric radii 4, 8, and 12 kpc	based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the mike spectrograph on themagellan telescopes we present detailed elemental abundances for 20 red giantstars in the outer galactic disk, located at galactocentric distances between 9and 13 kpc. the outer disk sample is complemented with samples of red giantsfrom the inner galactic disk and the solar neighbourhood, analysed usingidentical methods. for galactocentric distances beyond 10 kpc, we only findchemical patterns associated with the local thin disk, even for stars far abovethe galactic plane. our results show that the relative densities of the thickand thin disks are dramatically different from the solar neighbourhood, and wetherefore suggest that the radial scale length of the thick disk is muchshorter than that of the thin disk. we make a first estimate of the thick diskscale-length of l_thick=2.0 kpc, assuming l_thin=3.8 kpc for the thin disk. wesuggest that radial migration may explain the lack of radial age, metallicity,and abundance gradients in the thick disk, possibly also explaining the linkbetween the thick disk and the metal-poor bulge.

1110.0905	chemical constraints on the formation of the galactic thick disk	we highlight some results from our detailed abundance analysis study of 703kinematically selected f and g dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. theanalysis is based on spectra of high-resolution (r=45000 to 110000) and highsignal-to-noise (s/n=150 to 300). the main findings include: (1) at a givenmetallicity, the thick disk abundance trends are more $\alpha$-enhanced thanthose of the thin disk; (2) the metal-rich limit of the thick disk reaches atleast solar metallicities; (3) the metal-poor limit of the thin disk is around[fe/h]=-0.8; (4) the thick disk shows an age-metallicity gradient; (5) the thindisk does {\it not} show an age-metallicity gradient; (6) the most metal-richthick disk stars at [fe/h]=0 are significantly older than the most metal-poorthin disk stars at [fe/h]=-0.7; (7) based on our elemental abundances we findthat kinematical criteria produce thin and thick disk stellar samples that arebiased in the sense that stars from the low-velocity tail of the thick disk areclassified as thin disk stars, and stars from the high-velocity tail of thethin disk are classified as thick disk stars; (8) age criteria appears toproduce thin and thick disk stellar samples with less contamination.

1208.1674	projected rotational velocities and stellar characterization of 350 b  stars in the nearby galactic disk	projected rotational velocities (vsini) are presented for a sample of 350early b-type main sequence stars in the nearby galactic disk. the stars arelocated within ~1.5 kpc from the sun, and the great majority within 700 pc. theanalysis is based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the mikespectrograph on the magellan clay 6.5-m telescope at the las campanasobservatory in chile.spectral types were estimated based on relativeintensities of some key line absorption ratios and comparisons to syntheticspectra. effective temperatures were estimated from the reddening-free q index,and projected rotational velocities were then determined via interpolation on apublished grid that correlates the synthetic full width at half maximum of thehe i lines at 4026, 4388 and 4471 a with vsini. as the sample has been selectedsolely on the basis of spectral types it contains an selection of b stars inthe field, in clusters, and in ob associations. the vsini distribution obtainedfor the entire sample is found to be essentially flat for vsini values between0-150 km/s, with only a modest peak at low projected rotational velocities.considering subsamples of stars, there appears to be a gradation in the vsinidistribution with the field stars presenting a larger fraction of the slowrotators and the cluster stars distribution showing an excess of stars withvsini between 70 and 130 km/s. furthermore, for a subsample of potentialrunaway stars we find that the vsini distribution resembles the distributionseen in denser environments, which could suggest that these runaway stars havebeen subject to dynamical ejection mechanisms.

1211.6848	chemical evolution of the galactic bulge as traced by microlensed dwarf  and subgiant stars. v. evidence for a wide age distribution and a complex mdf	based on high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensingevents we present a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 32 dwarf andsubgiant stars in the galactic bulge. [abridged], we now have 58 microlensedbulge dwarfs and subgiants that have been homogeneously analysed. the maincharacteristics of the sample and the findings that can be drawn are: (i) themetallicity distribution (mdf) is wide and spans all metallicities between[fe/h]=-1.9 to +0.6; (ii) the dip in the mdf around solar metallicity that wasapparent in our previous analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) isno longer evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications ofmultiple components are starting to emerge. [abridged]; (iii) the stars with[fe/h]&lt;-0.1 are old with ages between 10 and 12 gyr; (iv) the metal-rich starswith [fe/h]&gt;-0.1 show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 gyr with adistribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 gyr and a tail towards higherages; (v) there are indications in the [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] that the "knee"occurs around [fe/h] = -0.3 to -0.2, which is a slightly higher metallicity ascompared to the "knee" for the local thick disk. this suggests that thechemical enrichment of the metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than whatis observed for the local thick disk. the results from the microlensed bulgedwarf stars in combination with other findings in the literature, in particularthe evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the milkyway could be an almost pure disk galaxy. the bulge would then just be aconglomerate of the other galactic stellar populations (thin disk, thick disk,halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of the galaxy,influenced by the galactic bar.

1312.1759	quantitative chemical tagging, stellar ages and the chemo-dynamical  evolution of the galactic disc	the early science results from the new generation of high-resolution stellarspectroscopic surveys, such as galah and the gaia-eso survey, will representmajor milestones in the quest to chemically tag the galaxy. yet this techniqueto reconstruct dispersed coeval stellar groups has remained largely untesteduntil recently. we build on previous work that developed an empirical chemicaltagging probability function, which describes the likelihood that two fieldstars are conatal, that is, they were formed in the same cluster environment.in this work we perform the first ever blind chemical tagging experiment, i.e.,tagging stars with no known or otherwise discernable associations, on a sampleof 714 disc field stars with a number of high quality high resolutionhomogeneous metal abundance measurements. we present evidence that chemicaltagging of field stars does identify coeval groups of stars, yet these groupsmay not represent distinct formation sites, e.g. as in dissolved open clusters,as previously thought. our results point to several important conclusions,among them that group finding will be limited strictly to chemical abundancespace, e.g. stellar ages, kinematics, colors, temperature and surface gravitydo not enhance the detectability of groups. we also demonstrate that inaddition to its role in probing the chemical enrichment and kinematic historyof the galactic disc, chemical tagging represents a powerful new stellar agedetermination technique.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1401.0541	young stars in an old bulge: a natural outcome of internal evolution in  the milky way	the center of our disk galaxy, the milky way, is dominated by aboxy/peanut-shaped bulge. numerous studies of the bulge based on stellarphotometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. theperceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likelyformation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique populationthat formed early and separately from the disk. however, recent studies ofindividual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that theyspan a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithicstructure. in this letter we demonstrate that the presence of young stars thatare located predominantly near the plane is expected for a bulge that hasformed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. using an n-body+sphsimulation of a disk galaxy forming out of gas cooling inside a dark matterhalo and forming stars, we find a qualitative agreement between our model andthe observations of young metal-rich stars in the bulge. we are also able topartially resolve the apparent contradiction in the literature between resultsthat argue for a purely old bulge population and those which show a populationcomprised of a range in ages; the key is where to look.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1401.4979	the gaia-eso survey: kinematic structure in the gamma velorum cluster	context: a key science goal of the gaia-eso survey (ges) is to use thekinematics of low-mass stars in young clusters to probe their dynamicalhistories and how they populate the field as they become unbound. theclustering of low-mass stars around the massive w-r binary gamma^2 velorum wasone of the first ges targets. aims: to empirically determine the radialvelocity (rv) precision of ges data, construct a kinematically unbiased sampleof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. methods: targetswere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolutionspectroscopy used to derive rvs and assess membership from the strength of theli6708a line. the rv distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihoodtechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. results: the ges rv precisionis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-masspopulation around gamma^2 vel. the structure is well fitted by two kinematiccomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsicdispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. the secondhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by~2km/s. the first population is older by 1-2myr based on a greater level of lidepletion seen among its m-stars and is probably more centrally concentratedaround gamma^2 vel. conclusions: we consider several formation scenarios,concluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of theoriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 vel, and a dispersed populationfrom the wider vela ob2 association, of which gamma^2 vel is the most massivemember. the apparent youth of gamma^2 vel compared to the older (&gt;=10myr)low-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binaryformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of thelow-mass stars.[abridged]

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1403.7568	the gaia-eso survey: the galactic thick to thin disc transition	(abridged) we have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/fe] abundances andradial velocities, determined from the gaia-eso survey giraffe spectra offgk-type stars (idr1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of thedisc stellar populations. we focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with highquality parameters, covering the volume |z|&lt;4.5kpc and r in the range 2-13kpc.we have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/fe] vs [m/h]plane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number densitydistribution. the thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layersabove the galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/fe] decreases.the thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to theplane at all metallicities. our data confirm the already known correlationsbetween v_phi and [m/h] for the two discs. for the thick disc sequence, a studyof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to64km/s/dex. the distributions of v_phi, v_z, and orbital parameters areanalysed for the chemically separated samples. concerning the gradients withgalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of v_phi, a[m/h] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/fe] gradient. forthe thick disc, flat gradients in [m/h] and [alpha/fe] are derived. ourchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems tohave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increasedprogressively, and, possibly, the v_phi dispersion decreased. at [m/h]-0.25dexand [alpha/fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance tothe galactic plane, v_phi, v_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with thoseof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between thesepopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

1408.6687	the gaia-eso survey: the chemical structure of the galactic discs from  the first internal data release	most high-resolution spectroscopic studies of the galactic discs were mostlyconfined to objects in the solar vicinity. here we aim at enlarging the volumein which individual chemical abundances are used to characterise both discs,using the first internal data release of the gaia-eso survey. we derive anddiscuss the abundances of eight elements (mg, al, si, ca, ti, fe, cr, ni, andy). the trends of these elemental abundances with iron are very similar tothose in the solar neighbourhood. we find a natural division between alpha-richand alpha-poor stars, best seen in the bimodality of the [mg/m] distributionsin bins of metallicity, which we attribute to thick- and thin-disc sequences,respectively. with the possible exception of al, the observed dispersion aroundthe trends is well described by the expected errors, leaving little room forastrophysical dispersion. using previously derived distances from recio-blancoet al. (2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1512.03835	the gaia-eso survey: separating disk chemical substructures with cluster  models	(abridged) recent spectroscopic surveys have begun to explore the galacticdisk system outside the solar neighborhood on the basis of large data samples.in this way, they provide valuable information for testing spatial and temporalvariations of disk structure kinematics and chemical evolution. we used agaussian mixture model algorithm, as a rigurous mathematical approach, toseparate in the [mg/fe] vs. [fe/h] plane a clean disk star subsample from thegaia-eso survey internal data release 2. we find that the sample is separatedinto five groups associated with major galactic components; the metal-rich endof the halo, the thick disk, and three subgroups for the thin disk sequence.this is confirmed with a sample of red clump stars from the apache pointobservatory galactic evolution experiment (apogee) survey. the twometal-intermediate and metal-rich groups of the thin disk decomposition([fe/h]&gt;-0.25 dex) highlight a change in the slope at solar metallicity. thisholds true at different radial regions. the distribution of galactocentricradial distances of the metal-poor part of the thin disk ([fe/h]&lt;-0.25 dex) isshifted to larger distances than those of the more metal-rich parts. moreover,the metal-poor part of the thin disk presents indications of a scale heightintermediate between those of the thick and the rest of the thin disk, and itdisplays higher azimuthal velocities than the latter. these stars might haveformed and evolved in parallel and/or dissociated from the inside-out formationtaking place in the internal thin disk. their enhancement levels might be dueto their origin from gas pre-enriched by outflows from the thick disk or theinner halo. the smooth trends of their properties (their spatial distributionwith respect to the plane, in particular) with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] suggested bythe data indicates a quiet dynamical evolution, with no relevant merger events.

0807.3982	a glimpse into the nature of galactic mid-ir excesses	we investigate the nature of the mid-ir excess for 31 intermediate-mass starsthat exhibit an 8 micron excess in either the galactic legacy infraredmid-plane survey extraordinaire or the mid-course space experiment using highresolution optical spectra to identify stars surrounded by warm circumstellardust. from these data we determine projected stellar rotational velocities andestimate stellar effective temperatures for the sample. we estimate stellarages from these temperatures, parallactic distances, and evolutionary models.using mips [24] measurements and stellar parameters we determine the nature ofthe infrared excess for 19 glimpse stars. we find that 15 stars exhibit halphaemission and four exhibit halpha absorption. assuming that the mid-ir excessesarise in circumstellar disks, we use the halpha fluxes to model and estimatethe relative contributions of dust and free-free emission. six stars exhibithalpha fluxes that imply free-free emission can plausibly explain the infraredexcess at [24]. these stars are candidate classical be stars. nine starsexhibit halpha emission, but their halpha fluxes are insufficient to explainthe infrared excesses at [24], suggesting the presence of a circumstellar dustcomponent. after the removal of the free-free component in these sources, wedetermine probable disk dust temperatures of tdisk~300-800 k and fractionalinfrared luminosities of l(ir)/l(*)~10^-3. these nine stars may bepre-main-sequence stars with transitional disks undergoing disk clearing. threeof the four sources showing halpha absorption exhibit circumstellar disktemperatures ~300-400 k, l(ir)/l(*)~10^-3, ir colors k-[24]&lt; 3.3, and are warmdebris disk candidates. one of the four halpha absorption sources has k-[24]&gt;3.3 implying an optically thick outer disk and is a transition disk candidate.

astro-ph;0106123	the distance scale of planetary nebulae	by collecting distances from the literature, a set of 73 planetary nebulaewith mean distances of high accuracy is derived. this sample is used forrecalibration of the mass-radius relationship, used by many statisticaldistance methods. an attempt to correct for a statistical peculiarity, whereerrors in the distances influences the mass--radius relationship by increasingits slope, has been made for the first time. distances to pne in the galacticbulge, derived by this new method as well as other statistical methods from thelast decade, are then used for the evaluation of these methods as distanceindicators. in order of achieving a bulge sample that is free from outliers wederive new criteria for bulge membership. these criteria are much morestringent than those used hitherto, in the sense that they also discriminateagainst background objects. by splitting our bulge sample in two, one withoptically thick (small) pne and one with optically thin (large) pne, we findthat our calibration is of higher accuracy than most other calibrations.differences between the two subsamples, we believe, are due to theincompleteness of the bulge sample, as well as the dominance of opticaldiameters in the ``thin'' sample and radio diameters in the ``thick'' sample.  our final conclusion is that statistical methods give distances that are atleast as accurate as the ones obtained from many individual methods. also, the`long' distance scale of galactic pne is confirmed.

astro-ph;0211589	signatures of sn ia in the galactic thick disk	we present the first results of a larger study into the stellar abundancesand chemical trends in long-lived dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood thatbelong to (based on their kinematics) the thin and thick galactic disk,respectively. we confirm that the trends of alpha-elements in the thin andthick disk are distinct (this has previously been shown for mg by fuhrmann1998, but e.g. chen et al. 2000 claimed the trends to follow smoothly upon eachother). we find that the thick disk show the typical signature of contributionfrom sn ia (i.e. the ``knee'') to the enrichment of the interstellar gas out ofwhich the later generations of thick disk stars formed. the trend starts out as[mg/fe] ~0.35 at [fe/h] ~ -0.7 and continue on this level with increasing[fe/h] until -0.4 dex where a decline in [mg/fe] starts and steadily continuesdown to 0 dex at solar metallicity. the same is true for the otheralpha-elements (e.g. si). using ages from the literature we find that the thickdisk in the mean is older than the thin disk. combining our results with otherobservational facts we suggest that the most likely formation scenario for thethick disk is, still, a violent merger event. we also suggest that there mightbe tentativeevidence for diffusion of orbits in todays thin disk (based onkinematics in combination with elemental abundances).

astro-ph;0304182	a differential study of the oxygen abundances in the galactic thin and  thick disks	first results from a study into the abundance trends of oxygen in thegalactic thin and thick disks are presented. oxygen abundances for 63 nearby fand g dwarf stars, based on very high resolution spectra ($r\sim215 000$) andhigh signal-to-noise ($s/n&gt;400$) of the faint forbidden oxygen line at 6300{\aa}, have been determined. our findings can be summarized as follows: {\bf1)} at $\rm [fe/h]&lt;0$ the oxygen trends in the thin and thick disk are smoothand distinct, indicating their different origins, {\bf 2)} $\rm [o/fe]$ for thethick disk stars show a turn-over at [fe/h]$\sim -0.35$, indicating the peak ofthe enrichment from sne type ia to the interstellar medium, {\bf 3)} the thindisk stars show a shallow decrease going from $\rm [fe/h] \sim -0.7$ to thehighest metallicities with no apparent turn-over present indicating a morequiet star formation history, and {\bf 4)} $\rm [o/fe]$ continues to decreaseat $\rm [fe/h]&gt;0$ without showing the leveling out that previously has beenseen.

astro-ph;0310741	oxygen trends in the galactic thin and thick disks	we present oxygen abundances for 72 f and g dwarf stars in the solarneighbourhood. using the kinematics of the stars we divide them into twosub-samples with space velocities that are typical for the thick and thindisks, respectively. the metallicities of the stars range from [fe/h] = -0.9 to+0.4 and we use the derived oxygen abundances of the stars to: (1) perform adifferential study of the oxygen trends in the thin and the thick disk; (2) tofollow the trend of oxygen in the thin disk to the highest metallicities. weanalyze the forbidden oxygen lines at 6300 {\aa} and 6363 {\aa} as well as the(nlte afflicted) triplet lines around 7774 {\aa}. for the forbidden line at6300 a we have spectra of very high s/n (&gt;400) and resolution (r=215 000). thishas enabled a very accurate modeling of the oxygen line and the blending nilines. the high internal accuracy in our determination of the oxygen abundancesfrom this line is reflected in the very tight trends we find for oxygenrelative to iron........

astro-ph;0403591	a possible age-metallicity relation in the galactic thick disk?	a sample of 229 nearby thick disk stars has been used to investigate theexistence of an age-metallicity relation (amr) in the galactic thick disk. theresults indicate that that there is indeed an age-metallicity relation presentin the thick disk. by dividing the stellar sample into sub-groups, separated by0.1 dex in metallicity, we show that the median age decreases by about 5-7 gyrwhen going from [fe/h]=-0.8 to [fe/h]=-0.1. combining our results with ournewly published alpha-element trends for a local sample of thick disk stars,that show signatures from supernovae type ia (snia), we can here draw theconclusion that the time-scale for the peak of the snia rate is of the order3-4 gyr in the thick disk. the tentative evidence for a thick disk amr that wepresent here also has implications for the thick disk formation scenario;star-formation must have been an ongoing process for several billion years.this is further discussed here and appear to strengthen the hypothesis that thethick disk originates from a merger event with a companion galaxy that puffedup a pre-existing thin disk.

astro-ph;0412132	alpha-, r-, and s-process element trends in the galactic thin and thick  disks	from a detailed elemental abundance analysis of 102 f and g dwarf stars wepresent abundance trends in the galactic thin and thick disks for 14 elements(o, na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, cr, fe, ni, zn, y, ba, and eu). stellar parametersand elemental abundances (except for y, ba and eu) for 66 of the 102 stars werepresented in our previous studies (bensby et al. 2003, 2004a). the 36 starsthat are new in this study extend and confirm our previous results and allow usto draw further conclusions regarding abundance trends. the s-process elementsy and ba, and the r-element eu have also been considered here for the wholesample for the first time. with this new larger sample we now have thefollowing results: 1) smooth and distinct trends that for the thin and thickdisks are clearly separated; 2) the alpha-element trends for the thick diskshow typical signatures from the enrichment of snia; 3) the thick disk stellarsample is in the mean older than the thin disk stellar sample; 4) the thickdisk abundance trends are invariant with galactocentric radii (r_m); 5) thethick disk abundance trends appear to be invariant with vertical distance(z_max) from the galactic plane. adding further evidence from the literaure weargue that a merger/interacting scenario with a companion galaxy to produce akinematical heating of the stars (that make up today's thick disk) in apre-existing old thin disk is the most likely formation scenario for thegalactic thick disk.

astro-ph;0506145	carbon abundances in the galactic thin and thick disks	although carbon is, together with oxygen and nitrogen, one of the mostimportant elements in the study of galactic chemical evolution its productionsites are still poorly known and have been much debated (see e.g. gustafsson etal. 1999; chiappini et al. 2003). to trace the origin and evolution of carbonwe have determined carbon abundances from the forbidden [c i] line at 8727 aand made comparisons to oxygen abundances from the forbidden [o i] line at 6300a in a sample of 51 nearby f and g dwarf stars. these data and the fact thatthe forbidden [c i] and [o i] lines are very robust abundance indicators (theyare essentially insensitive to deviations from lte and uncertainties in thestellar parameters, see, e.g., gustafsson et al. 1999; asplund et al. 2005)enable us to very accurately measure the c/o ratio as well as individual c ando abundances. our first results indicate that the time-scale for the mainsource that contribute to the carbon enrichment of the interstellar mediumoperate on the same time-scale as those that contribute to the iron enrichment(and can possibly be agb stars...)

astro-ph;0601130	the origin and chemical evolution of carbon in the galactic thin and  thick disks	[abridged] in order to trace the origin and evolution of carbon in thegalactic disk we have determined carbon abundances in 51 nearby f and g dwarfstars. the sample is divided into two kinematically distinct subsamples with 35and 16 stars that are representative of the galactic thin and thick disks,respectively. the analysis is based on spectral synthesis of the forbidden [ci] line at 872.7 nm using spectra of very high resolution (r~220000)and highsignal-to-noise (s/n&gt;300) that were obtained with the ces spectrograph on theeso 3.6-m telescope on la silla in chile. we find that [c/fe] versus [fe/h]trends for the thin and thick disks are totally merged and flat for sub-solarmetallicities. the thin disk that extends to higher metallicities than thethick disk,shows a shallow decline in [c/fe] from [fe/h]=0 and up to[fe/h]=+0.4. the [c/o] versus [o/h] trends are well separated between the twodisks (due to differences in the oxygen abundances)and bear a great resemblanceto the [fe/o] versus [o/h] trends. our interpretation of our abundance trendsis that the sources that are responsible for the carbon enrichment in thegalactic thin and thick disks have operated on a time-scale very similar tothose that are responsible for the fe and y enrichment (i.e., snia and agbstars, respectively)...... for the galaxy we hence conclude that the carbonenrichment at metallicities typical of the disk is mainly due to low andintermediate mass stars, while massive stars are still the main carboncontributor at low metallicities (halo and metal-poor thick disk).

astro-ph;0610754	hercules stream stars and the metal-rich thick disk	using the mike spectrograph, mounted on the 6.5 m magellan/clay telescope atthe las campanas observatory in chile, we have obtained high-resolution spectrafor 60 f and g dwarf stars, all likely members of a density enhancement in thelocal velocity distribution, referred to as the hercules stream. comparing withan existing sample of 102 thin and thick disk stars we have used spacevelocities, detailed elemental abundances, and stellar ages to trace the originof the hercules stream. we find that the hercules stream stars show a widespread in stellar ages, metallicities, and element abundances. however, thespreads are not random but separate the hercules stream into the abundance andage trends as outlined by either the thin disk or the thick disk. we henceclaim that the major part of the hercules stream actually are thin and thickdisk stars. these diverse properties of the hercules stream point toward adynamical origin, probably caused by the galactic bar. however, we can at themoment not entirely rule out that the hercules stream could be the remnants ofa relatively recent merger event.

astro-ph;0703488	manganese trends in a sample of thin and thick disk stars. the origin of  mn	context: manganese is an iron-peak element and although the nucleosynthesispath that leads to its formation is fairly well understood, it remains unclearwhich objects, sn ii and/or sn ia, that contribute the majority of mn to theinterstellar medium. it also remains unclear to which extent the supernovae mnyields depend on the metallicity of the progenitor star or not. aims: by usinga well studied and well defined sample of 95 dwarf stars we aim at furtherconstraining the formation site(s) of mn. methods: we derive mn abundancesthrough spectral synthesis of four mn i lines at 539.4, 549.2, 601.3, and 601.6nm. stellar parameters and data for oxygen are taken from bensby et al. (2003,2004, 2005). results: when comparing our mn abundances with o abundances forthe same stars we find that the abundance trends in the stars with kinematicsof the thick disk can be explained by metallicity dependent yields from sn ii.we go on and combine our data for dwarf stars in the disks with data for dwarfand giant stars in the metal-poor thick disk and halo from the literature. wefind that dwarf and giant stars show the same trends, which indicates thatneither non-lte nor evolutionary effects are a major concern for mn.furthermore, the [mn/o] vs [o/h] trend in the halo is flat. conclusions: weconclude that the simplest interpretation of our data is that mn is most likelyproduced in sn ii and that the mn yields for such snae must be metallicitydependent. contribution from sn ia in the metal-rich thin disk can not,however, be excluded.

0811.1777	the galactic stellar disc	the study of the milky way stellar discs in the context of galaxy formationis discussed. in particular we explore the properties of the milky way discusing a new sample of about 550 dwarf stars for which we have recently obtainedelemental abundances and ages based on high resolution spectroscopy. for allthe stars we also have full kinematic information as well as information abouttheir stellar orbits. we confirm results from previous studies that the thinand the thick disc have distinct abundance patterns. but we also explore alarger range of orbital parameters than what has been possible in our previousstudies. several new results are presented. we find that stars that reacheshigh above the galactic plane and have eccentric orbits show remarkably tightabundance trends. this implies that these stars formed out of well mixed gasthat had been homogenized over large volumes. we find some evidence that pointto that the event that most likely caused the heating of this stellarpopulation happened a few billion years ago. through a simple, kinematicexploration of stars with super-solar [fe/h] we show that the solarneighbourhood contains metal-rich, high velocity stars that very likely areassociated with the thick disc. additionally, the hr1614 moving group and thehercules and arcturus stellar streams are discussed and it is concluded that,probably, a large fraction of the so far identified groups and streams in thedisc are the result of evolution and interactions within the stellar discrather than being dissolved stellar clusters or engulfed dwarf galaxies.
