0902.3163	does bulk viscosity create a viable unified dark matter model?	we investigate in detail the possibility that a single imperfect fluid withbulk viscosity can replace the need for separate dark matter and dark energy incosmological models. with suitable choices of model parameters, we show thatthe background cosmology in this model can mimic that of a lcdm universe tohigh precision. however, as the cosmic expansion goes through thedecelerating-accelerating transition, the density perturbations in this fluidare rapidly damped out. we show that,although this does not significantlyaffect structure formation in baryonic matter, it makes the gravitationalpotential decay rapidly at late times, leading to modifications in predictionsof cosmological observables such as the cmb power spectrum and weak lensing.this model of unified dark matter is thus difficult to reconcile withastronomical observations. we also clarify the differences with respect toother unified dark matter models where the fluid is barotropic, i.e., p=p(rho),such as the (generalized) chaplygin gas model, and point out theirobservational difficulties. we also summarize the status of dark sector modelswith no new dynamical degrees of freedom introduced and discuss the problemswith them.

0906.3880	structure formation by fifth force i: n-body vs. linear simulations	we lay out the frameworks to numerically study the structure formation inboth linear and nonlinear regimes in general dark-matter-coupled scalar fieldmodels, and give an explicit example where the scalar field serves as adynamical dark energy. adopting parameters of the scalar field which yield arealistic cmb spectrum, we generate the initial conditions for our n-bodysimulations, which follow the spatial distributions of the dark matter and thescalar field by solving their equations of motion using the multilevel adaptivegrid technique. we show that the spatial configuration of the scalar fieldtracks well the voids and clusters of dark matter. indeed, the propagation ofscalar degree of freedom effectively acts a fifth force on dark matterparticles, whose range and magnitude are determined by the two model parameters(mu, gamma), local dark matter density as well as the background value for thescalar field. the model behaves like the lcdm paradigm on scales relevant tothe cmb spectrum, which are well beyond the probe of the local fifth force andthus not significantly affected by the matter-scalar coupling. on scalescomparable or shorter than the range of the local fifth force, the fifth forceis perfectly parallel to gravity and their strengths have a fixed ratio2gamma^2 determined by the matter-scalar coupling, provided that the chameleoneffect is weak; if on the other hand there is a strong chameleon effect (i.e.,the scalar field almost resides at its effective potential minimum everywherein the space), the fifth force indeed has suppressed effects in high densityregions and shows no obvious correlation with gravity, which means that thedark-matter-scalar-field coupling is not simply equivalent to a rescaling ofthe gravitational constant or the mass of the dark matter particles.

0910.3207	structure formation by fifth force: power spectrum from n-body  simulations	we lay out the framework to numerically study nonlinear structure formationin the context of scalar-field-coupled cold dark matter models (phicdm models)where the scalar field phi serves as dynamical dark energy. adopting parametersfor the scalar field which yield a realistic cmb spectrum, we generate theinitial conditions for our nbody simulations, which follow the spatialdistributions of dark matter and the scalar field, by solving their equationsof motion using the multilevel adaptive grid technique. we show that thespatial configuration of the scalar field tracks both the voids and clusters ofdark matter. the phicdm model differs from standard lcdm at small scales withobservable modifications of, e.g., the mass function of halos as well as thematter power spectrum. nevertheless, the predictions of both models for thehubble expansion and the cmb spectrum are virtually indistinguishable. hence,galaxy cluster counts and weak lensing observations, which probe structureformation at small scales, are needed to falsify this class of models.

0707.2664	the cosmology of ricci-tensor-squared gravity in the palatini  variational approach	we consider the cosmology of the ricci-tensor-squared gravity in the palatinivariational approach. the gravitational action of standard general relativityis modified by adding a function f(r^abr_ab) to the einstein-hilbert action,and the palatini variation is used to derive the field equations. a generalmethod of obtaining the background and first-order covariant andgauge-invariant perturbation equations is outlined. as an example, we considerthe cosmological constraints on such theories arising from the supernova typeia and cosmic microwave background observations. we find that the best fit tothe data is a non-null leading-order correction to einstein gravity, but thecurrent data exhibit no significant preference over the concordance model. thegrowth of non-relativistic matter density perturbations at late times is alsoanalyzed, and we find that a scale-dependent (positive or negative)sound-speed-squared term generally appears in the growth equation forsmall-scale density perturbations. we also estimate the observational boundimposed by the matter power spectrum for the model with f(r^abr_ab) =alpha(r^abr_ab)^beta to be roughly |\beta| \lesssim o(10^{-5}) so long as thedark matter does not possess compensating anisotropic stresses.

1001.3152	structure formation by the fifth force iii: segregation of baryons and  dark matter	in this paper we present the results of $n$-body simulations with a scalarfield coupled differently to cold dark matter (cdm) and baryons. the scalarfield potential and coupling function are chosen such that the scalar fieldacquires a heavy mass in regions with high cdm density and thus behaves like achameleon. we focus on how the existence of the scalar field affects theformation of nonlinear large-scale structure, and how the different couplingsof the scalar field to baryons and cdm particles lead to differentdistributions and evolutions for these two matter species, both on large scalesand inside virialized halos. as expected, the baryon-cdm segregation increasesin regions where the fifth force is strong, and little segregation in denseregions. we also introduce an approximation method to identify the virializedhalos in coupled scalar field models which takes into account the scalar fieldcoupling and which is easy to implement numerically. it is find that thechameleon nature of the scalar field makes the internal density profiles ofhalos dependent on the environment in a very nontrivial way.

1005.4231	n-body simulations for coupled scalar field cosmology	we describe in detail the general methodology and numerical implementation ofconsistent n-body simulations for coupled scalar field cosmological models,including the background cosmology and the generation of initial conditions(with the different couplings to different matter species taken into account).we perform fully consistent simulations for a class of coupled scalar fieldmodels with an inverse power-law potential and negative coupling constant, forwhich the chameleon mechanism does not operate. we find that in suchcosmological models the scalar-field potential plays a negligible role exceptin the background expansion, and the fifth force that is produced isproportional to gravity in magnitude, justifying the use of a rescaledgravitational constant g in some earlier n-body simulations of similar models.we study the effects of the scalar coupling on the nonlinear matter powerspectra and compare with linear perturbation calculations to investigate wherethe nonlinear model deviates from the linear approximation. for the first time,the algorithm to identify gravitationally virialized matter halos is adapted tothe scalar field cosmology, and then used to measure the mass function andstudy the properties of virialized halos. we find that the net effect of thescalar coupling helps produce more heavy halos in our simulation boxes andsuppresses the inner (but not the outer) density profile of halos compared withthose predicted by lambda-cdm, while this suppression weakens as the couplingbetween the scalar field and dark matter particles increases in strength.

1009.1400	n-body simulations for extended quintessence models	we introduce the n-body simulation technique to follow structure formation inlinear and nonlinear regimes for the extended quintessence models(scalar-tensor theories in which the scalar field has a self-interactionpotential and behaves as dark energy), and apply it to a class of modelsspecified by an inverse power-law potential and a non-minimal coupling. ourfull solution of the scalar field perturbation confirms that, when thepotential is not too nonlinear, the effects of the scalar field could beaccurately approximated as a modification of background expansion rate plus arescaling of the effective gravitational constant relevant for structuregrowth. for the models we consider, these have opposite effects, leading to aweak net effect in the linear perturbation regime. however, on the nonlinearscales the modified expansion rate dominates and could produce interestingsignatures in the matter power spectrum and mass function, which might be usedto improve the constraints on the models from cosmological data. we show thatthe density profiles of the dark matter halos are well described by thenavarro-frenk-white formula, although the scalar field could change theconcentration. we also derive an analytic formula for the scalar fieldperturbation inside halos assuming nfw density profile and sphericity, whichagrees well with numerical results if the parameter is appropriately tuned. theresults suggest that for the models considered, the spatial variation of thescalar field (and thus the locally measured gravitational constant) is veryweak, and so local experiments could see the background variation ofgravitational constant.
{fenge}
1009.1406	voids in coupled scalar field cosmology	we study the properties of voids in two different types of coupled scalarfield theories. due to the fifth force produced by the scalar field coupling,the matter particles feel stronger attraction amongst each other and clustermore quickly than they do in the standard lcdm model. consequently voids in thecoupled scalar field theories start to develop earlier and end up bigger, whichis confirmed by our numerical simulations. we find that a significantly largerportion of the whole space is under-densed in the coupled scalar field theoriesand there are more voids whose sizes exceed given thresholds. this is moreprominent in early times because at later times the under-dense regions havealready been evacuated in coupled scalar field theories and there is time forthe lcdm model to catch up. the coupled scalar field theories also predict asharper transition between voids and high density regions. all in all, thequalitative behaviour is different not only from the lcdm result, but alsoamongst specific coupled scalar field models, making voids a potentialcandidate to test alternative ideas about the cosmic structure formation.

1010.3748	on the effects of coupled scalar fields on structure formation	a coupling between a scalar field (representing the dark energy) and darkmatter could produce rich phenomena in cosmology. it affects cosmic structureformation mainly through the fifth force, a velocity-dependent force that actsparallel to particle's direction of motion and proportional to its speed, aneffective rescaling of the particle masses, and a modified background expansionrate. in many cases these effects entangle and it is difficult to see which isthe dominant one. here we perform n-body simulations to study their qualitativebehaviour and relative importance in affecting the key structure formationobservables, for a model with exponential scalar field coupling. we find thatthe fifth force, a prominent example of the scalar-coupling effects, is farless important than the rescaling of particle mass or the modified expansionrate. in particular, the rescaling of particle masses is shown to be the keyfactor leading to less concentration of particles in halos than in lcdm, apattern which is also observed in previous independent coupled scalar fieldsimulations.

0709.4581	detecting a lorentz-violating field in cosmology	we consider cosmology in the einstein-aether theory (the generally covarianttheory of gravitation coupled to a dynamical timelike lorentz-violating vectorfield) with a linear aether-lagrangian. the 3+1 spacetime splitting approach isused to derive covariant and gauge invariant perturbation equations which arevalid for a general class of lagrangians. restricting attention to theparameter space of these theories which is consistent with local gravityexperiments, we show that there are tracking behaviors for the aether field,both in the background cosmology and at linear perturbation level. theprimordial power-spectrum of scalar perturbations in this model is shown to bethe same that predicted by standard general relativity. however, thepower-spectrum of tensor perturbation is different from that in generalrelativity, but has a smaller amplitude and so cannot be detected at present.we also study the implications for late-time cosmology and find that theevolution of photon and neutrino anisotropic stresses can source the aetherfield perturbation during the radiation and matter dominated epochs, and as aresult the cmb and matter power spectra are modified. however these effects aredegenerate with respect to other cosmological parameters, such as neutrinomasses and the bias parameter in the observed galaxy spectrum.

1110.1379	ecosmog: an efficient code for simulating modified gravity	we introduce a new code, ecosmog, to run n-body simulations for a wide classof modified gravity and dynamical dark energy theories. these theoriesgenerally have one or more new dynamical degrees of freedom, the dynamics ofwhich are governed by their (usually rather nonlinear) equations of motion.solving these non-linear equations has been a great challenge in cosmology. ourcode is based on the ramses code, which solves the poisson equation onadaptively refined meshes to gain high resolutions in the high-density regions.we have added a solver for the extra degree(s) of freedom and performednumerous tests for the f(r) gravity model as an example to show itsreliability. we find that much higher efficiency could be achieved comparedwith other existing mesh/grid-based codes thanks to two new features of thepresent code: (1) the efficient parallelisation and (2) the usage of themultigrid relaxation to solve the extra equation(s) on both the regular domaingrid and refinements, giving much faster convergence even under much morestringent convergence criteria. this code is designed for performinghigh-accuracy, high-resolution and large-volume cosmological simulations formodified gravity and general dark energy theories, which can be utilised totest gravity and the dark energy hypothesis using the upcoming and future deepand high-resolution galaxy surveys.

1203.5125	chameleon f(r) gravity in the virialized cluster	current constraints on f(r) gravity from the large-scale structure are at theverge of penetrating into a region where the modified forces become nonlinearlysuppressed. for a consistent treatment of observables at these scales, we studycluster quantities produced in chameleon and linearized hu-sawicki f(r) gravitydark matter n-body simulations. we find that the standard navarro-frenk-whitehalo density profile and the radial power law for the pseudo phase-spacedensity provide equally good fits for f(r) clusters as they do in the newtonianscenario. we give qualitative arguments for why this should be the case. forpractical applications, we derive analytic relations, e.g., for the f(r) scalarfield, the gravitational potential, and the velocity dispersion as seen withinthe virialized clusters. these functions are based on three degrees of freedomfitted to simulations, i.e., the characteristic density, scale, and velocitydispersion. we further analyze predictions for these fitting parameters fromthe gravitational collapse and the jeans equation, which are found to agreewell with the simulations. our analytic results can be used to consistentlyconstrain chameleon f(r) gravity with future observations on virialized clusterscales without the necessity of running a large number of simulations.

0711.0958	perturbations in a non-uniform dark energy fluid: equations reveal  effects of modified gravity and dark matter	we propose a unified single-field description of the galactic dark matter andvarious uniform scalar fields for the inflation and cosmological constant. thetwo types of effects could originate from a fluid of both spatially andtemporally varying vacuum energy if the vacuum has an uneven pressure caused bya photon-like vector field (of perhaps an unstable massive boson). we propose amost general lagrangian with a {\bf n}on-{\bf u}niform cosmological constantfor this vacuum fluid (dubbed as a nu-lambda fluid), working within theframework of einsteinian gravity. this theory includes a continuous spectrum ofplausible dark energy theories and gravity theories, e.g., inflation,quintessence, k-essence, f(r), generalized einstein-aether f(k), mond, teves,bstv etc. theories. it also suggests new models such as a certain f(k+r) model,which suggests intriguing corrections to mond depending of redshift anddensity. some specific constructions of the nu-lambda fluid (e.g., zhao'sv-$\lambda$ model) closely resemble the $\lambda$cdm cosmology on large scale,but fit galaxy rotation curves as good as mond. perturbed einstein equations ina simple $f(k_4)$ model are solvable and show effects of a dm coupled to de.incorporating the perturbation equations here into standard simulations forcosmological structure growth offers a chance to falsify examples of thenu-lambda theories.

1205.2698	redshift space distortions in f(r) gravity	we use large volume n-body simulations to predict the clustering of darkmatter in redshift space in f(r) modified gravity cosmologies. this is thefirst time that the nonlinear matter and velocity fields have been resolved tosuch a high level of accuracy over a broad range of scales in this class ofmodels. we find significant deviations from the clustering signal in standardgravity, with an enhanced boost in power on large scales and stronger dampingon small scales in the f(r) models compared to gr at redshifts z&lt;1. we measurethe velocity divergence (p_\theta \theta) and matter (p_\delta \delta) powerspectra and find a large deviation in the ratios \sqrt{p_\theta \theta/p_\delta\delta} and p_\delta \theta/p_\delta\delta, between the f(r) models and gr for0.03&lt;k/(h/mpc)&lt;0.5. in linear theory these ratios equal the growth rate ofstructure on large scales. our results show that the simulated ratios agreewith the growth rate for each cosmology (which is scale dependent in the caseof modified gravity) only for extremely large scales, k&lt;0.06h/mpc at z=0. thevelocity power spectrum is substantially different in the f(r) models comparedto gr, suggesting that this observable is a sensitive probe of modifiedgravity. we demonstrate how to extract the matter and velocity power spectrafrom the 2d redshift space power spectrum, p(k,\mu), and can recover thenonlinear matter power spectrum to within a few percent for k&lt;0.1h/mpc.however, the model fails to describe the shape of the 2d power spectrumdemonstrating that an improved model is necessary in order to reconstruct thevelocity power spectrum accurately. the same model can match the monopolemoment to within 3% for gr and 10% for the f(r) cosmology at k&lt;0.2 h/mpc atz=1. our results suggest that the extraction of the velocity power spectrumfrom future galaxy surveys is a promising method to constrain deviations fromgr.

1206.3568	systematic simulations of modified gravity: symmetron and dilaton models	we study the linear and nonlinear structure formation in the dilaton andsymmetron models of modified gravity using a generic parameterisation whichdescribes a large class of scenarios using only a few parameters, such as thecoupling between the scalar field and the matter, and the range of the scalarforce on very large scales. for this we have modified the n-body simulationcode ecosmog, which is a variant of ramses working in modified gravityscenarios, to perform a set of 110 simulations for different models andparameter values, including the default lcdm. these simulations enable us toexplore a large portion of the parameter space. we have studied the effects ofmodified gravity on the matter power spectrum and mass function, and found arich and interesting phenomenology where the difference with the lcdm templatecannot be reproduced by a linear analysis even on scales as large as k~0.05h/mpc. our results show the full effect of screening on nonlinear structureformation and the associated deviation from lcdm. we also investigate howdifferences in the force mediated by the scalar field in modified gravitymodels lead to qualitatively different features for the nonlinear powerspectrum and the halo mass function, and how varying the individual modelparameters changes these observables. the differences are particularly large inthe nonlinear power spectra whose shapes for f(r), dilaton and symmetron modelsvary greatly, and where the characteristic bump around 1 h/mpc of f(r) modelsis preserved for symmetrons, whereas an increase on much smaller scales isparticular to symmetrons. no bump is present for dilatons where a flattening ofthe power spectrum takes place on small scales. these deviations from lcdm andthe differences between modified gravity models, such as dilatons andsymmetrons, could be tested with future surveys.

1206.4317	the nonlinear matter and velocity power spectra in f(r) gravity	we study the matter and velocity divergence power spectra in a f(r) gravitytheory and their time evolution measured from several large-volume n-bodysimulations with varying box sizes and resolution. we find that accurateprediction of the matter power spectrum in f(r) gravity places strongerrequirements on the simulation than is the case with lcdm, because of thenonlinear nature of the fifth force. linear perturbation theory is shown to bea poor approximation for the f(r) models, except when the chameleon effect isvery weak. we show that the relative differences from the fiducial lcdm modelare much more pronounced in the nonlinear tail of the velocity divergence powerspectrum than in the matter power spectrum, which suggests that future surveyswhich target the collection of peculiar velocity data will open newopportunities to constrain modified gravity theories. a close investigation ofthe time evolution of the power spectra shows that there is a pattern in theevolution history, which can be explained by the properties of thechameleon-type fifth force in f(r) gravity. varying the model parameter |f_r0|,which quantifies the strength of the departure from standard gravity, mainlyvaries the epoch marking the onset of the fifth force, as a result of which thedifferent f(r) models are in different stages of the same evolutionary path atany given time

1208.0600	linear perturbations in galileon gravity models	we study the cosmology of galileon modified gravity models in the linearperturbation regime. we derive the fully covariant and gauge invariantperturbed field equations using two different methods, which give consistentresults, and solve them using a modified version of the {\tt camb} code. wefind that, in addition to modifying the background expansion history andtherefore shifting the positions of the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) power spectrum, the galileon field can cluster strongly fromearly times, and causes the weyl gravitational potential to grow, rather thandecay, at late times. this leaves clear signatures in the low-$l$ cmb powerspectrum through the modified integrated sachs-wolfe effect, strongly enhancesthe linear growth of matter density perturbations and makes distinctivepredictions for other cosmological signals such as weak lensing and the powerspectrum of density fluctuations. the quasi-static approximation is shown towork quite well from small to the near-horizon scales. we demonstrate thatgalileon models display a rich phenomenology due to the large parameter spaceand the sensitive dependence of the model predictions on the galileonparameters. our results show that some galileon models are already ruled out bypresent data and that future higher significance galaxy clustering, isw andlensing measurements will place strong constraints on galileon gravity.

1212.2216	voids in modified gravity: excursion set predictions	we investigate the behavior of the fifth force in voids in chameleon modelsusing the spherical collapse method. contrary to newtonian gravity, we find thefifth force is repulsive in voids. the strength of the fifth force depends onthe density inside and outside the void region as well as its radius. it can bemany times larger than the newtonian force and their ratio is in principleunbound. this is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth forceis no more than 1/3 of gravity. the evolution of voids is governed by thenewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. whilethe first two forces are common in both lcdm and chameleon universes, the fifthforce is unique to the latter. driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,individual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in alcdm universe. the expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%larger for voids of a few mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by~10%. these differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. wecompare void statistics using excursion set theory; for voids of the same size,their number density is larger in chameleon models. the fractional differenceincreases with void size. the chance of having voids of radius ~25 mpc/h can be2.5 times larger. this difference is about 10 times larger than that in thehalo mass function. we find strong environmental dependence of void propertiesin chameleon models. the differences in size and expansion velocity with gr areboth larger for small voids in high density regions. in general, the differencebetween chameleon models and lcdm in void properties (size, expansion velocityand distribution function) are larger than the corresponding quantities forhalos. this suggests that voids might be better candidates than halos fortesting gravity.

1302.6241	the parameter space in galileon gravity models	we present the first constraints on the full parameter space of the galileonmodified gravity model, considering both the cosmological parameters and thecoefficients which specify the additional terms in the lagrangian due to thegalileon field, which we call the galileon parameters. we use the latest cosmicmicrowave background measurements, along with distance measurements fromsupernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations, performing a monte carlo markovchain exploration of the 9-dimensional parameter space. the integratedsachs-wolfe signal can be very different in galileon models compared tostandard gravity, making it essential to use the full cmb data rather than thecmb distance priors. we demonstrate that meaningful constraints are onlypossible in the galileon parameter space after taking advantage of a scalingdegeneracy. we find that the galileon model can fit the wmap 9-year resultsbetter than the standard \lambda-cold dark matter model, but gives a slightlyworse fit overall once lower redshift distance measurements are included. thebest-fitting cosmological parameters (e.g. matter density, scalar spectralindex, fluctuation amplitude) can differ by more than 2\sigma\ in the galileonmodel compared with \lambda cdm. we highlight other potential constraints ofthe galileon model using galaxy clustering and weak lensing measurements.

1303.0007	systematic simulations of modified gravity: chameleon models	in this work we systematically study the linear and nonlinear structureformation in chameleon theories of modified gravity, using a genericparameterisation which describes a large class of models using only 4parameters. for this we have modified the n-body simulation code ecosmog toperform a total of 65 simulations for different models and parameter values,including the default lcdm. these simulations enable us to explore asignificant portion of the parameter space. we have studied the effects ofmodified gravity on the matter power spectrum and mass function, and found arich and interesting phenomenology where the difference with the lcdm paradigmcannot be reproduced by a linear analysis even on scales as large ask~0.05h/mpc, since the latter incorrectly assumes that the modification ofgravity depends only on the background matter density. our results show thatthe chameleon screening mechanism is significantly more efficient than othermechanisms such as the dilaton and symmetron, especially in high-densityregions and at early times, and can serve as a guidance to determine the partsof the chameleon parameter space which are cosmologically interesting and thusmerit further studies in the future.

1304.6395	modeling halo mass functions in chameleon f(r) gravity	on cosmological scales, observations of the cluster abundance currently placethe strongest constraints on f(r) gravity. these constraints lie in thelarge-field limit, where the modifications of general relativity can correctlybe modeled by setting the compton wavelength of the scalar field to itsbackground value. these bounds are, however, at the verge of penetrating into aregime, where the modifications become nonlinearly suppressed due to thechameleon mechanism and cannot be described by this linearized approximation.for future constraints based on observations subjected to cluster abundance, itis therefore essential to consistently model the chameleon effect. we analyzedescriptions of the halo mass function in chameleon f(r) gravity using a mass-and environment-dependent spherical collapse model in combination withexcursion set theory and phenomenological fits to n-body simulations in thelcdm and f(r) gravity scenarios. our halo mass functions consistentlyincorporate the chameleon suppression and cosmological parameter dependencies,improving upon previous formalisms and providing an important extension ton-body simulations for the application in consistent tests of gravity withobservables sensitive to the abundance of clusters.

1305.7486	hierarchical clustering in chameleon $f(r)$ gravity	we use a suite of high resolution state-of-the-art n-body dark mattersimulations of chameleon $f(r)$ gravity to study the higher order volumeaveraged correlation functions $\bar{\xi_n}$ together with the hierarchical$n$-th order correlation amplitudes $s_n=\bar{\xi}_n/\bar{\xi}_2^{n-1}$ anddensity distribution functions (pdf). we show that under the non-linearmodifications of gravity the hierarchical scaling of the reduced cumulants ispreserved. this is however characterised by significant changes of both the$\bar{\xi_n}$ and $s_n$'s values and their scale dependence with respect togeneral relativity gravity (gr). in addition, we measure a significant increaseof the non linear $\sigma_8$ parameter reaching $14, 5$ and 0.5% in excess ofthe gr value for the three flavours of our $f(r)$ models. we further note thatthe values of the reduced cumulants up to order $n=9$ are significantlyincreased in $f(r)$ gravity for all our models at small scales $r\simlt30\hmpc$. in contrast the values of the hierarchical amplitudes, $s_n$'s, aresmaller in $f(r)$ indicating that the modified gravity density distributionfunctions are deviating from the gr case. furthermore we find that the redshiftevolution of relative deviations of the $f(r)$ hierarchical correlationamplitudes is fastest at high and moderate redshifts $1\leq z \leq4$. thegrowth of these deviations significantly slows down in the low redshiftuniverse. we also compute the pdfs and show that for scales below $\sim20\hmpc$ they are significantly shifted in $f(r)$ gravity towards the lowdensities. finally we discuss the implications of our theoretical predictionsfor measurements of the hierarchical clustering in galaxy redshifts surveys,including the important problems of the galaxy biasing and redshifts spacedistortions.

1306.3219	nonlinear structure formation in the cubic galileon gravity model	we model the linear and nonlinear growth of large scale structure in thecubic galileon gravity model, by running a suite of n-body cosmologicalsimulations using the {\tt ecosmog} code. our simulations include thevainshtein screening effect, which reconciles the cubic galileon model withlocal tests of gravity. in the linear regime, the amplitude of the matter powerspectrum increases by $\sim 25%$ with respect to the standard $\lambda$cdmmodel today. the modified expansion rate accounts for $\sim 20%$ of thisenhancement, while the fifth force is responsible for only $\sim 5%$. this isbecause the effective unscreened gravitational strength deviates from standardgravity only at late times, even though it can be twice as large today. in thenonlinear regime ($k \gtrsim 0.1 h\rm{mpc}^{-1}$), the fifth force leads toonly a modest increase ($\lesssim 8%$) in the clustering power on all scalesdue to the very efficient operation of the vainshtein mechanism. such a strongeffect is typically not seen in other models with the same screening mechanism.the screening also results in the fifth force increasing the number density ofhalos by less than 10%, on all mass scales. our results show that the screeningdoes not ruin the validity of linear theory on large scales which anticipatesvery strong constraints from galaxy clustering data. we also show that, whilstthe model gives an excellent match to cmb data on small angular scales ($l\gtrsim 50$), the predicted integrated sachs-wolf effect is in tension withplanck/wmap results.

1308.3491	simulating the quartic galileon gravity model on adaptively refined  meshes	we develop a numerical algorithm to solve the high-order nonlinearderivative-coupling equation associated with the quartic galileon model, andimplement it in a modified version of the ramses n-body code to study theeffect of the galileon field on the large-scale matter clustering. thealgorithm is tested for several matter field configurations with differentsymmetries, and works very well. this enables us to perform the firstsimulations for a quartic galileon model which provides a good fit to thecosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy, supernovae and baryonic acousticoscillations (bao) data. our result shows that the vainshtein mechanism in thismodel is very efficient in suppressing the spatial variations of the scalarfield. however, the time variation of the effective newtonian constant causedby the curvature coupling of the galileon field cannot be suppressed by thevainshtein mechanism. this leads to a significant weakening of the strength ofgravity in high-density regions at late times, and therefore a weaker matterclustering on small scales. we also find that without the vainshtein mechanismthe model would have behaved in a completely different way, which shows thecrucial role played by nonlinearities in modified gravity theories and theimportance of performing self-consistent n-body simulations for these theories.

1308.3699	spherical collapse in galileon gravity: fifth force solutions, halo mass  function and halo bias	we study spherical collapse in the quartic and quintic covariant galileongravity models within the framework of the excursion set formalism. we derivethe nonlinear spherically symmetric equations in the quasi-static andweak-field limits, focusing on model parameters that fit current cmb, snia andbao data. we demonstrate that the equations of the quintic model do not admitphysical solutions of the fifth force in high density regions, which preventsthe study of structure formation in this model. for the quartic model, we showthat the effective gravitational strength deviates from unity at late times ($z\lesssim 1$), becoming larger if the density is low, but smaller if the densityis high. this shows that the vainshtein mechanism at high densities is notenough to screen all of the modifications of gravity. this makes halos thatcollapse at $z \lesssim 1$ feel an overall weaker gravity, which suppresseshalo formation. however, the matter density in the quartic model is higher thanin standard $\lambda$cdm, which boosts structure formation and dominates overthe effect of the weaker gravity. in the quartic model there is a significantoverabundance of high-mass halos relative to $\lambda$cdm. dark matter halosare also less biased than in $\lambda$cdm, with the difference increasingappreciably with halo mass. however, our results suggest that the bias may notbe small enough to fully reconcile the predicted matter power spectrum with lrgclustering data.

1309.5389	novel probes of gravity and dark energy	the discovery of cosmic acceleration has stimulated theorists to considerdark energy or modifications to einstein's general relativity as possibleexplanations. the last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyondsmooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. whilethe theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence offifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observationalsignatures. this report focuses on observations that differ from theconventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure.examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via labexperiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearbyuniverse, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters,and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. theobservational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratoryexperiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radioobservations. in the coming decade, searches for these effects have thepotential for discovering fundamental new physics. we discuss how the searchescan be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modestadaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. the accompanyingpaper on the growth of cosmic structure describes complementary tests ofgravity with observations of large-scale structure.

1310.6768	galaxy infall kinematics as a test of modified gravity	infrared modifications of general relativity (gr) can be revealed bycomparing the mass of galaxy clusters estimated from weak lensing to that frominfall kinematics. we measure the 2d galaxy velocity distribution in thecluster infall region by applying the galaxy infall kinematics (gik) modeldeveloped by zu and weinberg (2013) to two suites of f(r) and galileon modifiedgravity simulations. despite having distinct screening mechanisms, namely, thechameleon and the vainshtein effects, the f(r) and galileon clusters exhibitvery similar deviations in their gik profiles from gr, with ~ 100-200 k/senhancement in the characteristic infall velocity at r=5 mpc/h and 50-100 km/sbroadening in the radial and tangential velocity dispersions across the entireinfall region, for clusters with mass ~ 10^{14} msol/h at z=0.25. thesedeviations are detectable via the gik reconstruction of the redshift--spacecluster-galaxy cross-correlation function, xi_cg^s(r_p,r_\pi), which shows ~1-2 mpc/h increase in the characteristic line-of-sight distance r_\pi^c atr_p&lt;6 mpc/h from gr predictions. with overlapping deep imaging and largeredshift surveys in the future, we expect that the gik modelling of xi_cg^s, incombination with the stacked weak lensing measurements, will provide powerfuldiagnostics of modified gravity theories and the origin of cosmic acceleration.

1310.6986	the integrated sachs-wolfe effect in $f(r)$ gravity	we study the late-time integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect in $f(r)$ gravityusing n-body simulations. in the $f(r)$ model under study, the linear growthrate is larger than that in general relativity (gr). this slows down the decayof the cosmic potential and induces a smaller isw effect on large scales.therefore, the $\dot\phi$ (time derivative of the potential) power spectrum at$k&lt;0.1h$/mpc is suppressed relative to that in gr. in the non-linear regime,relatively rapid structure formation in $f(r)$ gravity boosts the non-linearisw effect relative to gr, and the $\dot\phi$ power spectrum at $k&gt;0.1h$/mpc isincreased (100$\%$ greater on small scales at $z=0$). we explore thedetectability of the isw signal via stacking supercluster and supervoids. thedifferences in the corresponding isw cold or hot spots are $\sim 20\%$ forstructures of $\sim 100$mpc/$h$. such differences are greater for smallerstructures, but the amplitude of the signal is lower. the high amplitude of iswsignal detected by granett et al. can not explained in the $f(r)$ model. wefind relatively big differences between $f(r)$ and gr in the transverse bulkmotion of matter, and discuss its detectability via the relative frequencyshifts of photons from multiple lensed images.

1311.7187	massive gravity wrapped in the cosmic web	we study how the filamentary pattern of the cosmic web changes if the truegravity deviates from the general relativity (gr) on the large scale. the f(r)gravity whose strength is controlled to satisfy the current observationalconstraints on the cluster scale is adopted as our fiducial model and a largen-body simulation of high-resolution is utilized for this study. by applyingthe minimal spanning tree algorithm to the halo catalogs from the simulation atvarious epochs, we identify the main stems of the rich superclusters located inthe most prominent filamentary section of the cosmic web and determine theirspatial extents per member cluster as the degree of their straightness. it isfound that the $f(r)$ gravity has an effect of significantly bending thesuperclusters and that the effect becomes stronger as the universe evolves.even in the case where the deviation from gr is too small to be detectable byany other observables, the degree of the supercluster straightness exhibitsconspicuous difference between the $f(r)$ and the gr models. our results alsoimply that the supercluster straightness could be a useful discriminator off(r) gravity from the coupled dark energy since it is shown to evolvedifferently between the two models. as a final conclusion, the degree of thestraightness of the rich superclusters should provide a powerful cosmologicaltest of large scale gravity.

1312.1292	halo modelling in chameleon theories	we analyse modelling techniques for the large-scale structure formed inscalar-tensor theories of constant brans-dicke parameter which match theconcordance model background expansion history and produce a chameleonsuppression of the gravitational modification in high-density regions. thereby,we use a mass and environment dependent chameleon spherical collapse model, thesheth-tormen halo mass function and linear halo bias, the navarro-frenk-whitehalo density profile, and the halo model. furthermore, using the sphericalcollapse model, we extrapolate a chameleon mass-concentration scaling relationfrom a lcdm prescription calibrated to n-body simulations. we also provideconstraints on the model parameters to ensure viability on local scales. wetest our description of the halo mass function and nonlinear matter powerspectrum against the respective observables extracted from large-volume andhigh-resolution n-body simulations in the limiting case of f(r) gravity,corresponding to a vanishing brans-dicke parameter. we find good agreementbetween the two; the halo model provides a good qualitative description of theshape of the relative enhancement of the f(r) matter power spectrum withrespect to lcdm caused by the extra attractive gravitational force but fails torecover the correct amplitude. introducing an effective linear power spectrumin the computation of the two-halo term to account for an underestimation ofthe chameleon suppression at intermediate scales in our approach, we accuratelyreproduce the measurements from the n-body simulations.

1401.1497	halo model and halo properties in galileon gravity cosmologies	we investigate the performance of semi-analytical modelling of large-scalestructure in galileon gravity cosmologies using results from n-bodysimulations. we focus on the cubic and quartic galileon models that provide areasonable fit to cmb, snia and bao data. we demonstrate that the sheth-tormenmass function and linear halo bias can be calibrated to provide a very good fitto our simulation results. we also find that the halo concentration-massrelation is well fitted by a power law. the nonlinear matter power spectrumcomputed in the halo model approach is found to be inaccurate in the mildlynonlinear regime, but captures reasonably well the effects of the vainshteinscreening mechanism on small scales. in the cubic model, the screeningmechanism hides essentially all of the effects of the fifth force insidehaloes. in the case of the quartic model, the screening mechanism leaves behindresidual modifications to gravity, which make the effective gravitationalstrength time-varying and smaller than the standard value. compared to normalgravity, this causes a deficiency of massive haloes and leads to a weakermatter clustering on small scales. for both models, we show that there arerealistic halo occupation distributions of luminous red galaxies that can matchboth the observed large-scale clustering amplitude and the number density ofthese galaxies.

1404.1365	$\nu$galileon: modified gravity with massive neutrinos as a testable  alternative to $\lambda$cdm	we show that, in the presence of massive neutrinos, the galileon gravitymodel provides a very good fit to the current cmb temperature, cmb lensing andbao data. this model, which we dub ${\nu} \rm{galileon}$, when assuming itsstable attractor background solution, contains the same set of free parametersas $\lambda\rm{cdm}$, although it leads to different expansion dynamics andnontrivial gravitational interactions. the data provide compelling evidence($\gtrsim 6\sigma$) for nonzero neutrino masses, with $\sigma m_\nu \gtrsim0.4\ {\rm ev}$ at the $2\sigma$ level. upcoming precision terrestrialmeasurements of the absolute neutrino mass scale therefore have the potentialto test this model. we show that cmb lensing measurements at multipoles $l\lesssim 40$ will be able to discriminate between the ${\nu} \rm{galileon}$ and$\lambda\rm{cdm}$ models. unlike $\lambda\rm{cdm}$, the ${\nu} \rm{galileon}$model is consistent with local determinations of the hubble parameter. thepresence of massive neutrinos lowers the value of $\sigma_8$ substantially,despite of the enhanced gravitational strength on large scales. unlike$\lambda\rm{cdm}$, the ${\nu} \rm{galileon}$ model predicts a negative isweffect, which is difficult to reconcile with current observational limits.

1404.2206	the vainshtein mechanism in the cosmic web	we investigate the dependence of the vainshtein screening mechanism on thecosmic web morphology of both dark matter particles and halos as determined byorigami. unlike chameleon and symmetron screening, which come into effect inregions of high density, vainshtein screening instead depends on thedimensionality of the system, and screened bodies can still feel externalfields. origami is well-suited to this problem because it defines morphologiesaccording to the dimensionality of the collapsing structure and does not dependon a smoothing scale or density threshold parameter. we find that haloparticles are screened while filament, wall, and void particles are unscreened,and this is independent of the particle density. however, after separatinghalos according to their large scale morphological environment, we find nodifference in the screening properties of halos in filaments versus halos inclusters. we find that the fifth force enhancement of dark matter particles inhalos is greatest well outside the virial radius. we confirm the theoreticalexpectation that even if the internal field is suppressed by the vainshteinmechanism, the object still feels the fifth force generated by the externalfields, by measuring peculiar velocities and velocity dispersions of halos.finally, we investigate the morphology and gravity model dependence of halospins, concentrations, and shapes.
{fenge}
1406.0485	the observational status of galileon gravity after planck	we use the latest cmb data from planck, together with bao measurements, toconstrain the full parameter space of galileon gravity. we constrain separatelythe three main branches of the theory known as the cubic, quartic and quinticmodels, and find that all yield a very good fit to these data. unlike in$\lambda{\rm cdm}$, the galileon model constraints are compatible with localdeterminations of the hubble parameter and predict nonzero neutrino masses atover $5\sigma$ significance. we also identify that the low-$l$ part of the cmblensing spectrum may be able to distinguish between $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ andgalileon models. in the cubic model, the lensing potential deepens at latetimes on sub-horizon scales, which is at odds with the current observationalsuggestion of a positive isw effect. compared to $\lambda$cdm, the quartic andquintic models predict less isw power in the low-$l$ region of the cmbtemperature spectrum, and as such are slightly preferred by the planck data. weillustrate that residual local modifications to gravity in the quartic andquintic models may render the cubic model as the only branch of galileongravity that passes solar system tests.

1408.1084	nonlinear structure formation in nonlocal gravity	we study the nonlinear growth of structure in nonlocal gravity models withthe aid of n-body simulation and the spherical collapse and halo models. wefocus on a model in which the inverse-squared of the d'alembertian operatoracts on the ricci scalar in the action. for fixed cosmological parameters, thismodel differs from $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ by having a lower late-time expansionrate and an enhanced and time-dependent gravitational strength ($\sim 6\%$larger today). compared to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ today, in the nonlocal model,massive haloes are slightly more abundant (by $\sim 10\%$ at $m \sim 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h$) and concentrated ($\approx 8\%$ enhancement over a range of massscales), but their linear bias remains almost unchanged. we find that thesheth-tormen formalism describes the mass function and halo bias very well,with little need for recalibration of free parameters. the fitting of the haloconcentrations is however essential to ensure the good performance of the halomodel on small scales. for $k \gtrsim 1 h/{\rm mpc}$, the amplitude of thenonlinear matter and velocity divergence power spectra exhibits a modestenhancement of $\sim 12\%$ to $15\%$, compared to $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ today.this suggests that this model might only be distinguishable from $\lambda{\rmcdm}$ by future observational missions. we point out that the absence of ascreening mechanism may lead to tensions with solar system tests due to localtime variations of the gravitational strength, although this is subject toassumptions about the local time evolution of background averaged quantities.

1408.2856	chameleon $f(r)$ gravity on the virgo cluster scale	models of modified gravity offer promising alternatives to the concordance$\lambda$cdm cosmology to explain the late-time acceleration of the universe. apopular such model is $f(r)$ gravity, in which the ricci scalar in theeinstein-hilbert action is replaced by a general function of it. we study the$f(r)$ model of hu &amp; sawicki (2007), which recovers standard general relativityin high density regimes, while reproducing the desired late-time accelerationat cosmological scales. we run a suite of high resolution zoom simulationsusing the ecosmog code to examine the effect of $f(r)$ gravity on theproperties of a halo that is analogous to the virgo cluster. we show that thevelocity dispersion profiles can potentially discriminate between $f(r)$ modelsand $\lambda$cdm, and provide complementary analysis of lensing signal profilesto explore the possibility to further distinguish the different $f(r)$ models.our results confirm the techniques explored by cabre et al. (2012) to quantifythe effect of environment in the behavior of $f(r)$ gravity, and we extend themto study halo satellites at various redshifts. we find that the modifiedgravity effects in our models are most observable at low redshifts, and thateffects are generally stronger for satellites far from the center of the mainhalo. we show that the screening properties of halo satellites trace very wellthat of dark matter particles, which means that low-resolution simulations inwhich subhalos are not very well resolved can in principle be used to studysatellite properties. we discuss observables, particularly for halo satellites,that can potentially be used to constrain the observational viability of $f(r)$gravity.

1408.5338	voids in modified gravity reloaded: eulerian void assignment	we revisit the excursion set approach to calculate void abundances inchameleon-type modified gravity theories, which was previously studied byclampitt, cai and li (2013). we focus on properly accounting for thevoid-in-cloud effect, i.e., the growth of those voids sitting in over-denseregions may be restricted by the evolution of their surroundings. this effectmay change the distribution function of voids hence affect predictions on thedifferences between modified gravity and gr. we show that the thin-shellapproximation usually used to calculate the fifth force is qualitatively goodbut quantitatively inaccurate. therefore, it is necessary to numerically solvethe fifth force in both over-dense and under-dense regions. we then generalisethe eulerian void assignment method of paranjape, lam and sheth (2012) to ourmodified gravity model. we implement this method in our monte carlo simulationsand compare its results with the original lagrangian methods. we find that theabundances of small voids are significantly reduced in both modified gravityand gr due to the restriction of environments. however, the change in voidabundances for the range of void radii of interest for both models is similar.therefore, the difference between models remains similar to the results fromthe lagrangian method, especially if correlated steps of the random walks areused. as clampitt, cai and li (2013), we find that the void abundance is muchmore sensitive to modified gravity than halo abundances. our method can then bea faster alternative to n-body simulations for studying the qualitativebehaviour of a broad class of theories. we also discuss the limitations andother practical issues associated with its applications.
{fenge}
1410.1510	testing gravity using cosmic voids	we explore voids in dark matter and halo fields from simulations of$\lambda$cdm and hu-sawicki $f(r)$ models. in $f(r)$ gravity, dark matter voidabundances are greater than that of general relativity (gr). however, whenusing haloes to identify voids, the differences of void abundances become muchsmaller, but can still be told apart, in principle, at the 2, 6 and 14 $\sigma$level for the $f(r)$ model parameter amplitudes of $|f_{r0}|=10^{-6}$,$10^{-5}$ and $10^{-4}$. in contrast, the abundance of large voids found usinghaloes in $f(r)$ gravity is lower than in gr. the more efficient halo formationin underdense regions makes $f(r)$ voids less empty of haloes. this counterintuitive result suggests that voids are not necessarily emptier in $f(r)$ ifone looks at galaxies in voids. indeed, the halo number density profiles ofvoids are not distinguishable from gr. however, the same $f(r)$ voids are moreempty of dark matter. this can in principle be observed by weak gravitationallensing of voids, for which the combination of a spec-$z$ and a photo-$z$survey over the same sky is necessary. for a volume of 1~(gpc/$h$)$^3$,neglecting the lensing shape noise, $|f_{r0}|=10^{-5}$ and $10^{-4}$ may bedistinguished from gr using the lensing tangential shear signal around voids by4 and 8$\sigma$. the line-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is themain systematics that limits the significance of this signal, limiting theconstraining power for $|f_{r0}|=10^{-6}$. the halo void abundance beingsmaller and the steepening of dark matter void profiles in $f(r)$ models areunique features that can be combined to break the degeneracy between $|f_{r0}|$and $\sigma_8$. the outflow of mass from void centers and velocity dispersionsare greater in $f(r)$. model differences in velocity profiles imply potentialpowerful constraints of the model in phase space and in redshift space.

1410.8186	void dynamics	cosmic voids are becoming key players in testing the physics of our universe.here we concentrate on the abundances and the dynamics of voids as these areamong the best candidates to provide information on cosmological parameters.cai, padilla \&amp; li (2014) use the abundance of voids to tell apart hu \&amp;sawicki $f(r)$ models from general relativity. an interesting result is thateven though, as expected, voids in the dark matter field are emptier in $f(r)$gravity due to the fifth force expelling away from the void centres, thisresult is reversed when haloes are used to find voids. the abundance of voidsin this case becomes even lower in $f(r)$ compared to gr for large voids.still, the differences are significant and this provides a way to tell apartthese models. the velocity field differences between $f(r)$ and gr, on theother hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. paz et al.(2013), concentrate on the velocity profiles around voids. first they show thenecessity of four parameters to describe the density profiles around voidsgiven two distinct void populations, voids-in-voids and voids-in-clouds. thisprofile is used to predict peculiar velocities around voids, and thecombination of the latter with void density profiles allows the construction ofmodel void-galaxy cross-correlation functions with redshift space distortions.when these models are tuned to fit the measured correlation functions for voidsand galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey, small voids are found to be ofthe void-in-cloud type, whereas larger ones are consistent with beingvoid-in-void. this is a novel result that is obtained directly from redshiftspace data around voids. these profiles can be used to remove systematics onvoid-galaxy alcock-pacinsky tests coming from redshift-space distortions.
{fenge}
1410.8355	testing gravity using void profiles	we investigate void properties in $f(r)$ models using n-body simulations,focusing on their differences from general relativity (gr) and theirdetectability. in the hu-sawicki $f(r)$ modified gravity (mg) models, the halonumber density profiles of voids are not distinguishable from gr. in contrast,the same $f(r)$ voids are more empty of dark matter, and their profiles aresteeper. this can in principle be observed by weak gravitational lensing ofvoids, for which the combination of a spectroscopic redshift and a lensingphotometric redshift survey over the same sky is required. neglecting thelensing shape noise, the $f(r)$ model parameter amplitudes $|f_{r0}|=10^{-5}$and $10^{-4}$ may be distinguished from gr using the lensing tangential shearsignal around voids by 4 and 8$\sigma$ for a volume of 1~(gpc/$h$)$^3$. theline-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is the main systematics thatlimits the significance of this signal for the near future wide angle and deeplensing surveys. for this reason, it is challenging to distinguish$|f_{r0}|=10^{-6}$ from gr. we expect that this can be overcome with largervolume. the halo void abundance being smaller and the steepening of dark mattervoid profiles in $f(r)$ models are unique features that can be combined tobreak the degeneracy between $|f_{r0}|$ and $\sigma_8$.

1411.5694	using cosmic voids to distinguish f(r) gravity in future galaxy surveys	we use properties of void populations identified in $n$-body simulations toforecast the ability of upcoming galaxy surveys to differentiate models of f(r)gravity from \lcdm~cosmology. we analyze multiple simulation realizations,which were designed to mimic the expected number densities, volumes, andredshifts of the upcoming euclid satellite and a lower-redshift ground-basedcounterpart survey, using the public {\tt vide} toolkit. we examine voidabundances, ellipicities, radial density profiles, and radial velocity profilesat redshifts 1.0 and 0.43. we find that stronger f(r) coupling strengthseliminates small voids and produces voids up to $\sim 20\%$ larger in radius,leading to a significant tilt in the void number function. additionally, underthe influence of modified gravity, voids at all scales tend to be measurablyemptier with correspondingly higher compensation walls. the velocity profilesreflect this, showing increased outflows inside voids and increased inflowsoutside voids. using the void number function as an example, we forecast thatfuture surveys can constrain the modified gravity coupling strength to $\sim 3\times 10^{-5}$ using voids.

1411.5965	linear perturbations in k-mouflage cosmologies with massive neutrinos	we present a comprehensive derivation of linear perturbation equations fordifferent matter species, including photons, baryons, cold dark matter, scalarfields, massless and massive neutrinos, in the presence of a generic conformalcoupling. starting from the lagrangians, we show how the conformaltransformation affects the dynamics. in particular, we discuss how toincorporate consistently the scalar coupling in the equations of the boltzmannhierarchy for massive neutrinos and the subsequent fluid approximations. we usethe recently proposed k-mouflage model as an example to demonstrate thenumerical implementation of our linear perturbation equations. k-mouflage is anew mechanism to suppress the fifth force between matter particles induced bythe scalar coupling, but in the linear regime the fifth force is unsuppressedand can change the clustering of different matter species in different ways. weshow how the cmb, lensing potential and matter power spectra are affected bythe fifth force, and find ranges of k-mouflage parameters whose effects couldbe seen observationally. we also find that the scalar coupling can have thenontrivial effect of shifting the amplitude of the power spectra of the lensingpotential and density fluctuations in opposite directions, although both probethe overall clustering of matter. this paper can serve as a reference for thosewho work on generic coupled scalar field cosmology, or those who are interestedin the cosmological behaviour of the k-mouflage model.

1411.6128	testing the quasi-static approximation in $f(r)$ gravity simulations	numerical simulations in modified gravity have commonly been performed underthe quasi-static approximation -- that is, by neglecting the effect of timederivatives in the equation of motion of the scalar field that governs thefifth force in a given modified gravity theory. to test the validity of thisapproximation, we analyse the case of $f(r)$ gravity beyond this quasi-staticlimit, by considering effects, if any, these terms have in the matter andvelocity divergence cosmic fields. to this end, we use the adaptive meshrefinement code ecosmog to study three variants ($|f_{r}|= 10^{-4}[$f4$],10^{-5}[$f5$]$ and $10^{-6}[$f6$]$) of the hu-sawicki $f(r)$ gravity model,each of which refers to a different magnitude for the scalar field thatgenerates the fifth force. we find that for f4 and f5, which show strongerdeviations from standard gravity, a low-resolution simulation is enough toconclude that time derivatives make a negligible contribution to the matterdistribution. the f6 model shows a larger deviation from the quasi-staticapproximation, but one that diminishes when re-simulated at higher resolution.we therefore come to the conclusion that the quasi-static approximation isvalid for the most practical applications in $f(r)$ cosmologies.

0804.1588	dark fluid: towards a unification of empirical theories of galaxy  rotation, inflation and dark energy	empirical theories of dark matter like mond gravity and of dark energy likef(r) gravity were motivated by astronomical data. but could these theories bebranches rooted from a more general hence natural framework? here we proposethe natural lagrangian of such a framework based on simple dimensional analysisand co-variant symmetry requirements, and explore various outcomes in atop-down fashion. our framework preserves the co-variant formulation of gr, butallows the expanding physical metric be bent by a single new species of darkfluid flowing in space-time. its non-uniform stress tensor and current vectorare simply functions of a vector field of variable norm, resembling the4-vector electromagnetic potential description for the photon fluid, but isdark (e.g., by very early decoupling from the baryon-radiation fluid). the darkfluid framework naturally branches into a continuous spectrum of theories withdark energy and dark matter effects, including the $f(r)$ gravity, teves-liketheories, einstein-aether and $\nu\lambda$ theories as limiting cases. when thevector field degenerates into a pure higgs-like scalar field, we obtain thephysics for inflaton and quintessence. in this broad setting we emphasize thenon-constant dynamical field behind the cosmological constant effect, andhighlight plausible corrections beyond the classical mond predictions. choicesof parameters can be made to pass bbn, ppn, and causality constraints. the darkfluid is inspired to unify/simplify the astronomically successful ingredientsof previous constructions: the desired effects of inflaton plus quintessenceplus cold dm particle fields or mond-like scalar field(s) are shown largelyachievable by one vector field only.

1412.5195	rapid simulation rescaling from standard to modified gravity models	we develop and test an algorithm to rescale a simulated dark-matter particledistribution or halo catalogue from a standard gravity model to that of amodified gravity model. this method is based on that of angulo &amp; white but withsome additional ingredients to account for (i) scale-dependent growth of lineardensity perturbations and (ii) screening mechanisms that are generic featuresof viable modified gravity models. we attempt to keep the method as general aspossible, so that it may plausibly be applied to a wide range of modifiedtheories, although tests against simulations are restricted to a subclass of$f(r)$ models at this stage. we show that rescaling allows the power spectrumof matter to be reproduced at the $\sim 3$ per cent level in both real andredshift space up to $k=0.1h\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-1}$ if we change the box size andalter the particle displacement field; this limit can be extended to$k=1h\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-1}$ if we additionally alter halo internal structure. wesimultaneously develop an algorithm that can be applied directly to a halocatalogue, in which case the halo mass function and clustering can bereproduced at the $\sim 5$ per cent level. finally we investigate theclustering of halo particle distributions, generated from rescaled halocatalogues, and find that a similar accuracy can be reached.

1503.01109	exploring the liminality: properties of haloes and subhaloes in  borderline $f(r)$ gravity	we investigate the properties of dark matter haloes and subhaloes in an$f(r)$ gravity model with $|f_{r0}|=10^{-6}$, using a very high-resolutionn-body simulation. the model is a borderline between being cosmologicallyinteresting and yet still consistent with current data. we find that the halomass function in this model has a maximum 20% enhancement compared with the$\lambda$cdm predictions between $z=1$ and $z=0$. because of the chameleonmechanism which screens the deviation from standard gravity in denseenvironments, haloes more massive than $10^{13}h^{-1}m_\odot$ in this $f(r)$model have very similar properties to haloes of similar mass in $\lambda$cdm,while less massive haloes, such as that of the milky way, can have steeperinner density profiles and higher velocity dispersions due to their weakerscreening. the halo concentration is remarkably enhanced for low-mass haloes inthis model due to a deepening of the total gravitational potential. contrary tothe naive expectation, the halo formation time $z_f$ is later for low-masshaloes in this model, a consequence of these haloes growing faster than theircounterparts in $\lambda$cdm at late times and the definition of $z_f$.subhaloes, especially those less massive than $10^{11}h^{-1}m_\odot$, aresubstantially more abundant in this $f(r)$ model for host haloes less massivethan $10^{13}h^{-1}m_\odot$. we discuss the implications of these results forthe milky way satellite abundance problem. although the overall halo andsubhalo properties in this borderline $f(r)$ model are close to their$\lambda$cdm predictions, our results suggest that studies of the local groupand astrophysical systems, aided by high-resolution simulations, can bevaluable for further tests of it.

1503.07204	f(r) gravity on non-linear scales: the post-friedmann expansion and the  vector potential	many modified gravity theories are under consideration in cosmology as thesource of the accelerated expansion of the universe and linear perturbationtheory, valid on the largest scales, has been examined in many of these models.however, smaller non-linear scales offer a richer phenomenology with which toconstrain modified gravity theories. here, we consider the hu-sawicki form of$f(r)$ gravity and apply the post-friedmann approach to derive the leadingorder equations for non-linear scales, i.e. the equations valid in thenewtonian-like regime. we reproduce the standard equations for the scalarfield, gravitational slip and the modified poisson equation in a coherentframework. in addition, we derive the equation for the leading order correctionto the newtonian regime, the vector potential. we measure this vector potentialfrom $f(r)$ n-body simulations at redshift zero and one, for two values of the$f_{r_0}$ parameter. we find that the vector potential at redshift zero in$f(r)$ gravity can be close to 50\% larger than in gr on small scales for$|f_{r_0}|=1.289\times10^{-5}$, although this is less for larger scales,earlier times and smaller values of the $f_{r_0}$ parameter. similarly to ingr, the small amplitude of this vector potential suggests that the newtonianapproximation is highly accurate for $f(r)$ gravity, and also that thenon-linear cosmological behaviour of $f(r)$ gravity can be completely describedby just the scalar potentials and the $f(r)$ field.

1504.01493	k-mouflage gravity models that pass solar system and cosmological  constraints	we show that solar system tests can place very strong constraints onk-mouflage models of gravity, which are coupled scalar field models withnontrivial kinetic terms that screen the fifth force in regions of largegravitational acceleration. in particular, the bounds on the anomalousperihelion of the moon imposes stringent restrictions on the k-mouflagelagrangian density, which can be met when the contributions of higher-orderoperators in the static regime are sufficiently small. the bound on the rate ofchange of the gravitational strength in the solar system constrains thecoupling strength $\beta$ to be smaller than $0.1$. these two bounds imposetighter constraints than the results from the cassini satellite and big bangnucleosynthesis. despite the solar system restrictions, we show that it ispossible to construct viable models with interesting cosmological predictions.in particular, relative to $\lambda$-cdm, such models predict percent-leveldeviations for the clustering of matter and the number density of dark matterhaloes. this makes these models predictive and testable by forthcomingobservational missions.

1505.03468	galaxy cluster lensing masses in modified lensing potentials	we determine the concentration-mass relation of 19 x-ray selected galaxyclusters from the clash survey in theories of gravity that directly modify thelensing potential. we model the clusters as nfw haloes and fit their lensingsignal, in the cubic galileon and nonlocal gravity models, to the lensingconvergence profiles of the clusters. we discuss a number of important issuesthat need to be taken into account, associated with the use of nonparametricand parametric lensing methods, as well as assumptions about the backgroundcosmology. our results show that the concentration and mass estimates in themodified gravity models are, within the errorbars, the same as in $\lambda$cdm.this result demonstrates that, for the nonlocal model, the modifications togravity are too weak at the cluster redshifts, and for the galileon model, thescreening mechanism is very efficient inside the cluster radius. however, atdistances $\sim \left[2-20\right] {\rm mpc}/h$ from the cluster center, we findthat the surrounding force profiles are enhanced by $\sim20-40\%$ in the cubicgalileon model. this has an impact on dynamical mass estimates, which meansthat tests of gravity based on comparisons between lensing and dynamical massescan also be applied to the cubic galileon model.

1505.03656	effective dark matter power spectra in $f(r)$ gravity	using n-body simulations, we measure the power spectrum of the effective darkmatter density field, which is defined through the modified poisson equation in$f(r)$ cosmologies. we find that when compared to the conventional dark matterpower spectrum, the effective power spectrum deviates more significantly fromthe $\lambda$cdm model. for models with $f_{r0}=-10^{-4}$, the deviation canexceed 150\% while the deviation of the conventional matter power spectrum isless than 50\%. even for models with $f_{r0}=-10^{-6}$, for which theconventional matter power spectrum is very close to the $\lambda$cdmprediction, the effective power spectrum shows sizeable deviations. our resultsindicate that traditional analyses based on the dark matter density field mayseriously underestimate the impact of $f(r)$ gravity on galaxy clustering. wetherefore suggest the use of the effective density field in such studies. inaddition, based on our findings, we also discuss several possible methods ofmaking use of the differences between the conventional and effective darkmatter power spectra in $f(r)$ gravity to discriminate the theory from the$\lambda$cdm model.

1505.05809	weak lensing by voids in modified lensing potentials	we study lensing by voids in cubic galileon and nonlocal gravity cosmologies,which are examples of theories of gravity that modify the lensing potential. wefind voids in the dark matter and halo density fields of n-body simulations andcompute their lensing signal analytically from the void density profiles, whichwe show are well fit by a simple analytical formula. in the cubic galileonmodel, the modifications to gravity inside voids are not screened and theyapproximately double the size of the lensing effects compared to gr. thedifference is largely determined by the direct effects of the fifth force onlensing and less so by the modified density profiles. for this model, we alsodiscuss the subtle impact on the force and lensing calculations caused by thescreening effects of haloes that exist in and around voids. in the nonlocalmodel, the impact of the modified density profiles and the direct modificationsto lensing are comparable, but they boost the lensing signal by only $\approx10\%$, compared with that of gr. overall, our results suggest that lensing byvoids is a promising tool to test models of gravity that modify lensing.

1507.01998	the copernicus complexio: statistical properties of warm dark matter  haloes	the recent detection of a 3.5 kev x-ray line from the centres of galaxies andclusters by bulbul et al. (2014a) and boyarsky et al. (2014a) has beeninterpreted as emission from the decay of 7 kev sterile neutrinos which couldmake up the (warm) dark matter (wdm). as part of the copernicus complexio(coco) programme, we investigate the properties of dark matter haloes formed ina high-resolution cosmological $n$-body simulation from initial conditionssimilar to those expected in a universe in which the dark matter consists of 7kev sterile neutrinos. this simulation and its cold dark matter (cdm)counterpart have $\sim13.4$bn particles, each of mass $\sim 10^5\, h^{-1}m_\odot$, providing detailed information about halo structure and evolutiondown to dwarf galaxy mass scales. non-linear structure formation on smallscales ($m_{200}\, \leq\, 2 \times 10^9\,h^{-1}\,m_\odot$) begins slightlylater in coco-warm than in coco-cold. the halo mass function at the present dayin the wdm model begins to drop below its cdm counterpart at a mass $\sim 2\times 10^{9}\,h^{-1}\,m_\odot$ and declines very rapidly towards lower massesso that there are five times fewer haloes of mass $m_{200}=10^{8}\,h^{-1}\,m_\odot$ in coco-warm than in coco-cold. halo concentrations ondwarf galaxy scales are correspondingly smaller in coco-warm, and we provide asimple functional form that describes its evolution with redshift. the shapesof haloes are similar in the two cases, but the smallest haloes in coco-warmrotate slightly more slowly than their cdm counterparts.

0805.3428	microscopic and macroscopic behaviors of palatini modified gravity  theories	we show that, within modified gravity, the non-linear nature of the fieldequations implies that the usual naive averaging procedure (replacing themicroscopic energy-momentum by its cosmological average) is invalid. we discussthen how the averaging should be performed correctly and show that, as aconsequence, at classical level the physical masses and geodesics of particles,cosmology and astrophysics in palatini modified gravity theories are allindistinguishable from the results of general relativity plus a cosmologicalconstant. palatini gravity is however a different theory from generalrelativity and predicts different internal structures of particles from thelatter. on the other hand, and in contrast to classical particles, theelectromagnetic field permeates in the space, hence a different averagingprocedure should be applied here. we show that in general palatini gravitytheories would then affect the propagation of photons, thus changing thebehaviour of a universe dominated by radiation. finally, palatini theories alsopredict alterations to particle physics laws. for example, it can lead tosensitive corrections to the hydrogen energy levels, the measurements of whichcould be used to place very strong constraints on the properties of viablepalatini gravity theories

1508.07366	cluster gas fraction as a test of gravity	we propose a new cosmological test of gravity, by using the observed massfraction of x-ray emitting gas in massive galaxy clusters. the cluster gasfraction, believed to be a fair sample of the average baryon fraction in theuniverse, is a well-understood observable, which has previously mainly beenused to constrain background cosmology. in some modified gravity models, suchas $f(r)$ gravity, gas temperature in a massive cluster is determined by theeffective mass of that cluster, which can be larger than its true mass. on theother hand, x-ray luminosity is determined by the true gas density, which inboth modified gravity and $\lambda$cdm models depends mainly on $\omega_{\rmb}/\omega_{\rm m}$ and hence the true total cluster mass. as a result, thestandard practice of combining gas temperatures and x-ray surface brightnessesof clusters to infer their gas fractions can, in modified gravity models, leadto a larger - in $f(r)$ gravity this can be $1/3$ larger - value of$\omega_{\rm b}/\omega_{\rm m}$ than that inferred from other observations suchas the cmb. a quick calculation shows that the hu-sawicki $n=1$ $f(r)$ modelwith $|\bar{f}_{r0}|=3\sim5\times10^{-5}$ is in tension with the gas fractiondata of the 42 clusters analysed by allen et al. (2008). we also discuss theimplications for other modified gravity models.

0805.4400	testing alternative theories of dark matter with the cmb	we propose a method to study and constrain modified gravity theories for darkmatter using cmb temperature anisotropies and polarization. we assume that thetheories considered here have already passed the matter power-spectrum test oflarge-scale structure. with this requirement met, we show that a modifiedgravity theory can be specified by parametrizing the time evolution of itsdark-matter density contrast, which is completely controlled by the dark matterstress history. we calculate how the stress history with a givenparametrization affects the cmb observables, and a qualitative discussion ofthe physical effects involved is supplemented with numerical examples. it isfound that, in general, alternative gravity theories can be efficientlyconstrained by the cmb temperature and polarization spectra. there exist,however, special cases where modified gravity cannot be distinguished from thecdm model even by using both cmb and matter power spectrum observations, norcan they be efficiently restricted by other observables in perturbedcosmologies. our results show how the stress properties of dark matter, whichdetermine the evolutions of both density perturbations and the gravitationalpotential, can be effectively investigated using just the general conservationequations and without assuming any specific theoretical gravitational theorywithin a wide class.

1511.08200	speeding up n-body simulations of modified gravity: vainshtein screening  models	we introduce and demonstrate the power of a method to speed up currentiterative techniques for n-body modified gravity simulations. our method isbased on the observation that the accuracy of the final result is notcompromised if the calculation of the fifth force becomes less accurate, butsubstantially faster, in high-density regions where it is weak due toscreening. we focus on the ndgp model which employs vainshtein screening, andtest our method by running amr simulations in which the solutions on the finerlevels of the mesh (high density) are not obtained iteratively, but insteadinterpolated from coarser levels. we show that the impact this has on thematter power spectrum is below $1\%$ for $k &lt; 5h/{\rm mpc}$ at $z = 0$, andeven smaller at higher redshift. the impact on halo properties is also small($\lesssim 3\%$ for abundance, profiles, mass; and $\lesssim 0.05\%$ forpositions and velocities). the method can boost the performance of modifiedgravity simulations by more than a factor of 10, which allows them to be pushedto resolution levels that were previously hard to achieve.

0705.3795	the cosmology of modified gauss-bonnet gravity	we consider the cosmology where some function f(g) of the gauss-bonnet term gis added to the gravitational action to account for the late-time acceleratingexpansion of the universe. the covariant and gauge invariant perturbationequations are derived with a method which could also be applied to generalf(r,r^abr_ab,r^abcdr_abcd) gravitational theories. it is pointed out that,despite their fourth-order character, such f(g) gravity models generally cannotreproduce arbitrary background cosmic evolutions; for example, the standardlcdm paradigm with omega_de = 0.76 cannot be realized in f(g) gravity theoriesunless f is a true cosmological constant because it imposes exclusionaryconstraints on the form of f(g). we analyze the perturbation equations and findthat, as in f(r) model, the stability of early-time perturbation growth putssome constraints on the functional form of f(g), in this case d^2 f/d g^2 &lt; 0.furthermore, the stability of small-scale perturbations also requires that fnot deviate significantly from a constant. these analyses are illustrated bynumerically propagating the perturbation equations with a specific modelreproducing a representative lcdm cosmic history. our results show how the f(g)models are highly constrained by cosmological data.

gr-qc;0701111	the cosmology of f(r) gravity in the metric variational approach	we consider the cosmologies that arise in a subclass of f(r) gravity withf(r)=r+\mu ^{2n+2}/(-r)^{n} and -1&lt;n&lt;0 in the metric (as opposed to thepalatini) variational approach to deriving the gravitational field equations.the calculations of the isotropic and homogeneous cosmological models areundertaken in the jordan frame and at both the background and the perturbationlevels. for the former, we also discuss the connection to the einstein frame inwhich the extra degree of freedom in the theory is associated with a scalarfield sharing some of the properties of a 'chameleon' field. for the latter, wederive the cosmological perturbation equations in general theories of f(r)gravity in covariant form and implement them numerically to calculate thecosmic-microwave-background temperature and matter-power spectra of thecosmological model. the cmb power is shown to reduce at low l's, and the matterpower spectrum is almost scale-independent at small scales, thus having asimilar shape to that in standard general relativity. these are in starkcontrast with what was found in the palatini f(r) gravity, where the cmb poweris largely amplified at low l's and the matter spectrum is stronglyscale-dependent at small scales. these features make the present model moreadaptable than that arising from the palatini f(r) field equations, and none ofthe data on background evolution, cmb power spectrum, or matter power spectrumcurrently rule it out.

hep-ph;0511013	big bang nucleosynthesis constraints on universal extra dimensions and  varying fundamental constants	the successful prediction of light element abundances from big bangnucleosynthesis has been a pillar of the standard model of cosmology. becausemany of the relevant reaction rates are sensitive to the values of fundamentalconstants, such as the fine structure constant and the strong couplingconstant, bbn is a useful tool to probe and to put constraints on possiblecosmological variations of these constants, which arise naturally from manyversions of extra-dimensional theories. in this paper, we study the dependencesof fundamental constants on the radion field of the universal extra dimensionmodel, and calculate the effects of such varying constants on bbn. we show thatthe discrepancy between bbn and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe dataon the baryon-to-photon ratio may be reduced if the volume of the extradimensions was slightly larger - by $\mathcal{o} (10^{-3})$ - at the bbn eracompared to its present value, which would result in smaller gauge couplings atbbn by the same factor.
