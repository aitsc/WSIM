0706.1787	the search for the missing baryons at low redshift	at low redshift, only about one-tenth of the known baryons lie in galaxies orthe hot gas seen in galaxy clusters and groups. models posit that these"missing baryons" are in gaseous form in overdense filaments that connect themuch denser virialized groups and clusters. about 30% are cool (&lt;1e5 k) and aredetected in ly alpha absorption studies, but about half is predicted to lie inthe 1e5-1e7 k regime. gas is detected in the 2-5e5 k range through oviabsorption studies (7% of the baryons) and possibly near 1e5 k from broad lyabsorption (20% of the baryons). hotter gas (0.5-2e6 k) is detected at zeroredshift by ovii and oviii k x-ray absorption, and the ovii line strengths seemto correlate with the galactic soft x-ray background, so it is probablyproduced by galactic halo gas, rather than a local group medium. there are nocompelling detections of the intergalactic hot gas (0.5-10e6 k) either inabsorption or emission and these upper limits are consistent with theoreticalmodels. claimed x-ray absorption lines are not confirmed, while most of theclaims of soft emission are attributable to artifacts of background subtractionand field-flattening. the missing baryons should become detectable withmoderate improvements in instrumental sensitivity.

0903.0429	elemental abundances in the x-ray gas of early-type galaxies with xmm  and chandra observations	the source of hot gas in elliptical galaxies is thought to be due to stellarmass loss, with contributions from supernova events and possibly from infallfrom a surrounding environment. this picture predicts supersolar values for themetallicity of the gas toward the inner part of the galaxy, which can be testedby measuring the gas phase abundances. we use high-quality data for 10 nearbyearly-type galaxy from xmm-newton, featuring both the epic and the reflectiongrating spectrometer, where the strongest emission lines are detected withlittle blending; some chandra data are also used. we find excellent consistencyin the elemental abundances between the different xmm instruments and goodconsistency with chandra. differences in abundances with aperture size andmodel complexity are examined, but large differences rarely occur. for atwo-temperature thermal model plus a point source contribution, the median feand o abundances are 0.86 and 0.44 of the solar value, while si and mgabundances are similar to that for fe. this is similar to stellar abundancesfor these galaxies but supernovae were expected to enhance the gas phaseabundances considerably, which is not observed.

0904.1007	redshift evolution in the iron abundance of the intracluster medium	clusters of galaxies provide a closed box within which one can determine thechemical evolution of the gaseous baryons with cosmic time. we studied thismetallicity evolution in the hot x-ray emitting baryons through an analysis ofxmm-newton observations of 29 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.3 &lt; z &lt;1.3. taken alone, this data set does not show evidence for significantevolution. however, when we also include a comparable sample of 115 clustersobserved with chandra (maughan et al. 2008) and a lower redshift sample of 70clusters observed with xmm at z &lt; 0.3 (snowden et al. 2008), there isdefinitive evidence for a decrease in the metallicity. this decrease isapproximately a factor of two from z = 0 to z \approx 1, over which we find aleast-squares best-fit line z(z) / z_{\odot} = (0.46 \pm 0.05) - (0.38 \pm0.03)z. the greatest uncertainty in the evolution comes from poorly constrainedmetallicities in the highest redshift bin.

0907.0275	x-ray searches for emission from the whim in the galactic halo and the  intergalactic medium	at least 50% of the baryons in the local universe are undetected andpredicted to be in a hot dilute phase (1e5-1e7 k) in low and moderateoverdensity environments. we searched for the predicted diffuse faint emissionthrough shadowing observations whereby cool foreground gas absorbs more distantdiffuse emission. observations were obtained with chandra and xmm-newton. usingthe cold gas in two galaxies, ngc 891 and ngc 5907, shadows were not detectedand a newer observation of ngc 891 fails to confirm a previously reported x-rayshadow. our upper limits lie above model predictions. for local group studies,we used a cloud in the magellanic stream and a compact high velocity cloud tosearch for a shadow. instead of a shadow, the x-ray emission was brightertowards the magellanic stream cloud and there is a less significant brightnessenhancement toward the other cloud also. the brightness enhancement toward themagellanic stream cloud is probably due to an interaction with a hot ambientmedium that surrounds the milky way. we suggest that this interaction drives ashock into the cloud, heating the gas to x-ray emitting temperatures.

0907.3489	mass loss from planetary nebulae in elliptical galaxies	early-type galaxies possess a dilute hot (2-10e6 k) gas that is probably thethermalized ejecta of the mass loss from evolving stars. we investigate theprocesses by which the mass loss from orbiting stars interacts with thestationary hot gas for the case of the mass ejected in a planetary nebulaevent. numerical hydrodynamic simulations show that at first, the ejectaexpands nearly symmetrically, with an upstream bow shock in the hot ambientgas. at later times, the flow past the ejecta creates fluid instabilities thatcause about half of the ejecta to separate and the other half to flow moreslowly downstream in a narrow wake. when radiative cooling is included, most ofthe material in the wake (&gt;80%) remains below 1e5 k while the separated ejectais hotter (1e5-1e6 k). the separated ejecta is still less than one-quarter thetemperature of the ambient medium and the only way it will reach thetemperature of the ambient medium is through turbulent mixing (after thematerial has left the grid). these calculations suggest that a significantfraction of the planetary nebula ejecta may not become part of the hot ambientmaterial. this is in contrast to our previous calculations for continuous massloss from giant stars in which most of the mass loss became hot gas. wespeculate that detectable ovi emission may be produced, but more sophisticatedcalculations will be required to determine the emission spectrum and to betterdefine the fraction of cooled material.

0907.3494	the disk-halo connection and where has all the gas gone?	the wealth of data in the past decades, and especially in the past 15 yearshas transformed our picture of the gas around the milky way and other spiralgalaxies. there is good evidence for extraplanar gas that is a few kpc inheight and is seen in all gaseous phases: neutral; warm atomic; and hot, x-rayemitting gas. this medium is seen not only around the milky way, but otherspiral galaxies and it is related to the star formation rate, so it is likelyproduced by the activity in the disk through a galactic fountain. more extendedexamples of halo gas are seen, such as the hvc around the milky way and aroundm31. this gas is typically 10-20 kpc from the galaxy and is not seen beyond 50kpc. this gas is most likely being accreted. a hot dilute halo (1e6 k) ispresent with a similar size, although its size is poorly determined. an ongoingcontroversy surrounds the relative amounts of outflow from the disk andaccretion onto galaxies such as the milky way. there is good evidence foraccretion of cold material onto the milky way and other galaxies, but it is notclear if there is enough to modify the gas content and star formationproperties in the disk. the reservoir of accretion material is as yetunidentified. some of these findings may be related to the issue that galaxiesare baryon-poor: their baryon to dark matter ratio is well below thecosmological value. the absence of baryons may be due to extremely violentoutflow events in the early stages of galaxy formation. we may be able tounderstand this stage of galaxy evolution by applying our deepeningunderstanding of our local disk-halo environment.

0707.1699	x-ray absorption from the milky way halo and the local group	million degree gas is present at near-zero redshift and is due either to agaseous galactic halo or a more diffuse but very massive local group medium. wecan discriminate between these models because the column densities shoulddepend on location in the sky, either relative to the galaxy bulge or to them31-milky way axis. to search for these signatures, we measured the ovii kalphaabsorption line strength toward 25 bright agns, plus lmc x-3, using xmm-newtonrgs archival data. the data are in conflict with a purely local group model,but support the galactic halo model. the strongest correlation is between theovii equivalent widths and the rosat background emission measurement in the r45band (0.4-1 kev), for which ovii emission makes the largest singlecontribution. this suggests that much of the ovii emission and absorption arecospatial, from which the radius of a uniform halo appears to lie the range15-110 kpc. the present data do not constrain the type of halo gas model and anequally good fit is obtained in a model where the gas density decreases as apower-law, such as r^(-3/2). for a uniform halo with a radius of 20 kpc, theelectron density would be 9e-4 cm^(-3), and the gas mass is 4e8 msolar. theredshift of the four highest s/n ovii measurements is consistent with a milkyway origin rather than a local group origin.

0911.2230	on the baryon fractions in clusters and groups of galaxies	we present the baryon fractions of 2mass groups and clusters as a function ofcluster richness using total and gas masses measured from stacked rosat x-raydata and stellar masses estimated from the infrared galaxy catalogs. we detectx-ray emission even in the outskirts of clusters, beyond r_200 for richnessclasses with x-ray temperatures above 1 kev. this enables us to more accuratelydetermine the total gas mass in these groups and clusters. we find that theoptically selected groups and clusters have flatter temperature profiles andhigher stellar-to-gas mass ratios than the individually studied, x-ray brightclusters. we also find that the stellar mass in poor groups with temperaturesbelow 1 kev is comparable to the gas mass in these systems. combining theseresults with individual measurements for clusters, groups, and galaxies fromthe literature, we find a break in the baryon fraction at ~1 kev. above thistemperature, the baryon fraction scales with temperature as f_b \proptot^0.20\pm0.03. we see significantly smaller baryon fractions below thistemperature, and the baryon fraction of poor groups joins smoothly onto that ofsystems with still shallower potential wells such as normal and dwarf galaxieswhere the baryon fraction scales with the inferred velocity dispersion as f_b\propto \sigma^1.6. the small scatter in the baryon fraction at any givenpotential well depth favors a universal baryon loss mechanism and a preheatingmodel for the baryon loss. the scatter is, however, larger for less massivesystems. finally, we note that although the broken power-law relation can beinferred from data points in the literature alone, the consistency between thebaryon fractions for poor groups and massive galaxies inspires us to fit thetwo categories of objects (galaxies and clusters) with one relation.

0707.4001	different methods of forming cold fronts in non-merging clusters	sharp edges in x-ray surface brightness with continuous gas pressure calledcold fronts have been often found in relaxed galaxy clusters such as abell 496.models that explain cold fronts as surviving cores of head-on subclustermergers do not work well for these clusters and competing models involving gassloshing have been recently proposed. here, we test some concrete predictionsof these models in a combined analysis of density, temperature, metalabundances and abundance ratios in a deep chandra exposure of abell 496. weconfirm that the chemical discontinuities found in this cluster are notconsistent with a core merger remnant scenario. however, we find chemicalgradients across a spiral "arm" discovered at 73 kpc north of the clustercenter and coincident with the sharp edge of the main cold front in thecluster. despite the overall sn ia iron mass fraction dominance found withinthe cooling radius of this cluster, the metal enrichment along the arm,determined from silicon and iron abundances, is consistent with a lower sn iairon mass fraction (51% +- 14%) than that measured in the surrounding regions(85% +- 14%). the "arm" is also significantly colder than the surroundings by0.5-1.6 kev. the arm extends from a boxy colder region surrounding the centerof the cluster, where two other cold fronts are found. this cold arm is aprediction of current high resolution numerical simulations as a result of anoff-center encounter with a less massive pure dark matter halo and we suggestthat the cold fronts in a496 provide the first clear corroboration of suchmodel, where the closest encounter happened ~ 0.5 gyr ago. we also argue for apossible candidate dark matter halo responsible for the cold fronts in theoutskirts of a496.

1105.4614	detection of a hot gaseous halo around the giant spiral galaxy ngc 1961	hot gaseous halos are predicted around all large galaxies and are criticallyimportant for our understanding of galaxy formation, but they have never beendetected at distances beyond a few kpc around a spiral galaxy. we used thechandra acis-i instrument to search for diffuse x-ray emission around an idealcandidate galaxy: the isolated giant spiral ngc 1961. we observed fourquadrants around the galaxy for 30 ks each, carefully subtracting backgroundand point source emission, and found diffuse emission that appears to extend to40-50 kpc. we fit $\beta$-models to the emission, and estimate a hot halo masswithin 50 kpc of $5\times10^9 m_{\odot}$. when this profile is extrapolated to500 kpc (the approximate virial radius), the implied hot halo mass is$1-3\times10^{11} m_{\odot}$. these mass estimates assume a gas metallicity of$z = 0.5 z_{\odot}$. this galaxy's hot halo is a large reservoir of gas, butfalls significantly below observational upper limits set by pervious searches,and suggests that ngc 1961 is missing 75% of its baryons relative to the cosmicmean, which would tentatively place it below an extrapolation of the baryontully-fisher relationship of less massive galaxies. the cooling rate of the gasis no more than 0.4 $m_{\odot}$/year, more than an order of magnitude below thegas consumption rate through star formation. we discuss the implications ofthis halo for galaxy formation models.

1403.0584	modeling x-ray emission around galaxies	extended x-ray emission can be studied either spatially (through its surfacebrightness profile) or spectrally (by analyzing the spectrum at variouslocations in the field). both techniques have advantages and disadvantages, andwhen the emission becomes particularly faint and/or extended, the two methodscan disagree. we argue that an ideal approach would be to model the events filedirectly, and therefore to use both the spectral and spatial information whichare simultaneously available for each event. in this work we propose a firststep in this direction, introducing a method for spatial analysis which can beextended to leverage spectral information simultaneously. we construct a modelfor the entire x-ray image in a given energy band, and generate a likelihoodfunction to compare the model to the data. a critical goal of this modeling isdisentangling vignetted and unvignetted backgrounds through their differentspatial distributions. employing either maximum likelihood or markov chainmonte carlo, we can derive probability distribution functions for the sourceand background parameters together, or we can fit and subtract the background,leaving the description of the source non-parametric. we calibrate anddemonstrate this method against a variety of simulated images, and then applyit to chandra observations of the hot gaseous halo around the elliptical galaxyngc 720. we are able to follow the x-ray emission below a tenth of thebackground, and to infer a hot gas mass within 35 kpc of 4-5x10^9 msun, withsome indication that the profile continues to at least 50 kpc and that itsteepens as the radius increases. we derive much stronger constraints on thesurface brightness profile than previous studies, which employed the spectralmethod, and we show that the density profiles inferred from these studies arein conflict with the observed surface brightness profile.

0803.1772	an infrared survey of brightest cluster galaxies. ii: why are some  brightest cluster galaxies forming stars?	quillen et al.(2007) presented an imaging survey with the {\it spitzer spacetelescope} of 62 brightest cluster galaxies with optical line emission locatedin the cores of x-ray luminous clusters. they found that at least half of thesesources have signs of excess infrared emission. here we discuss the nature ofthe ir emission and its implications for cool core clusters. the strength ofthe mid-ir excess emission correlates with the luminosity of the opticalemission lines. excluding the four systems dominated by an agn, the excessmid-infrared emission in the remaining brightest cluster galaxies is likelyrelated to star formation. the mass of molecular gas (estimated from coobservations) is correlated with the ir luminosity as found for normal starforming galaxies. the gas depletion time scale is about 1 gyr. the physicalextent of the infrared excess is consistent with that of the optical emissionline nebulae. this supports the hypothesis that the star formation occurs inmolecular gas associated with the emission line nebulae and with evidence thatthe emission line nebulae are mainly powered by ongoing star formation. we finda correlation between mass deposition rates (${\dot m}_x$) estimated from thex-ray emission and the star formation rate estimated from the infraredluminosity. the star formation rates are 1/10 to 1/100 of the mass depositionrates suggesting that the re-heating of the icm is generally very effective inreducing the amount of mass cooling from the hot phase but not eliminating itcompletely.

0803.2817	on the lack of strong o-line excess in the coma cluster outskirts from  suzaku	about half of the baryons in the local universe are thought to reside in theso-called warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) at temperatures of 0.1-10million k. thermal soft excess emission in the spectrum of some clusteroutskirts that contains ovii and/or oviii emission lines is regarded asevidence of the whim, although the origin of the lines is controversial due tostrong galactic and solar system foreground emission. we observed the coma-11field, where the most prominent thermal soft excess has ever been reported,with suzaku xis in order to make clear the origin of the excess. we did notconfirm ovii or oviii excess emission. the ovii and oviii intensity in coma-11is more than 5 sigma below that reported before and we obtained 2 sigma upperlimits of 2.8 and 2.9 photons cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 for ovii and oviii,respectively. the intensities are consistent with those in another field(coma-7) that we measured, and with other measurements in the coma outskirts(coma-7 and x com fields with xmm-newton). we did not confirm the spatialvariation within coma outskirts. the strong oxygen emission lines previouslyreported are likely due to solar wind charge exchange.

1408.4115	non-detection of x-ray emission from sterile neutrinos in stacked galaxy  spectra	we conduct a comprehensive search for x-ray emission lines from sterileneutrino dark matter, motivated by recent claims of unidentified emission linesin the stacked x-ray spectra of galaxy clusters and the centers of the milkyway and m31. since the claimed emission lines lie around 3.5 kev, we focus ongalaxies and galaxy groups (masking the central regions), since these objectsemit very little radiation above $\sim 2$ kev and offer a clean backgroundagainst which to detect emission lines. we develop a formalism for maximizingthe signal-to-noise of decaying dark matter emission lines by weighing eachx-ray event according to the expected dark matter profile. in total, we examine81 and 89 galaxies with chandra and xmm-newton respectively, totaling 15.0 and14.6 ms of integration time. we find no significant evidence of any emissionlines, placing strong constraints on the mixing angle of sterile neutrinos withmasses between 4.8-12.4 kev. in particular, if the 3.57 kev feature from bulbulet al. (2014) were due to 7.1 kev sterile neutrino emission, we would havedetected it at $4.4\sigma$ and $11.8\sigma$ in our two samples. the mostconservative estimates of the systematic uncertainties reduce these constraintsto $4.4\sigma$ and 7.8$\sigma$, or letting the line energy vary between 3.50and 3.60 kev reduces these constraints to $2.7\sigma$ and $11.0\sigma$respectively. unlike previous constraints, our measurements do not depend onthe model of the x-ray background or on the assumed logarithmic slope of thecenter of the dark matter profile.

1412.3116	constraining the milky way's hot gas halo with ovii and ovii emission  lines	the milky way hosts a hot ($\approx 2 \times 10^6$ k), diffuse, gaseous halobased on detections of z = 0 ovii and oviii absorption lines in quasar spectraand emission lines in blank-sky spectra. here we improve constraints on thestructure of the hot gas halo by fitting a radial model to a much larger sampleof ovii and oviii emission line measurements from xmm-newton epic-mos spectracompared to previous studies ($\approx$ 650 sightlines). we assume a modified$\beta$-model for the halo density distribution and a constant-density localbubble from which we calculate emission to compare with the observations. wefind an acceptable fit to the oviii emission line observations with$\chi^{2}_{red}$ (dof) = 1.08 (644) for best-fit parameters of $n_or_c^{3\beta} = 1.35 \pm 0.24$ cm$^{-3}$ kpc$^{3\beta}$ and $\beta = 0.50 \pm0.03$ for the hot gas halo and negligible local bubble contribution. the oviiobservations yield an unacceptable $\chi^{2}_{red}$ (dof) = 4.69 (645) forsimilar best-fit parameters, which is likely due to temperature or densityvariations in the local bubble. the oviii fitting results imply hot gas massesof $m$(&lt; 50 kpc) = $3.8_{-0.3}^{+0.3} \times 10^{9} m_{\odot}$ and $m$(&lt; 250kpc) = $4.3_{-0.8}^{+0.9} \times 10^{10} m_{\odot}$, accounting for $\lesssim$50% of the milky way's missing baryons. we also explore our results in thecontext of optical depth effects in the halo gas, the halo gas coolingproperties, temperature and entropy gradients in the halo gas, and the gasmetallicity distribution. the combination of absorption and emission lineanalyses implies a sub-solar gas metallicity that decreases with radius, butthat also must be $\geq 0.3 z_{\odot}$ to be consistent with the pulsardispersion measure toward the lmc.

1503.03489	the swift agn and cluster survey i: number counts of agn and galaxy  clusters	the swift agn and cluster survey (sacs) uses 125 deg^2 of swift xrtserendipitous fields with variable depths surrounding gamma-ray bursts toprovide a medium depth (4e-15 erg/s/cm^2) and area survey filling the gapbetween deep, narrow chandra/xmm-newton surveys and wide, shallow rosatsurveys. here we present a catalog of 22,563 point sources and 442 extendedsources and examine the number counts of the agn and galaxy clusterpopulations. sacs provides excellent constraints on the agn number counts atthe bright end with negligible uncertainties due to cosmic variance, and theseconstraints are consistent with previous measurements. we use wise mid-infrared(mir) colors to classify the sources. for agn we can roughly separate the pointsources into mir-red and mir-blue agn, finding roughly equal numbers of eachtype in the soft x-ray band (0.5-2 kev), but fewer mir-blue sources in the hardx-ray band (2-8 kev). the cluster number counts, with 5% uncertainties fromcosmic variance, are also consistent with previous surveys but span a muchlarger continuous flux range. deep optical or ir follow-up observations of thiscluster sample will significantly increase the number of higher redshift (z &gt;0.5) x-ray-selected clusters.

0705.2242	the search for million degree gas through the nvii hyperfine line	gas in the million degree range occurs in a variety of astronomicalenvironments, and it may be the main component of the elusive missing baryonsat low redshift. the nvii ion is found in this material and it has a hyperfinespin-flip transition with a rest frequency of 53.042 ghz, which can be observedfor z &gt; 0.1, when it is shifted into a suitably transparent radio band. we usedthe 42-48 ghz spectrometer on the green bank telescope to search for bothemission and absorption from this nvii transmission. for absorption studies,3c273, 3c 279, 3c 345, and 4c+39.25 were observed but no feature were seenabove the 5 sigma level. for emission line studies, we observed abell 1835,abell 2390 and the star-forming galaxy pks 1345+12, but no features were seenexceeding 5 sigma. we examine whether the strongest emission feature, in abell2390 (3.7 sigma), and the strongest absorption feature, toward 4c+39.25 (3.8sigma), might be expected from theoretical models. the emission feature wouldrequire ~1e10 msolar of 1e6 k gas, which is inconsistent with x-ray limits forthe o vii kalpha line, so it is unlikely to be real. the nvii absorptionfeature requires a nvii column of 6e16 cm^-2, higher than model predictions byat least an order of magnitude, which makes it inconsistent with modelexpectations. the individual observations were less than 1 hr in length, so forlengthy observations, we show that nvii absorption line observations can beginto be useful in in the search for hot intergalactic gas.

1505.00016	binary frequencies in globular clusters	binary stars are predicted to have an important role in the evolution ofglobular clusters, so we obtained binary fractions for 35 globular clustersthat were imaged in the f606w and f814w with the acs on the hubble spacetelescope. when compared to the values of prior efforts (sollima et al. 2007;milone et al. 2012), we find significant discrepancies, despite each groupcorrecting for contamination effects and having performed the appropriatereliability tests. the most reliable binary fractions are obtained whenrestricting the binary fraction to q &gt; 0.5. our analysis indicates that therange of the binary fractions is nearly an order of magnitude for the lowestdynamical ages, suggesting that there is a broad distribution in the binaryfraction at globular cluster formation. dynamical effects also appears todecrease the core binary fractions by a factor of two over a hubble time, butthis is a weak relationship. we confirm a correlation from previous work thatthe binary fraction within the core radius decreases with cluster age,indicating that younger clusters formed with higher binary fractions. thestrong radial gradient in the binary fraction with cluster radius appears to bea consequence of dynamical interactions. it is often not present in dynamicallyyoung clusters but nearly always present in dynamically old clusters.

0805.4331	mass loss from evolved stars in elliptical galaxies	most of the x-ray emitting gas in early-type galaxies probably originatesfrom red giant mass loss and here we model the interaction between this stellarmass loss and the hot ambient medium. using two-dimensional hydrodynamicsimulations, we adopt a temperature for the ambient medium of 3e6 k along witha range of ambient densities and stellar velocities. when the stellar velocityis supersonic relative to the ambient medium, a bow shock occurs, along with ashock driven into the stellar ejecta, which heats only a fraction of the gas.behind the bow shock, a cool wake develops but the fast flow of the hot mediumcauses kelvin-helmholtz instabilities to grow and these fingers are shocked andheated (without radiative cooling). along with the mixing of this wake materialwith the hot medium, most of the stellar ejecta is heated to approximately thetemperature of the hot ambient medium within 2 pc of the star. with theaddition of radiative cooling, some wake material remains cool (&lt; 1e5 k),accounting for up to 25% of the stellar mass loss. less cooled gas surviveswhen the ambient density is lower or when the stellar velocity is higher thanin our reference case. these results suggest that some cooled gas should bepresent in the inner part of early-type galaxies that have a hot ambientmedium. these calculations may explain the observed distributed opticalemission line gas as well as the presence of dust in early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0005469	maximum entropy reconstruction of the interstellar medium: i. theory	we have developed a technique to map the three-dimensional structure of thelocal interstellar medium using a maximum entropy reconstruction technique. aset of column densities n to stars of known distance can in principle be usedto recover a three-dimensional density field n, since the two quantities arerelated by simple geometry through the equation n = c n, where c is a matrixcharacterizing the stellar spatial distribution. in practice, however, there isan infinte number of solutions to this equation. we use a maximum entropyreconstruction algorithm to find the density field containing the leastinformation which is consistent with the observations. the solution obtainedwith this technique is, in some sense, the model containing the minimumstructure. we apply the algorithm to several simulated data sets to demonstrateits feasibility and success at recovering ``real'' density contrasts.  this technique can be applied to any set of column densities whose end pointsare specified. in a subsequent paper we shall describe the application of thismethod to a set of stellar color excesses to derive a map of the dustdistribution, and to soft x-ray absorption columns to hot stars to derive a mapof the total density of the interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0107493	untangling the x-ray emission from the sa galaxy ngc1291 with chandra	we present a chandra acis-s observation of the nearby bulge-dominated sagalaxy ngc1291. the x-ray emission from the bulge resembles the x-ray emissionfrom a sub-class of elliptical and s0 galaxies with low l_x/l_b luminosityratios. the x-ray emission is composed of a central point-like nucleus, ~50point sources that are most likely low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), and diffusegas detectable out to a radius of 120" (5.2 kpc). the diffuse gas has a globaltemperature of 0.32^{+0.04}_{-0.03} kev and metallicity of 0.06 +/- 0.02 solar,and both quantities marginally decrease with increasing radius. the hot gasfills the hole in the hi distribution, and the softening of the spectrum of thex-ray gas with radius might indicate a thermal coupling of the hot and coldphases of the interstellar medium as previously suggested. the integrated x-rayluminosity of the lmxbs, once normalized by the optical luminosity, is a factorof 1.4 less than in the elliptical galaxy ngc4697 or s0 galaxy ngc1553. thedifference in l_{x,stellar}/l_b between the galaxies appears to be because of alack of very bright sources in ngc1291. no sources above 3 x 10^38 ergs/s werefound in ngc1291 when ~7 were expected from scaling from ngc4697 and ngc1553.the cumulative l_{x,stellar}/l_b value including only sources below 1.0 x 10^38ergs/s is remarkably similar between ngc1291 and ngc4697, if a recent surfacebrightness fluctuation-determined distance is assumed for ngc4697. if this is acommon feature of the lmxb population in early-type systems, it might be usedas a distance indicator. finally, a bright, variable (1.6-3.1 x 10^39 ergs/s)source was detected at the optical center of the galaxy. its spectrum showsexcess soft emission superimposed on a highly absorbed power law component,similar to what has been found in several other low luminosity agn (abridged).

astro-ph;0211314	the optical counterpart of a ultraluminous x-ray object in m81	ultraluminous x-ray objects are off-nucleus point sources with$l_x=10^{39}$-$10^{41}$ erg/s and are among the most poorly understood x-raysources. to help understand their nature, we are trying to identify theiroptical counterparts by combining images from the hubble space telescope andthe chandra observatory. here we report an optical counterpart for ulx ngc 3031x-11, which has average x-ray luminosity of $\sim2\times10^{39}$ erg/s and hasvaried by a factor of 40% over the last 20 years. we find a unique opticalcounterpart with the magnitude and color of an o8v star and we identify this asthe secondary in a binary system. the primary is believed to be a black hole ofapproximately 18 $m_\odot$, based on analyses of acis and asca spectra. thisbinary system probably is powered by mass transfer from the o8v star onto theblack hole, with the roche lobe equal to the stellar radius. this modelpredicts an orbital period of $\sim1.8$ days, which can be tested by futureobservations.

astro-ph;0212422	x-ray spectral properties of low-mass x-ray binaries in nearby galaxies	we investigated the x-ray spectral properties of a collection of low-massx-ray binaries (lmxbs) within a sample of 15 nearby early-type galaxiesobserved with chandra. we find that the spectrum of the sum of the sources in agiven galaxy is remarkably similar from galaxy to galaxy when only sources withx-ray luminosities less than 10^39 ergs/s (0.3-10 kev) are considered. fittingthese lower luminosity sources in all galaxies simultaneously yielded abest-fit power law exponent of gamma = 1.56 +/- 0.02 (or kt_brem = 7.3 +/- 0.3kev). this is the tightest constraint to date on the spectral properties oflmxbs in external galaxies. there is no apparent difference in the spectralproperties of lmxbs that reside inside and outside globular clusters. wedemonstrate how the uniformity of the spectral properties of lmxbs can lead tomore accurate determinations of the temperature and metallicity of the hot gasin galaxies. although few in number in any given galaxy, sources withluminosities of 1-2 x 10^39 ergs/s are present in 10 of the galaxies. thespectra of these luminous sources are softer than the spectra of the rest ofthe sources, and are consistent with the spectra of galactic black hole x-raybinary candidates when they are in their very high state. the spectra of thesesources are very different than those of ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs)found within spiral galaxies, suggesting that the two populations of x-rayluminous objects have different formation mechanisms. the number of sourceswith apparent luminosities above 2 x 10^39 ergs/s is equal to the number ofexpected background agn and thus appear to not be associated with the galaxy,indicating that very luminous sources are absent or very rare in early-typegalaxies.

astro-ph;0310335	small-scale structure in the galactic ism: implications for galaxy  cluster studies	observations of extragalactic objects need to be corrected for galacticabsorption and this is often accomplished by using the measured 21 cm hicolumn. however, within the beam of the radio telescope there are variations inthe hi column that can have important effects in interpreting absorption linestudies and x-ray spectra at the softest energies. we examine the hi anddirbe/iras data for lines of sight out of the galaxy, which show evidence forhi variations in of up to a factor of three in 1 degree fields. column densityenhancements would preferentially absorb soft x-rays in spatially extendedobjects and we find evidence for this effect in the rosat pspc observations oftwo bright clusters of galaxies, abell 119 and abell 2142.  for clusters of galaxies, the failure to include column density fluctuationswill lead to systematically incorrect fits to the x-ray data in the sense thatthere will appear to be a very soft x-ray excess. this may be one cause of thesoft x-ray excess in clusters, since the magnitude of the effect is comparableto the observed values.

astro-ph;0312393	the lack of very ultraluminous x-ray sources in early-type galaxies	we have searched for ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in a sample of 28elliptical and s0 galaxies observed with chandra. we find that the number ofx-ray sources detected at a flux level that would correspond to a 0.3-10 kevx-ray luminosity of ~2 x 10^39 ergs/s or greater (for which we have used thedesignation very ultraluminous x-ray sources; vulxs) at the distance of eachgalaxy is equal to the number of expected foreground/background objects. inaddition, the vulxs are uniformly distributed over the chandra field of viewrather than distributed like the optical light of the galaxies, strengtheningthe argument that the high flux sources are unassociated with the galaxies. wehave also taken the vulx candidate list of colbert and ptak and determined thespatial distribution of vulxs in early-type galaxies and late-type galaxiesseparately. while the spiral galaxy vulxs are clearly concentrated toward thecenters of the galaxies, the early-type galaxy vulxs are distributed randomlyover the rosat hri field of view, again indicating that they are not associatedwith the galaxies themselves. we conclude that with the exception of two rarehigh luminosity objects within globular clusters of the elliptical galaxyngc1399, vulxs are generally not found within old stellar systems. however, wedo find a significant population of sources with luminosities of 1-2 x 10^39ergs/s that reside within the sample galaxies that can be explained byaccretion onto 10-20 solar mass black holes. given our results, we propose thatulxs be defined as x-ray sources with l_x(0.3-10 kev) &gt; 2 x 10^39 ergs/s.

astro-ph;0511635	galactic globular clusters with luminous x-ray binaries	luminous x-ray binaries (&gt;1e34 erg/s, lmxbs) have a neutron star or blackhole primary, and in globular clusters, most of these close binaries areexpected to be have evolved from wider binaries through dynamical interactionswith other stars. we sought to find a predictor of this formation rate that isrepresentative of the initial properties of globular clusters rather than ofthe highly evolved core quantities. models indicate the half-light quantitiesbest reflect the initial conditions, so we examine whether the associateddynamical interaction rate, proportional to l^1.5 r^-2.5, is useful inunderstanding the presence of luminous lmxbs in the galactic globular clustersystem. we find that while lmxb clusters with large values of l^1.5 r^-2.5preferentially host lmxbs, the systems must also have half-mass relaxationtimes below about 1e9 yr. this relaxation time effect probably occurs becauseseveral relaxation times are required to modify binary separations, a timescalethat must be shorter than cluster ages. the frequency of finding an lmxbcluster is enhanced if the cluster is metal-rich and if it is close to thebulge region. the dependence upon metallicity is most likely due either todiffering initial mass functions at the high mass end, or because bulge systemsevolve more rapidly from tidal interactions with the bulge. this approach canbe used to investigate globular cluster systems in external galaxies, wherecore properties are unresolved.

astro-ph;0602323	ovi observations of galaxy clusters: evidence for modest cooling flows	a prediction of the galaxy cluster cooling flow model is that as gas coolsfrom the ambient cluster temperature, emission lines are produced in gas atsubsequently decreasing temperatures. gas passing through 10^5.5 k emits in thelines of ovi 1032,1035, and here we report a fuse study of these lines in threecooling flow clusters, abell 426, abell 1795, and awm 7. no emission wasdetected from awm 7, but ovi is detected from the centers of abell 426 andabell 1795, and possibly to the south of the center in abell 1795, where x-rayand optical emission line filaments lie. in abell 426, these line luminositiesimply a cooling rate of 32+/-6 msolar/yr within the central r = 6.2 kpc region,while for abell 1795, the central cooling rate is 26+/-7 msolar/yr (within r =22 kpc), and about 42+/-9 msolar/yr including the southern pointing. includingother studies, three of six clusters have ovi emission, and they also have starformation as well as emission lines from 1e4 k gas. these observations aregenerally consistent with the cooling flow model but at a rate closer to 30msolar/yr than originally suggested values of 100-1000 msolar/yr.

astro-ph;9806385	measuring molecular, neutral atomic, and warm ionized galactic gas  through x-ray absorption	we study the column densities of neutral atomic, molecular, and warm ionizedgalactic gas through their continuous absorption of extragalactic x-ray spectraat |b| &gt; 25 degrees. for n(h,21cm) &lt; 5x10^20 cm^-2 there is an extremely tightrelationship between n(h,21cm) and the x-ray absorption column, n(xray), with amean ratio along 26 lines of sight of n(xray)/n(h,21cm) = 0.972 +- 0.022. thisis significantly less than the anticpated ratio of 1.23, which would occur ifhe were half he i and half he ii in the warm ionized component. we suggest thatthe ionized component out of the plane is highly ionized, with he being mainlyhe ii and he iii. in the limiting case that h is entirely hi, we place an upperlimit on the he abundance in the ism of he/h &lt;= 0.103.  at column densities n(xray) &gt; 5x10^20 cm^-2, which occurs at our lowerlatitudes, the x-ray absorption column n(xray) is nearly double n(h,21cm). thisexcess column cannot be due to the warm ionized component, even if he wereentirely he i, so it must be due to a molecular component. this result impliesthat for lines of sight out of the plane with |b| ~ 30 degrees, molecular gasis common and with a column density comprable to n(h,21cm).  this work bears upon the far infrared background, since a warm ionizedcomponent, anticorrelated with n(h,21cm), might produce such a background. notonly is such an anticorrelation absent, but if the dust is destroyed in thewarm ionized gas, the far infrared background may be slightly larger than thatdeduced by puget et al. (1996).

astro-ph;9810377	on the extreme ultraviolet emission from galaxy clusters	an extremely soft x-ray excess throughout galaxy clusters has been claimed asa new feature of these sytems, with important physical implications. we havereexamined this feature in the five clusters for which it has been discussed,using the most recent x-ray absorption cross sections, x-ray data processingtechniques, and a consistent set of hi data. for the virgocluster, we find thatthe spectrum can be fit with a single-temperature thermal plasma and with anx-ray absorption column that is not significantly different than the galactichi column. the result for abell 1367, abell 1656 (coma), abell 1795, and abell2199 is similar in that the difference betweenthe x-ray absorption column andthe galactic hi column is less than 3-sigma for he/h = 0.09, and for he/h =0.10 only one cluster location leads to a galactic hi column more than 3-sigmaabove the x-ray absorption column (coma, with one location with a 3.6-sigmadifference). we conclude that there is no strong evidence for the extremelysoft x-ray excess in galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;9811063	the dependence of the soft x-ray properties of lmxbs on the metallicity  of their environment	we determine the x-ray spectral properties of a sample of low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) which reside in globular clusters of m31, as well as fivelmxbs in galactic globular clusters and in the large magellanic cloud using therosat pspc. we find a trend in the x-ray properties of the lmxbs as a functionof globular cluster metallicity. the spectra of lmxbs become progressivelysofter as the metallicity of its environment increases. the one m31 globularcluster lmxb in our sample which has a metallicity greater than solar hasspectral properties similar to those of lmxbs in the bulge of m31, but markedlydifferent from those which reside in low metallicity globular clusters, both inm31 and the galaxy. the spectral properties of this high metallicity lmxb isalso similar to those of x-ray faint early-type galaxies. this lends support tothe claim that a majority of the x-ray emission from these x-ray faintearly-type galaxies results from lmxbs and not hot gas, as is the case in theirx-ray bright counterparts.

astro-ph;9811274	the closest damped lyman alpha system	a difficulty of studying damped lyman alpha systems is that they are distant,so one knows little about the interstellar medium of the galaxy. here we reportupon a damped lyman alpha system in the nearby galaxy ngc 4203, which is soclose (v_helio = 1117 km/s) and bright (b_o = 11.62) that its hi disk has beenmapped. the absorption lines are detected against ton 1480, which lies only1.9' (12 h_50 kpc) from the center of ngc 4203. observations were obtained withthe faint object spectrograph on hst (g270h grating) over the 2222-3277angstrom region with 200 km/s resolution. low ionization lines of fe, mn, andmg were detected, leading to metallicities of -2.29, &lt; -0.68, and &gt; -2.4, whichare typical of other damped lyman alpha systems, but well below the stellarmetallicity of this type of galaxy. most notably, the velocity of the lines is1160 +- 10 km/s, which is identical to the hi rotational velocity of 1170 km/sat that location in ngc 4203, supporting the view that these absorption linesystems can be associated with the rotating disks of galaxies. in addition, theline widths of the mg lines give an upper limit to the velocity dispersion of167 km/s, to the 99% confidence level.

astro-ph;9901406	radial temperature profiles of x-ray--emitting gas within clusters of  galaxies	previous analyses of asca data of clusters of galaxies have found conflictingresults regarding the slope of the temperature profile of the hot x-ray gaswithin clusters, mainly because of the large, energy-dependent point spreadfunction (psf) of the asca mirrors. we present a summary of all asca-determinedcluster temperature profiles found in the literature, and find a discrepancy inthe radial temperature trend of clusters based on which psf-correction routineis used. this uncertainty in the cluster temperature profile in turn can leadto large uncertainties in the amount of dark matter in clusters. in this study,we have used rosat pspc data to obtain independent relative temperatureprofiles for 26 clusters, most of which have had their temperature profilesdetermined by asca. our aim is not to measure the actual temperature values ofthe clusters, but to use x-ray color profiles to search for a hardening orsoftening of the spectra with radius for comparison to asca-derived profiles.the radial color profiles indicate that outside of the cooling flow region, thetemperature profiles of clusters are in general constant. within 35% of thevirial radius, we find a temperature drop of 20% at 10 kev and 12% at 5 kev canbe ruled out at the 99% confidence level. a subsample of non-cooling flowclusters shows that the condition of isothermality applies at very small radiitoo, although cooling gas complicates this determination in the cooling flowsubsample. the colors predicted from the temperature profiles of a series ofhydrodynamical cluster simulations match the data very well, although theycannot be used to discriminate among different cosmologies. an additionalresult is that the color profiles show evidence for a central peak inmetallicity in low temperature clusters.

astro-ph;9907153	using the bulge of m31 as a template for the integrated x-ray emission  from lmxbs	we have performed joint asca + rosat pspc spectral fitting on the inner 5' ofthe bulge of m31. we find that single component spectral models provide aninadequate fit to the spectrum, in contrast to previous studies by einstein andginga. although the 2-10 kev spectrum can be fit adequately with abremsstrahlung model with kt = 7.4 +/- 0.3 kev, an additional soft componentwith kt = 0.38 +/- 0.03 kev is required to fit the spectrum below 2 kev. thissoft component comprises 38% +/- 6% of the total emission in the 0.1-2.0 kevband, and possibly more depending on the absorption value used in the fit.since previous spatial studies of the bulge of m31 indicate that &lt; 25% of thex-ray emission from the bulge in this band is from a diffuse gaseous component,this implies that stellar sources, namely low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), areresponsible for some if not all of the soft component. the spectral propertiesof m31 are very similar to those of the x-ray faint early-type galaxy ngc4382.this supports the claim that the unexplained soft x-ray emission seenpreviously in these galaxies also emanates from lmxbs.

astro-ph;9909135	the effect of environment on the x-ray emission from early-type galaxies	in order to help understand the phenomena of x-ray emission from early-typegalaxies, we obtained an optically flux-limited sample of 34 early-typegalaxies, observed with rosat. a previous analysis of this sample suggestedthat the most x-ray luminous galaxies were in rich environments. here weinvestigate environmental influences quantitatively, and find a positivecorrelation between l_b/l_x and the local galaxy density. we suggest that thiscorrelation occurs because the x-ray luminosity is enhanced either throughaccretion of the intergalactic gas or because the ambient medium stiflesgalactic winds. when the ambient medium is unimportant, partial or globalgalactic winds can occur, reducing l_b/l_x. these effects lead to the largeobserved dispersion in l_x at fixed l_b. we argue that the transition fromglobal winds to partial winds is one of the principle reasons for the steeprelationship between l_x and l_b. we discuss details of the data reduction notpreviously presented, and examine the dependence of l_x on the choice of outersource radius and background location. effects of malmquist bias are shown notto be important for the issues addressed. finally, we compare the temperaturededuced for these galaxies from different analyses of rosat and asca data.

0810.5130	high-velocity clouds in the nearby spiral galaxy m 83	we present deep hi 21-cm and optical observations of the face-on spiralgalaxy m 83 obtained as part of a project to search for high-velocity clouds(hvcs) in nearby galaxies. anomalous-velocity neutral gas is detected toward m83, with 5.6x10^7 msolar of hi contained in a disk rotating 40-50 km/s moreslowly in projection than the bulk of the gas. we interpret this as avertically extended thick disk of neutral material, containing 5.5% of thetotal hi within the central 8 kpc. using an automated source detectionalgorithm to search for small-scale hi emission features, we find eightdistinct, anomalous-velocity hi clouds with masses ranging from 7x10^5 to1.5x10^7 msolar and velocities differing by up to 200 km/s compared to the hidisk. large on-disk structures are coincident with the optical spiral arms,while unresolved off-disk clouds contain no diffuse optical emission down to alimit of 27 r' mag per square arcsec. the diversity of the thick hi disk andlarger clouds suggests the influence of multiple formation mechanisms, with agalactic fountain responsible for the slowly-rotating disk and on-disk discreteclouds, and tidal effects responsible for off-disk cloud production. the massand kinetic energy of the hi clouds are consistent with the mass exchange ratepredicted by the galactic fountain model. if the hvc population in m 83 issimilar to that in our own galaxy, then the galactic hvcs must be distributedwithin a radius of less than 25 kpc.

0706.1073	the merger in abell 576: a line of sight bullet cluster?	using a combination of chandra and xmm observations, we confirmed thepresence of a significant velocity gradient along the ne/e-w/sw direction inthe intracluster gas of the cluster abell 576. the results are consistent witha previous asca sis analysis of this cluster. the error weighted average overacis-s3, epic mos 1 &amp; 2 spectrometers for the maximum velocity difference is&gt;3.3e03 km/s at the 90% confidence level, similar to the velocity limitsestimated indirectly for the "bullet" cluster (1e0657-56). the probability thatthe velocity gradient is generated by standard random gain fluctuations withchandra and xmm is &lt;0.1%. the regions of maximum velocity gradient are in ccdzones that have the lowest temporal gain variations. it is unlikely that thevelocity gradient is due to hubble distance differences between projectedclusters (probability&lt;~0.01%). we mapped the distribution of elementalabundance ratios across the cluster and detected a strong chemicaldiscontinuity using the abundance ratio of silicon to iron, equivalent to avariation from 100% sn ia iron mass fraction in the west-northwest regions to32% in the eastern region. the "center" of the cluster is located at thechemical discontinuity boundary, which is inconsistent with the radiallysymmetric chemical gradient found in some regular clusters, but consistent witha cluster merging scenario. we predict that the velocity gradient as measuredwill produce a variation of the cmb temperature towards the east of the core ofthe cluster that will be detectable by current and near-future bolometers. themeasured velocity gradient opens for the possibility that this cluster ispassing through a near line-of-sight merger stage where the cores have recentlycrossed.
