(ii) the mainknots k1, k2 and k3 -of this hypergiant shell s3- show a stellar population andemission line ratios associated with the presence of a starburst + of/shocks.(iii) the internal shells s1 and s2 show structures, of components andproperties very similar to those detected in the nuclear shells of mrk 231.(iv) the shells s1+s2 and s3 are aligned at pa = 131: i.e. suggesting that theof process is in the blow-out phase with bipolar structure. in addition, theshells s4 and s5 (at 80-100 kpc scale) are aligned at pa = 40, i.e.: a bipolarof perpendicular to the internal of. finally, the generation of uhe cosmic raysand neutrino/ dark-matter -associated with hyne in bal + ir + fe ii qsos- isdiscussed.

0902.2403	near-ir galaxy counts and evolution from the wide-field alhambra survey	the alhambra survey aims to cover 4 square degrees using a system of 20contiguous, equal width, medium-band filters spanning the range 3500 a to 9700a plus the standard jhks filters. here we analyze deep near-ir number counts ofone of our fields (alh08) for which we have a relatively large area (0.5 squaredegrees) and faint photometry (j=22.4, h=21.3 and k=20.0 at the 50% of recoveryefficiency for point-like sources). we find that the logarithmic gradient ofthe galaxy counts undergoes a distinct change to a flatter slope in each band:from 0.44 at [17.0, 18.5] to 0.34 at [19.5, 22.0] for the j band; for the hband 0.46 at [15.5, 18.0] to 0.36 at [19.0, 21.0], and in ks the change is from0.53 in the range [15.0, 17.0] to 0.33 in the interval [18.0, 20.0]. theseobservations together with faint optical counts are used to constrain modelsthat include density and luminosity evolution of the local type-dependentluminosity functions. our models imply a decline in the space density ofevolved early-type galaxies with increasing redshift, such that only 30% - 50%of the bulk of the present day red-ellipticals was already in place at z~1.

0904.3066	barred galaxies in the abell 901/2 supercluster with stages	we present a study of bar and host disk evolution in a dense clusterenvironment, based on a sample of ~800 bright (mv &lt;= -18) galaxies in the abell901/2 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w imaging from the stagessurvey, and data from spitzer, xmm-newton, and combo-17. we identify andcharacterize bars through ellipse-fitting, and other morphological featuresthrough visual classification. (1) we explore three commonly used methods forselecting disk galaxies. we find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,via visual classification, a single component s'ersic cut (n &lt;= 2.5), and ablue-cloud cut. in cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) for moderately inclineddisks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical barfraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appearto have no significant bulge component. within a given absolute magnitude bin,f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge asopposed to those with bulges. for a given morphological class, f_bar-opt risesat higher luminosities. (4) for bright early-types, as well as faint late-typesystems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the abell 901/2clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxiesat lower redshifts (5) between the core and the virial radius of the cluster atintermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appearto depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by afactor of ~1.3. we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution ofbars and disks in dense environments.

0910.5718	interacting galaxies in the a901/902 supercluster with stages	we present a study of galaxy mergers and the influence of environment in theabell 901/902 supercluster at z~0.165. we use hst acs f606w data from thestages survey, combo-17, spitzer 24um, and xmm-newton x-ray data. our analysisutilizes both a visual classification system, and quantitative cas parametersto identify systems which show evidence of a recent or ongoing merger of massratio &gt;1/10. our results are: (1) after visual classification and minimizingthe contamination from false projection pairs, we find that the merger fractionf_merge is 0.023+/-0.007. the estimated fractions of likely major mergers,likely minor mergers, and ambiguous cases are 0.01+/-0.004, 0.006+/-0.003, and0.007+/-0.003, respectively. (2) the mergers lie outside the cluster core ofradius r &lt; 0.25 mpc: the lack of mergers in the core is likely due to the largegalaxy velocity dispersion in the core. mergers populate the region (0.25 mpc &lt;r &lt;= 2 mpc) between the core and outskirt. in this region, the estimatedfrequency of mergers is similar to those seen at typical group overdensities.this suggests ongoing growth of the clusters via accretion of group and fieldgalaxies. (3) we compare our observed merger fraction with those reported inother clusters and groups out to z~0.4. existing data points on the mergerfraction for l&lt;= l* galaxies in clusters allow for a range of evolutionaryscenarios. (4) the fraction of mergers, which lie on the blue cloud is80%+/-18% versus 34%+/-7% for non-interacting galaxies, implying thatinteracting galaxies are preferentially blue. (5) the average sfr, based on uvor uv+ir data, is enhanced by a factor of ~1.5 to 2 in mergers compared tonon-interacting galaxies. however, mergers in the clusters contribute only asmall fraction (between 10% and 15%) of the total sfr density.(abridged)

0911.0704	relating basic properties of bright early-type dwarf galaxies to their  location in abell 901/902	we present a study of the population of bright early-type dwarf galaxies inthe multiple-cluster system abell 901/902. we use data from the stages surveyand combo-17 to investigate the relation between the color and structuralproperties of the dwarfs and their location in the cluster. the definition ofthe dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includesgalaxies in the luminosity range -16 &gt;= m_b &gt;~-19 mag. using a fit to the colormagnitude relation of the dwarfs, our sample is divided into a red and bluesubsample. we find a color-density relation in the projected radialdistribution of the dwarf sample: at the same luminosity dwarfs with reddercolors are located closer to the cluster centers than their bluer counterparts.furthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than thebluer dwarfs. these findings are consistent with theoretical expectationsassuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformedlate-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping andgalaxy harassment. this indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarfelliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processesrelated to interactions with their host cluster.

0912.3762	site testing of the sierra de javalambre. first results	we present the main characteristics of the proposed location for thejavalambre astrophysical observatory. the measurements have been obtained fromspectrophotometric, photometric and seeing data obtained with differentmonitors and instruments on the site and publicly accessible meteorologicalsatellite data.  the night-sky optical spectrum observed in a moonless night shows very littlecontamination by the typical pollution lines. their contribution to thesky-brightness is ~0.06 mag in b, ~0.09 mag in v and ~0.06 mag in r. inparticular, the comparison of the strengths of the sodium artificial andnatural lines indicates that the site satisfies the iau recommendations for adark site. the zenith-corrected values of the moonless night-sky surfacebrightness are b = 22.8 mag arcsec^-2, v = 22.1 mag arcsec^-2, r = 21.5 magarcsec^-2, i = 20.4 mag arcsec^-2, which indicates that the site is very dark.the extinction has been measured for the summer period, with a typical value of0.22 mag in the v-band, with the best measured value of 0.18 mag in a totallyphotometric night. the median value of the seeing in the v-band for the lasttwo years (2008-9) is 0.71", with a mode of 0.58". the seeing values present aseasonal pattern, being smaller in summer (~0.69") than in winter time (0.77").for 68% of the analyzed nights the seeing was better than 0.8" during theentire night. the seeing is found to be stable for rather long periods, inparticular for the nights with good seeing values. the typical scale, fornights with the seeing below 0.8", is about 5 hours for variations within 20%of the reference value. the fraction of totally clear nights is ~53%, while thefraction of nights with at least a 30% of the night clear is ~74%.

1002.1067	barred disks in dense environments	we investigate the properties of bright (mv &lt;= -18) barred and unbarred disksin the abell 901/902 cluster system at z~0.165 with the stages hst acs survey.to identify and characterize bars, we use ellipse-fitting. we use visualclassification, a sersic cut, and a color cut to select disk galaxies, and findthat the latter two methods miss 31% and 51%, respectively of disk galaxiesidentified through visual classification. this underscores the importance ofcarefully selecting the disk sample in cluster environments. however, we findthat the global optical bar fraction in the clusters is ~30% regardless of themethod of disk selection. we study the relationship of the optical bar fractionto host galaxy properties, and find that the optical bar fraction dependsstrongly on the luminosity of the galaxy and whether it hosts a prominent bulgeor is bulgeless. within a given absolute magnitude bin, the optical barfraction increases for galaxies with no significant bulge component. withineach morphological type bin, the optical bar fraction increases for brightergalaxies. we find no strong trend (variations larger than a factor of 1.3) forthe optical bar fraction with local density within the cluster between the coreand virial radius (r ~ 0.25 to 1.2 mpc). we discuss the implications of ourresults for the evolution of bars and disks in dense environments.

1007.4917	ppak wide-field integral field spectroscopy of ngc 628: i. the largest  spectroscopic mosaic on a single galaxy	we present a wide-field ifs survey on the nearby face-on sbc galaxy ngc 628,comprising 11094 individual spectra, covering a nearly circular field-of-viewof ~6 arcmin in diameter, with a sampling of ~2.7 arcsec per spectrum in theoptical wavelength range (3700--7000 aa). this galaxy is part of the ppak ifsnearby galaxies survey, (pings, rosales-ortega et al. 2009). to our knowledge,this is the widest spectroscopic survey ever made in a single nearby galaxy. adetailed flux calibration was applied, granting a spectrophotometric accuracyof $\sim$\,0.2 mag.  the age of the stellar populations shows a negative gradient from the inner(older) to the outer (younger) regions. we found an inversion of this gradientin the central ~1 kpc region, where a somewhat younger stellar population ispresent within a ring at this radius. this structure is associated with acircumnuclear star-forming region at ~ 500 pc, also found in similar spiralgalaxies. from the study of the integrated and spatially resolved ionized gaswe found a moderate sfr of ~ 2.4 msun yr$^{-1}$. the oxygen abundance shows a aclear gradient of higher metallicity values from the inner part to the outerpart of the galaxy, with a mean value of 12~+~log(o/h) ~ 8.7. at some specificregions of the galaxy, the spatially resolved distribution of the physicalproperties show some level of structure, suggesting real point-to-pointvariations within an individual \hh region. our results are consistent with aninside-out growth scheme, with stronger star formation at the outer regions,and with evolved stellar populations in the inner ones.

1208.1117	integral field spectroscopy of a sample of nearby galaxies: ii.  properties of the h ii regions	in this work we analyze the spectroscopic properties of a large number of hii regions, \sim2600, located in 38 galaxies. the sample of galaxies has beenassembled from the face-on spirals in the pings survey and a sample describedin m\'armol-queralt\'o (2011, henceforth paper i). all the galaxies wereobserved using integral field spectroscopy with a similar setup, covering theiroptical extension up to \sim2.4 effective radii within a wavelength range from\sim3700 to \sim6900{\aa}. we develop a new automatic procedure to detect h iiregions, based on the contrast of the h{\alpha} intensity maps. once detected,the procedure provides us with the integrated spectra of each individualsegmented region. a well-tested automatic decoupling procedure has been appliedto remove the underlying stellar population, deriving the main proper- ties ofthe strongest emission lines in the considered wavelength range (covering from[o ii] {\lambda}3727 to [s ii] {\lambda}6731). a final catalogue of thespectroscopic properties of these regions has been created for each galaxy. inthe current study we focused on the understanding of the average properties ofthe h ii regions and their radial distributions. we find that the gas-phaseoxygen abundance and the h{\alpha} equivalent width present negative andpositive gradient, respectively. the distribution of slopes is statisticallycompatible with a random gaussian distribution around the mean value, if theradial distances are measured in units of the respective effective radius. nodifference in the slope is found for galaxies of different morphologies:barred/non-barred, grand-design/flocculent. therefore, the effective radius isa universal scale length for gradients in the evolution of galaxies. otherproperties have a larger variance across each object.

1304.2158	the mass-metallicity relation explored with califa: i. is there a  dependence on the star formation rate?	we present the results on the study of the global and local m-z relationbased on the first data available from the califa survey (150 galaxies). thissurvey provides integral field spectroscopy of the complete optical extent ofeach galaxy (up to 2-3 effective radii), with enough resolution to separateindividual hii regions and/or aggregations. nearly $\sim$3000 individual hiiregions have been detected. the spectra cover the wavelength range between[oii]3727 and [sii]6731, with a sufficient signal-to-noise to derive the oxygenabundance and star-formation rate associated with each region. in addition, wehave computed the integrated and spatially resolved stellar masses (and surfacedensities), based on sdss photometric data. we explore the relations betweenthe stellar mass, oxygen abundance and star-formation rate using this dataset.  we derive a tight relation between the integrated stellar mass and thegas-phase abundance, with a dispersion smaller than the one already reported inthe literature ($\sigma_{\delta{\rm log(o/h)}}=$0.07 dex). indeed, thisdispersion is only slightly larger than the typical error derived for ouroxygen abundances. however, we do not find any secondary relation with thestar-formation rate, other than the one induced due to the primary relation ofthis quantity with the stellar mass. we confirm the result using the $\sim$3000individual hii regions, for the corresponding local relations.  our results agree with the scenario in which gas recycling in galaxies, bothlocally and globally, is much faster than other typical timescales, like thatof gas accretion by inflow and/or metal loss due to outflows. in essence,late-type/disk dominated galaxies seem to be in a quasi-steady situation, witha behavior similar to the one expected from an instantaneousrecycling/closed-box model.

1304.5788	resolving galaxies in time and space: i: applying starlight to califa  data cubes	fossil record methods based on spectral synthesis techniques have maturedover the past decade, and their application to integrated galaxy spectrafostered substantial advances on the understanding of galaxies and theirevolution. yet, because of the lack of spatial resolution, these studies arelimited to a global view, providing no information about the internal physicsof galaxies. motivated by the califa survey, which is gathering integral fieldspectroscopy over the full optical extent of 600 galaxies, we have developed anend-to-end pipeline which: (i) partitions the observed data cube into voronoizones in order to, when necessary and taking due account of correlated errors,increase the s/n, (ii) extracts spectra, including propagated errors andbad-pixel flags, (iii) feeds the spectra into the starlight spectral synthesiscode, (iv) packs the results for all galaxy zones into a single file, (v)performs a series of post-processing operations, including zone-to-pixel imagereconstruction and unpacking the spectral and stellar population propertiesinto multi-dimensional time, metallicity, and spatial coordinates. this paperprovides an illustrated description of this whole pipeline and its products.using data for the nearby spiral ngc 2916 as a show case, we go through each ofthe steps involved, presenting ways of visualizing and analyzing this manifold.these include 2d maps of properties such as the v-field, stellar extinction,mean ages and metallicities, mass surface densities, star formation rates ondifferent time scales and normalized in different ways, 1d averages in thetemporal and spatial dimensions, projections of the stellar light and massgrowth (x,y,t) cubes onto radius-age diagrams, etc. the results illustrate therichness of the combination of ifs data with spectral synthesis, providing aglimpse of what is to come from califa and future surveys.

1306.2338	nebular emission and the lyman continuum photon escape fraction in  califa early-type galaxies	we use deep integral field spectroscopy data from the califa survey to studythe warm interstellar medium (wim) of 32 nearby early-type galaxies (etgs). wepropose a tentative subdivision of our sample etgs into two groups, accordingto their ha equivalent width (ew) and lyman continuum (lyc) photon escapefraction (plf). type i etgs show nearly constant ews and a plf~0, suggestingthat photoionization by post-agb stars is the main driver of their faintextranuclear nebular emission. type ii etgs are characterized by very low,outwardly increasing ews, and a plf as large as ~0.9 in their centers. suchproperties point to a low, and inwardly decreasing wim density and/or volumefilling factor. we argue that, because of extensive lyc photon leakage,emission-line luminosities and ews are reduced in type ii etg nuclei by atleast one order of magnitude. consequently, the line weakness of these etgs isby itself no compelling evidence for their containing merely "weak"(sub-eddington accreting) active galactic nuclei (agn). in fact, lyc photonescape, which has heretofore not been considered, may constitute a key elementin understanding why many etgs with prominent signatures of agn activity inradio continuum and/or x-ray wavelengths show only faint emission lines andweak signatures of agn activity in their optical spectra. the lyc photonescape, in conjunction with dilution of nuclear ews by line-of-sightintegration through a triaxial stellar host, can systematically impededetection of agn in gas-poor galaxy spheroids through optical emission-linespectroscopy. we further find that type i and ii etgs differ little (~0.4 dex)in their mean bpt line ratios, which in both cases are characteristic ofliners. this potentially hints at a degeneracy of the projected,luminosity-weighted bpt ratios for the specific 3d properties of the wim inetgs.

1311.3941	the effects of spatial resolution on integral field spectrograph surveys  at different redshifts. the califa perspective	over the past decade, 3d optical spectroscopy has become the preferred toolfor understanding the properties of galaxies and is now increasingly used tocarry out galaxy surveys. low redshift surveys include sauron, diskmass,atlas3d, pings and venga. at redshifts above 0.7, surveys such as massiv, sins,glace, and images have targeted the most luminous galaxies to study mainlytheir kinematic properties. the on-going califa survey ($z\sim0.02$) is thefirst of a series of upcoming integral field spectroscopy (ifs) surveys withlarge samples representative of the entire population of galaxies. othersinclude sami and manga at lower redshift and the upcoming kmos surveys athigher redshift. given the importance of spatial scales in ifs surveys, thestudy of the effects of spatial resolution on the recovered parameters becomesimportant. we explore the capability of the califa survey and a hypotheticalhigher redshift survey to reproduce the properties of a sample of objectsobserved with better spatial resolution at lower redshift. using a sample ofpings galaxies, we simulate observations at different redshifts. we then studythe behaviour of different parameters as the spatial resolution degrades withincreasing redshift.

1311.7052	a characteristic oxygen abundance gradient in galaxy disks unveiled with  califa	we present the largest and most homogeneous catalog of hii regions andassociations compiled so far. the catalog comprises more than 7000 ionizedregions, extracted from 306 galaxies observed by the califa survey. we describethe procedures used to detect, select, and analyse the spectroscopic propertiesof these ionized regions. in the current study we focus on the characterizationof the radial gradient of the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas, based on thestudy of the deprojected distribution of hii regions. we found that allgalaxies without clear evidence of an interaction present a common gradient inthe oxygen abundance, with a characteristic slope of alpha = -0.1 dex/rebetween 0.3 and 2 disk effective radii, and a scatter compatible with randomfluctuations around this value, when the gradient is normalized to the diskeffective radius. the slope is independent of morphology, incidence of bars,absolute magnitude or mass. only those galaxies with evidence of interactionsand/or clear merging systems present a significant shallower gradient,consistent with previous results. the majority of the 94 galaxies with h iiregions detected beyond 2 disk effective radii present a flattening in theoxygen abundance. the flattening is statistically significant. we cannotprovide with a conclusive answer regarding the origin of this flattening.however, our results indicate that its origin is most probably related to thesecular evolution of galaxies. finally, we find a drop/truncation of the oxygenabundance in the inner regions for 26 of the galaxies. all of them arenon-interacting, mostly unbarred, sb/sbc galaxies. this feature is associatedwith a central star-forming ring, which suggests that both features areproduced by radial gas flows induced by resonance processes.

1405.0880	a study of the ionized gas in stephan's quintet from integral field  spectroscopy observations	the stephan's quintet (sq) is a famous interacting compact group of galaxiesin an important stage of dynamical evolution, but surprisingly very fewspectroscopic studies are found in the literature. we present optical integralfield spectroscopy (ifs) observations of the sq from the ppak ifs nearbygalaxies survey (pings), that provide a powerful way of studying with spatialresolution the physical characteristics of the ionized gas within the group.the nature of the gas emission is analysed using 2d maps ofcontinuum-subtracted, pure emission-line intensities, stacked spectra,diagnostic diagrams, and photoionization model predictions. in the case of ngc7319, we study the galaxy-wide high-velocity outflow emission by comparing theemission properties with theoretical shock and agn models. we conclude that theexcitation mechanism of the gas in this galaxy is a mixture of agnphotoionization and shocks with a photoionizing precursor. the emission spectrafrom the large scale shock front in the interacting pair ngc 7318a/b isanalysed, confirming the presence of several kinematic components. comparisonwith predictions from theoretical shock models suggests that the gas emissionis consistent with shocks without a photoionizing precursor, low pre-shockdensity, and velocities in the range of 200 - 400 km s-1. the gas oxygenabundance for ngc 7318b is determined using an updated o3n2 calibration.although ngc 7317 shows no significant gas emission, an ionizing cluster isfound southwest of this galaxy, probably the result of tidal interaction. as aby-product, we analyse the gas emission of the foreground galaxy ngc 7320.

1407.0002	stellar population gradients in galaxy discs from the califa survey	while studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common,very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients inthe same regions. we present here a comparative study of the stellarmetallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiralgalaxies with and without bars, using data from the califa survey. we measurethe slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties ofthe galaxies. we find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients inthe disc are shallow and negative. furthermore, when normalized to theeffective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradientsdoes not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of thegalaxies. contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\sim$2.5scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similarmanner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average,older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. one of the goals of thepresent paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear couplingbetween the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producingradial migrations across significant distances within discs. the process ofradial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and,therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barredgalaxies. however, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or agegradients in galaxies with without bars. we discuss possible scenarios that canlead to this absence of difference.

1409.7388	the star formation history of galaxies in 3d: califa perspective	we resolve spatially the star formation history of 300 nearby galaxies fromthe califa integral field survey to investigate: a) the radial structure andgradients of the present stellar populations properties as a function of thehubble type; and b) the role that plays the galaxy stellar mass and stellarmass surface density in governing the star formation history and metallicityenrichment of spheroids and the disks of galaxies. we apply the fossil recordmethod based on spectral synthesis techniques to recover spatially andtemporally resolved maps of stellar population properties of spheroids andspirals with galaxy mass from 10$^9$ to 7$\times$10$^{11}$ m$_{\odot}$. theindividual radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density ($\mu_{*}$),stellar extinction (a$_{v}$), luminosity weighted ages ($\langle$ log age$\rangle_{l}$), and mass weighted metallicity ($\langle$ logz/z$_{\odot}$$\rangle_{m}$) are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology (e,s0, sa, sb, sbc, sc and sd). all these properties show negative gradients as asight of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies. however, the gradientsdepend on the hubble type in different ways. for the same galaxy mass, e and s0galaxies show the largest inner gradients in $\mu_{*}$; and andromeda-likegalaxies (sb with log m$_{*}$(m$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 11) show the largest innerage and metallicity gradients. in average, spiral galaxies have a stellarmetallicity gradient $\sim$ -0.1 dex per half-light radius, in agreement withthe value estimated for the ionized gas oxygen abundance gradient by califa. aglobal (m$_{*}$-driven) and local ($\mu_{*}$- driven) stellar metallicityrelation are derived. we find that in disks, the stellar mass surface densityregulates the stellar metallicity; in spheroids, the galaxy stellar massdominates the physics of star formation and chemical enrichment.

"transversal"(angular distance) bao measure the angular size of this scale, while"line-of-sight" (or "radial") bao require precise redshifts, but provide adirect measurement of the hubble parameter at different redshifts, a moresensitive probe of dark energy. the main goal of this paper is to show that aprecision of sigma_z ~0.003(1 + z) is sufficient to measure bao in the radialdirection. this precision can be achieved for bright, red galaxies, by using afilter system comprising about 40 filters, each with a width of ~100 a, from ~4000 a to ~ 8000 a, supplemented by two broad-band filters. we describe apractical implementation, a new galaxy survey, pau, to be carried out with atelescope/camera combination with an etendue of about 20 m^2deg^2, and covering8000 sq. deg. in the sky in four years. we expect to measure positions andredshifts for over 14 million red, early-type galaxies with l &gt; l* and i_ab &lt;22.5 in the interval 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, with sigma_z &lt; 0.003(1 + z). thispopulation has a number density n &gt; 10^-3 mpc^-3 h^3 within the 9 (gpc/h)^3volume of the survey, ensuring that the error in the determination of the baoscale is not limited by shot-noise. by itself, such a survey will deliverprecisions of order 5% in the dark-energy equation of state parameter w, ifassumed constant, and can determine its time derivative when combined withfuture cmb measurements. in addition, pau will yield high-quality redshift andlow-resolution spectroscopy for hundreds of millions of other galaxies.

astro-ph;0307147	integral-field spectroscopy of the quadruple qso he 0435-1223: evidence  for microlensing	we present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of therecently discovered quadruple qso and gravitational lens he0435-1223. using thepotsdam multi-aperture spectrophotometer (pmas), we show that all four qsocomponents have very similar but not identical spectra. in particular, thespectral slopes of components a, b, and d are indistinguishable, implying thatextinction due to dust plays no major role in the lensing galaxy. while alsothe emission line profiles are identical within the error bars, as expectedfrom lensing, the equivalent widths show significant differences betweencomponents. most likely, microlensing is responsible for this phenomenon. thisis also consistent with the fact that component d, which shows the highestrelative continuum level, has brightened by 0.07 mag since dec 2001. we findthat the emission line flux ratios between the components are in betteragreement with simple lens models than broad band or continuum measurements,but that the discrepancies between model and data are still unacceptably large.finally, we present a detection of the lensing galaxy, although this is closeto the limits of the data. comparing with a model galaxy spectrum, we obtain aredshift estimate of z_lens=0.44+-0.02.

astro-ph;0408267	evolution and impact of bars over the last eight billion years: early  results from gems	bars drive the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies by redistributing massand angular momentum, and they are ubiquitous in present-day spirals. earlystudies of the hubble deep field reported a dramatic decline in the rest-frameoptical bar fraction f_opt to below 5% at redshifts z&gt;0.7, implying that disksat these epochs are fundamentally different from present-day spirals. the gemsbar project, based on ~8300 galaxies with hst-based morphologies and accurateredshifts over the range 0.2-1.1, aims at constraining the evolution and impactof bars over the last 8 gyr. we present early results indicating that f_optremains nearly constant at ~30% over the range z=0.2-1.1,corresponding tolookback times of ~2.5-8 gyr. the bars detected at z&gt;0.6 are primarily strongwith ellipticities of 0.4-0.8. remarkably, the bar fraction and range of barsizes observed at z&gt;0.6 appear to be comparable to the values measured in thelocal universe for bars of corresponding strengths. implications for barevolution models are discussed.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0603835	extended lyman alpha emission around bright quasars	quasars trace the most massive structures at high redshifts and theirpresence may influence the evolution of the massive host galaxies. we study theextended lyman alpha emission line regions (eelrs) around seven bright, mostlyradio-quiet quasars (qsos) at 2.7&lt;z&lt;4.5, and compare luminosities with eelrsaround radio-loud qsos reported in the literature. using integral fieldspectroscopy, we analyse the morphology and kinematics of the quiescent lyaeelrs around the qsos. we find evidence for the presence of eelrs around fourradio-quiet and one radio-loud qso. all eelrs appear asymmetric and theoptically brightest qsos also have the brightest lya nebulae. for the twobrightest nebulae we find velocities between ~600 km s^-1 at the qso positionto ~200 km s^-1 at a distance of 3-4 arcsec from the qso and surface fluxdensities up to 2-3*10^{-16} erg cm^-2 s^-1 arcsec^-2. the five eelrs havetotal lya luminosities which correspond to ~0.5% of the luminosities from theqsos broad lya emission lines. this fraction is an order of magnitude smallerthan found for eelrs around radio-loud, steep spectrum qsos reported in theliterature. while the nebulae luminosities are correlated with the qso lyaluminosities, we find that nebulae luminosities are not correlated with thecentral qso ionising fluxes. the presence of gas in the eelrs can beinterpreted based on two competing scenarios: either from quasar feedbackmechanisms, or from infalling matter. apart from these two effects, the lyaflux around radio-loud objects can be enhanced due to interactions with theradio jets. the relatively fainter nebulae around radio-quiet qsos compared tolobe-dominated radio-loud qsos can be ascribed to this effect, or tosignificant differences in the environments between the two classes.

astro-ph;9710301	red quasars not so dusty	webster et al (1995) claimed that up to 80% of qsos may be obscured by dust.they inferred the presence of this dust from the remarkably broad range of b-koptical-infrared colours of a sample of flat-spectrum pks radio qsos. if suchdust is typical of qsos, it will have rendered invisible most of those whichwould otherwise been have detected by optical surveys. we used the williamherschel telescope on la palma to obtain k infrared images of 54 b3 radioquasars selected at low frequency (mainly steep-spectrum), and we find thatalthough several have very red optical-infrared colours, most of these can beattributed to an excess of light in k rather than a dust-induced deficit in b.we present evidence that some of the infrared excess comes from the light ofstars in the host galaxy (some, as previously suggested, comes from synchrotronradiation associated with flat-spectrum radio sources). the b-k colours of theb3 qsos provide no evidence for a large reddened population. either the websteret al qsos are atypical in having such large extinctions, or their reddening isnot due to dust; either way, the broad range of their b-k colours does notprovide evidence that a large fraction of qsos has been missed from opticalsurveys.

astro-ph;9712220	k-band imaging of 52 b3-vla quasars: nucleus and host properties	we present k-band imaging and photometry of a sample of 52 radio loud quasars(rqs) selected from the b3 survey with flux densities above 0.5 jy at 408 mhz.the optical completeness of the sample is 90% and the quasars cover theredshift range 0.4 - 2.3. for ~57% of the sources for which the quality of theimages allowed a detailed morphological study (16/28) resolved extendedemission was detected around the qso, and its k flux was measured. interpretingthis ``fuzz'' as starlight emission from the host galaxy, its location on thek-z plane at z&lt;1 is consistent with radio quasars being hosted by galaxiessimilar to radio galaxies (rgs) or giant ellipticals (ges). at higher redshiftsthe detected host galaxies of rqs are more luminous than typical rgs and ges,although some weak detections or upper limits are consistent with a similarfraction of rqs being hosted by galaxies with the expected luminosities for rgsor ges. we found a significant correlation between radio power and nuclearinfrared luminosity indicating a direct link between the radio synchrotronemission and the nuclear emission in k. this correlation is more tight for thesteep-spectrum sources (99.97% significance). in addition, a trend is foundbetween radio power and infrared luminosity of the host galaxy (or mass), inthe sense that the most powerful quasars inhabit the most luminous galaxies.

0809.3969	integral field spectroscopy of hh 262: the spectral atlas	hh 262 is a group of emitting knots displaying an "hour-glass" morphology inthe halpha and [sii] lines, located 3.5' to the northeast of the young stellarobject l1551-irs5, in taurus. we present new results of the kinematics andphysical conditions of hh 262 based on integral field spectroscopy covering afield of 1.5'x3', which includes all the bright knots in hh 262. these datashow complex kinematics and significant variations in physical conditions overthe mapped region of hh 262 on a spatial scale of &lt;3". a new result derivedfrom the ifs data is the weakness of the [nii] emission (below detection limitin most of the mapped region of hh 262), including the brightest central knots.our data reinforce the association of hh 262 with the redshifted lobe of theevolved molecular outflow l1551-irs5. the interaction of this outflow with ayounger one, powered by l1551 ne, around the position of hh 262 could give riseto the complex morphology and kinematics of hh 262.

0809.4988	the night-sky at the calar alto observatory ii: the sky at the near  infrared	we present here the characterization of the night sky-brightness at thenear-infrared, the telescope seeing, and the fraction of useful time at thecalar alto observatory. for this study we have collected a large datasetcomprising 7311 near-infrared images taken regularly along the last four yearsfor the alhambra survey (j, h and ks-bands), together with a more reduceddataset of additional near-infrared images taken for the current study. inaddition we collected the information derived by the meteorological station atthe observatory during the last 10 years, together with the results from thecloud sensor for the last ~2 years. we analyze the dependency of thenear-infrared night sky-brightness with the airmass and the seasons, studyingits origins and proposing a zenithal correction. a strong correlation is foundbetween the night sky-brightness in the ks-band and the air temperature, with agradient of ~ -0.08 mag per 1 c degree. the typical (darkest) nightsky-brightness in the j, h and ks-band are 15.95 mag (16.95 mag), 13.99 mag(14.98 mag) and 12.39 mag (13.55 mag), respectively. these values show thatcalar alto is as dark in the near-infrared as most of the other astronomicalastronomical sites in the world that we could compare with. only mauna kea isclearly darker in the ks-band. the typical telescope seeing at the 3.5m is~1.0" when converted to the v-band, being only slightly larger than theatmospheric seeing measured at the same time by the seeing monitor, ~0.9".finally we estimate the fraction of useful time based on the relative humidity,gust wind speed and presence of clouds. this fraction, ~72%, is very similar tothe one derived in paper i, based on the fraction of time when the extinctionmonitor is working.

0811.3914	integral field spectroscopy of two radio galaxies at z~2.3	in this article we study the morphology, kinematics and ionization propertiesof the giant ionized gas nebulae surrounding two high redshift radio galaxies,4c40.36 (z=2.27) and 4c48.48 (z=2.34).}{integral field spectroscopyobservations were taken using the ppak bundle of the pmas spectrograph, mountedon the 3.5m on the calar alto observatory, in order to cover a field-of-view of64" x 72" centered in each radio galaxy. the observations spanned over 5nights, using two different spectral resolutions (with fwhm~4 aa and ~8 aarespectively), covering the optical wavelength range from ~3700 aa to ~7100 aa,which corresponds to the rest-frame ultraviolet range from ~1100 aa to ~2000 aa&gt;. various emission lines are detected within this wavelength range, includinglyalpha (1216 aa), nv (1240 aa), civ (1549 aa), heii (1640 aa), oiii] (1663 aa)and ciii] (1909\aa). the dataset was used to derive the spatial distribution ofthe flux intensity of each of these lines and the gas kinematics. theproperties of the emission lines in the nuclear regions were studied indetail.in agreement with previous studies, we find that both objects areembedded in a large ionized gas nebula, where ly alpha emission is extendedacross ~100 kpc or more. the civ and heii emission lines are also spatiallyextended. the nebulae are generally aligned with the radio axis, although wedetect emission far from it. in 4c+48.48, there is a band of low ly-alpha/civrunning perpendicular to the radio axis, at the location of the active nucleus.this feature might be the observational signature of an edge-on disk of neutralgas. the kinematics of both nebulae are inconsistent with stable rotation,although they are not inconsistent with infall or outflow.

0812.3568	optimal filter systems for photometric redshift estimation	in the next years, several cosmological surveys will rely on imaging data toestimate the redshift of galaxies, using traditional filter systems with 4-5optical broad bands; narrower filters improve the spectral resolution, butstrongly reduce the total system throughput. we explore how photometricredshift performance depends on the number of filters n_f, characterizing thesurvey depth through the fraction of galaxies with unambiguous redshiftestimates. for a combination of total exposure time and telescope imaging areaof 270 hrs m^2, 4-5 filter systems perform significantly worse, both incompleteness depth and precision, than systems with n_f &gt;= 8 filters. ourresults suggest that for low n_f, the color-redshift degeneracies overwhelm theimprovements in photometric depth, and that even at higher n_f, the effectivephotometric redshift depth decreases much more slowly with filter width thannaively expected from the reduction in s/n. adding near-ir observationsimproves the performance of low n_f systems, but still the system whichmaximizes the photometric redshift completeness is formed by 9 filters withlogarithmically increasing bandwidth (constant resolution) and half-bandoverlap, reaching ~0.7 mag deeper, with 10% better redshift precision, than 4-5filter systems. a system with 20 constant-width, non-overlapping filtersreaches only ~0.1 mag shallower than 4-5 filter systems, but has a precisionalmost 3 times better, dz = 0.014(1+z) vs. dz = 0.042(1+z). we briefly discussa practical implementation of such a photometric system: the alhambra survey.
