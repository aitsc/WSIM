1442335930	Applying resonant parametric perturbation to control chaos in the buck dc/dc converter with phase shift and frequency mismatch considerations	The buck converter has been known to exhibit chaotic behavior in a wide parameter range. In this paper, the resonant parametric perturbation method is applied to control chaos in a voltage-mode controlled buck converter. In particular, the effects of phase shift and frequency mismatch in the perturbing signal are studied. It is shown that the control power can be significantly reduced if the perturbation is applied with an appropriate phase shift. Moreover, when frequency mismatch is inevitable, intermittent chaos occurs, but effective control can still be accomplished at the expense of raising the control power. Analysis, simulations and experimental measurements are presented to provide theoretical and practical evidences for the proposed control method.

In practical design, by employing a controller that can convert one input control to four output controls for the MOSFETs in bridge, the sliding-mode control is successfully applied to the PS FB ZVS converter.

73149084659	Cooperative communication based on IDMA	Cooperative communication schemes can provide diversity gain. However, when the network model is compose of multiple source-destination pairs with multiple common relays, interference problems arise. In this paper, we propose a cooperative transmission scheme based on Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) with decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols so that destinations can cancel the interference and achieve diversity gain. The simulations show diversity gains of at least 8dB when cooperative communication has been implemented with IDMA over DF and AF protocols. We also provide an insight to how power allocation between sources and relays would affect the performance. It reveals that relay nodes can be adaptive to select DF or AF protocol based on the constraints of power allocation and the locations of relays. ©2009 IEEE.

72449160314	Fundamental frequency transformation and unpredictability estimation algorithm of chaotic systems	In this paper, first, a method of fundamental frequency transformation for chaotic systems is proposed based on the concept of frequency domain analysis in the periodic orbit theory of chaotic attractors and on the matrix principle. Then, by using this method, Lorenz and Chua circuits are realized with different fundamental frequencies, and the corresponding frequency spectra are tested. Moreover, some experiments are carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed method, and an unpredictability estimation algorithm of chaotic systems is discussed. Finally, an improved formula for calculating the regression frequency is deduced. The proposed formula is also used to compare the unpredictability between Lorenz and Chua circuits with the same fundamental frequency of 3kHz. The results indicate that the presented formula greatly improves the unpredictability estimation accuracy of different chaotic systems.

77949560067	Cascaded image encryption systems based on physical chaos	A cascaded encryption scheme using physical chaos is realized primarily, which combines chaotic encryption with data encryption standard. The difference of statistical properties of cipher text is studied for two cases. One case is that the ciphertexts come from different schemes, i.e. the cascaded and the single-stage ones, respectively. The other is that the ciphertexts are generated by chaotic signals with different unpredictability in the same scheme. Because physical chaos is adopted in this system, there is no assured relationship between plaintexts and ciphertexts, and the statistical characteristics of ciphertexts should be better than (or about equal to) that of any other encryption system. The experimental results support this conclusion, and show that the stronger unpredictability of chaotic signals causes the weaker correlation of ciphertexts. © 2010 Chin. Phys. Soc.

77949886926	A way to complexity analysis of chaotic pseudorandom sequence	In order to measure the random essential of chaotic pseudorandom sequences, a method based on the intensive statistical complexity is proposed and is used to analyze the complexity of a chaotic pseudorandom sequence. Then, based on the chaotic sequence and the octal chaotic pseudorandom sequence produced by both the Logistic map and the coupled map lattice, an example is persented to demonstrate how the method works. Moreover, an improvement of permutation patterns is performed to make the method applicable to binary chaotic pseudorandom sequences. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method well presents the related structure and reflects the random essential of the sequence, and that it is suitable for the complexity measurement of different chaotic pseudorandom sequences produced by the chaotic system with simple computation.

77949904734	Design and analysis of asymmetric IDMA interleaver	In an interleave division multiple access (IDMA) system, different interleavers are used for different users, and all the users employ a common spreading sequence to spread the spectrum. Hence, interleaver plays a key role in the IDMA secure communication. As there are no interleaver designs for IDMA secure communications, this paper proposes a design scheme of an asymmetric IDMA interleaver based on the discrete Arnold map, which implements the secure communication via the method similar to the asymmetric encryption scheme. Simulated results show that the proposed interleaver is of the performance as good as that of the pseudo random interleaver, and that it is effective in performing secure communications.

77955152268	Relay-assisted partial packet recovery with IDMA method in CDMA wireless network	Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) is an effective technique for reliable transmission of packets in wireless networks. In ARQ, however, only a few erroneous bits in a packet will cause the entire packet to be discarded at the receiver. In this case, it's wasteful to retransmit the correct bit in the received packet. The partial packet recovery only retransmits the unreliable decoded bits in order to increase the throughput of network. In addition, the cooperative transmission based on Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) can obtain diversity gains with multiple relays with different locations for multiple sources simultaneously. By exploring the diversity from the channel between relay and destination, we propose a relay-assisted partial packet recovery in CDMA wireless network to improve the performance of throughput. In the proposed scheme, asynchronous IDMA iterative chip-by-chip multiuser detection is utilized as a method of multiple partial recovery, which can be a complementarity in a current CDMA network. The confidence values' concept is applied to detect unreliable decoded bits. According to the result of unreliable decoded bits' position, we use a recursive algorithm based on cost evaluation to decide a feedback strategy. Then the feedback request with minimum cost can be obtained. The simulation results show that the performance of throughput can be significantly improved with our scheme, compared with traditional ARQ scheme. The upper bound with our scheme is provided in our simulation. Moreover, we show how relays' location affects the performance. Copyright © 2010 ACM.

82255164404	Study of simulation approaches for fractional-order chaotic systems	To solve problems of theory analysis for fractional-order chaotic systems at present, three simulation approaches, including dynamical simulation, circuit simulation and numerical simulation, were investigated based on the analysis methods of fractional-order chaotic systems in frequency-domain and time-domain respectively. The fractional-order integral operator dynamical simulation model and circuit simulation model were designed according to the fractional-order integral operator representation in frequency domain. The process of variable evolvement with time can be observed on time by dynamical simulation and circuit simulation. The numerical simulation was achieved by employing the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector scheme for fractional-order differential operator. The dynamic performances of fractional-order chaotic system can be analyzed by using simulation output data. The simulation results of fractional-order diffusionless Lorenz system show that all the three simulation approaches are effective.

84865964940	Spatiotemporal chaotic pseudorandom number generator based on coupled sawtooth map	Based on the diffusion and spatiotemporal chaos produced by coupled sawtooth map, a spatiotemporal chaotic pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that determined by cryptography is proposed in this paper. A two-way coupled map lattice consisting of sawtooth maps is made to serve as the spatiotemporal chaotic system. Each lattice could produce an independent pseudorandom number simultaneously. The statistic characteristics of the pseudorandom number were investigated numerically during situations of weakly coupled such as stationary probability density function and random-like behavior with parameter β in different values. Furthermore, the cryptographic properties of the pseudorandom sequence such as period, balance, correlation were analyzed in details. The test of security using NIST test suite were analyzed as well. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the pseudorandom sequence of the spatiotemporal chaotic system possesses very good cryptographic properties. A simple stream cipher based on the proposed PRNG is constructed and its security is discussed. The proposed PRNG based on two-way coupled sawtooth map has been verified to be a good candidate for constructing a more secure and efficient stream cipher.

0036823884	New approach to chaotic modulation and linear demodulation	A new approach of chaotic modulation and linear demodulation for secure communication was proposed. The transmitter and receiver have the same chaotic circuit. An information signal was introduced into the linear subcircuit of the chaotic circuit in the transmitter to modulate the chaotic circuit. One of the chaotic signals modulated is transmitted to the chaotic circuit of the receiver. A certain current or voltage variable in the chaotic circuit of the receiver is detected and demodulated by a linear filter and the information signal can be recovered. The chaotic communication system based on the new modulating and demodulating approach is highly secure and simple in circuit. The simulation results of two secure communication systems designed by this approach are quite satisfactory.

84872841681	IDMA-based cooperative partial packet recovery: Principles and applications	In this article, we focus on the cooperative multi-user network model and propose a relay-assisted partial packet recovery scheme in which asynchronous interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) with iterative chip-by-chip multiuser detection (MUD) is used for the recovery of partial packets from multiple sources. In packet transmission, only a few erroneous bits may cause the entire packet to be discarded and partial packet recovery can reduce waste in resource by retransmitting only the bits that are unreliable, As the retransmitted partial packets for different sources can be of different lengths, IDMA is particularly suitable because of the simplicity of chip-by-chip MUD and because there is no need for strict synchronization. Our detailed scheme, which includes a feedback request strategy for indicating the unreliable bits, is presented and its performance is investigated. The simulation results show that the network throughput can be significantly improved by the proposed scheme, compared to traditional CDMA-based automatic repeat request (ARQ). Moreover, under the context of cognitive radio networks, we propose a hybrid strategy in which interleave division multiplexing (IDM) is used during whole-packet retransmission, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with and without the hybrid strategy as well as give insights about the throughput performance under different parameter settings. © 2012 Luo et al.

84877658879	Test and comparison analysis on properties of random sequences generated by unpredictable physical chaos	Two methods of generating random sequences by several typical physical chaotic systems, including Chua's circuit, Lorenz system and Chen's system, were given. And the randomness properties of the random sequences generated by the chaos systems were analyzed by using NIST's STS randomness test suite. Six tests, which are the monobit test, the runs test, the discrete Fourier transform test, the approximate entropy test, and the cumulative sums test, were conducted to compare the pseudorandom properties of these chaotic sequences. The experiment results show that the randomness properties of the sequences generated by physical chaos are better than those by simulation chaos, and NIST's STS randomness test suite can distinguish the randomness of different sequences. Among three typical physical chaotic circuits, we recommend the circuit of Chen's system to generate random sequences.
