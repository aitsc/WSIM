0902.0386	type-ia supernova-driven galactic bulge wind	stellar feedback in galactic bulges plays an essential role in shaping theevolution of galaxies. to quantify this role and facilitate comparisons withx-ray observations, we conduct 3d hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptivemesh refinement code, flash, to investigate the physical properties of hot gasinside a galactic bulge, similar to that of our galaxy or m31. we assume thatthe dynamical and thermal properties of the hot gas are dominated by mechanicalenergy input from sne, primarily type ia, and mass injection from evolved starsas well as iron enrichment from sne. we study the bulge-wide outflow as well asthe sn heating on scales down to ~4 pc. an embedding scheme that is devised toplant individual snr seeds, allows to examine, for the first time, the effectof sporadic sne on the density, temperature, and iron ejecta distribution ofthe hot gas as well as the resultant x-ray morphology and spectrum. we findthat the sne produce a bulge wind with highly filamentary density structuresand patchy ejecta. compared with a 1d spherical wind model, the non-uniformityof simulated gas density, temperature, and metallicity substantially alters thespectral shape and increases the diffuse x-ray luminosity. the differentialemission measure as a function of temperature of the simulated gas exhibits alog-normal distribution, with a peak value much lower than that of thecorresponding 1d model. the bulk of the x-ray emission comes from therelatively low temperature and low abundance gas shells associated with snblastwaves. sn ejecta are not well mixed with the ambient medium, at least inthe bulge region. these results, at least partly, account for the apparent lackof evidence for iron enrichment in the soft x-ray-emitting gas in galacticbulges and intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies.[...]

0902.3847	m31* and its circumnuclear environment	we present a multiwavelength investigation of the circumnuclear environmentof m31. based on chandra/acis data, we tightly constrain the x-ray luminosityof m31*, the central supermassive black hole of the galaxy, to be l (0.3-7kev)&lt;= 1.2x10^{36}erg/s, approximately 10^{-10} of the eddington luminosity.  from the diffuse x-ray emission, we characterize the circumnuclear hot gaswith a temperature of ~0.3 kev and a density of ~0.1 cm^{-3}. in the absence ofan active smbh and recent star formation, the most likely heating source forthe hot gas is type ia sne. the presence of cooler, dusty gas residing in anuclear spiral has long been known in terms of optical line emission andextinction. we further reveal the infrared emission of the nuclear spiral andevaluate the relative importance of various possible ionizing sources. we showevidence for interaction between the nuclear spiral and the hot gas, probablyvia thermal evaporation. this mechanism lends natural understandings to 1) theinactivity of m31*, in spite of a probably continuous supply of gas from outerdisk regions, and 2) the launch of a bulge outflow of hot gas, primarilymass-loaded from the circumnuclear regions. one particular prediction of such ascenario is the presence of gas with intermediate temperatures arising from theconductive interfaces. the fuse observations do show strong ovi$\lambda$1032and 1038 absorption lines against the bulge starlight, but the effective ovicolumn density (~4x10^{14} cm^{-2}), may be attributed to foreground gaslocated in the bulge and/or the highly inclined disk of m31. our study stronglyargues that stellar feedback, particularly in the form of energy release fromsne ia, may play an important role in regulating the evolution of smbhs and theinterstellar medium in galactic bulges.

0905.1482	global hot gas in and around the galaxy	the hot interstellar medium traces the stellar feedback and its role inregulating the eco-system of the galaxy. i review recent progress inunderstanding the medium, based largely on x-ray absorption line spectroscopy,complemented by x-ray emission and far-uv ovi absorption measurements. theseobservations enable us for the first time to characterize the global spatial,thermal, chemical, and kinematic properties of the medium. the results aregenerally consistent with what have been inferred from x-ray imaging of nearbygalaxies similar to the galaxy. it is clear that diffuse soft x-rayemitting/absorbing gas with a characteristic temperature of $\sim 10^6$ kresides primarily in and around the galactic disk and bulge. in the solarneighborhood, for example, this gas has a characteristic vertical scale heightof $\sim 1$ kpc. this conclusion does not exclude the presence of alarger-scale, probably much hotter, and lower density circum-galactic hotmedium, which is required to explain observations of various high-velocityclouds. this hot medium may be a natural product of the stellar feedback in thecontext of the galaxy formation and evolution.

0908.2495	dynamic s0 galaxies: a case study of ngc 5866	s0 galaxies are often thought to be passively evolved from spirals after starformation is quenched. to explore what is occurring in s0s, we present amulti-wavelength study of ngc5866--an isolated nearby edge-on s0. this studyshows strong evidence for dynamic activities in the interstellar medium, whichare most likely driven by supernova explosions in the galactic disk and bulge.we utilize chandra, hst, and spitzer data as well as ground-based observationsto characterize the content, structure, and physical state of the medium andits interplay with stars in ngc5866. a cold gas disk is detected with anexponential scale height of 100pc. numerous off-disk dusty spurs are clearlypresent: prominent ones can extend as far as 300pc from the galactic plane andare probably produced by individual sne, whereas faint filaments can have ~ kpcscale and are likely produced by sne collectively in disk/bulge. we also detectsubstantial amounts of diffuse ha- and pa-emitting gas with a comparable scaleheight as the cold gas. we find that the heating of the dust and warm ionizedgas cannot be explained by the radiation from evolved stars alone, stronglyindicating the presence of young stars in the disk at a low formation rate of ~0.05msun/yr. we reveal the presence of diffuse x-ray-emitting hot gas, whichextends as far as 3.5kpc from the disk and can be heated easily by type ia snein the bulge. however, the temperature of this gas is ~ 0.2kev, substantiallylower than what might be expected from the mass-loss of evolved stars and typeia sne heating alone, indicating mass loading from cool gas is important. thetotal masses of the cold, warm and hot gases are ~ 5*10^8, 10^4 and 3*10^7msun.the relative richness of the gases, undergoing circulations between disk/halo,is perhaps a result of its relative isolation.

1002.3379	discovery of a luminous blue variable with an ejection nebula near the  quintuplet cluster	we report on the discovery of a luminous blue variable (lbv) lying ~7 pc inprojection from the quintuplet cluster. this source, which we call lbvg0.120-0.048, was selected for spectroscopy owing to its detection as a strongsource of paschen-alpha excess in a recent narrowband imaging survey of thegalactic center region with hst/nicmos. the k-band spectrum is similar to thatof the pistol star and other known lbvs. the new lbv was previously catalogedas a photometric variable star, exhibiting brightness fluctuations of up to ~1mag between 1994 and 1997, with significant variability also occurring onmonth-to-month time scales. the luminosity of lbv g0.120-0.048, as derived from2mass photometry, is approximately equivalent to that of the pistol star.however, the time-averaged brightness of lbv g0.120-0.048 between 1994 and 1997exceeded that of the pistol star; lbv g0.120-0.048 also suffers moreextinction, which suggests that it was intrinsically more luminous in theinfrared than the pistol star between 1994 and 1997. paschen-alpha imagesreveal a thin circular nebula centered on lbv g0.120-0.048 with a physicalradius of ~0.8 pc. we suggest that this nebula is a shell of ejected materiallaunched from a discrete eruption that occurred between 5000 and 10,000 yearsago. because of the very short amount of time that evolved massive stars spendin the lbv phase, and the close proximity of lbv g0.120-0.048 to the quintupletcluster, we suggest that this object might be coeval with the cluster and mayhave once resided within it.

1003.1282	x-raying galaxies: a chandra legacy	this presentation reviews chandra's major contribution to the understandingof nearby galaxies. after a brief summary on significant advances incharacterizing various types of discrete x-ray sources, the presentationfocuses on the global hot gas in and around galaxies, especially normal oneslike our own. the hot gas is a product of stellar and agn feedback -- the leastunderstood part in theories of galaxy formation and evolution. chandraobservations have led to the first characterization of the spatial, thermal,chemical, and kinetic properties of the gas in our galaxy. the gas isconcentrated around the galactic bulge and disk on scales of a few kpc. thecolumn density of chemically-enriched hot gas on larger scales is at least anorder magnitude smaller, indicating that it may not account for the bulk of themissing baryon matter predicted for the galactic halo according to the standardcosmology. similar results have also been obtained for other nearby galaxies.the x-ray emission from hot gas is well correlated with the star formation rateand stellar mass, indicating that the heating is primarily due to the stellarfeedback. however, the observed x-ray luminosity of the gas is typically lessthan a few percent of the feedback energy. thus the bulk of the feedback(including injected heavy elements) is likely lost in galaxy-wide outflows. theresults are compared with simulations of the feedback to infer its dynamics andinterplay with the circum-galactic medium, hence the evolution of galaxies.

1006.4976	missing iron problem and type ia supernova enrichment of hot gas in  galactic spheroids	type ia supernovae (ia sne) provide a rich source of iron for hot gas ingalactic stellar spheroids. however, the expected super-solar iron abundance ofthe hot gas is not observed. instead, x-ray observations often show decreasingiron abundance toward galactic central regions, where the ia sn enrichment isexpected to be the highest. we examine the cause of this missing iron problemby studying the enrichment process and its effect on x-ray abundancemeasurements of the hot gas. the evolution of ia sn iron ejecta is simulated inthe context of galaxy-wide hot gas outflows, in both supersonic and subsoniccases, as may be expected for hot gas in galactic bulges or elliptical galaxiesof intermediate masses. sn reverse-shock heated iron ejecta is typically foundto have a very high temperature and low density, hence producing little x-rayemission. such hot ejecta, driven by its large buoyancy, can quickly reach asubstantially higher outward velocity than the ambient medium, which isdominated by mass loss from evolved stars. the ejecta is gradually anddynamically mixed with the medium at large galactic radii. the ejecta is alsoslowly diluted and cooled by {\sl insitu} mass injection from evolved stars.these processes together naturally result in the observed positive gradient inthe average radial iron abundance distribution of the hot gas, even ifmass-weighted. this trend is in addition to the x-ray measurement bias thattends to underestimate the iron abundance for the hot gas with a temperaturedistribution.

1007.3637	variable o vi and n v emission from the x-ray binary lmc x-3: heating of  the black hole companion	based on high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with fuse and cos,we present new detections of o vi and n v emission from the black-hole x-raybinary (xrb) system lmc x-3. we also update the ephemeris of the xrb usingrecent radial velocity measurements obtained with the echelle spectrograph onthe magellan-clay telescope. we observe significant velocity variability of theuv emission, and we find that the o vi and n v emission velocities follow theoptical velocity curve of the xrb. moreover, the o vi and n v intensitiesregularly decrease between binary phase = 0.5 and 1.0, which suggests that thesource of the uv emission is increasingly occulted as the b star in the xrbmoves from superior to inferior conjunction. these trends suggest thatillumination of the b-star atmosphere by the intense x-ray emission from theaccreting black hole creates a hot spot on one side of the b star, and this hotspot is the origin of the o vi and n v emission. however, the velocitysemiamplitude of the ultraviolet emission, k_{uv}~180 km/s, is lower than theoptical semiamplitude; this difference could be due to rotation of the b star.if our hypothesis about the origin of the highly ionized emission is correct,then careful analysis of the emission occultation could, in principle,constrain the inclination of the xrb and the mass of the black hole.

1008.2395	x-ray emission from the sombrero galaxy: discrete sources	we present a study of discrete x-ray sources in and around thebulge-dominated, massive sa galaxy, sombrero (m104), based on new and archivalchandra observations with a total exposure of ~200 ks. with a detection limitof l_x = 1e37 erg/s and a field of view covering a galactocentric radius of ~30kpc (11.5 arcminute), 383 sources are detected. cross-correlation with spitleret al.'s catalogue of sombrero globular clusters (gcs) identified from hst/acsobservations reveals 41 x-rays sources in gcs, presumably low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs). we quantify the differential luminosity functions (lfs) forboth the detected gc and field lmxbs, whose power-low indices (~1.1 for thegc-lf and ~1.6 for field-lf) are consistent with previous studies forelliptical galaxies. with precise sky positions of the gcs without a detectedx-ray source, we further quantify, through a fluctuation analysis, the gc lf atfainter luminosities down to 1e35 erg/s. the derived index rules out afaint-end slope flatter than 1.1 at a 2 sigma significance, contrary to recentfindings in several elliptical galaxies and the bulge of m31. on the otherhand, the 2-6 kev unresolved emission places a tight constraint on the fieldlf, implying a flattened index of ~1.0 below 1e37 erg/s. we also detect 101sources in the halo of sombrero. the presence of these sources cannot beinterpreted as galactic lmxbs whose spatial distribution empirically followsthe starlight. their number is also higher than the expected number of cosmicagns (52+/-11 [1 sigma]) whose surface density is constrained by deep x-raysurveys. we suggest that either the cosmic x-ray background is unusually highin the direction of sombrero, or a distinct population of x-ray sources ispresent in the halo of sombrero.

1009.5767	x-ray emission from the sombrero galaxy: a galactic-scale outflow	based on new and archival chandra observations of the sombrero galaxy (m104), we study the diffuse x-ray emission in and around its massive stellarbulge. the 2-6 kev unresolved emission from the bulge region closely followsthe k-band star light and most likely arises from unresolved stellar sources.at lower energies, however, the unresolved emission reaches a galactocentricradius of at least 23 kpc, significantly beyond the extent of the starlight,clearly indicating the presence of diffuse hot gas. we isolate the emission ofthe gas by properly accounting for the emission from unresolved stellarsources, predominantly cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries,whose quasi-universal x-ray emissivity is recently established. we find a gastemperature of ~0.6 kev with little variation across the field of view, exceptfor a lower temperature of ~0.3 kev along the stellar disk. we measure a totalintrinsic 0.3-2 kev luminosity of ~2e39 erg/s, which is comparable to theprediction by the latest galaxy formation models for disk galaxies as massiveas sombrero. however, such numerical models do not fully account for internalfeedback processes, such as nuclear feedback and stellar feedback, againstaccretion from the intergalactic medium. on the other hand, we find no evidencefor either the nucleus or the very modest star-forming activities in the diskto be a dominant heating source for the diffuse gas. we also show that neitherthe expected energy released by type ia supernovae nor the expected massreturned by evolved stars is recovered by observations. we argue that insombrero a galactic-scale subsonic outflow of hot gas continuously removes muchof the "missing" energy and mass input from the bulge region. the observeddensity and temperature distributions of such an outflow, however, continues topose challenges to theoretical studies.

1010.1051	galactic coronae in the intracluster environment: semi-confined  stellar-feedback-driven outflows	recently x-ray observations have shown the common presence of compactgalactic coronae around intermediate-mass spheroid galaxies embedded in theintracluster/intragroup medium (icm). we conduct 2-d hydrodynamic simulationsto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the naturalproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by thethermal and ram pressures of the icm. we find that the temperature of asimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,consistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gastemperature and k-band luminosity of galaxies. the simulated coronae typicallyrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. as aresult, the hot gas density increases with the icm thermal pressure. the rampressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of thecoronae. the density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,if present, and hence the formation of stars. the increase also enhancesradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive blackholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed inclusters than in the field. the radiation enhancement is consistent with asubstantially higher surface brightness of the x-ray emission detected fromcoronae in cluster environment. the total x-ray luminosity of a corona,however, depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and rampressures. these environment dependences should at least partly explain thelarge dispersion in the observed diffuse x-ray luminosities of spheroids withsimilar stellar properties. furthermore, we show that an outflow powered by thedistributed feedback can naturally produce a positive radial gradient in thehot gas entropy, mimicking a cooling flow.

1105.2580	dynamic s0 galaxies ii: the role of diffuse hot gas	gas loss is thought to be important in sf quenching and morphologicaltransition during the evolution of s0 galaxies. in high density environments,gas loss can be achieved via many external mechanisms. however, in relativelyisolated environments, where these external mechanisms cannot be efficient, gasloss must be dominated by some internal processes. we perform chandra analysisof hot gas in five nearby isolated s0 galaxies, based on quantitativesubtraction of various stellar contributions. we find that all the galaxiesstudied in the present work are x-ray faint, with the hot gas luminosity lx&lt;5%of the expected ia sn energy injection rate. we further compare our resultswith those from relevant recent papers, in order to investigate the energybudget, cold-hot gas relation, and gas removal from s0 galaxies in isolatedenvironments. we find that elliptical and s0 galaxies are not significantlydifferent in lx at the low mass end (typically with lk&lt;1e11lsun). however, atthe high mass end, s0 galaxies tend to have significantly lower lx thanelliptical galaxies of the same stellar masses. we further discuss thepotential relation of the diffuse x-ray emission with the cold gas content ins0 and elliptical galaxies. we find that lx/lk^2 tends to correlate positivelywith the total cold gas mass m(h2+hi) for gas-poor galaxies withm(h2+hi)&lt;1e8msun, while they anti-correlate with each other for gas-rich ones.this cold-hot gas relation can be explained in a scenario of galaxy evolution,with the leftover cold gas from the precursor star forming galaxy mainlyremoved by the long-lasting ia sn feedback. the two different trends forgas-rich and -poor galaxies may be the results of the initial fast decreasingsn rate and the later fast decreasing mass-loading to hot gas, respectively.

1111.5915	charge exchange x-ray emission of nearby star-forming galaxies	properties of hot gas outflows from galaxies are generally measured fromassociated x-ray line emission assuming that it represents atomic transitionsin thermally excited hot gas. x-ray line emission, however, can also arise fromthe charge exchange between highly ionised ions and neutral species. thek\alpha\ triplet of he-like ions can be used as a powerful diagnostic, becausethe charge exchange x-ray emission (cxe) favours the inter-combination andforbidden lines, while the thermal emission favours the resonance line. weanalyse the ovii triplet of a sample of nine nearby star-forming galaxiesobserved by the xmm-newton reflection grating spectrometers. for most galaxies,the forbidden lines are comparable to or stronger than the resonance lines,which is in contrast to the thermal prediction. for ngc 253, m51, m83, m61, ngc4631, and the antennae galaxy, the observed line ratios are consistent with theratio of the cxe; for m94 and ngc 2903, the observed ratios indicate multipleorigins; for m82, different regions show different line ratios, also indicatingmultiple origins. we discuss other possible mechanisms that can produce arelatively strong forbidden line, such as a collisionalnon-equilibrium-ionization recombining/ionizing plasma, which are not favoured.these results suggest that the cxe may be a common process and contribute asignificant fraction of the soft x-ray line emission for galaxies with massivestar formation.

1112.0530	sources of x-rays from galaxies	galactic x-ray emission is a manifestation of various high-energy phenomenaand processes. the brightest x-ray sources are typically accretion-poweredobjects: active galactic nuclei and low- or high-mass x-ray binaries. suchobjects with x-ray luminosities of &gt; 10^{37} ergs/s can now be detectedindividually in nearby galaxies. the contributions from fainter discretesources (including cataclysmic variables, active binaries, young stellarobjects, and supernova remnants) are well correlated with the star formationrate or stellar mass of galaxies. the study of discrete x-ray sources isessential to our understanding of stellar evolution, dynamics, and end-productsas well as accretion physics. with the subtraction of the discrete sourcecontributions, one can further map out truly diffuse x-ray emission, which canbe used to trace the feedback from active galactic nuclei, as well as fromstars, both young and old, in the form of stellar winds and supernovae. thex-ray emission efficiency, however, is only about 1% of the energy input rateof the stellar feedback alone. the bulk of the feedback energy is most likelygone with outflows into large-scale galactic halos. much is yet to beinvestigated to comprehend the role of such outflows in regulating theecosystem, hence the evolution of galaxies. even the mechanism of the diffusex-ray emission remains quite uncertain. a substantial fraction of the emissioncannot arise directly from optically-thin thermal plasma, as commonly assumed,and most likely originates in its charge exchange with neutral gas. theseuncertainties underscore our poor understanding of the feedback and itsinterplay with the galaxy evolution.

1112.1418	detecting the warm-hot intergalactic medium through x-ray absorption  lines	the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim) at temperatures 1e5-1e7 k isbelieved to contain 30-50% of the baryons in the local universe. however, allcurrent x-ray detections of the whim at redshifts z&gt;0 are of low statisticalsignificance (&lt;=3sigma) and/or controversial. in this work, we aim to establishthe detection limits of current x-ray observatories and explore requirementsfor next-generation x-ray telescopes for studying the whim through x-rayabsorption lines. we analyze all available grating observations of mrk 421 andobtain spectra with signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) of \sim90 and 190 per 50 maspectral bin from chandra and xmm observations, respectively. although thesespectra are two of the best ever collected with chandra and xmm, we cannotconfirm the two whim systems reported by nicastro et al. in 2005. our bootstrapsimulations indicate that spectra with such high s/n cannot constrain the whimwith ovii column densities n(ovii)\sim1e15 cm^{-2} (corresponding to anequivalent widths of 2.5 ma for a doppler velocity of 50 km s^{-1}) at &gt;=3sigmasignificance level. the simulation results also suggest that it would take &gt;60ms for chandra and 140 ms for xmm to measure the n(ovii) at &gt;=4sigma from aspectrum of a background qso with flux of \sim0.2 mcrab (1 crab = 2e-8 ergs^{-1} cm^{-2} at 0.5-2 kev). future x-ray pectrographs need to be equippedwith spectral resolution r \sim 4000 and effective area a&gt;=100 cm^2 toaccomplish the similar constraints with an exposure time of \sim2 ms and wouldrequire \sim11 ms to survey the 15 qsos with flux \sim0.2 mcrab along whichclear intergalactic ovi absorbers have been detected.

1201.0551	chandra survey of nearby edge-on disk galaxies i: luminosities of  galactic coronae	x-ray-emitting coronae of nearby galaxies are expected to be produced eitherby accretion from the intergalactic medium and/or by various galactic feedback.we herein present a systematical analysis of the chandra observations of 53nearby edge-on disk galaxies over a range of 3 orders of magnitude in sfr.various coronal properties, such as the luminosity, vertical/horizontal extent,and other inferred parameters, are characterized for all the sample galaxies.for galaxies with high enough counting statistics, we also examine the thermaland chemical states of the coronal gas. here we concentrate on the coronalluminosity (lx), estimated in 0.5-2kev and within 5 times the diffuse x-rayvertical scale height. we find lx strongly correlates with the sfr for thewhole sample. but the inclusion of ia sne in the total energy input (e_sn)gives an even tighter correlation, which may be characterized with a linearrelation, lx=0.5%e_sn, and with a dispersion of 0.45dex. moreover, the coronalradiation efficiency (\eta=lx/e_sn) shows little correlation with either thestellar mass or the gravitational mass (m_tf, inferred from the rotationvelocity), but is significantly correlated with their ratio (m_tf/m_*), whichmay be expressed as a linear scaling relation \eta=0.35%m_tf/m_* for the entireranges of galaxy parameters. this joint scaling relation suggests that thecoronae are self-regulated by the combination of gravitational confinement andfeedback. but sn appears to be the primary heating source, because about halfof our galaxies are not massive enough to allow for the accretion to play amajor role. the commonly low \eta further suggests that the bulk of the snenergy likely flows out into large-scale galactic halos for essentially all thegalaxies. such ubiquitous outflows could have profound implications forunderstanding the ecosystem, hence the evolution of galaxies.

1204.3356	spectroscopic evidence of charge exchange x-ray emission from galaxies	what are the origins of the soft x-ray line emission from non-agn galaxies?xmm-newton rgs spectra of nearby non-agn galaxies (including starforming ones:m82, ngc 253, m51, m83, m61, ngc 4631, m94, ngc 2903, and the antennaegalaxies, as well as the inner bulge of m31) have been analyzed. in particular,the k{\alpha} triplet of o vii shows that the resonance line is typicallyweaker than the forbidden and/or inter-combination lines. this suggests that asubstantial fraction of the emission may not arise directly from optically thinthermal plasma, as commonly assumed, and may instead originate at its interfacewith neutral gas via charge exchange. this latter origin naturally explains theobserved spatial correlation of the emission with various tracers of cool gasin some of the galaxies. however, alternative scenarios, such as the resonancescattering by the plasma and the relic photo-ionization by agns in the recentpast, cannot be ruled out, at least in some cases, and are being examined. suchx-ray spectroscopic studies are important to the understanding of therelationship of the emission to various high-energy feedback processes ingalaxies.

0711.3212	limits on hot galactic halo gas from x-ray absorption lines	although the existence of large-scale hot gaseous halos around massive diskgalaxies have been theorized for a long time, there is yet very littleobservational evidence. we report the chandra and xmm-newton grating spectraldetection of ovii and neix kalpha absorption lines along the sight-line of 4u1957+11. the line absorption is consistent with the interstellar medium inorigin. attributing these line absorptions to the hot gas associated with thegalactic disk, we search for the gaseous halo around the milky way by comparingthis sight-line with more distant ones (toward x-ray binary lmc x-3 and the agnmrk 421). we find that all the line absorptions along the lmc x-3 and mrk 421sight-lines are attributable to the hot gas in a thick galactic disk, as tracedby the absorption lines in the spectra of 4u~1957+11 after a galactic latitudedependent correction. we constrain the ovii column density through the halo tobe n(ovii) &lt; 5e15 cm^{-2} (95% confidence limit), and conclude that the hot gascontribution to the metal line absorptions, if existing, is negligible.

1302.0076	xmm-newton/rgs detection of the missing interstellar ovii kalpha  absorption line in the spectrum of cyg x-2	the hot interstellar medium is an important part of the galactic ecosystemand can be effectively characterized through x-ray absorption linespectroscopy. however, in a study of the hot medium using the accreting neutronstar x-ray binary, cyg x-2, as a background light source, a mystery came aboutwhen the putatively strong ovii kalpha line was not detected in chandra gratingobservations, while other normally weaker lines such as ovii kbeta as well asovi and oviii kalpha are clearly present (yao et al. 2009). we haveinvestigated the grating spectra of cyg x-2 from 10 xmm-newton observations, insearch of the missing line. we detect it consistently in nine of theseobservations, but the line is absent in the remaining one observation or isinconsistent with the detection in others at a 4sigma confidence level. thisabsence of the line resembles that seen in the chandra observations. similarly,the ovi kalpha line is found to disappear occasionally, but not in concert withthe variation of the ovii kalpha line. all these variations are most likely dueto the presence of changing ovii and ovi kalpha emission lines of cyg x-2,which are blurred together with the absorption ones in the x-ray spectra. are-examination of the chandra grating data indeed shows evidence for a narrowemission line slightly off the ovi kalpha absorption line. we further show thatnarrow nv emission lines with varying centroids and fluxes are present infar-uv spectra from the cosmic origins spectrograph aboard the hubble spacetelescope. these results provide new constraints on the accretion around theneutron star and on the x-ray-heating of the stellar companion. theunderstanding of these physical processes is also important to the fidelity ofusing such local x-ray binaries for interstellar absorption line spectroscopy.

1308.1933	chandra survey of nearby highly inclined disc galaxies - ii: correlation  analysis of galactic coronal properties	x-ray observations provide a key tool for exploring the properties ofgalactic coronae and their formation processes. in an earlier paper, we havepresented a chandra data analysis of the coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclineddisc galaxies. here we study the correlation of the x-ray measurements withother galaxy properties and compare the results with those obtained forelliptical galaxies. a good correlation is present between the coronalluminosity lx and the sfr. but we find a better correlation between lx and thetotal sn mechanical energy input rate (esn), including the expectedcontribution from core collapsed (cc) and ia sne. the x-ray radiationefficiency (eta=lx/esn) has a mean value of ~0.4% with an rms of ~0.5dex. etafurther correlates with mtf/m* (mtf is the baryon mass measured from therotation velocity and the tully-fisher relation, m* is the stellar massmeasured from the k-band luminosity) and the cc sn rate surface density (fsn,in units of sn/yr/kpc^2), which can be characterized as: eta=0.41%mtf/m* andeta=1.4%fsn^-0.3. these correlations reflect the roles played by thegravitational mass and energetic feedback concentrations in determining eta.the characteristic temperature of the corona shows little dependence on thetotal or specific sfr, the cold gas content, or lx. the coronae of discgalaxies tend to be more x-ray luminous, hotter, and lower in fe/o abundanceratio than those of elliptical ones of similar masses. early-type non-starburstdisc galaxies tend to be more fe-rich, while starburst ones have a roughlyconstant abundance ratio of fe/o~0.36solar. our results are consistent with thecoronal gas being mainly provided by stellar feedback in a mass range ofm*~10^{8.7-11}msun. in addition, processes such as charge exchange at cool/hotgas interfaces, as well as various environmental effects, are also needed toexplain the diversity of coronal properties.

1402.4471	chandra survey of nearby highly inclined disc galaxies - iii: comparison  with hydrodynamical simulations of circumgalactic coronae	x-ray observations of circumgalactic coronae provide a valuable means bywhich to test galaxy formation theories. two primary mechanisms are thought tobe responsible for the establishment of such coronae: accretion ofintergalactic gas (igm) and/or galactic feedback. in this paper, we firstcompare our chandra sample of galactic coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclineddisc galaxies to an analytical model considering only the accretion of igm. weconfirm the existing conclusion that this pure accretion model substantiallyover-predicts the coronal emission. we then select 30 field galaxies from ouroriginal sample, and correct their coronal luminosities to uniformly comparethem to deep x-ray measurements of several massive disc galaxies from theliterature, as well as to a comparable sample of simulated galaxies drawn fromthe galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic). thesesimulations explicitly model both accretion and sne feedback and yield galaxiesexhibit x-ray properties in broad agreement with our observational sample.however, notable and potentially instructive discrepancies exist between theslope and scatter of the lx-m200 and lx-sfr relations, highlighting some knownshortcomings of gimic, e.g., the absence of agn feedback, and possibly theadoption of constant stellar feedback parameters. the simulated galaxiesexhibit a tight lx-m200 correlation with little scatter. having inferred m200for our observational sample via the tully-fisher relation, we find a weakerand more scattered correlation. in the simulated and observed samples alike,massive non-starburst galaxies above a typical transition mass of m*~2e11msunor m200~1e13msun tend to have higher lx/m* and lx/m200 than low-masscounterparts, indicating that the accretion of igm plays an increasinglyimportant role in establishing the observable hot circumgalactic medium withincreasing galaxy mass.

1408.3207	spectral modeling of the charge-exchange x-ray emission from m82	it has been proposed that the charge exchange (cx) process at the interfacebetween hot and cool interstellar gases could contribute significantly to theobserved soft x-ray emission in star forming galaxies. we analyze thexmm-newton/rgs spectrum of m82, using a newly developed cx model combined witha single-temperature thermal plasma to characterize the volume-filling hot gas.the cx process is largely responsible for not only the strongly enhancedforbidden lines of the k$\alpha$ triplets of various he-like ions, but alsogood fractions of the ly$\alpha$ transitions of c vi (~87%), o viii and n vii($\gtrsim$50%) as well. in total about a quarter of the x-ray flux in the rgs6-30 \aa\ band originates in the cx. we infer an ion incident rate of$3\times10^{51}\,\rm{s^{-1}}$ undergoing cx at the hot and cool gas interface,and an effective area of the interface as $\sim2\times10^{45}\,{\rm cm^2}$ thatis one order of magnitude larger than the cross section of the global biconicoutflow. with the cx contribution accounted for, the best fit temperature ofthe hot gas is 0.6 kev, and the metal abundances are approximately solar. wefurther show that the same cx/thermal plasma model also gives an excellentdescription of the epic-pn spectrum of the outflow cap, projected at 11.6 kpcaway from the galactic disk of m82. this analysis demonstrates that the cx ispotentially an important contributor to the x-ray emission from starburstgalaxies and also an invaluable tool to probe the interface astrophysics.

0803.4215	feedback from galactic stellar bulges and hot gaseous haloes of galaxies	we demonstrate that the feedback from stellar bulges can play an essentialrole in shaping the halo gas of galaxies with substantial bulge components byconducting 1-d hydrodynamical simulations. the feedback model we considerconsists of two distinct phases: 1) an early starburst during the bulgeformation and 2) a subsequent long-lasting mass and energy injection fromstellar winds of low-mass stars and type ia sne. an energetic outward blastwaveis initiated by the starburst and is maintained and enhanced by thelong-lasting stellar feedback. for a mw-like galactic bulge, this blastwavesweeps up the halo gas in the proto-galaxy and heats up the surrounding mediumto a scale much beyond the virial radius of the halo, thus the accretion of thehalo hot gas can be completely stopped. in addition, the long-lasting feedbackin the later phase powers a galactic bulge wind that is reverse-shocked at alarge radius in the presence of surrounding intergalactic medium and hencemaintains a hot gaseous halo. as the mass and energy injection decreases withtime, the feedback evolves to a subsonic and quasi-stable outflow, which isenough to prevent halo gas from cooling. the two phases of the feedback thusre-enforce each-other's impact on the gas dynamics. the simulation resultsdemonstrate that the stellar bulge feedback may provide a plausible solution tothe long-standing problems in understanding the mw type galaxies, such as the"missing stellar feedback" problem and the "over-cooling" problem. thesimulations also show that the properties of the hot gas in the subsonicoutflow state depend sensitively on the environment and the formation historyof the bulge. this dependence and variance may explain the large dispersion inthe x-ray to b-band luminosity ratio of the low $l_x/l_b$ es.

1503.02745	the role of feedback in accretion on low luminosity agn: sgr a* case  study	we present numerical models of the gas dynamics in the inner parsec of thegalactic centre. we follow the gas from its origin as stellar winds of severalobserved young massive stars, until it is either captured by the central blackhole, or leaves the system. unlike our previous models, we include an outflowfrom the inner accretion flow. two different kinds of outflows are modelled:(i) an instantaneous-response feedback mode, in which the outflow rate isdirectly proportional to the current black hole gas capture rate; and (ii) anoutburst mode, which is stronger but lasts for a limited time. the lattersituation may be particularly relevant to sgr a*, since there is evidence thatsgr a* was much brighter in the recent past. we find that both types of outflowperturb the gas dynamics near the bondi radius and the black hole capture ratesignificantly. the effects persist longer than the outflow itself. we alsocompare the effects of spherically symmetric and collimated outflows, and findthat the latter are far less efficient in transferring its energy to thesurrounding gas near the capture radius. our results imply that accretionfeedback is important for non-radiative accretion flows not only within butalso outside the capture radius. steady-state bondi accretion rate estimatesthat do not account for feedback outflows over-predict not only the accretionrate onto the black hole but also the capture rate at the bondi radius itself.finally, the steady-state assumption under which non-radiative flows have beenroutinely studied in the literature may have to be abandoned if accretionfeedback is bursty in nature.

1506.01097	photometric evidence of an intermediate-age stellar population in the  inner bulge of m31	we explore the assembly history of the m31 bulge within a projectedmajor-axis radius of 180" (~680 pc) by studying its stellar populations inhubble space telescope wfc3 and acs observations. colors formed by comparingnear-ultraviolet vs. optical bands are found to become bluer with increasingmajor-axis radius, which is opposite to that predicted if the sole sources ofnear-ultraviolet light were old extreme horizontal branch stars with a negativeradial gradient in metallicity. spectral energy distribution fits require ametal-rich intermediate-age stellar population (300 myr to 1 gyr old, ~solarmetallicity) in addition to the dominant old population. the radial gradientsin age and metallicity of the old stellar population are consistent with thosein previous works. for the intermediate-age population, we find an increase inage with radius and a mass fraction that increases up to 2% at 680 pc away fromthe center. we exclude contamination from the m31 disk and/or halo as the mainorigin for this population. our results thus suggest that intermediate-agestars exist beyond the central 5" (19 pc) of m31 and contribute ~1% of thetotal stellar mass in the bulge. these stars could be related to the seculargrowth of the m31 bulge.

1506.02946	statistics of x-ray flares of sagittarius a*: evidence for solar-like  self-organized criticality phenomenon	x-ray flares have routinely been observed from the supermassive black hole,sagittarius a$^\star$ (sgr a$^\star$), at our galactic center. the nature ofthese flares remains largely unclear, despite of many theoretical models. inthis paper, we study the statistical properties of the sgr a$^\star$ x-rayflares, by fitting the count rate (cr) distribution and the structure function(sf) of the light curve with a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method. with the3 million second \textit{chandra} observations accumulated in the sgr a$^\star$x-ray visionary project, we construct the theoretical light curves throughmonte carlo simulations. we find that the $2-8$ kev x-ray light curve can bedecomposed into a quiescent component with a constant count rate of$\sim6\times10^{-3}~$count s$^{-1}$ and a flare component with a power-lawfluence distribution $dn/de\propto e^{-\alpha_{\rm e}}$ with $\alpha_{\rme}=1.65\pm0.17$. the duration-fluence correlation can also be modelled as apower-law $t\propto e^{\alpha_{\rm et}}$ with $\alpha_{\rm et} &lt; 0.55$ ($95\%$confidence). these statistical properties are consistent with the theoreticalprediction of the self-organized criticality (soc) system with the spatialdimension $s = 3$. we suggest that the x-ray flares represent plasmoidejections driven by magnetic reconnection (similar to solar flares) in theaccretion flow onto the black hole.

0705.2772	the galactic central diffuse x-ray enhancement: a differential  absorption/emission analysis	the soft x-ray background shows a general enhancement toward the inner regionof the galaxy. but whether this enhancement is a local feature (e.g., asuperbubble within a distance of &lt;= 200 pc) and/or a phenomenon related toenergetic outflows from the galactic center/bulge remains unclear. here wereport a comparative x-ray emission and absorption study of diffuse hot gasalong the sight lines toward 3c 273 and mrk 421, on and off the enhancement,but at similar galactic latitudes. the diffuse 3/4-kev emission intensity, asestimated from the rosat all sky survey, is about three times higher toward 3c273 than toward mrk 421. based on archival \chandra grating observations ofthese two agns, we detect x-ray absorption lines (e.g., ovii kalpha, kbeta, andoviii kalpha transitions at z~0) and find that the mean hot gas thermal andkinematic properties along the two sight lines are significantly different. bysubtracting the foreground and background contribution, as determined along themrk 421 sight line, we isolate the net x-ray absorption and emission producedby the hot gas associated with the enhancement in the direction of 3c 273. froma joint analysis of these differential data sets, we obtain the temperature,dispersion velocity, and hydrogen column density as 2.0(1.6, 2.3)e6 k,216(104,480) km/s, and 2.2(1.4, 4.1)e19 cm^{-2}, respectively (90% confidenceintervals), assuming that the gas is approximately isothermal, solar in metalabundances, and equilibrium in collisional ionization. we also constrain theeffective line-of-sight extent of the gas to be 3.4(1.0, 10.1) kpc, stronglysuggesting that the enhancement most likely represents a galactic centralphenomenon.

1511.01206	igr j12580+0134: the first tidal disruption event with an off-beam  relativistic jet	supermassive black holes (smbhs) can capture and tidally disrupt stars orsub-stellar objects orbiting nearby. the detections of sw j1644+57-like eventssuggest that at least some tdes can launch a relativistic jet beaming towardsearth. a natural expectation would be the existence of tdes with a relativisticjet beaming away from earth. the nearby tde candidate igr j12580+0134 providesnew insights into the jet phenomenon. combining several constraints, we findthat the event invokes a $8-40$ jupiter mass object tidally disrupted by a $3\times 10^5 - 1.8 \times 10^7 m_\sun$ smbh. recently, a bright radio transientwas discovered by irwin et al. in association with igr j12580+0134. we performdetailed modeling of the event based on a numerical jet model previouslydeveloped for the radio emission of sw j1644+57. we find that the radio data ofigr j12580+0134 can be interpreted within an external forward shock model inthe newtonian regime. using sw j1644+57 as a template and properly correctingfor its luminosity, we argue that the observed x-ray flux in early times is toofaint to allow an on-beam relativistic jet unless the lorentz factor is verysmall. rather, the x-ray emission is likely from the disk or corona near theblack hole. from various constraints, we find that the data are consistent withan off-beam relativistic jet with a viewing angle $\theta_{\rm obs} \gtrsim30^{\rm o}$, and an initial lorentz factor $\gamma_j \gtrsim $ a few.thisscenario can readily be tested in the upcoming vlbi observations.

1511.06673	chang-es vi: probing supernova energy deposition in spiral galaxies  through multi-wavelength relationships	how a galaxy regulates its sne energy into differentinterstellar/circumgalactic medium components strongly affects galaxyevolution. based on the jvla d-configuration c- (6 ghz) and l-band (1.6 ghz)continuum observations, we perform statistical analysis comparingmulti-wavelength properties of the chang-es galaxies. the high-quality jvladata and edge-on orientation enable us for the first time to include the halointo the energy budget for a complete radio-flux-limited sample. we find tightcorrelations of $l_{\rm radio}$ with the mid-ir-based sfr. the normalization ofour $i_{\rm 1.6ghz}/{\rm w~hz^{-1}}-{\rm sfr}$ relation is $\sim$2-3 times ofthose obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of enhanced irextinction at high inclination. we also find tight correlations between $l_{\rmradio}$ and the sne energy injection rate $\dot{e}_{\rm sn(ia+cc)}$, indicatingthe energy loss via synchrotron radio continuum accounts for $\sim0.1\%$ of$\dot{e}_{\rm sn}$, comparable to the energy contained in cr electrons. theintegrated c-to-l-band spectral index is $\alpha\sim0.5-1.1$ for non-agngalaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron component. thelow-scatter $l_{\rm radio}-{\rm sfr}$/$l_{\rm radio}-\dot{e}_{\rm sn (ia+cc)}$relationships have super-linear logarithmic slopes at $\sim2~\sigma$ in l-band($1.132\pm0.067$/$1.175\pm0.102$) while consistent with linear in c-band($1.057\pm0.075$/$1.100\pm0.123$). the super-linearity could be naturallyreproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy disks. using chandra halox-ray measurements, we find sub-linear $l_{\rm x}-l_{\rm radio}$ relations.these results indicate that the observed radio halo of a starburst galaxy isclose to electron calorimeter, and a galaxy with higher sfr tends to distributean increased fraction of sne energy into radio emission (than x-ray).

1512.02655	chandra survey of nearby highly inclined disk galaxies -- iv: new  insights into the working of stellar feedback	galaxy evolution is regulated by the interplay between galactic disks andtheir surrounding medium. we study this interplay by examining how the galacticcoronal emission efficiency of stellar feedback depends on the (surface andspecific) star formation rates (sfrs) and other parameters for a sample of 52chandra-observed nearby highly inclined disk galaxies. we first measure thestar forming galactic disk sizes, as well as the sfrs of these galaxies, usingdata from the wide-field infrared survey explorer, and then show that 1) thespecific 0.5-2~kev luminosity of the coronal emission correlates with thespecific sfr in a {\sl sub-linear} fashion: on average, $l_x/l_k \propto(sfr/m_*)^{\gamma}$ with $\gamma =0.29\pm0.12$; 2) the efficiency of theemission $ l_x/sfr$ decreases with increasing surface sfr ($i_{sfr}$; $\gamma =-0.44\pm0.12$); and 3) the characteristic temperature of the x-ray-emittingplasma weakly correlates with $i_{sfr}$ ($\gamma = 0.08\pm0.04$). theseresults, somewhat surprising and anti-intuitive, suggest that a) the linearcorrelation between $l_x$ and sfr, as commonly presented, is largely due to thecorrelation of these two parameters with galaxy mass; b) much of the mechanicalenergy from stellar feedback likely drives global outflows with little x-raycooling and with a mass-loading efficiency decreasing fast with increasing$i_{sfr}$ ($\gamma \lesssim -0.5$); c) these outflows heat and inflate themedium around the galactic disks of massive galaxies, reducing its radiativecooling rate, whereas for relatively low-mass galaxies, the energy in theoutflows is probably dissipated in regions far away from the galactic disks.

astro-ph;0102021	rosat x-ray observations of the spiral galaxy m81	we present results from the analysis of deep rosat hri and pspc observationsof the spiral galaxy m81. the inferred total (0.5-2 kev band) luminosity of m81is ~3x10^40 ergs/s, excluding the contribution from identified interlopersfound within the d_25 ellipse. the nucleus of the galaxy alone accounts forabout 65% of this luminosity. the rest is due to 26 other x-ray sources(contributing ~10%) and to apparently diffuse emission, which is seen acrossmuch of the galactic disk and is particularly bright in the bulge region aroundthe nucleus. spectral analysis further gives evidence for a soft component,which can be characterized by a two-temperature optically thin plasma withtemperature at ~0.15 kev and 0.60 kev and an absorption of the galacticforeground only. these components, accounting for ~13% of the x-ray emissionfrom the region, apparently arise in a combination of hot gas and faintdiscrete sources. we find interesting spatial coincidences of luminous(10^37-10^40 ergs/s) and variable x-ray sources with shock-heated opticalnebulae. three of them are previously classified as supernova remnantcandidates. the other one is far off the main body of m81, but is apparentlyassociated with a dense hi concentration produced most likely by the tidalinteractions of the galaxy with its companions. these associations suggest thatsuch optical nebulae may be powered by outflows from luminous x-ray binaries,which are comparable to, or more luminous than galactic `micro-quasars'.

astro-ph;0109212	x-ray detection of a pre-supernova evolution for the sn 1993j progenitor	we report on the first detection of a pre-supernova (sn) evolution in thex-ray regime. the results are based on rosat observations of sn 1993j rangingfrom six days to five years after the outburst. the x-ray observations are usedto probe the sn shell interaction with the ambient circumstellar matter (csm).after exploring various scenarios that might explain the observed x-raylightcurve with a t^-0.27 rate of decline, we present a coherent picture interms of the interaction of the sn shock front with the csm deposited by theprogenitor's stellar wind. during the observed period, the sn shell has reacheda radius of 3x10^17 cm from the site of the explosion, corresponding to ~10^4years in the progenitors stellar wind history. our analysis shows that themass-loss rate of the progenitor has decreased constantly from \dot{m} =4x10^-4 to 4x10^-5 m_sun/yr (v_w/10 km/s) during the late stage of theevolution. assuming a spherically symmetric expansion, the circumstellar matterdensity profile is found to be significantly flatter (\rho_csm \propto r^-1.63)than expected for a constant mass-loss rate and constant wind velocity profile(r^-2). the observed evolution either reflects a decrease in the mass-lossrate, an increase in the wind speed or a combination of both, indicating thatthe progenitor likely was making a transition from the red to the bluesupergiant phase during the late stage of its evolution.

astro-ph;0405122	confronting the superbubble model with x-ray observations of 30 dor c	we present an analysis of xmm-newton observations of the superbubble 30 dor cand compare the results with the predictions from the standard wind-blownbubble model. we find that the observed x-ray spectra cannot be fittedsatisfactorily with the model alone and that there is evidence for nonthermalx-ray emission, which is particularly important at &gt; 4 kev. the totalunabsorbed 0.1-10 kev luminosities of the eastern and western parts of thebubble are ~3 10^36 erg/s and ~5 10^36 erg/s, respectively. the unabsorbed0.1-10 kev luminosity of the bubble model is 4 10^36 erg/s and so the power-lawcomponent contributes between 1/3 and 1/2 to the total unabsorbed luminosity inthis energy band. the nature of the hard nonthermal emission is not clear,although recent supernovae in the bubble may be responsible. we expect thatabout one or two core-collapse supernovae could have occured and are requiredto explain the enrichment of the hot gas, as evidenced by the overabundance ofalpha-elements by a factor of 3, compared to the mean value of 0.5 solar forthe interstellar medium in the large magellanic cloud. as in previous studiesof various superbubbles, the amount of energy currently present in 30 dor c issignificantly less than the expected energy input from the enclosed massivestars over their lifetime. we speculate that a substantial fraction of theinput energy may be radiated in far-infrared by dust grains, which are mixedwith the hot gas because of the thermal conduction and/or dynamic mixing.

astro-ph;0405272	correction for the flux measurement bias in x-ray source detection	with a high spatial resolution imaging instrument such as the  chandra/acis, one can confidently identify an x-ray source with only a fewdetected counts. the detection threshold of such sources, however, variesstrongly across the field-of-view of the instrument. furthermore, the lowdetection counting statistics, together with a typical steep source number-fluxrelation, causes more intrinsically faint sources to be detected at apparentlyhigher fluxes than the other way around. we quantify this ``x-ray eddingtonbias'' as well as the detection threshold variation and devise simpleprocedures for their corrections. to illustrate our technique, we presentresults from our analysis of x-ray sources detected in the fields of thelarge-scale hierarchical complex abell 2125 at $z = 0.247$ and the nearbygalaxy ngc 4594 (sombrero). we show that the sources detected in the abell 2125field, excluding 10 known complex members, have a number-flux relationconsistent with the expected from foreground or background objects. incontrast, the number-flux relation of the ngc 4594 field is dominated by x-raysources associated with the galaxy. this galactic component of the relation iswell characterized by a broken power law.

astro-ph;0408355	a chandra acis view of the thermal composite supernova remnant 3c391	we present a 60 ks chandra acis-s observation of the thermal compositesupernova remnant 3c391. the southeast-northwest elongated morphology issimilar to that previously found in radio and x-ray studies. this observationunveils a highly clumpy structure of the remnant. detailed spatially resolvedspectral analysis for the small-scale features reveals that the interior gas isgenerally of normal metal abundance and has approached or basically reachedionization equilibrium. the hydrogen column density increases from southeast tonorthwest. three mechanisms, radiative rim, thermal conduction, and cloudletevaporation, may all play roles in the x-ray appearance of 3c391 as a "thermalcomposite" remnant, but there are difficulties with each of them in explainingsome physical properties. comparatively, the cloudlet evaporation model isfavored by the main characteristics such as the highly clumpy structure and theuniform temperature and density distribution over most of the remnant. thedirectly measured postshock temperature also implies a young age, about 4 kyr,for the remnant. the postshock gas pressure derived from the ne and sw rims,which harbor maser spots, is consistent with the estimate for the maserregions. an unresolved x-ray source is observed on the northwest border and itsspectrum is best fitted by a power-law.

astro-ph;0409704	diffuse x-rays from the arches and quintuplet clusters	the origin and initial mass function of young stellar clusters near thegalactic center are still poorly understood. two of the more prominent ones,the arches and quintuplet clusters, may have formed from a shock-induced burstof star formation, given their similar age and proximity to each other. theirunusual mass distribution, however, may be evidence of a contributing roleplayed by other factors, such as stellar capture from regions outside theclusters themselves. diffuse x-ray emission from these sources provides us witha valuable, albeit indirect, measure of the stellar mass-loss rate from theirconstituents. using recent data acquired with chandra, we can study the natureand properties of the outflow to not only probe the pertinent physicalconditions, such as high metallicity, the magnetic field, and so forth, butalso to better constrain the stellar distribution within the clusters, in orderto identify their formative history. in this paper, we present a set ofthree-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of the wind-windinteractions in both the arches and quintuplet clusters. we are guidedprimarily by the currently known properties of the constituent stars, though wevary the mass-loss rates in order to ascertain the dependence of the measuredx-ray flux on the assumed stellar characteristics. our results are comparedwith the latest observations of the arches cluster. our analysis of thequintuplet cluster may be used as a basis for comparison with future x-rayobservations of this source.

astro-ph;0410035	extra-planar diffuse hot gas around normal disk galaxies	i review results from {\sl chandra} observations of nearby normal edge-ongalaxies (sd to sa types). these galaxies have a broad range of star formationrate, but none of them is dominated by a nuclear starburst. the galaxies areall in directions of low galactic foreground absorption. extra-planar diffusesoft x-ray emission is detected unambiguously from all the galaxies, except forn4244 (sd), which is low in both the stellar mass and the star formation rate.the thermal nature of the x-ray-emitting gas is well established, although itschemical and ionization states remain largely uncertain. the x-ray luminosityof the gas is proportional to the star formation rate and to the stellar massof the galaxies. but the luminosity accounts for at most a few percent of theexpected supernova mechanical energy input. therefore, there is a ``missing''energy problem for spiral galaxies. much of the energy in late-type spirals maybe converted and radiated in lower energy bands. but early-type ones mostlikely have outflows, which are powered primarily by type ia supernovae ingalactic bulges. these galactic outflows may strongly affect both the dynamicsand cooling of the intergalactic gas accretion, hence the evolution of thegalaxies.

astro-ph;0507041	an xmm-newton and chandra study of the starburst galaxy ic 10	we present an x-ray study of our nearest starburst galaxy ic 10, based onxmm-newton and chandra observations. a list of 73 xmm-newton and 28 chandradetections of point-like x-ray sources in the field is provided; a substantialfraction of them are likely stellar objects in the milky way due to the lowgalactic latitude location of ic 10. the brightest source in the ic 10 field,x-1, shows a large variation by a factor of up to $\sim 6$ on time scalesduring the xmm-newton observation. the x-ray spectra of the source indicate thepresence of a multi-color blackbody accretion disk with an inner disktemperature t_{in} \approx 1.1 kev. these results are consistent with theinterpretation of the source as a stellar mass black hole, probably accretingfrom a wolf-rayet star companion. we infer the mass of this black hole to beabout 4 msun if it is not spinning, or a factor of up to about 6 higher ifthere is significant spinning. we also detect an apparent diffuse soft x-rayemission component of ic 10. an effective method is devised to remove the x-rayccd-readout streaks of x-1 that strongly affect the study of the diffusecomponent in the xmm-newton and chandra observations. we find that the diffusex-ray morphology is oriented along the optical body of the galaxy and ischiefly associated with starburst regions. the diffuse component can becharacterized by an optically thin thermal plasma with a mean temperature of$\sim 4 \times 10^6$ k and a 0.5-2 kev luminosity of $\sim 8 \times 10^{37}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$, representing only a small fraction of the expectedmechanical energy inputs from massive stars in the galaxy. there is evidencethat the hot gas is driving outflows from the starburst regions; therefore, thebulk of the energy inputs may be released in a galactic wind.

astro-ph;0606543	an xmm-newton observation of the massive edge-on sb galaxy ngc 2613	we present an xmm-newton observation of the massive edge-on sb galaxy ngc2613. we discover that this galaxy contains a deeply embedded active nucleuswith a 0.3-10 kev luminosity of 3.3x10^40 erg/s and a line-of-sight absorptioncolumn of 1.2x10^23 cm^-2. within the 25 mag/arcsec^2 optical b-band isophoteof the galaxy, we detect an additional 4 sources with an accumulated luminosityof 4.3x10^39 erg/s. the bulk of the unresolved x-ray emission spatially followsthe near-infrared (nir) k-band surface brightness distribution; the luminosityratio l_x/l_k ~ 8x10^-4 is consistent with that inferred from galactic discretesources. this x-ray-nir association and the compatibility of the x-ray spectralfit with the expected spectrum of a population of discrete sources suggest thatlow-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) are the most likely emitters of the unresolvedemission in the disk region. the remaining unresolved emission is primarily dueto extraplanar hot gas. the luminosity of this gas is at least a factor of 10less than that predicted by recent simulations of intergalactic gas accretionby such a massive galaxy with a circular rotation speed v_c ~ 304 km/s^2 (toftet al. 2002). instead, we find that the extraplanar hot gas most likelyrepresents discrete extensions away from the disk, including two``bubble-like'' features on either side of the nucleus. these extensions appearto correlate with radio continuum emission and, energetically, can be easilyexplained by outflows from the galactic disk.

astro-ph;0607397	non-equilibrium ionization model for stellar cluster winds and its  application	we have developed a self-consistent physical model for super stellar clusterwinds based on combining a 1-d steady-state adiabatic wind solution and anon-equilibrium ionization calculation. comparing with the case of collisionalionization equilibrium, we find that the non-equilibrium ionization effect issignificant in the regime of a high ratio of energy to mass input rate andmanifests in a stronger soft x-ray flux in the inner region of the starcluster. implementing the model in x-ray data analysis softwares (e.g., xspec)directly facilitates comparisons with x-ray observations. physical quantitiessuch as the mass and energy input rates of stellar winds can be estimated byfitting observed x-ray spectra. the fitted parameters may then be compared withindependent measurements from other wavelengths. applying our model to the starcluster ngc 3603, we find that the wind accounts for no more than 50% of thetotal "diffuse" emission, and the derived mass input rate and terminal velocityare comparable to other empirical estimates. the remaining emission most likelyoriginate from numerous low-mass pre-main-sequence stellar objects.

astro-ph;0611038	hot gaseous halos of nearby disk galaxies	i review studies of the hot gaseous medium in and around nearby normal diskgalaxies, including the milky way. this medium represents a reservoir ofmaterials required for lasting star formation, a depository of galacticfeedback (e.g., stellar mass loss and supernovae), and an interface between theinterstellar and intergalactic media. important progress has been made recentlywith the detection of x-ray absorption lines in the spectra of x-ray binariesand agns. the x-ray absorption line spectroscopy, together with existing x-rayemission and far-uv \ovi absorption measurements now allows for the first timeto characterize the global spatial, thermal, and chemical properties of hot gasin the galaxy. the results are generally consistent with those inferred fromx-ray imaging of nearby edge-on galaxies similar to the milky way. observeddiffuse x-ray emitting/absorbing gas does not extend significantly more than$\sim 10$ kpc away from galactic disks/bulges, except in nuclear starburst orvery massive galaxies. the x-ray cooling rate of this gas is generally far lessthan the expected supernova mechanical energy input alone. so the bulk of theenergy is ``missing''. on the other hand, evidence for a large-scale ($\gsim10^2$ kpc) hot gaseous halo around the milky way to explain varioushigh-velocity clouds is mounting. the theoretical argument for ongoingaccretion of intergalactic gas onto disk galaxies is also compelling. i discusspossible solutions that reconcile these facts.

astro-ph;0611446	chandra detection of fe xvii in absorption: iron abundance in the hot  gaseous interstellar medium	the iron depletion level and the gas-phase iron abundance in the hot ~10^6 kinterstellar medium (ism) is critical to the understanding of its energybalance as well as the thermal sputtering, cooling, and heating processes ofdust grains. here we report on the first detection of the fe xvii absorptionline at 15.02 a from the hot ism in the spectrum of the low mass x-ray binary4u~1820-303 observed with chandra x-ray observatory. by jointly analyzing thisabsorption line with those from ovii, oviii, and neix ions in the samespectrum, we obtain an abundance ratio as fe/ne=0.8(0.4, 2.1) in units of theanders &amp; grevesse solar value (90% confidence intervals). we find that theresult is robust with respect to different assumed gas temperaturedistributions. the obtained fe/ne abundance ratio, albeit with largeuncertainties, is consistent with the solar value, indicating that there isvery little or no iron depleted into dust grains, i.e., most of or all of thedust grains have been destroyed in the hot ism.

astro-ph;0612290	the non-isothermality and extent of galactic diffuse hot gas toward  mrk~421	diffuse hot gas can be traced effectively by its x-ray absorption andemission. we present a joint-analysis of these tracers to characterize thespatial and temperature distributions of the galactic hot gas along thesight-line toward the nearby bright active galactic nucleus mrk 421. we alsocomplement this analysis with far-uv ovi absorption observations. we find thatthe observed absorption line strengths of ovii and oviii are inconsistent withthe diffuse background emission line ratio of the same ions, if the gas isassumed to be isothermal in a collisional ionization equilibrium state. but allthese lines as well as the diffuse 3/4-kev broad-band background intensity inthe field can be fitted with a plasma with a power law temperaturedistribution. we show that this distribution can be derived from a hot gaseousdisk model with the gas temperature and density decreasing exponentially withthe vertical distance from the galactic plane. the joint fit gives theexponential scale heights as ~1.0 kpc and ~1.6 kpc and the middle plane valuesas 2.8e6 k and 2.4e-3 cm^{-3} for the temperature and density, respectively.these values are consistent with those inferred from x-ray observations ofnearby edge-on galaxies similar to our own.

astro-ph;0701487	chandra and xmm-newton detection of large-scale diffuse x-ray emission  from the sombrero galaxy	we present an x-ray study of the massive edge-on sa galaxy, sombrero (m~104;ngc 4594), based on xmm-newton and chandra observations. a list of 62xmm-newton and 175 chandra discrete x-ray sources is provided. at energiesabove 2 kev, the source-subtracted x-ray emission is distributed similarly asthe stellar k-band light and is primarily due to the residual emission fromdiscrete sources. at lower energies, however, a substantial fraction of thesource-subtracted emission arises from diffuse hot gas extending to ~20 kpcfrom the galactic center. the observed diffuse x-ray emission from the galaxyshows a steep spectrum that can be characterized by an optically-thin thermalplasma with temperatures of ~0.6-0.7 kev, varying little with radius. thediffuse emission has a total luminosity of ~3e39 erg/s in the 0.2-2 kev energyrange. this luminosity is significantly smaller than the prediction by currentnumerical simulations for galaxies as massive as sombrero. we argue that thestellar feedback likely plays an essential role in regulating the physicalproperties of hot gas. indeed, the observed diffuse x-ray luminosity ofsombrero accounts for at most a few percent of the expected mechanical energyinput from type ia supernovae. the inferred gas mass and metal content are alsosubstantially less than those expected from stellar ejecta. we speculate that agalactic bulge wind, powered primarily by type ia supernovae, has removed muchof the 'missing' energy and metal-enriched gas from regions revealed by thex-ray observations.

astro-ph;9503123	two x-ray sources in 30 doradus: wolf-rayet + black hole binaries?	i report the detection of two x-ray sources of luminosities $\sim 10^{36}{\rm~ergs~s^{-1}}$ in the central region of 30 doradus. these two sourcesappear point-like in images taken with the {\sl rosat} hri. one of the sourcesis most likely associated with a close spectroscopic binary r140a2 (wn6) withan orbital period of 2.76 days. the mass of the unknown binary component islikely in the range of $2.4 - 15{\rm~m}_\odot$. this suggests that the x-raysource could represent a long-sought class of binaries containing a wolf-rayetstar and a black hole. the other source, which coincides spatially with mk34(wn4.5), may have a similar nature. available x-ray spectral data support thiswolf-rayet + black-hole binary explanation of the two sources. i have used a{\sl rosat} pspc observation to show that the sources have ultrasoft spectrawith possible intrinsic absorption. modeled with multicolor blackbody disks,the spectra provide estimates of the disks' characteristic inner radii, whichare in agreement with those obtained for the known black-hole candidates. an{\sl asca} observation has further revealed a hard x-ray spectral componentfrom the central 30 doradus region. this component, represented by a power lawwith a photon index of $\sim 2.4$, may belong to the two sources. thecharacteristics of both the power-law and ultrasoft components stronglyindicates that the two sources are black-hole candidates in high-mass x-raybinaries.

astro-ph;9708087	rosat and asca observations of the crab-like supernova remnant n157b in  the large magellanic cloud	we report the results of rosat and asca x-ray observations of the supernovaremnant n157b (or 30 dor b, snr 0539-69.1) in the large magellanic cloud. forcomparison, we also briefly describe the results on snr 0540-69.3, the onlyconfirmed crab-like remnant in the cloud. the x-ray emission from n157b can bedecomposed into a bright comet-shaped feature, superimposed on a diffuseemission region of a dimension $\sim 20$ pc. the flat and nearly featurelessspectrum of the remnant is distinctly different from those of young shell-likeremnants, suggesting a predominantly crab-like nature of n157b. characterizedby a power law with an energy slope $\sim 1.5$, the spectrum of n157b above$\sim 2$ kev is, however, considerably steeper than that of snr 0540-69.3,which has a slope of $\sim 1.0$. at lower energies, the spectrum of n157bpresents marginal evidence for emission lines, which if real most likely arisein hot gas of the diffuse emission region. the hot gas has a characteristicthermal temperature of 0.4-0.7 kev. no significant periodic signal is detectedfrom n157b in the period range of $3 \times 10^{-3}-2000$ s. the pulsedfraction is $\lesssim 9%$ (99% confidence) in the $2-7$ kev range. we discussthe nature of the individual x-ray components. in particular, we suggest thatthe synchrotron radiation of relativistic particles from a fast-moving ($\sim10^3 km s^{-1}$) pulsar explains the size, morphology, spectrum, and energeticsof the comet-shaped x-ray feature. we infer the age of the remnant as $\sim 5\times 10^3$ yrs. the lack of radio polarization of the remnant may be due tofaraday dispersion by foreground \ion{h}{2} gas.

astro-ph;9710144	the hot galactic corona and the soft x-ray background	i characterize the global distribution of the 3/4 kev band background with asimple model of the hot galactic corona, plus an isotropic extragalacticbackground. the corona is assumed to be approximately polytropic (index = 5/3)and hydrostatic in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. the modelaccounts for x-ray absorption, and is constrained iteratively with the rosatall-sky x-ray survey data. regions where the data deviate significantly fromthe model represent predominantly the galactic disk and individual nearby hotsuperbubbles. the global distribution of the background, outside these regions,is well characterized by the model; the 1 sigma relative dispersion of the datafrom the model is about 15%. the electron density and temperature of the coronanear the sun are about 1.1 x 10^{-3} cm^{-3} and about 1.7 x 10^6 k. the samemodel also explains well the 1.5 kev band background. the model prediction inthe 1/4 kev band, though largely uncertain, qualitatively shows large intensityand spectral variations of the corona contribution across the sky.

astro-ph;9810365	rosat hri detection of the 16 ms pulsar psr j0537-6910 inside snr n157b	based on a deep rosat hri observation, we have detected a pulsed signal inthe 0.1-2 kev band from psr j0537-6910 --- the recently discovered pulsarassociated with the supernova remnant n157b in the large magellanic cloud. themeasured pulse period 0.01611548182 ms (+- 0.02 ns), epoch mjd 50540.5, gives arevised linear spin-down rate of $5.1271 \times 10^{-14} s s^{-1}$, slightlygreater than the previously derived value. the narrow pulse shape (fwhm = 10%duty cycle) in the rosat band resembles those seen in both xte and asca data (&gt;2 kev), but there is also marginal evidence for an interpulse. this rosatdetection enables us to locate the pulsar at r.a., dec (j2000) =$5^h37^m47^s.2, -69^\circ 10' 23''$. with its uncertainty $\sim 3''$, thisposition coincides with the centroid of a compact x-ray source. but the pulsedemission accounts for only about 10% of the source luminosity $\sim 2 \times10^{36} ergs^{-1}$ in the 0.1-2 kev band. these results support our previoussuggestions: (1) the pulsar is moving at a high velocity ($\sim 10^3 km/s$);(2) a bow shock, formed around the pulsar, is responsible for most of the x-rayemission from the source; (3) a collimated outflow from the bow shock regionpowers a pulsar wind nebula that accounts for an elongated non-thermal radioand x-ray feature to the northwest of the pulsar.

astro-ph;9903194	a2111: a z=0.23 butcher-oemler cluster with a non-isothermal atmosphere  and normal metallicity	we report results from an x-ray study of the abell 2111 galaxy cluster usingthe advanced satellite for astrophysics and cosmology asca and the rosatposition sensitive proportional counter (pspc). by correcting for theenergy-dependent point-spread function of the asca instruments, we haveexamined the temperature structure of the cluster. the cluster's core within 3'is found to have a temperature of 6.46+-0.87 kev, significantly higher than3.10+-1.19 kev in the surrounding region of r = 3 - 6'. this radiallydecreasing temperature structure can be parameterized by a polytropic index of$\gamma$ $\simeq$ 1.45. the x-ray morphology of the cluster appears elongatedand clumpy on scales $\le$1'. these results, together with earlier {\it rosat}and optical studies which revealed that the x-ray centroid and ellipticity ofa2111 shift with spatial scale, are consistent with the hypothesis that thecluster is a dynamically young system. most likely, the cluster has recentlyundergone a merger, which may also be responsible for the high fraction of bluegalaxies observed in the cluster. alternatively, the temperature structure mayalso be due to the gravitational potential of the cluster. we have furthermeasured the emission weighted abundance of the x-ray-emitting intraclustermedium as 0.25$\pm$0.14 solar. this value is similar to those of nearbyclusters which do not show a large blue galaxy fraction, indicating that starformation in disk galaxies and subsequent loss to the medium do not drasticallyalter the average abundance of a cluster. this is consistent with recentresults which indicate that cluster abundances have remained constant since atleast z ~ 0.3.

astro-ph;9903246	detection of x-ray-emitting hypernova remnants in m101	based on an ultra deep (230 ks) rosat hri imaging of m101, we have detected 5x-ray sources that coincide spatially with optical emission line featurespreviously classified as supernova remnants in this nearby galaxy. two of thesecoincidences (snr mf83 and ngc5471b) most likely represent the true physicalassociation of x-ray emission with shock-heated interstellar gas. mf83, with aradius of ~ 134 pc, is one of the largest remnants known. ngc5471b, with aradius of 30 pc and a velocity of at least 350 km/s (fwzi), is extremely brightin both radio and optical. the x-ray luminosities of these two shell-likeremnants are $\sim 1$ and $3 \times 10^{38} ergs/s$ (0.5-2 kev), about an orderof magnitude brighter than the brightest supernova remnants known in our galaxyand in the magellanic clouds. the inferred blastwave energy is $\sim 3 \times10^{52} ergs$ for ngc5471b and $\sim 3 \times 10^{53}$ ergs for mf83.therefore, the remnants likely originate in hypernovae, which are a factor of$\gtrsim 10$ more energetic than canonical supernovae and are postulated asbeing responsible for gamma-ray bursts observed at cosmological distances. thestudy of such hypernova remnants in nearby galaxies has the potential toprovide important constraints on the progenitor type, rate, energetics, andbeaming effect of gamma-ray bursts.
