0909.0750	the size-star formation relation of massive galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5	we study the relation between size and star formation activity in a completesample of 225 massive (m &gt; 5 x 10^10 msun) galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, selected fromthe fireworks uv-ir catalog of the cdfs. based on stellar population synthesismodel fits to the observed restframe uv-nir seds, and independent mips 24micron observations, 65% of galaxies are actively forming stars, while 35% arequiescent. using sizes derived from 2d surface brightness profile fits to highresolution (fwhm_{psf}~0.45 arcsec) groundbased isaac data, we confirm andimprove the significance of the relation between star formation activity andcompactness found in previous studies, using a large, complete mass-limitedsample. at z~2, massive quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller thanmassive star forming galaxies, and a median factor of 0.34+/-0.02 smaller thangalaxies of similar mass in the local universe. 13% of the quiescent galaxiesare unresolved in the isaac data, corresponding to sizes &lt;1 kpc, more than 5times smaller than galaxies of similar mass locally. the quiescent galaxiesspan a kormendy relation which, compared to the relation for local early types,is shifted to smaller sizes and brighter surface brightnesses and isincompatible with passive evolution. the progenitors of the quiescent galaxies,were likely dominated by highly concentrated, intense nuclear star bursts atz~3-4, in contrast to star forming galaxies at z~2 which are extended anddominated by distributed star formation.

0909.1803	discovery of z~8 galaxies in the hudf from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  observations	we utilize the newly-acquired, ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations over the hudfto search for star-forming galaxies at z~8-8.5, only 600 million years fromrecombination, using a y_{105}-dropout selection. the new 4.7 arcmin**2 wfc3/irobservations reach to ~28.8 ab mag (5 sigma) in the y_{105}j_{125}h_{160}bands. these remarkable data reach ~1.5 ab mag deeper than the previous dataover the hudf, and now are an excellent match to the hudf optical acs data. forour search criteria, we use a two-color lyman-break selection technique toidentify z~8-8.5 y_{105}-dropouts. we find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. thesources have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 ab mag and very blue uv-continuumslopes, with a median estimated beta of &lt;~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{\beta}). this suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dustfree but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. the observednumber of y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sourcesexpected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expectedextrapolating the bouwens et al. 2008 lf results to z~8. these results provideevidence that the evolution in the lf seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of wfc3/ir has enabled hst tocross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

0909.1806	z~7 galaxies in the hudf: first epoch wfc3/ir results	we present a sample of 16 robust z~7 z-drop galaxies detected by the newlyinstalled wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope. our analysis is basedon the first epoch data of the hudf09 program covering the hubble ultra deepfield with 60 orbits of y, j, and h observations. these remarkable data cover4.7 arcmin^2 and are the deepest nir images ever taken, reaching to ~29 mag ab(5 sigma). the 16 z~6.5-7.5 galaxies have been identified based on the lymanbreak technique utilizing (z-y) vs. (y-j) colors. they have magnitudes j =26.0-29.0 (ab), an average apparent half-light radius of ~0.16 arcsec (&lt;~1kpc), and show very blue colors (some even beta&lt;~-2.5), in particular at lowluminosities. the wfc3/ir data confirms previous nicmos detections indicatingthat the dropout selection at z~7 is very reliable. our data allow a firstdetermination of the faint end slope of the z~7 luminosity function, reachingdown to m_uv ~ -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. whenfixing phi*=1.4e-3/mpc^3/mag to the value previously measured at z~6, we find abest-fit value of alpha=-1.77+-0.20, with a characteristic luminosity ofm_*=-19.91+-0.09. this steep slope is similar to what is seen at z~2-6 andindicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate fluxto reionize the universe. the remarkable depth and resolution of these newimages provide insights into the coming power of jwst.

0909.5183	structure and morphologies of z~7-8 galaxies from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  imaging of the hudf	we present a first morphological study of z~7-8 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)from oesch et al. 2009 and bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deepnear-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) by the hudf09program. with an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies arefound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness ofmu_j ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. by comparison tolower redshift lbgs it is found that only little size evolution takes placefrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in theirapparent profiles. the average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 forgalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52for (0.12-0.3)l*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comovingsizes. the peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.however, a tail of larger galaxies (&gt;~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towardslater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhancedaccretion of cold gas. additionally, the average star-formation surface densityof lbgs with luminosities (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} is nearly constant at sigma_{sfr}=1.9msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similarstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. the above evolutionarytrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possiblyincomplete.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0910.2227	the dead sequence: a clear bimodality in galaxy colors from z=0 to z=2.5	we select 25,000 galaxies from the newfirm medium band survey (nmbs) to studythe rest-frame u-v color distribution of galaxies at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. the fiveunique nir filters of the nmbs enable the precise measurement of photometricredshifts and rest-frame colors for 9,900 galaxies at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. therest-frame u-v color distribution at all z&lt;~2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, ablue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). modelfits to the optical-nir seds and the distribution of mips-detected galaxiesindicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largelyby the amount of reddening by dust. this result does not support the simplestinterpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star-formingto red quiescent galaxies. we show that correcting the rest-frame colors fordust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and bluesequences up to z~2.5. our study confirms that dusty starburst galaxies cancontribute a significant fraction to red sequence samples selected on the basisof a single rest-frame color (i.e. u-v), so extra care must be taken if samplesof truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. interestingly, of galaxiesdetected at 24 microns, 14% remain on the red sequence after applying thereddening correction.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0707.2787	the evolution of the field and cluster morphology-density relation for  mass-selected samples of galaxies	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and photometric/spectroscopic surveys inthe goods-south field (the chandra deep field-south, cdfs) are used toconstruct volume-limited, stellar mass-selected samples of galaxies atredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. the cdfs sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 contains 207 galaxies completedown to m=4x10^10 msol (for a ``diet'' salpeter imf), corresponding to aluminosity limit for red galaxies of m_b=-20.1. the sdss sample at0.020&lt;z&lt;0.045 contains 2003 galaxies down to the same mass limit, whichcorresponds to m_b=-19.3 for red galaxies. morphologies are determined with anautomated method, using the sersic parameter n and a measure of the residualfrom the model fits, called ``bumpiness'', to distinguish differentmorphologies. these classifications are verified with visual classifications.in agreement with previous studies, 65-70% of the galaxies are located on thered sequence, both at z~0.03 and at z~0.8. similarly, 65-70% of the galaxieshave n&gt;2.5. the fraction of e+s0 galaxies is 43+/-3%$ at z~0.03 and 48+/-7% atz~0.8, i.e., it has not changed significantly since z~0.8. when combined withrecent results for cluster galaxies in the same redshift range, we find thatthe morphology-density relation for galaxies more massive than 0.5m* hasremained constant since at least z~0.8. this implies that galaxies evolve inmass, morphology and density such that the morphology-density relation does notchange. in particular, the decline of star formation activity and theaccompanying increase in the stellar mass density of red galaxies since z~1must happen without large changes in the early-type galaxy fraction in a givenenvironment.

0912.4263	a candidate redshift z ~ 10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population  at an age of 500 myr	searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded alarge sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years(myr) after the big bang (redshifts 6 &gt; z &gt; 3; ref. 1). the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. observations ofz ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z &gt; 9-10. here we usethe full two-year hudf09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 myr after the bigbang. not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we showthat, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is muchsmaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 myr later at z ~ 8. thisdemonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased inboth luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. the 100-200myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliestgalaxies.

0707.4484	hst and spitzer imaging of red and blue galaxies at z~2.5: a correlation  between size and star formation activity from compact quiescent galaxies to  extended star forming galaxies	we present hst nicmos+acs and spitzer irac+mips observations of 41 galaxiesat 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 in the fires ms1054 field with red and blue rest-frame opticalcolors. about half of the galaxies are very compact (effective radii r_e &lt; 1kpc) at rest-frame optical wavelengths, the others are extended (1&lt; r_e &lt; 10kpc). for reference, 1 kpc corresponds to 0.12 arcsec at z=2.5 in the adoptedcosmology. we separate actively star forming galaxies from quiescent galaxiesby modeling their rest-frame uv-nir seds. the star forming galaxies span thefull range of sizes, while the quiescent galaxies all have r_e&lt;2kpc. in theredshift range where mips 24 micron imaging is a sensitive probe of re-radiateddust emission (z&lt;2.5), the 24 micron fluxes confirm that the light of the smallquiescent galaxies is dominated by old stars, rather than dust-enshrouded starformation or agn activity. the inferred surface mass densities and velocitydispersions for the quiescent galaxies are very high compared to those in localgalaxies. the galaxies follow a kormendy relation (between surface brightnessand size) with approximately the same slope as locally, but shifted to brightersurface brightnesses, consistent with a mean stellar formation redshift ofz_f~5. this paper demonstrates a direct relation between star formationactivity and size at z~2.5, and the existence of a significant population ofmassive, extremely dense, old stellar systems without readily identifiablecounterparts in the local universe.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1006.4360	uv luminosity functions from 132 z~7 and z~8 lyman-break galaxies in the  ultra-deep hudf09 and wide-area ers wfc3/ir observations	we identify 73 z~7 and 59 z~8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch,and use this large 26-29.4 ab mag sample of galaxies to derive very deepluminosity functions to &lt;-18 ab mag and the star formation rate density at z~7and z~8. the galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated lyman-breaktechnique on the full two-year wfc3/ir and acs data available over the hudf09(~29.4 ab mag, 5 sigma), two nearby hudf09 fields (~29 ab mag, 14 arcmin) andthe wider area ers (~27.5 ab mag) ~40 arcmin**2). the application of strictoptical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low(just ~7% in the hudf). this very low value includes a full assessment of thecontamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, agn, spurioussources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., sne). from careful modelling ofthe selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosityfunctions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to &lt;-18 ab mag. the faint-end slopesalpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 andalpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. such steep slopes contrast to the localalpha&lt;~-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z~4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05.with such steep slopes (alpha&lt;~-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate thegalaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. the star formationrate densities derived from these new z~7 and z~8 luminosity functions areconsistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). we findreasonable consistency, with the sfr densities implied from reported stellarmass densities, being only ~40% higher at z&lt;7. this suggests that (1) thestellar mass densities inferred from the spitzer irac photometry are reasonablyaccurate and (2) that the imf at very high redshift may not be very differentfrom that at later times.

1006.5453	the age spread of quiescent galaxies with the newfirm medium-band  survey: identification of the oldest galaxies out to z~2	with a complete, mass-selected sample of quiescent galaxies from the newfirmmedium-band survey (nmbs), we study the stellar populations of the oldest andmost massive galaxies (&gt;10^11 msun) to high redshift. the sample includes 570quiescent galaxies selected based on their extinction-corrected u-v colors outto z=2.2, with accurate photometric redshifts, sigma_z/(1+z)~2%, and rest-framecolors, sigma_u-v~0.06 mag. we measure an increase in the intrinsic scatter ofthe rest-frame u-v colors of quiescent galaxies with redshift. this scatter incolor arises from the spread in ages of the quiescent galaxies, where we seeboth relatively quiescent red, old galaxies and quiescent blue, youngergalaxies towards higher redshift. the trends between color and age areconsistent with the observed composite rest-frame spectral energy distributions(seds) of these galaxies. the composite seds of the reddest and bluestquiescent galaxies are fundamentally different, with remarkably well-defined4000a- and balmer-breaks, respectively. some of the quiescent galaxies may beup to 4 times older than the average age- and up to the age of the universe, ifthe assumption of solar metallicity is correct. by matching the scatterpredicted by models that include growth of the red sequence by thetransformation of blue galaxies to the observed intrinsic scatter, the dataindicate that most early-type galaxies formed their stars at high redshift witha burst of star formation prior to migrating to the red sequence. the observedu-v color evolution with redshift is weaker than passive evolution predicts;possible mechanisms to slow the color evolution include increasing amounts ofdust in quiescent galaxies towards higher redshift, red mergers at z&lt;1, and afrosting of relatively young stars from star formation at later times.

1105.2038	lower-luminosity galaxies could reionize the universe: very steep  faint-end slopes to the uv luminosity functions at z&gt;=5-8 from the hudf09  wfc3/ir observations	the hudf09 data are the deepest near-ir observations ever, reaching to 29.5mag. luminosity functions (lf) from these new hudf09 data for 132 z\sim7 andz\sim8 galaxies are combined with new lfs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlierz\sim4 lf to reach to very faint limits (&lt;0.05 l*(z=3)). the faint-end slopesalpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formallydivergent uv fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 abmag. these results have important implications for reionization. the weightedmean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. for such steep slopes, and a faint-endlimit of -10 ab mag, galaxies provide a very large uv ionizing photon flux.while current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,matching the thomson optical depths is more challenging. extrapolating thecurrent lf evolution to z&gt;8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value atz\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive thomson optical depths of0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. however, this result will change if the faint-endslope alpha is not constant with redshift. we test this hypothesis and find aweak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the thomson optical depths to0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent wmap estimates(tau=0.088+/-0.015). it may thus not be necessary to resort to extremeassumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. nevertheless, theuncertainties remain large. deeper wfc3/ir+acs observations can furtherconstrain the ionizing flux from galaxies.

(2011). the newer data cover a 3x larger area andprovide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the uv luminosityfunction (lf). if the evolution of the z~4-8 lfs is extrapolated to z~10, sixz~10 galaxies are expected in our data. the detection of only one sourcesuggests that the uv lf evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. theluminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude inonly 170 myr from z~10 to z~8. this increase is &gt;=4x larger than expected fromthe lower redshift extrapolation of the uv lf. we are thus likely witnessingthe first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.future deep hst wfc3/ir data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a morerobust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

1109.0994	uv-continuum slopes at z~4-7 from the hudf09+ers+candels observations:  discovery of a well-defined uv-color magnitude relationship for z&gt;=4  star-forming galaxies	ultra-deep acs and wfc3/ir hudf+hudf09 data, along with the wide-areagoods+ers+candels data over the cdf-s goods field, are used to measure uvcolors, expressed as the uv-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies overa wide range in luminosity (0.1l*(z=3) to 2l*(z=3)) at high redshift (z~7 toz~4). beta is measured using all acs and wfc3/ir passbands uncontaminated byly_alpha and spectral breaks. extensive tests show that our beta measurementsare only subject to minimal biases. using a different selection procedure,dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. toreconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found thatbeta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the samepassbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.high-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame uv color-magnitude (cm)relationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter uv luminosities.no evolution is seen in the slope of the uv cm relationship in the first 1.5gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors fromz~7 to z~4. this suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-definedsequence in the l(uv)-color (beta) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). dustappears to be the principal factor driving changes in the uv color (beta) withluminosity. these new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinctionestimates at z~4-7 and confirm that the extinction is still essentially zero atlow luminosities and high redshifts. inclusion of the new dust extinctionresults leads to (i) excellent agreement between the sfr density at z~4-8 andthat inferred from the stellar mass density, and (ii) to higher ssfrs at z&gt;~4,suggesting the ssfr may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z~4-7 to z~2.

1201.0755	the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z~8: new constraints  from candels data in goods-south	we present new z~8 galaxy candidates from a search over ~95 arcmin^2 ofwfc3/ir data, tripling the previous search area for bright z~8 galaxies. ouranalysis uses newly acquired wfc3/ir imaging data from the candels multi-cycletreasury program over the goods south field. these new data are combined withexisting deep optical acs imaging to search for relatively bright (m_uv &lt; -19.5mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique. these newcandidates are used to determine the bright end of the uv luminosity function(lf) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. to minimize contamination from lowerredshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical acs data and impose strictnon-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. in thewhole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnituderange h_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. the new data show that the uv lf is a factor ~1.7xlower at m_uv &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone.combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ersdata allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 uv lf yet.schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fitcharacteristic magnitude of m*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. the faint-end slope isvery steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. a combination ofwide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required tosignificantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.

1205.0017	a dual narrowband survey for h\alpha\ emitters at z=2.2: demonstration  of the technique and constraints on the h\alpha\ luminosity function	we present first results from a narrowband imaging program for intermediateredshift emission-line galaxies using the newly commissioned fourstar infraredcamera at the 6.5m magellan telescope. to enable prompt identification ofh\alpha\ emitters, a pair of custom 1% filters, which sample low-airglowatmospheric windows at 1.19 \mu m and 2.10 \mu m, is used to detect bothh\alpha\ and [oii]\lambda 3727 emission from the same redshift volume at z=2.2.initial observations are taken over a 130 arcmin^2 area in the candels-cosmosfield. the exquisite image quality resulting from the combination of theinstrument, telescope, and standard site conditions (~0.55" fwhm) allows the1.19 \mu m and 2.10 \mu m data to probe 3\sigma\ emission-line depths down to1.0e-17 erg/s/cm^2 and 1.2e-17 erg/s/cm^2 respectively, in less than 10 hoursof integration time in each narrowband. for h\alpha\ at z=0.8 and z=2.2, thesefluxes correspond to observed star formation rates of ~0.3 and ~4 msun/yrrespectively. we find 122 sources with a 1.19 \mu m excess, and 136 with a 2.10\mu m excess, 41 of which show an excess in both bands. the dual narrowbandtechnique, as implemented here, is estimated to identify about &gt;80% of z=2.2h\alpha\ emitters in the narrowband excess population. with the most securesuch sample obtained to-date, we compute constraints on the faint-end slope ofthe z=2.2 h\alpha\ luminosity function. these "narrow-deep" fourstarobservations have been obtained as part of the larger newh\alpha\ survey, whichwill combine the data with "wide-shallow" imaging through a similar narrowbandfilter pair with newfirm at the kpno/ctio 4m telescopes, to enable study ofboth luminous (but rare) and faint emission-line galaxies in the intermediateredshift universe.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

1211.1010	a rest-frame optical view on z~4 galaxies i: color and age distributions  from deep irac photometry of the iudf10 and goods surveys	we present a study of rest-frame uv-to-optical color distributions for z~4galaxies based on the combination of deep hst/acs+wfc3/ir data withspitzer/irac imaging. in particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the iracultradeep field program (iudf10). our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxiesselected as b-dropout lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the hudf and one of itsdeep parallel fields, the hudf09-2, as well as goods-north and south. thissample is used to investigate the uv continuum slopes beta and balmer breakcolors (j_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. the [4.5]filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame opticalemission lines. we find that galaxies at m_z&lt;-21.5 (roughly corresponding tol*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. theuv continuum slopes and the j_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. the mostsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at theseredshifts is better described by an smc-like extinction curve, rather than thetypically assumed calzetti reddening. after correcting for dust, we find thatthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function ofluminosity. in contrast to some results from the literature, we find that onlya small fraction of galaxies shows balmer break colors which are consistentwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 myr. under the assumption of smoothstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies atm_z&lt;-19.75. our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars anddust in galaxies at z&gt;4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed inshort, intense bursts of star-formation.

1211.2230	a census of star-forming galaxies in the z~9-10 universe based on  hst+spitzer observations over 19 clash clusters: three candidate z~9-10  galaxies and improved constraints on the star formation rate density at z~9	we utilise a two-color lyman-break selection criterion to search for z~9-10galaxies over the first 19 clusters in the clash program. a systematic searchyields three z~9-10 candidates. while we have already reported the most robustof these candidates, macs1149-jd, two additional z~9 candidates are also foundand have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. a careful assessment of varioussources of contamination suggests &lt;~1 contaminants for our z~9-10 selection. todetermine the implications of these search results for the lf and sfr densityat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantitiesin lensing fields. our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing thenumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in clash with the number of galaxiesin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences inselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. this procedure takes advantage of thefact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selectionsbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensingmodels. we find that the normalization of the uv lf at z~9 is just0.28_{-0.20}^{+0.39}\times that at z~8, ~1.4_{-0.8}^{+3.0}x lower thanextrapolating z~4-8 lf results. while consistent with the evolution in the uvlf seen at z~4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z&gt;8.compared to similar evolutionary findings from the hudf, our result is lessinsensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independentsightlines on the high-redshift universe.

1211.3105	photometric constraints on the redshift of z~10 candidate udfj-39546284  from deeper wfc3/ir+acs+irac observations over the hudf	ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations on the hudf from the hudf09 program revealedjust one plausible z~10 candidate udfj-39546284. udfj-39546284 had all theproperties expected of a galaxy at z~10 showing (1) no detection in the deepacs+wfc3 imaging data blueward of the f160w band, exhibiting (2) a bluespectral slope redward of the break, and showing (3) no prominent detection indeep irac observations. the new, similarly deep wfc3/ir hudf12 f160wobservations over the hudf09/xdf allow us to further assess this candidate.these observations show that this candidate, previously only detected at ~5.9sigma in a single band, clearly corresponds to a real source. it is detected at~5.3 sigma in the new h-band data and at ~7.8 sigma in the full 85-orbit h-bandstack. interestingly, the non-detection of the source (&lt;1 sigma) in the newf140w observations suggests a higher redshift. formally, the best-fit redshiftof the source utilizing all the wfc3+acs (and irac+k-band) observations is11.8+/-0.3. however, we consider the z~12 interpretation somewhat unlikely,since the source would either need to be ~20x more luminous than expected orshow very high-ew ly-alpha emission (which seems improbable given the extensiveneutral gas prevalent early in the reionization epoch). lower-redshiftsolutions fail if only continuum models are allowed. plausible lower-redshiftsolutions require that the h-band flux be dominated by line emission such ashalpha or [oiii] with extreme ews. the tentative detection of line emission at1.6 microns in udfj-39546284 in a companion paper suggests that such emissionmay have already been found.

1301.6162	probing the dawn of galaxies at z~9-12: new constraints from hudf12/xdf  and candels data	we present a comprehensive analysis of z&gt;8 galaxies based on ultra-deepwfc3/ir data. we constrain the evolution of the uv luminosity function (lf) andluminosity densities from z~11 to z~8 by exploiting all the wfc3/ir data overthe hubble ultra-deep field from the hudf09 and the new hudf12 program, inaddition to the hudf09 parallel field data, as well as wider area wfc3/irimaging over goods-south. galaxies are selected based on the lyman breaktechnique in three samples centered around z~9, z~10 and z~11, with seven z~9galaxy candidates, and one each at z~10 and z~11. we confirm a new z~10candidate (with z=9.8+-0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our firstz~10 sample. the deeper data over the hudf confirms all our previous z&gt;~7.5candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples tohigher redshift and fainter limits (h_160~29.8 mag). we perform one of thefirst estimates of the z~9 uv lf and improve our previous constraints at z~10.extrapolating the lower redshift uv lf evolution should have revealed 17 z~9and 9 z~10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3x and 9x larger than observed. theinferred star-formation rate density (sfrd) in galaxies above 0.7 m_sun/yrdecreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previousestimates. the low number of sources found at z&gt;8 is consistent with a veryrapid build-up of galaxies across z~10 to z~8. from a combination of allcurrent measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in thesfrd from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). our measurements thusconfirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, andsignify a rapid build-up of galaxies with m_uv&lt;-17.7 within only ~200 myr fromz~10 to z~8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

1304.4227	discovery of lyman break galaxies at z~7 from the zfourge survey	star-forming galaxies at redshifts z&gt;6 are likely responsible for thereionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of thesegalaxies. we present three candidates for z~7 lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) froma 155 arcmin^2 area in the candels/cosmos field imaged by the deep fourstargalaxy evolution (zfourge) survey. the fourstar medium-band filters provide theequivalent of r~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 lbgsand brown dwarf stars. the distinction between stars and galaxies based on anobject's angular size can become unreliable even when using hst imaging; thereexists at least one very compact z~7 candidate (fwhm~0.5-1 kpc) that isindistinguishable from a point source. the medium-band filters provide narrowerredshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. the uvluminosity function derived using the three z~7 candidates is consistent withprevious studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (muv -21.6 mag)from z~7 to z~5. fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, wepredict lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest lbgs, and find thatthe presence of a lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux therebychanging the constraints on stellar masses and uv spectral slopes. thisillustrates the limitations of deriving lbg properties using only broad-bandphotometry. the derived specific star-formation rates for the bright lbgs are~13 per gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity lbgs, implying that thestar-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

1409.1228	first frontier field constraints on the cosmic star-formation rate  density at z~10 - the impact of lensing shear on completeness of  high-redshift galaxy samples	we search the complete hubble frontier field dataset of abell 2744 and itsparallel field for z~10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmicstar-formation rate density (sfrd) at z&gt;8. we independently confirm two imagesof the recently discovered triply-imaged z~9.8 source by zitrin et al. (2014)and set an upper limit for similar z~10 galaxies with red colors ofj_125-h_160&gt;1.2 in the parallel field of abell 2744. we utilize extensivesimulations to derive the effective selection volume of lyman-break galaxies atz~10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field.particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear toaccurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnifiedsources. we show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness ata given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the criticalcurves. these effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on thedetectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantiallyreduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. the detections andlimits from both pointings result in a sfrd which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dexthan previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. nevertheless, thecombination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistentwith a rapidly declining sfrd in the 170 myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted bycosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in lambdacdm. oncebiases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,the full six cluster and parallel frontier field program will be an extremelypowerful new dataset to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z&gt;8before the advent of the jwst.

1509.02167	mean halpha+[nii]+[sii] ew inferred for star-forming galaxies at  z=5.1-5.4 using high-quality spitzer/irac photometry	recent spitzer/infrared array camera (irac) photometric observations haverevealed that rest-frame optical emission lines contribute signficantly to thebroadband fluxes of high-redshift galaxies. specifically, in the narrowredshift range z~5.1-5.4 the [3.6]-[4.5] color is expected to be very red, dueto contamination of the 4.5-micron band by the dominant halpha line, while the3.6-micron filter is free of nebular emission lines. we take advantage of newreductions of deep spitzer/irac imaging over the goods-north+south fields(labbe+2015) to obtain a clean measurement of the mean halpha equivalent widthfrom the [3.6]-[4.5] color in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4. the selectedsources either have measured spectroscopic redshifts (13 sources) or lie veryconfidently in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4 based on the photometric redshiftlikelihood intervals (11 sources). our z_{phot}=5.1-5.4 sample andz_{spec}=5.10-5.40 spectroscopic sample have a mean [3.6]-[4.5] color of0.31+/-0.05 mag and 0.35+/-0.07 mag, implying a rest-frame equivalent widthew(halpha+[nii]+[sii]) of 665+/-53 angstroms and 707+/-74 angstroms,respectively, for sources in these samples. these values are consistent albeitslightly higher than derived by stark+2013 at z~4, suggesting an evolution tohigher values of the halpha+[nii]+[sii] ew at z&gt;2. using the 3.6micron band,which is free of emission line contamination, we perform robust sed fitting andfind a median specific star formation rate of ssfr = 17_{-5}^{+2} gyr^{-1},7_{-2}^{+1}x higher than at z~2. we find no strong correlation (&lt;2sigma)between the halpha+[nii]+[sii] ew and the stellar mass of sources. before theadvent of jwst, improvements in these results will come through an expansion ofcurrent spectroscopic samples and deeper spitzer/irac measurements.

1511.01988	radio galaxies in zfourge/nmbs: no difference in the properties of  massive galaxies with and without radio-agn out to z = 2.25	in order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass-distribution, someprocess must be responsible for the suppression of star-formation in the mostmassive of galaxies. commonly active galactic nuclei (agn) are invoked tofulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic ofmuch debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression andenhancement of star-formation in agn hosts. using the zfourge and nmbs galaxysurveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited(m$_{\odot}$ $\ge$ 10$^{10.5}$ m$_{\odot}$), high-luminosity (l$_{1.4}$ $&gt;$10$^{24}$ w hz$^{-1}$) sample of radio-loud active galactic nuclei to aredshift of z = 2.25. in contrast to low redshift studies, which associateradio-agn activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z $&gt;$ 1.5radio-agn are hosted by star-forming galaxies. indeed, the stellar populationsof radio-agn are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistentwith the non-agn mass-similar galaxy population. interestingly, we find theradio-agn fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 $\le$ z $&lt;$2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-agn duty cycle has little dependence onredshift or galaxy type. we do however see a strong relation between theradio-agn fraction and stellar mass, with radio-agn becoming rare below $\sim$10$^{10.5}$ m$_{\odot}$ or a halo-mass of 10$^{12}$ m$_{\odot}$. this halo-massthreshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-agnfeedback at this mass limit. despite this we find that radio-agn hoststar-formation rates are consistent with the non-agn mass-similar galaxysample, suggesting that while radio-agn are in the right place to suppressstar-formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible fordoing so.

astro-ph;0510186	faint infrared extragalactic survey: data and source catalogue of the  ms1054-03 field	we present deep near-infrared js, h, and ks band imaging of a field aroundms1054-03, a massive cluster at z=0.83. the observations were carried out withisaac at the eso vlt as part of the faint infrared extragalactic survey(fires). the total integration time amounts to 25.9h in js, 24.4h in h, and26.5h in ks, divided nearly equally between four pointings covering 5.5'x5.3'.the 3-sigma total limiting ab magnitudes for point sources from the shallowestto deepest pointing are js=26.0-26.2, h=25.5-25.8, and ks=25.3-25.7. theeffective spatial resolution of the coadded images has fwhm=0.48", 0.46", and0.52" in js, h, and ks. we complemented the isaac data with deep opticalimaging using existing hst wfpc2 mosaics in the f606w and f814w filters and newu, b and v band data from vlt fors1. we constructed a ks-band limitedmulticolour source catalogue to ks(total,ab)=25 (about 5-sigma for pointsources). the catalogue contains 1858 objects, of which 1663 have eight-bandphotometry. we describe the observations, data reduction, source detection andphotometric measurements method. we present the number counts, colourdistributions, and photometric redshifts z_ph of the catalogue sources. we findthat our counts at the faint end 22&lt;ks(ab)&lt;25, with slope dlog(n)/dm=0.20, lieat the flatter end of published counts in other deep fields and are consistentwith those we derived in the hdf-south, the other fires field. spectroscopicredshifts z_sp are available for about 330 sources in the ms1054-03 field;comparison between the z_ph and z_sp shows very good agreement, with&lt;|z_sp-z_ph|/(1+z_sp)&gt;=0.078. the ms1054-03 field observations complement ourhdf-south data set with nearly five times larger area at about 0.7 brightermagnitudes.

astro-ph;0601113	the space density and colors of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3: the  predominance of distant red galaxies	using the deep multi-wavelength musyc, goods, and fires surveys we constructa stellar mass-limited sample of galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3. the sample comprises 294galaxies with m&gt;10^11 solar masses distributed over four independent fieldswith a total area of almost 400 sq arcmin. the mean number density of massivegalaxies in this redshift range is (2.2+-0.6) x 10^-4 mpc^-3. we present medianvalues and 25th and 75th percentiles for the distributions of observed r mags,observed j-k colors, and rest-frame uv continuum slopes, m/l(v) ratios, and u-vcolors. the galaxies show a large range in all these properties. the ``mediangalaxy'' is faint in the observer's optical (r=25.9), red in the observednear-ir (j-k=2.48), has a rest-frame uv spectrum which is relatively flat(beta=-0.4), and rest-frame optical colors resembling those of nearby spiralgalaxies (u-v=0.62). we determine which galaxies would be selected as lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) or distant red galaxies (drgs, having j-k&gt;2.3) in thismass-limited sample. by number drgs make up 69% of the sample and lbgs 20%,with a small amount of overlap. by mass drgs make up 77% and lbgs 17%. neithertechnique provides a representative sample of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3 as theyonly sample the extremes of the population. as we show here, multi-wavelengthsurveys with high quality photometry are essential for an unbiased census ofmassive galaxies in the early universe. the main uncertainty in this analysisis our reliance on photometric redshifts; confirmation of the results presentedhere requires extensive near-infrared spectroscopy of optically-faint samples.

astro-ph;0611245	nicmos imaging of drgs in the hdf-s: a relation between star-formation  and size at z ~ 2.5	we present deep, high angular-resolution hst/nicmos imaging in the hubbledeep field south (hdf-s), focusing on a subset of 14 distant red galaxies(drgs) at z ~ 2.5 galaxies that have been pre-selected to have j-k &gt; 2.3. wefind a clear trend between the rest-frame optical sizes of these sources andtheir luminosity-weighted stellar ages as inferred from their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds). galaxies whose seds are consistent withbeing dusty and actively star forming generally show extended morphologies inthe nicmos images (r_e &gt;~ 2 kpc), while the 5 sources which are not vigorouslyforming stars are extremely compact (r_e &lt;~ 1 kpc). this trend suggests adirect link between the mean ages of the stars and the size and density of thegalaxies and supports the conjecture that early events quench star-formationand leave compact remnants. furthermore, the compact galaxies have stellarsurface mass densities which exceed those of local galaxies by more than anorder of magnitude. the existence of such massive dense galaxies presents aproblem for models of early-type galaxy formation and evolution. larger samplesof drgs and higher spatial resolution imaging will allow us to determine theuniversality of the results presented here for a small sample.
