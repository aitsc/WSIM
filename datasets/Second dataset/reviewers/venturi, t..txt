0905.0588	deep 1.4 ghz follow up of the steep spectrum radio halo in abell 521	in a recent paper we reported on the discovery of a radio halo with verysteep spectrum in the merging galaxy cluster abell 521 through observationswith the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt). we showed that the steepspectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons and supports a turbulent acceleration scenario. at thattime, due to the steep spectrum, the available observations at 1.4 ghz(archival nrao - very large array - vla cnb-configuration data) were notadequate to accurately determine the flux density associated with the radiohalo. in this paper we report the detection at 1.4 ghz of the radio halo inabell 521 using deep vla observations in the d-configuration. we use these newdata to confirm the steep-spectrum of the object. we consider abell 521 theprototype of a population of very-steep spectrum halos. this population ispredicted assuming that turbulence plays an important role in the accelerationof relativistic particles in galaxy clusters, and we expect it will be unveiledby future surveys at low frequencies with the lofar and lwa radio telescopes.

0910.3782	kinematics of the parsec-scale radio jet in 3c48	we present results on the compact steep-spectrum quasar 3c 48 fromobservations with the vlba, merlin and evn at multiple radio frequencies. inthe 1.5-ghz vlbi images, the radio jet is characterized by a series of brightknots. the active nucleus is embedded in the southernmost vlbi component a,which is further resolved into two sub-components a1 and a2 at 4.8 and 8.3 ghz.a1 shows a flat spectrum and a2 shows a steep spectrum. the most stronglypolarized vlbi components are located at component c $\sim$0.25 arcsec north ofthe core. the polarization angles at c show gradual changes across the jetwidth at all observed frequencies, indicative of a gradient in theemission-weighted intrinsic polarization angle across the jet and possibly asystematic gradient in the rotation measure; moreover, the percentage ofpolarization increases near the curvature at c, likely consistent with thepresence of a local jet-ism interaction and/or changing magnetic-fielddirections. the hot spot b shows a higher rotation measure, and has no detectedproper motion. these facts provide some evidence for a stationary shock in thevicinity of b. comparison of the present vlbi observations with those made 8.43years ago suggests a proper motion of $\beta_{app}=3.7\pm0.4 c$ for a2 to thenorth. the apparent superluminal motion suggests that the relativistic jetplasma moves at a velocity of $\gtrsim0.96 c$ if the jet is viewed at aninclination angle less than $20\degr$. a simple precessing jet model and ahydrodynamical isothermal jet model with helical-mode kelvin-helmholtzinstabilities are used to fit the oscillatory jet trajectory of 3c 48 definedby the bright knots.

1306.4379	revisiting scaling relations for giant radio halos in galaxy clusters	many galaxy clusters host megaparsec-scale radio halos, generated byultrarelativistic electrons in the magnetized intracluster medium. correlationsbetween the power of radio halos and the thermal properties of the hostingclusters were established in the last decade, including the connection betweenthe presence of a halo and cluster mergers. the x-ray luminosity and redshiftlimited extended gmrt radio halo survey provides a rich and unique dataset forstatistical studies of the halos. we uniformly analyze the radio and x-ray datafor the gmrt cluster sample, and use the new planck sz catalog, to revisit thecorrelations between the power of halos and the thermal properties of galaxyclusters. we find that the radio power of halos at 1.4 ghz scales with thecluster x-ray (0.1--2.4 kev) luminosity computed within r_500 as p_1.4l_500^2.0. our bigger and more homogenous sample confirms that the x-rayluminous (l_500 &gt; 5x10^44 erg/s) clusters branch into two populations --- radiohalos lie on the correlation, while clusters with upper limits to radio-haloemission are well below that correlation. this bimodality remains if we excisecool cores from the x-ray luminosities. correlating with planck data, we findthat p_1.4 scales with the cluster integrated sz signal within r_500 as p_1.4y_500^2.1, in line with previous findings. however, contrary to previousstudies that were limited by incompleteness and small sample size, we find thatthe "sz-luminous" y_500 &gt; 6x10^-5 mpc^2 clusters show a bimodal behaviorsimilar to that in the radio-x-ray diagram. bimodality of both correlations canbe traced to clusters dynamics, with radio halos found exclusively in mergingclusters. these results confirm the key role of mergers for the origin of giantradio halos, suggesting that they trigger the relativistic particleacceleration.

1309.5286	on the connection between radio and gamma rays. variability and  polarization properties in relativistic jets	relativistic jets are one of the most powerful manifestations of the releaseof energy produced around supermassive black holes at the centre of activegalactic nuclei (agn). their emission is observed across the entireelectromagnetic spectrum, from the radio band to gamma rays. despite decades ofefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. inparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energyemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths areamong the greatest challenges in the study of agn. from the comparison of theradio and gamma-ray light curves of gamma-ray flaring objects, there isevidence that some flares, either in radio or in gamma rays, have not anobvious connection at the other extreme of the electromagnetic spectrum, likein the case of the narrow-line seyfert 1 sbs 0846+513. an intriguing aspectpointed out by high resolution radio observations is the change of thepolarization properties close in time with some high energy flares. inparticular, in pks 1510-089 and 3c 454.3 a rotation of almost 90 degrees hasbeen observed after strong gamma-ray flares. the swing of the polarizationangle may be related either to the propagation of a shock along the jet thatorders the magnetic field, or a change of the opacity regime.

1408.1394	the stripping of a galaxy group diving into the massive cluster a2142	structure formation in the current universe operates through the accretion ofgroup-scale systems onto massive clusters. the detection and study of suchaccreting systems is crucial to understand the build-up of the most massivevirialized structures we see today. we report the discovery with xmm-newton ofan irregular x-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy clusterabell 2142. the tip of the x-ray emission coincides with a concentration ofgalaxies. the bulk of the x-ray emission of this substructure appears to belagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800kpc. the temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 kev, which is a factor of~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma ofa galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13m_sun. for this reason, we interpretthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the maindark-matter halo. the x-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gasstripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through theintracluster medium (icm). this is the longest x-ray trail reported to date.for an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas hasbeen surviving in the presence of the hot icm for at least 600 myr, whichexceeds the spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of &gt;~400.such a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangledmagnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.the long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that theinfalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.

1409.0392	exploring the multiband emission of txs 0536+145: the most distant  gamma-ray flaring blazar	we report results of a multiband monitoring campaign of the flat spectrumradio quasar txs 0536+145 at redshift 2.69. this source was detected during avery high gamma-ray activity state in 2012 march by the large area telescope onboard fermi, becoming the gamma-ray flaring blazar at the highest redshiftdetected so far. at the peak of the flare the source reached an apparentisotropic gamma-ray luminosity of 6.6 x 10^49 erg/s which is comparable to thevalues achieved by the most luminous blazars. this activity triggeredradio-to-x-rays monitoring observations by swift, very long baseline array,european vlbi network, and medicina single-dish telescope. significantvariability was observed from radio to x-rays supporting the identification ofthe gamma-ray source with txs 0536+145. both the radio and gamma-ray lightcurves show a similar behaviour, with the gamma-rays leading the radiovariability with a time lag of about 4-6 months. the luminosity increase isassociated with a flattening of the radio spectrum. no new superluminalcomponent associated with the flare was detected in high resolutionparsec-scale radio images. during the flare the gamma-ray spectrum seems todeviate from a power law, showing a curvature that was not present during theaverage activity state. the gamma-ray properties of txs 0536+145 are consistentwith those shown by the high-redshift gamma-ray blazar population.

0803.4084	gmrt radio halo survey in galaxy clusters at z = 0.2 -- 0.4. ii.the ebcs  clusters and analysis of the complete sample	we present the results of the gmrt cluster radio halo survey. the mainpurposes of our observational project are to measure which fraction of massivegalaxy clusters in the redshift range z=0.2--0.4 hosts a radio halo, and toconstrain the expectations of the particle re--acceleration model for theorigin of the non--thermal radio emission. we selected a complete sample of 50clusters in the x-ray band from the reflex (27) and the ebcs (23) catalogues.in this paper we present giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) observations at610 mhz for all clusters still lacking high sensitivity radio information, i.e.16 ebcs and 7 reflex clusters, thus completing the radio information for thewhole sample. the typical sensitivity in our images is in the range 1$\sigma\sim 35-100 \mu$jy b$^{-1}$. we found a radio halo in a697, a diffuseperipheral source of unclear nature in a781, a core--halo source in z7160, acandidate radio halo in a1682 and ``suspect'' central emission in z2661.including the literature information, a total of 10 clusters in the sample hosta radio halo. a very important result of our work is that 25 out of the 34clusters observed with the gmrt do not host extended central emission at thesensitivity level of our observations, and for 20 of them firm upper limits tothe radio power of a giant radio halo were derived. the gmrt radio halo surveyshows that radio halos are not common, and our findings on the fraction ofgiant radio halos in massive clusters are consistent with the statisticalexpectations based on the re--acceleration model. our results favour primary tosecondary electron models.

0803.4127	shock acceleration as origin of the radio relic in a521?	we present new high sensitivity observations of the radio relic in a521carried out with the giant metrewave radio telescope at 327 mhz and with thevery large array at 4.9 and 8.5 ghz. we imaged the relic at these frequenciesand carried out a detailed spectral analysis, based on the integrated radiospectrum between 235 mhz and 4.9 ghz, and on the spectral index image in thefrequency range 327-610 mhz. to this aim we used the new gmrt observations andother proprietary as well as archival data. we also searched for a possibleshock front co-located with the relic on a short archival chandra x-rayobservation of the cluster. the integrated spectrum of the relic is consistentwith a single power law; the spectral index image shows a clear trend ofsteepening going from the outer portion of the relic toward the cluster centre.we discuss the origin of the source in the light of the theoretical models forthe formation of cluster radio relics. our results on the spectral propertiesof the relic are consistent with acceleration of relativistic electrons by ashock in the intracluster medium. this scenario is further supported by ourfinding of an x-ray surface brightness edge coincident with the outer border ofthe radio relic. this edge is likely a shock front.

0804.1906	a gmrt multifrequency radio study of the isothermal core of the poor  galaxy cluster awm 4	we present a detailed radio morphological study and spectral analysis of thewide-angle-tail radio source 4c +24.36 associated with the dominant galaxy inthe relaxed galaxy cluster awm 4. our study is based on new high sensitivitygmrt observations at 235 mhz, 327 mhz and 610 mhz, and on literature andarchival data at other frequencies. we find that the source major axis islikely oriented at a small angle with respect to the plane of the sky. thewide-angle-tail morphology can be reasonably explained by adopting a simplehydrodynamical model in which both ram pressure (driven by the motion of thehost galaxy) and buoyancy forces contribute to bend the radio structure. thespectral index progressively steepens along the source major axis from $\alpha\sim$0.3 in the region close to the radio nucleus to beyond 1.5 in the lobes.the results of the analysis of the spectral index image allow us to derive anestimate of the radiative age of the source of $\sim$ 160 myr. the clusterx-ray emitting gas has a relaxed morphology and short cooling time, but itstemperature profile is isothermal out to at least 160 kpc from the centre.therefore we seek evidence of energy ejection from the central agn to preventcatastrophic cooling. we find that the energy injected by 4c +24.36 in the formof synchrotron luminosity during its lifetime is far less than the energyrequired to maintain the high gas temperature in the core. we also find that itis not possible for the central source to eject the requisite energy in theintracluster gas in terms of the enthalpy of buoyant bubbles of relativisticfluid, without creating discernible large cavities in the existing x-rayxmm-newton observations.

1412.5940	cluster radio halos at the crossroads between astrophysics and cosmology  in the ska era	giant radio halos (rh) are diffuse, mpc-sized, synchrotron radio sourcesobserved in a fraction of merging galaxy clusters. the current scenario for theorigin of rhs assumes that turbulence generated during cluster mergersre-accelerates pre-existing fossil and/or secondary electrons in theintra-cluster-medium (icm) to the energies necessary to produce the observedradio emission. moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse "off state"halos produced by secondary electrons. in this chapter we use monte carlosimulations, that combine turbulent-acceleration physics and the generation ofsecondaries in the icm, to calculate the occurrence of rhs in the universe,their spectral properties and connection with properties of the hostingclusters. predictions for ska1 surveys are presented at low (100-300 mhz) andmid (1-2 ghz) frequencies assuming the expected sensitivities and spatialresolutions of ska1. ska1 will step into an unexplored territory allowing us tostudy the formation and evolution of rhs in a totally new range of clustermasses and redshift, allowing firm tests of the current theoretical hypothesis.in particular, the combination of ska1-low and sur will allow the discovery of~1000 ultrasteep- spectrum halos and to detect for the very first time "offstate" rhs. we expect that at least ~2500 giant rhs will be discovered byska1-low surveys up to z~0.6. remarkably these surveys will be sensitive to rhsin a cluster mass range (down to ~10^14 solar masses) and redshifts (up to ~1)that are unexplored by current observations. ska1 surveys will be highlycompetitive with present and future sz-surveys in the detection ofhigh-redshift massive objects.

1503.00480	flaring gamma-ray emission from high redshift blazars	high redshift blazars are among the most powerful objects in the universe.although they represent a significant fraction of the extragalactic hard x-raysky, they are not commonly detected in gamma-rays. high redshift (z&gt;2) objectsrepresent &lt;10 per cent of the agn population observed by fermi so far, andgamma-ray flaring activity from these sources is even more uncommon. thecharacterization of the radio-to-gamma-ray properties of high redshift blazarsrepresent a powerful tool for the study of both the energetics of such extremeobjects and the extragalactic background light. we present results of amulti-band campaign on txs 0536+145, which is the highest redshift flaringgamma-ray blazar detected so far. at the peak of the flare the source reachedan apparent isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of 6.6x10^49 erg/s, which iscomparable with the luminosity observed from the most powerful blazars. thephysical properties derived from the multi-wavelength observations are thencompared with those shown by the high redshift population. in additionpreliminary results from the high redshift flaring blazar pks 2149-306 will bediscussed.

astro-ph;0311251	agn and starburst radio activity in the a3558 cluster complex	in this paper we present very large array (vla) 1.4 ghz (21 cm) observationsof the region between the centres of a3558 and a3562, in the majorclustermerger complex of the shapley concentration. our final catalogue includes atotal of 174 radio sources above the flux density limit of 0.25 mjy b$^{-1}$.by cross-correlation with optical and spectroscopic catalogues we found 33optical counterparts belonging to the shapley concentration. we investigatedthe effects of cluster merger on the radio emission properties of the galaxypopulation by means of the radio source counts and the radio luminosityfunctions (rlf). we found that the radio source counts are consistent with thefield source counts.the rlf of elliptical and s0 galaxies in the regionsurveyed here, is consistent with the ``universal'' rlf for early--typegalaxies.this result suggests that the deficit in radio galaxies found inourprevious works over the whole a3558 chain, is entirely due to the clustera3558. a population of faint radio galaxies (logp$_{1.4 ghz}$(w hz$^{-1}$)\ltsim 22) is also found.half of these objects are also blue, suggesting thatstarburst is the main mechanism driving the radio emission. finally, wedetected 14 spiral radio galaxies, whose ratio between radio and opticalemission is similar to those found in galaxies located in rich and dynamicallyevolved clusters. our results are briefly discussed in the light of the age andstage of the merger in the a3558 cluster complex.

astro-ph;0404373	a new sample of large angular size radio galaxies. iii. statistics and  evolution of the grown population	we present in this paper a detailed study of a new sample of large angularsize fr i and fr ii radio galaxies and compare the properties of the twoclasses. as expected, a pure morphology based distinction of fr is and fr iiscorresponds to a break in total radio power. the radio cores in fr is are alsoweaker than in fr iis, although there is not a well defined break power. wefind that asymmetry in the structure of the sample members must be theconsequence of anisotropies in the medium where the lobes expand, withorientation playing a minor role. moreover, literature data and ourobservations at kiloparsec scales suggest that the large differences betweenthe structures of fr i and fr ii radio galaxies must arise from the poorlyknown central kiloparsec region of their host galaxies. we analyze thesub-sample of giant radio galaxies, and do not find evidence that these largeobjects require higher core powers. our results are consistent with giant radiogalaxies being the older population of normal fr i and fr ii objects evolvingin low density environments. comparing results from our sample with predictionsfrom the radio luminosity function we find no evidence of a possible fr ii tofr i evolution. moreover, we conclude that at z~0.1, one out of four fr iiradio sources has a linear size above 500 kpc, thus being in an advanced stageof evolution (for example, older than ~10 myr assuming a jet-head velocity of0.1c). radio activity seems to be a short-lived process in active galaxies,although in some cases recurrent: five objects in our sample present signs ofreactivation in their radio structures.

astro-ph;0505614	spectral properties and origin of the radio halo in a3562	we present a new detailed multiband study of the merging cluster a3562, inthe core of the shapley concentration supercluster. we analyzed new, lowfrequency radio data performed at 240 mhz, 332 mhz and 610 mhz with the giantmetrewave radio telescope (gmrt). the new gmrt data allowed us to carry out adetailed study of the radio halo at the centre of a3562, as well as of thehead--tail radio galaxy j1333--3141 embedded in it, and of the extendedemission around the peripheral cluster galaxy j1332--3146a. thanks to thepresent observations we could derive the integrated spectrum of the radio halowith five data points in the frequency range 240 mhz -- 1.4 ghz. our data showa clear steepening of the total spectrum in this frequency range. furthermore,by comparing the gmrt 332 mhz image with a previously published vla 1.4 ghzimage, we produced an image of the halo spectral index distribution. the imageshows a very complex structure, with an average value of$\alpha^{1.4ghz}_{332mhz} \sim 1.5$ and a number of knots steepening up to$\sim 2$. we performed a combined morphological and statistical analysis usingthe radio images and the quantities derived from xmm--newton and {\it chandra}observations. we discuss our results in the light of particle re--accelerationprocesses in galaxy clusters. in particular, we outline an overall picture,consistent with the available radio and x-ray data, in which the cluster mergerkinematics, the injection of turbulence and b--amplification induced by themerger between a 3562 and sc 1329--313 are jointly taken into account.

astro-ph;0510433	the cluster relic source in a521	we present high sensitivity radio observations of the merging cluster a521,at a mean redsfhit z=0.247. the observations were carried out with the gmrt at610 mhz and cover a region of $\sim$1 square degree, with a sensitivity limitof $1\sigma$ = 35 $\mu$jy b$^{-1}$. the most relevant result of theseobservations is the presence of a radio relic at the cluster periphery, at theedge of a region where group infalling into the main cluster is taking place.thanks to the wealth of information available in the literature in the opticaland x-ray bands, a multi--band study of the relic and its surroundings wasperformed. our analysis is suggestive of a connection between this source andthe complex ongoing merger in the a521 region. the relic might be ``revived'fossil radio plasma through adiabatic compression of the magnetic field orshock re--acceleration due to the merger events. we also briefly discussed thepossibility that this source is the result of induced ram pressure stripping ofradio lobes associated with the nearby cluster radio galaxy j0454--1016a.allowing for the large uncertainties due to the small statistics, the number ofradio emitting early--type galaxies found in a521 is consistent with theexpectations from the standard radio luminosity function for local (z$\le$0.09)cluster ellipticals.

astro-ph;0611704	the vvds-vla deep field: iii. gmrt observations at 610 mhz and the radio  spectral index properties of the sub-mjy population	we present the low frequency (610 mhz) radio source counts of the vvds-vlafield and investigate the radio spectral index properties of the sub-mjypopulation. we use new deep (r.m.s.$\simeq 50$ $\mu$jy/beam) observations ofthe vvds-vla field obtained at 610 mhz with the gmrt and matched in resolution(6 arcsec) with already available vla data at 1.4 ghz on the same field. wefind evidence of a change of the dominant population of radio sources below 0.5mjy (at 1.4 ghz): between 0.15 and 0.5 mjy the median spectral index issignificantly flatter ($\alpha=-0.46\pm 0.03$) than that of brighter sources($\alpha=-0.67\pm 0.05$). a relevant contribution below 0.5 mjy from apopulation of flat spectrum low luminosity compact agns and radio quiet qsoscould explain this effect. at even fainter flux density, between 0.10 and 0.15mjy at 1.4 ghz, the median spectral index steepens again ($\alpha=-0.61\pm0.04$) suggesting that the contribution of starburst galaxies becomes importantbelow $\sim 0.2$ mjy. finally we present a sample of 58 candidate ultra-steepsources with radio flux density from one to two orders of magnitude lower thanany other sample of such objects.

astro-ph;9406037	vlbi observations of a complete sample of radio galaxies. iv-the radio  galaxies ngc2484, 3c109 and 3c382	we present here new vlbi observations of one fr-i radio galaxy (ngc2484) andtwo broad line fr-ii radio galaxies (3c109 and 3c382). for 3c109 new vla mapsare also shown. these sources belong to a complete sample of radio galaxiesunder study for a better knowledge of their structures at parsec resolution.the parsec structure of these 3 objects is very similar: asymmetric emissionwhich we interpret as the core plus a one-sided jet. the parsec scale jet isalways on the same side of the main kpc-scale jet. the limit on the jet tocounterjet brightness ratio, the ratio of the core radio power to the totalradio power and the synchrotron-self compton model allow us to derive someconstraints on the jet velocity and orientation with respect to the line ofsight. from these data and from those published on 2 other sources of oursample, we suggest that parsec scale jets are relativistic in both fr-i andfr-ii radio galaxies and that pc scale properties in fr-i and fr-ii radiogalaxies are very similar despite of the large difference between these twoclasses of radio galaxies on the kpc scale.

astro-ph;9804336	radio properties of the shapley concentration. ii. j1324-3138: a remnant  of a radio galaxy in the abell cluster a3556?	in this paper we present a detailed study of the radio galaxy j1324-3138,located at a projected distance of 2 arcmin from the centre of the abellcluster of galaxies a3556, belonging to the core of the shapley concentration,at an average redshift z=0.05. we have observed j1324-3138 over a wide range offrequencies: at 327 mhz (vla), at 843 mhz (most), and at 1376 mhz, 2382 mhz,4790 mhz and 8640 mhz (atca). our analysis suggests that j1324-3138 is aremnant of a tailed radio galaxy, in which the nuclear engine has switched offand the radio source is now at a late stage of its evolution, confined by theintracluster gas. the radio galaxy is not in pressure equilibrium with theexternal medium, as it is often found for extended radio sources in clusters ofgalaxies. we favour the hypothesis that the lack of observed polarised radioemission in the source is due to faraday rotation by a foreground screen, i.e.the source is seen through a dense cluster gas, characterised by a randommagnetic field. an implication of the head-tail nature of the source is thatj1324-3138 is moving away from the core of a3556 and that possibly a majormerging event between the core of a3556 and the subgroup hosting j1324-3138 hasalready taken place.

astro-ph;9907069	radio observations of merging clusters in the shapley concentration	in this paper we present the first results of a radio survey at 22 cm in thecentral region of the shapley concentration, carried out with the australiatelescope compact array. in order to study the effect of merging on thestatistical properties of radio galaxies, and the relation between merging andthe existence of {\it relic} and {\it halo} type radio sources, we observed thetwo complexes of merging clusters centered on a3528 and on a3558. our resultsshow that the radio source counts in these regions, characterised by very highoptical overdensity and major cluster mergers, do not differ from thebackground source counts. this suggests that the merging phenomenon does notinfluence the probability of a galaxy to become radio surce. furthermore weinvestigated the possibility that the extended radio source j1324-3138 is arelic, applying the model recently proposed by ensslin et al.

0810.4288	a low-frequency radio halo associated with a cluster of galaxies	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in theuniverse, containing about 10^15 solar masses of hot (10^8 k) gas, galaxies anddark matter in a typical volume of about 10 mpc^3. magnetic fields andrelativistic particles are mixed with the gas as revealed by giant radiohaloes, which arise from diffuse, megaparsec-scale synchrotron radiation atcluster center. radio haloes require that the emitting electrons areaccelerated in situ (by turbulence), or are injected (as secondary particles)by proton collisions into the intergalactic medium. they are found only in afraction of massive clusters that have complex dynamics, which suggests aconnection between these mechanisms and cluster mergers. here we report a radiohalo at low frequencies associated with the merging cluster abell 521. thishalo has an extremely steep radio spectrum, which implies a high frequencycut-off; this makes the halo difficult to detect with observations at 1.4 ghz(the frequency at which all other known radio haloes have been best studied).the spectrum of the halo is inconsistent with a secondary origin of therelativistic electrons, but instead supports turbulent acceleration, whichsuggests that many radio haloes in the universe should emit mainly at lowfrequencies.
