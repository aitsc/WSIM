0905.3309	infrared identification of igr j09026-4812 as a seyfert 1 galaxy	igr j09026-4812 was discovered by integral in 2006 as a new hard x-raysource. thereafter, an observation with chandra pinpointed a single x-raysource within the isgri error circle, showing a hard spectrum, and improvingits high-energy localisation to a subarcsecond accuracy. thus, the x-ray sourcewas associated to the infrared counterpart 2mass j09023731-4813339 whose jhksphotometry indicated a highly reddened source. the high-energy properties andthe counterpart photometry suggested a high-mass x-ray binary with a mainsequence companion star located 6.3-8.1 kpc away and with a 0.3-10 kevluminosity of 8e34 erg/s. new optical and infrared observations were needed toconfirm the counterpart and to reveal the nature of igr j09026-4812. weperformed optical and near infrared observations on the counterpart 2massj09023731-4813339 with the eso/ntt telescope on march 2007. we achievedphotometry and spectroscopy in near infrared wavelengths and photometry inoptical wavelengths. the accurate astrometry at both optical and near infraredwavelengths confirmed 2mass j09023731-4813339 to be the counterpart of igrj09026-4812. however, the near infrared images show that the source isextended, thus excluding any galactic compact source possibility. the sourcespectrum shows three main emission lines identified as the hei lambda 1.0830micron line, and the hi pa_beta and pa_alpha lines, typical in galaxies with anactive galactic nucleus. the broadness of these lines reached values as largeas 4000 km/s pointing towards a type 1 seyfert galaxy. the redshift of thesource is z=0.0391(4). thus, the near infrared photometry and spectroscopyallowed us to classify igr j09026-4812 as a seyfert galaxy of type 1.

0909.3283	the infrared/x-ray correlation of gx 339-4: probing hard x-ray emission  in accreting black holes	gx 339-4 has been one of the key sources for unravelling the accretionejection coupling in accreting stellar mass black holes. after a long period ofquiescence between 1999 and 2002, gx 339-4 underwent a series of 4 outburststhat have been intensively observed by many ground based observatories [radio,infrared(ir), optical] and satellites (x-rays). here, we present results ofthese broad-band observational campaigns, focusing on the optical-ir(oir)/x-ray flux correlations over the four outbursts. we found tight oir/x-raycorrelations over four decades with the presence of a break in the ir/x-raycorrelation in the hard state. this correlation is the same for all fouroutbursts. this can be interpreted in a consistent way by considering asynchrotron self-compton origin of the x-rays in which the break frequencyvaries between the optically thick and thin regime of the jet spectrum. we alsohighlight the similarities and differences between optical/x-ray and ir/x-raycorrelations which suggest a jet origin of the near-ir emission in the hardstate while the optical is more likely dominated by the blackbody emission ofthe accretion disc in both hard and soft state. however we find a nonnegligible contribution of 40 per cent of the jet emission in the v-band duringthe hard state.  we finally concentrate on a soft-to-hard state transition during the decay ofthe 2004 outburst by comparing the radio, ir, optical and hard x-rays lightcurves. it appears that unusual delays between the peak of emission in thedifferent energy domains may provide some important constraints on jetformation scenario.

0910.3074	discovery of a highly energetic pulsar associated with igr j14003-6326  in a young uncataloged galactic supernova remnant g310.6-1.6	we report the discovery of 31.18 ms pulsations from the integral source igrj14003-6326 using the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). this pulsar is mostlikely associated with the bright chandra x-ray point source lying at thecenter of g310.6-1.6, a previously unrecognised galactic composite supernovaremnant with a bright central non-thermal radio and x-ray nebula, taken to bethe pulsar wind nebula (pwn). psr j1400-6325 is amongst the most energeticrotation-powered pulsars in the galaxy, with a spin-down luminosity of edot =5.1e+37 erg.s-1. in the rotating dipole model, the surface dipole magneticfield strength is b_s = 1.1e+12 g and the characteristic age tau_c = p/2pdot =12.7 kyr. the high spin-down power is consistent with the hard spectral indicesof the pulsar and the nebula of 1.22 +/- 0.15 and 1.83 +/- 0.08, respectively,and a 2-10 kev flux ratio f_pwn/f_psr ~ 8. follow-up parkes observationsresulted in the detection of radio emission at 10 and 20 cm from psr j1400-6325at a dispersion measure of ~ 560 cm-3 pc, which implies a relatively largedistance of 10 +/- 3 kpc. however, the resulting location off the galacticplane of ~ 280 pc would be much larger than the typical thickness of themolecular disk, and we argue that g310.6-1.6 lies at a distance of ~ 7 kpc.there is no gamma-ray counterpart to the nebula or pulsar in the fermi datapublished so far. a multi-wavelength study of this new composite supernovaremnant, from radio to very-high energy gamma-rays, suggests a young (&lt; 1000yr) system, formed by a sub-energetic (~ 1e+50 ergs), low ejecta mass (m_ej ~ 3msun) sn explosion that occurred in a low-density environment (n_0 ~ 0.01cm-3).

1012.0855	suzaku observes weak flares from igr j17391-3021 representing a common  low-activity state in this sfxt	we present an analysis of a 37-ks observation of the supergiant fast x-raytransient (sfxt) igr j17391-3021 (=xte j1739-302) gathered with suzaku. thesource evolved from quiescence to a low-activity level culminating in threeweak flares lasting ~3 ks each in which the peak luminosity is only a factor of5 times that of the pre-flare luminosity. the minimum observed luminosity was1.3x10^33 erg/s (d/2.7 kpc)^2 in the 0.5--10 kev range. the weak flares areaccompanied by significant changes in the spectral parameters including acolumn density (nh = (4.1+-0.5)x10^22 /cm^2) that is ~2--9 times the absorptionmeasured during quiescence. accretion of obscuring clumps of stellar windmaterial can explain both the small flares and the increase in nh. placing thisobservation in the context of the recent swift monitoring campaign, we findthat weak-flaring episodes, or at least epochs of enhanced activity just abovethe quiescent level but well below the moderately bright or high-luminosityoutbursts, represent more than 60+-5% of all observations in the 0.5--10kevenergy range making this the most common state in the emission behavior of igrj17391-3021

1202.3984	optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the black hole gx 339-4: i. a  focus on the continuum in the low/hard and high/soft states	the microquasar gx 339-4, known to exhibit powerful compact jets thatdominate its radio to near-infrared emission, entered an outburst in 2010 forthe fifth time in about fifteen years. an extensive radio to x-raymulti-wavelength campaign was immediately triggered, and we report here oneso/fors2+isaac optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, supportedby atca radio and rxte/swift x-ray quasi-simultaneous data. gx 339-4 wasobserved at three different epochs, once in the soft state and twice in thehard state. in the soft state, the optical and near-infrared continuum islargely consistent with the raleigh-jeans tail of a thermal process. as anexplanation, we favour irradiation of the outer accretion disc by its innerregions, enhanced by disc warping. an excess is also present at lowfrequencies, likely due to a m subgiant companion star. during the first hardstate, the optical/near-infrared continuum is well-described by the opticallythin synchrotron emission of the compact jet combined with disc irradiation andperhaps another component peaking in the ultraviolet. the spectral break wherethe jet transits from the optically thick to thin regimes, located below1.20e14 hz, is not detected and the extension of the optically thin synchrotronis consistent with the 3-50 kev spectrum. in contrast, the emission during thesecond hard state is more difficult to understand and points toward a morecomplex jet continuum. in both cases, the near-infrared continuum is found tobe variable at timescales at least as short as 20 s, although thesevariabilities are smoothed out beyond a few hundred seconds. this implies rapidvariations - in flux and frequency - of the location of the spectral break,i.e. dramatic short timescale changes of the physical conditions at the base ofthe jet, such as the magnetic field and/or the base radius.

1302.1702	the supergiant fast x-ray transient with the shortest orbital period:  suzaku observes one orbit in igrj16479-4514	the eclipsing hard x-ray source igr j16479-4514 is the supergiant fast x-raytransient (sfxt) with the shortest orbital period (3.32 days). this allowed usto perform a 250 ks long x-ray observation with suzaku in 2012 february,covering most of its orbit, including the eclipse egress. outside the eclipse,the source luminosity is around a few 1e34erg/s. the x-ray spectrum can be fitwith an absorbed power law together with a neutral iron emission line at 6.4kev. the column density is constant at 1e23 cm-2 outside the x-ray eclipse.during the eclipse it is lower, consistent with a scattering origin for the lowx-ray emission during the eclipse by the supergiant companion wind. thescattered x-ray emission during the x-ray eclipse is used to directly probe thedensity of the companion wind at the orbital separation, resulting in 7e-14g/cm3, which translates into a ratio mdot_w/v_terminal = 7e-17 solar masses/kmof the wind mass loss rate to the wind terminal velocity. this ratio, assumingreasonable terminal velocities in the range 500-3000 km/s, translates into anaccretion luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than that observed. weconclude that a mechanism reducing the accretion rate onto the compact objectis at work, likely due to the neutron star magnetosphere.

1303.1198	long term variability of cygnus x-1 v. state definitions with all sky  monitors	we present a scheme to determine the spectral state of the canonical blackhole cyg x-1 using data from previous and current x-ray all sky monitors(rxte-asm, swift-bat, maxi, and fermi-gbm). state determinations of thehard/intermediate and soft state agree to better than 10% between differentmonitors, facilitating the determination of the state and its context for anyobservation of the source, potentially over the lifetimes of differentindividual monitors. a separation of the hard and the intermediate state, whichstrongly differ in their spectral shape and short-term timing behavior, is onlypossible when monitor data in the soft x-rays (&lt;5 kev) are available. astatistical analysis of the states confirms the different activity patterns ofthe source (e.g., months to years long hard state periods or phases duringwhich numerous transitions occurs). it also shows the hard and soft states tobe stable, with the probability of cyg x-1 remaining in a given state for atleast one week to be larger than 85% for the hard state and larger than 75%,for the soft state. intermediate states are short lived, with a probability of50% that the source leaves the intermediate state within three days. a reliabledetection of these potentially short-lived events is only possible with monitordata with a time resolution of better than 1 d.

1304.6336	multiwavelength observations of the black hole transient xte j1752-223  during its 2010 outburst decay	galactic black hole transients show many interesting phenomena duringoutburst decays. we present simultaneous x-ray (rxte, swift, and integral), andoptical/near-infrared (o/nir) observations (smarts) of the x-ray transient xtej1752-223 during its outburst decay in 2010. the multiwavelength observationsover 150 days in 2010 cover the transition from soft to hard spectral state. wediscuss the evolution of radio emission is with respect to the o/nir lightcurve which shows several flares. one of those flares is bright and long,starting about 60 days after the transition in x-ray timing properties. duringthis flare, the radio spectral index becomes harder. other smaller flares occuralong with the x-ray timing transition, and also right after the detection ofthe radio core. we discuss the significances of these flares. furthermore,using the simultaneous broadband x-ray spectra including integral, we find thata high energy cut-off with a folding energy near 250 kev is necessary aroundthe time that the compact jet is forming. the broad band spectrum can be fittedequally well with a comptonization model. in addition, using photoelectricabsorption edges in the xmm-newton rgs x-ray spectra and the extinction of redclump giants in the direction of the source, we find a lower limit on thedistance of &gt; 5 kpc.

1308.4669	nustar spectroscopy of grs 1915+105: disk reflection, spin, and  connections to jets	we report on the results of spectral fits made to a nustar observation of theblack hole grs 1915+105 in a "plateau" state. this state is of special interestbecause it is similar to the "low/hard" state seen in other black holes,especially in that compact, steady jets are launched in this phase. the 3-79kev bandpass of nustar, and its ability to obtain moderate-resolution spectrafree from distortions such as photon pile-up, are extremely well suited tostudies of disk reflection in x-ray binaries. in only 15 ks of net exposure, anextraordinarily sensitive spectrum of grs 1915+105 was measured across the fullbandpass. ionized reflection from a disk around a rapidly-spinning black holeis clearly required to fit the spectra; even hybrid comptonization modelsincluding ionized reflection from a disk around a schwarzschild black holeproved inadequate. a spin parameter of a = 0.98 +/- 0.01 (1-sigma statisticalerror) is measured via the best-fit model; low spins are ruled out at a highlevel of confidence. this result suggests that jets can be launched from a diskextending to the innermost stable circular orbit. a very steep inner diskemissivity profile is also measured, consistent with models of compact coronaeabove kerr black holes. these results support an emerging association betweenthe hard x-ray corona and the base of the relativistic jet.

1310.5776	constraints on the neutron star and inner accretion flow in serpens x-1  using nustar	we report on an observation of the neutron star low-mass x-ray binary serpensx-1, made with nustar. the extraordinary sensitivity afforded by nustarfacilitated the detection of a clear, robust, relativistic fe k emission linefrom the inner disk. a relativistic profile is required over a single gaussianline from any charge state of fe at the 5-sigma level of confidence, and anytwo gaussians of equal width at the same confidence. the comptonback-scattering "hump" peaking in the 10-20 kev band is detected for the firsttime in a neutron star x-ray binary. fits with relativistically-blurred diskreflection models suggest that the disk likely extends close to the innermoststable circular orbit (isco) or stellar surface. the best-fit blurredreflection models constrain the gravitational redshift from the stellar surfaceto be z &gt; 0.16. the data are broadly compatible with the disk extending to theisco; in that case, z &gt; 0.22 and r &lt; 12.6 km (assuming m = 1.4 msun and a=0,where a = cj/gm^2). if the star is as large or larger than its isco, or if theeffective reflecting disk leaks across the isco to the surface, the redshiftconstraints become measurements. we discuss our results in the context ofefforts to measure fundamental properties of neutron stars, and models foraccretion onto compact objects.

(c) the coherence betweenenergy bands drops during transitions from the intermediate into the soft statebut recovers in the soft state.

1505.02788	distorted cyclotron line profile in cep x-4 as observed by nustar	we present spectral analysis of nustar and swift observations of cep x-4during its outburst in 2014. we observed the source once during the peak of theoutburst and once during the decay, finding good agreement in the spectralshape between the observations. we describe the continuum using a powerlaw witha fermi-dirac cutoff at high energies. cep x-4 has a very strong cyclotronresonant scattering feature (crsf) around 30 kev. a simple absorption-like linewith a gaussian optical depth or a pseudo-lorentzian profile both fail todescribe the shape of the crsf accurately, leaving significant deviations atthe red side of the line. we characterize this asymmetry with a secondabsorption feature around 19 kev. the line energy of the crsf, which is notinfluenced by the addition of this feature, shows a small but significantpositive luminosity dependence. with luminosities between (1-6)e36 erg/s, cepx-4 is below the theoretical limit where such a correlation is expected. thisbehavior is similar to vela x-1 and we discuss parallels between the twosystems.

(2014) tosimultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronalheight in a self-consistent manner. detailed fits to the iron line profileindicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and alow source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitationalradii at the 3{\sigma} confidence level. in addition, we find that the lineprofile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, andthat the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflectionspectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. we find that the blurringparameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line or the entirebroad-band spectrum, which is well modelled with a comptonized continuum plusreflection model.

1506.01381	the complex accretion geometry of gx 339-4 as seen by nustar and swift	we present spectral analysis of five nustar and swift observations of gx339-4 taken during a failed outburst in summer 2013. these observations covereddington luminosity fractions in the range ~0.9-6%. throughout this outburst,gx 339-4 stayed in the hard state, and all five observations show similar x-rayspectra with a hard power-law with a photon index near 1.6 and significantcontribution from reflection. using simple reflection models we findunrealistically high iron abundances. allowing for different photon indices forthe continuum incident on the reflector relative to the underlying observedcontinuum results in a statistically better fit and reduced iron abundances.with a photon index around 1.3, the input power-law on the reflector issignificantly harder than that which is directly observed. we study theinfluence of different emissivity profiles and geometries and consistently findan improvement when using separate photon indices. the inferred inner accretiondisk radius is strongly model dependent, but we do not find evidence for atruncation radius larger than 100 r_g in any model. the data do not allowindependent spin constraints but the results are consistent with the literature(i.e., a&gt;0). our best-fit models indicate an inclination angle in the range40-60 degrees, consistent with limits on the orbital inclination but higherthan reported in the literature using standard reflection models. the iron linearound 6.4 kev is clearly broadened, and we detect a superimposed narrow coreas well. this core originates from a fluorescence region outside the influenceof the strong gravity of the black hole and we discuss possible geometries.

astro-ph;0304139	an xmm observation of igr j16320-4751=ax j1631.9-4752	the hard x-ray sensitivity and arcminute position accuracy of the recentlylaunched international gamma-ray laboratory (integral) has lead to the(re-)discovery of a class of heavily absorbed hard x-ray sources lying in thegalactic plane. we report on the analysis of an xmm observation of such asource igr j16320-4751 = ax j1631.9-4752. our analysis allowed us to obtain themost accurate x-ray position to date (rodriguez et al. 2003), and to identify alikely infrared counterpart (tomsick et al. 2003). we present the detailedanalysis of the igr j1632-4751 xmm spectra. the pn spectrum can be wellrepresented by a single powerlaw or a comptonized spectrum with a highequivalent absorption column density of ~ 2 x10^{23} cm^{-2}. the currentanalysis and the comparison with the properties of other sources favor thepossibility that the source is a galactic x-ray binary (xrb). theidentification of two candidate ir counterparts is in good agreement with thisidentification. the hard spectrum previously seen with asca, and the brightnessof the candidate counterparts indicate that igr j1632-4751 is most probably ahighly absorbed high mass x-ray binary, hosting a neutron star.

astro-ph;0306227	spectral evolution of the microquasar xte j1550-564 over its entire 2000  outburst	we report on rxte observations of the microquasar xte j1550-564 during a ~70day outburst in april-june 2000. we study the evolution of the pca+hextespectra over the outburst. the source transited from an initial low hard state(ls), to an intermediate state (is), and then back to the ls. the source showsan hysteresis effect similar to what is observed in other sources, favoring acommon origin for the state transitions in soft x-ray transients. the firsttransition occurs at a ~ constant 2-200 kev flux, which probably indicates achange in the relative importance of the emitting media. the second transitionis more likely driven by a drop in the mass accretion rate.  in both ls, the spectra are characterized by the presence of a strongpower-law tail (compton corona) with a variable high energy cut-off. during theis, the spectra show the presence of a ~0.8 kev thermal component (accretiondisk). we discuss the apparently independent evolution of the two media, andshow that right after the x-ray maximum on mjd 51662, the decrease of thesource luminosity is due to a decrease of the power-law luminosity, at aconstant disk luminosity. this, together with the detection of radio emission(with a spectrum typical of optically thin synchrotron emission), may suggestthat the corona is ejected and further detected as a discrete radio ejection.

astro-ph;0307394	chandra/hetgs spectroscopy of the galactic black hole gx 339-4: a  relativistic iron line and evidence for a seyfert-like warm absorber	we observed the galactic black hole gx 339-4 with the chandra high energytransmission grating spectrometer (hetgs) for 75 ksec during the decline of its2002-2003 outburst. the sensitivity of this observation provides anunprecedented glimpse of a galactic black hole at about a tenth of theluminosity of the outburst peak. the continuum spectrum is well described by amodel consisting of multicolor disk blackbody (kt = 0.6 kev) and power-law(gamma = 2.5) components. x-ray reflection models yield improved fits. astrong, relativistic fe k-alpha emission line is revealed, indicating that theinner disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. the breadth of theline is sufficient to suggest that gx 339-4 may harbor a black hole withsignificant angular momentum. absorption lines from h-like and he-like o, andhe-like ne and mg are detected, as well as lines which are likely due to ne iiand ne iii. the measured line properties make it difficult to associate theabsorption with the coronal phase of the interstellar medium. a scenariowherein the absorption lines are due to an intrinsic agn-like warm-absorbergeometry -- perhaps produced by a disk wind in an extended disk-dominated state-- may be more viable. we compare our results to chandra observations of thegalactic black hole candidate xte j1650-500, and discuss our findings in termsof prominent models for galactic black hole accretion flows and connections tosupermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0309799	a close look at the state transitions of galactic black hole transients  during outburst decay	we characterize the evolution of spectral and temporal properties of severalgalactic black hole transients during outburst decay using the data from wellsampled pca/\rxte observations close to the transition to the low/hard state.we find several global patterns of evolution for spectral and temporalparameters before, during, and after the transition. we show that the changesin temporal properties (sudden increase or decrease in the rms amplitude ofvariability) are much sharper than the changes in the spectral properties, andit is much easier to identify a state transition with the temporal properties.  the spectral index shows a drop 3-5 days before the transition for some ofour sources. the ratio of the power-law flux to the total flux in the 3-25 kevband increases close to the transition, which may mean that the system must bedominated by the coronal emission for the transition to occur. we also showthat the power-law flux shows a sharp change along with the temporal propertiesduring the transitions which may indicate a threshold transition volume for thecorona. the evolution of the spectral and temporal properties after thetransition is consistent with the idea that the inner accretion disk moves awayfrom the black hole. based on the evolution of spectral and temporal parametersand changes during the transitions, we discuss possible scenarios of how thetransition is happening.

astro-ph;0405398	an x-ray timing study of xte j1550--564: evolution of the low frequency  qpo for the complete 2000 outburst	we report on rxte observations of the microquasar xte j1550 during a ~70 dayoutburst in april-june 2000. we focus here on the temporal properties of thesource and study the behavior of low frequency (0.1-10 hz) quasi periodicoscillations (lfqpo), which seem to be of different types. we focus on theso-called type c (according to the classification of remillard andcollaborators), which corresponds to a strong 0.1-6 hz lfqpo, found to bepresent during at least 17 observations. we find that the frequency of the qpois better correlated with the soft x-ray (&lt; 7 kev) flux than with the hard flux(&gt; 7 kev). if soft x-rays represent the behavior of an accretion disk, therelation shows that the disk may set the lfqpo frequency. in two cases, theidentification of the type of qpo is not straightforward. if the qpos in thosetwo cases are type a (or b), then we may be seeing the qpo type alternatebetween type c and type a (or b), and this may represent some rapid changes inthe physical properties of the accretion flow, before the system stabilizes andslowly decays toward the end of the outburst. on the other hand, if all theqpos are of type c, we may be observing an inversion in the frequency vs. fluxrelation, similar to that seen in gro j1655-40. we discuss the qpo behavior inthe framework of theoretical models.

astro-ph;0409092	multi-wavelength observations of the galactic black hole transient  4u1543-47 during outburst decay: state transitions and jet contribution	multiwavelength observations of galactic black hole (gbh) transients duringthe state transitions and in the low/hard state may provide detailedinformation on the accretion structure of these systems. 4u1543-47 is a gbhtransient that was covered exceptionally well in x-ray and infrared (dailyobservations) and reasonably well in optical and radio during its outburstdecay in 2002. when all the available information is gathered in theintermediate and the low/hard state, 4u1543-47 makes an important contributionto our understanding of state transitions and the role of outflows on the highenergy emission properties of black hole binaries. the evolution of the x-rayspectral and temporal properties and the ir light curve place strongconstraints on different models for explaining the overall emission fromaccreting black holes. the overall spectral energy distribution is consistentwith synchrotron origin for the optical and infrared emission, however, thex-ray flux is above the power-law continuation of the optical and infraredflux. the infrared light curve, the hexte light curve and the evolution of thex-ray photon index indicate that the major source of hard x-rays cannot bedirect synchrotron radiation from an acceleration region in a jet for most ofthe outburst decay.

astro-ph;0409154	on the origin of radio emission in the x-ray states of xte j1650-500  during the 2001-2002 outburst	we report on simultaneous radio and x-ray observations of the black holecandidate xte j1650-500 during the course of its 2001-2002 outburst. thescheduling of the observations allowed us to sample the properties of xtej1650-50 in different x-ray spectral states, namely the hard state, the steeppower-law state and the thermal dominant state, according to the recentspectral classification of mcclintock &amp; remillard. the hard state is consistentwith a compact jet dominating the spectral energy distribution at radiofrequencies; however, the current data suggest that its contribution as directsynchrotron emission at higher energies may not be significant. in that case,xte j1650-50 may be dominated by compton processes (either inversecomptonization of thermal disk photons and/or ssc from the base of the compactjet) in the x-ray regime. we, surprisingly, detect a faint level of radioemission in the thermal dominant state that may be consistent with the emissionof previously ejected material interacting with the interstellar medium,similar (but on a smaller angular scale) to what was observed in xte j1550-564by corbel and co-workers. based on the properties of radio emission in thesteep power-law state of xte j1650-50, and taking into account the behavior ofother black hole candidates (namely gx 339-4, xte j1550-564, and xte j1859+226)while in the intermediate and steep power-law states, we are able to present ageneral pattern of behavior for the origin of radio emission in these twostates that could be important for understanding the accretion-ejectioncoupling very close to the black hole event horizon.

astro-ph;0505526	discovery of x-ray jets in the microquasar h 1743-322	we report on the formation and evolution of two large-scale,synchrotron-emitting jets from the black hole candidate h 1743-322 followingits reactivation in 2003. in november 2003 after the end of its 2003 outburst,we noticed, in observations with the australia telescope compact array, thepresence of a new and variable radio source about 4.6" to the east of h1743-322, that was later found to move away from h 1743-322. in february 2004,we detected a radio source to the west of h 1743-322, symmetrically placedrelative to the eastern jet. in 2004, follow-up x-ray observations with {\emchandra} led to the discovery of x-ray emission associated with the two radiosources. this likely indicates that we are witnessing the interaction ofrelativistic jets from h 1743-322 with the interstellar medium causing in-situparticle acceleration. the spectral energy distribution of the jets during thedecay phase is consistent with a classical synchrotron spectrum of a singleelectron distribution from radio up to x-rays, implying the production of veryhigh energy ($&gt;$ 10 tev) particles in those jets. we discuss the jetkinematics, highlighting the presence of a significantly relativistic flow in h1743-322 almost a year after the ejection event.

astro-ph;0509870	on the origin of black hole x-ray emission in quiescence: chandra  observations of xte j1550-564 and h 1743-322	we report the results of observations of the black hole binaries xtej1550-564 and h 1743-322 in their quiescent state using the chandra x-rayobservatory. both sources are detected at their faintest level of x-rayemission ever observed with a 0.5-10 kev unabsorbed luminosity of 2 $\times$10$^{32}$ (d/5 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for xte j1550-564 and 9 $\times$ 10$^{31}$(d/8 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ for h 1743-322. these luminosities are in the upperrange compared to the faintest levels observed in other black hole systems,possibly related to residual accretion for these sources with frequentoutbursts. for xte j1550-564, the chandra observations also constrain the x-rayspectrum as a fit with an absorbed power-law model yields a photon index of2.25 $\pm$ 0.08, clearly indicating a softening of the x-ray spectrum at lowerluminosities compared to the standard hard state. similar softening at lowluminosity is seen for several black hole transients with orbital periods lessthan 60 hours. most of the current models of accreting black holes are able toreproduce such softening in quiescence. in contrast, we find that systems withorbital periods longer than 60 hours appear to have hard spectra in quiescenceand their behaviour may be consistent with hardening in quiescence.

astro-ph;0512387	the galactic black hole transient h1743-322 during outburst decay:  connections between timing noise, state transitions and radio emission	multi-wavelength observations of galactic black hole transients duringoutburst decay are instrumental for our understanding of the accretion geometryand the formation of outflows around black hole systems. h1743-322, a blackhole transient observed intensely in x-rays and also covered in the radio bandduring its 2003 decay, provides clues about the changes in accretion geometryduring state transitions and also the general properties of x-ray emissionduring the intermediate and the low-hard states. in this work, we report on theevolution of spectral and temporal properties in x-rays and the flux in theradio band with the goal of understanding the nature of state transitionsobserved in this source. we concentrate on the transition from the thermaldominant state to the intermediate state that occurs on a timescale of one day.we show that the state transition is associated with a sudden increase inpower-law flux. we determine that the ratio of the power-law flux to theoverall flux in the 3--25 kev band must exceed 0.6 to observe strong timingnoise. even after the state transition, once this ratio was below 0.6, thesystem transited back to the thermal dominant state for a day. we show that theemission from the compact radio core does not turn on during the transitionfrom the thermal dominant state to the intermediate state but does turn on whenthe source reaches the low-hard state, as seen in 4u 1543-47 and gx 339-4. wefind that the photon index correlates strongly with the qpo frequency andanti-correlates with the rms amplitude of variability. we also show that thevariability is more likely to be associated with the power-law emission thanthe disk emission.
