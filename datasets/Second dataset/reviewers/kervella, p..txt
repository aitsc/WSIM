0905.4540	high resolution spectroscopy for cepheids distance determination. v.  impact of the cross-correlation method on the p-factor and the  gamma-velocities	the cross correlation method (hereafter cc) is widely used to derive theradial velocity curve of cepheids when the signal to noise of the spectra islow. however, if it is used with the wrong projection factor, it mightintroduce some biases in the baade-wesselink (hereafter bw) methods ofdetermining the distance of cepheids. in addition, it might affect the averagevalue of the radial velocity curve (or gamma-velocity) important for galacticstructure studies. we aim to derive a period-projection factor relation(hereafter pp) appropriate to be used together with the cc method. moreover, weinvestigate whether the cc method can explain the misunderstood previouscalculation of the k-term of cepheids. we observed eight galactic cepheids withthe harps spectrograph. for each star, we derive an interpolated cc radialvelocity curve using the harps pipeline. the amplitudes of these curves areused to determine the correction to be applied to the semi-theoreticalprojection factor derived in nardetto et al. (2007). their average value (orgamma-velocity) are also compared to the center-of-mass velocities derived innardetto et al. (2008). the correction in amplitudes allows us to derive a newpp relation: p = [-0.08+-0.05] log p +[1.31+-0.06]. we also find a negligiblewavelength dependence (over the optical range) of the pp relation. we finallyshow that the gamma-velocity derived from the cc method is systematicallyblue-shifted by about 1.0 +- 0.2km/s compared to the center-of-mass velocity ofthe star. an additional blue-shift of 1.0km/s is thus needed to totally explainthe previous calculation of the k-term of cepheids (around 2km/s). the new pprelation we derived is a solid tool for the distance scale calibration(abridged).

0906.3386	asteroseismology and interferometry of the red giant star epsilon oph	the giii red giant star epsilon oph has been found to exhibit several modesof oscillation by the most mission. we interpret the observed frequencies ofoscillation in terms of theoretical radial p-mode frequencies of stellarmodels. evolutionary models of this star, in both shell h-burning and corehe-burning phases of evolution, are constructed using as constraints acombination of measurements from classical ground-based observations (forluminosity, temperature, and chemical composition) and seismic observationsfrom most. radial frequencies of models in either evolutionary phase canreproduce the observed frequency spectrum of epsilon oph almost equally well.the best-fit models indicate a mass in the range of 1.85 +/- 0.05 msun withradius of 10.55 +/- 0.15 rsun. we also obtain an independent estimate of theradius of epsilon oph using high accuracy interferometric observations in theinfrared k' band, using the chara/fluor instrument. the measured limb darkeneddisk angular diameter of epsilon oph is 2.961 +/- 0.007 mas. together with thehipparcos parallax, this translates into a photospheric radius of 10.39 +/-0.07 rsun. the radius obtained from the asteroseismic analysis matches theinterferometric value quite closely even though the radius was not constrainedduring the modelling.

0912.3215	the radius and effective temperature of the binary ap star beta crb from  chara/fluor and vlt/naco observations	the prospects for using asteroseismology of rapidly oscillating ap (roap)stars are hampered by the large uncertainty in fundamental stellar parameters.results in the literature for the effective temperature (teff) often span arange of 1000 k. our goal is to reduce systematic errors and improve the teffcalibration of ap stars based on new interferometric measurements. we obtainedlong-baseline interferometric observations of beta crb using the chara/fluorinstrument. to disentangle the flux contributions of the two components of thisbinary star, we obtained vlt/naco adaptive optics images. we determined limbdarkened angular diameters of 0.699+-0.017 mas for beta crb a (frominterferometry) and 0.415+-0.017 mas for beta crb b (from surface brightness-color relations), corresponding to radii of 2.63+-0.09 rsun (3.4 percentuncertainty) and 1.56+-0.07 rsun (4.5 percent). the combined bolometric flux ofthe a and b components was determined from satellite uv data, spectrophotometryin the visible and broadband data in the infrared. the flux from the bcomponent constitutes 16+-4 percent of the total flux and was determined byfitting an atlas9 model atmosphere to the broad-band naco j and k magnitudes.combining the flux of the a component with its measured angular diameter, wedetermine the effective temperature teff(a) = 7980+-180 k (2.3 percent). ournew interferometric and imaging data enable a nearly model-independentdetermination of the effective temperature of beta crb a. including our recentstudy of alpha cir, we now have direct teff measurements of two of thebrightest roap stars, providing a strong benchmark for an improved calibrationof the teff scale for ap stars. this will support the use of potentially strongconstraints imposed by asteroseismic studies of roap stars.

0704.1825	extended envelopes around galactic cepheids iii. y oph and alpha per  from near-infrared interferometry with chara/fluor	unbiased angular diameter measurements are required for accurate distances tocepheids using the interferometric baade wesselink method (ibwm). the precisionof this technique is currently limited by interferometric measurements at the1.5% level. at this level, the center-to-limb darkening (cld) and the presenceof circumstellar envelopes (cse) seem to be the two main sources of bias. theobservations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometricvisibility profile of cepheids. in particular, we assess the systematicpresence of cse around cepheids in order determine accurate distances with theibwm free from cse biased angular diameters. we observed a cepheid (y oph) forwhich the pulsation is well resolved and a non-pulsating yellow supergiant(alpha per) using long-baseline near-infrared interferometry. we interpretedthese data using a simple cse model we previously developed. we found that ourobservations of alpha per do not provide evidence for a cse. the measured cldis explained by an hydrostatic photospheric model. our observations of y oph,when compared to smaller baseline measurements, suggest that it is surroundedby a cse with similar characteristics to cse found previously around othercepheids. we have determined the distance to y oph to be d=491+/-18 pc.additional evidence points toward the conclusion that most cepheids aresurrounded by faint cse, detected by near infrared interferometry: afterobserving four cepheids, all show evidence for a cse. our cse non-detectionaround a non-pulsating supergiant in the instability strip, alpha per, providesconfidence in the detection technique and suggests a pulsation driven mass-lossmechanism for the cepheids.

1010.3649	surface convection and red giants radii measurements	the phenomenological models of convection use characteristic length scalesthey do not determine but that are chosen to fit solar or stellar observations.we investigate if changes of these length scales are required between the sunand low mass stars on the red giant branch (rgb). the question is addressedjointly in the frameworks of the mixing length theory and of the full spectrumof turbulence model. for both models, the convective length scale is assumed tobe a fixed fraction of the local pressure scale height. we use constraintscoming from the observed effective temperatures and linear radii independently.we rely on a sample of 38 nearby giants and subgiants for which surfacetemperatures and luminosities are known accurately and the radii are determinedthrough interferometry to better than 10%. for the few cases where the stellarmasses were determined by asteroseismological measurements, we computeddedicated models. first we calibrate the solar models. then, with the samephysics, we compute rgb models for masses between 0.9 mo and 2.5 mo andmetallicities ranging from $\rm [fe/h]=-0.34$ to solar. the evolution isfollowed up to 1000 lo. a special attention is given to the opacities and tothe non grey atmosphere models used as boundary conditions for which the modelof convection is the same as in the interior. we find that for both the mixinglength theory and the full spectrum of turbulence model the characteristicsolar length scale for convection has to be slightly reduced to fit the loweredge of the observed rgb. the corresponding models also better match theexpected mass distribution on the rgb and are in better agreement to theseismic constraints. these results are robust whether effective temperaturesdetermined spectroscopically or radii determined interferometrically are used.

0709.3255	a new calibration of galactic cepheid period-luminosity relations from b  to k bands, and a comparison to lmc pl relations	the universality of the cepheid period-luminosity relations has been underdiscussion since metallicity effects have been assumed to play a role in thevalue of the intercept and, more recently, of the slope of these relations. thegoal of the present study is to calibrate the galactic pl relations in variousphotometric bands (from b to k) and to compare the results to thewell-established pl relations in the lmc. we use a set of 59 calibrating stars,the distances of which are measured using five different distance indicators:hubble space telescope and revised hipparcos parallaxes, infrared surfacebrightness and interferometric baade-wesselink parallaxes, and classicalzero-age-main-sequence-fitting parallaxes for cepheids belonging to openclusters or ob stars associations. a detailed discussion of absorptioncorrections and projection factor to be used is given. we find no significantdifference in the slopes of the pl relations between lmc and our galaxy. weconclude that the cepheid pl relations have universal slopes in all photometricbands, not depending on the galaxy under study (at least for lmc and milkyway). the possible zero-point variation with metal content is not discussed inthe present work, but an upper limit of 18.50 for the lmc distance modulus canbe deduced from our data.

1108.3698	hot exozodiacal dust resolved around vega with iota/ionic	although debris discs have been detected around a significant number ofmain-sequence stars, only a few of them are known to harbour hot dust in theirinner part where terrestrial planets may have formed. thanks to infraredinterferometric observations, it is possible to obtain a direct measurement ofthese regions, which are of prime importance for preparing future exo-earthcharacterisation missions. in this context, we have resolved the exozodiacaldust disc around vega with the help of infrared stellar interferometry andestimated the integrated h-band flux originating from the first few aus of thedebris disc. using precise h-band interferometric measurements obtained withthe 3-telescope iota/ionic interferometer (mount hopkins, arizona), thoroughmodelling of both interferometric data (squared visibility and closure phase)and spectral energy distribution was performed to constrain the nature of thenear-infrared excess emission. the most straightforward scenario consists in acompact dust disc producing a thermal emission that is largely dominated bysmall grains located between 0.1 and 0.3 au from vega and accounting for 1.23+/- 0.45% of the near-infrared stellar flux for our best-fit model. this fluxratio is shown to vary slightly with the geometry of the model used to fit ourinterferometric data (variations within +/-0.19%). initially revealed by k-bandchara/fluor observations, the presence of hot exozodiacal dust in the vicinityof vega is confirmed by our h-band iota/ionic measurements at the 3-sigmalevel. whereas the origin of the dust is still uncertain, its presence and thepossible connection with the outer disc suggest that the vega system iscurrently undergoing major dynamical perturbations.

1307.2488	a near-infrared interferometric survey of debris disc stars. iii. first  statistics based on 42 stars observed with chara/fluor	(abridged) dust is expected to be ubiquitous in extrasolar planetary systemsowing to the dynamical activity of minor bodies. inner dust populations are,however, still poorly known because of the high contrast and small angularseparation with respect to their host star. we aim to determine the level ofnear-infrared exozodiacal dust emission around a sample of 42 nearby mainsequence stars with spectral types ranging from a to k and to investigate itscorrelation with various stellar parameters and with the presence of cold dustbelts. we use high-precision k-band visibilities obtained with the fluorinterferometer on the shortest baseline of the chara array. the calibratedvisibilities are compared with the expected visibility of the stellarphotosphere to assess whether there is an additional, fully resolvedcircumstellar emission. near-infrared circumstellar emission amounting to about1% of the stellar flux is detected around 13 of our 42 target stars. follow-upobservations showed that one of them (eps cep) is associated with a stellarcompanion, while another one was detected around what turned out to be a giantstar (kap crb). the remaining 11 excesses found around single main sequencestars are most probably associated with hot circumstellar dust, yielding anoverall occurrence rate of 28+8-6% for our (biased) sample. we show that theoccurrence rate of bright exozodiacal discs correlates with spectral type,k-band excesses being more frequent around a-type stars. it also correlateswith the presence of detectable far-infrared excess emission in the case ofsolar-type stars. this study provides new insight into the phenomenon of brightexozodiacal discs, showing that hot dust populations are probably linked toouter dust reservoirs in the case of solar-type stars. for a-type stars, noclear conclusion can be made regarding the origin of the detected near-infraredexcesses.

1404.1014	reaching micro-arcsecond astrometry with long baseline optical  interferometry; application to the gravity instrument	a basic principle of long baseline interferometry is that an optical pathdifference (opd) directly translates into an astrometric measurement. in thesimplest case, the opd is equal to the scalar product between the vectorlinking the two telescopes and the normalized vector pointing toward the star.however, a too simple interpretation of this scalar product leads to seeminglyconflicting results, called here "the baseline paradox". for micro-arcsecondaccuracy astrometry, we have to model in full the metrology measurement. itinvolves a complex system subject to many optical effects: from pure baselineerrors to static, quasi-static and high order optical aberrations. the goal ofthis paper is to present the strategy used by the "general relativity analysisvia vlt interferometry" instrument (gravity) to minimize the biases introducedby these defects. it is possible to give an analytical formula on how thebaselines and tip-tilt errors affect the astrometric measurement. this formuladepends on the limit-points of three type of baselines: the wide-anglebaseline, the narrow-angle baseline, and the imaging baseline. we also,numerically, include non-common path higher-order aberrations, whose amplitudewere measured during technical time at the very large telescope interferometer.we end by simulating the influence of high-order common-path aberrations due toatmospheric residuals calculated from a monte-carlo simulation tool foradaptive optics systems. the result of this work is an error budget of thebiases caused by the multiple optical imperfections, including opticaldispersion. we show that the beam stabilization through both focal and pupiltracking is crucial to the gravity system. assuming the instrument pupil isstabilized at a 4 cm level on m1, and a field tracking below 0.2$\lambda/d$, weshow that gravity will be able to reach its objective of 10$\mu$as accuracy.

astro-ph;0303634	the diameters of alpha centauri a and b - a comparison of the  asteroseismic and vinci/vlti views	we compare the first direct angular diameter measurements obtained on ourclosest stellar neighbour, alpha centauri, to recent model diametersconstrained by asteroseismic observations. using the vinci instrument installedat eso's vlt interferometer (vlti), the angular diameters of the two maincomponents of the system, alpha cen a and b, were measured with a relativeprecision of 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. particular care has been taken in thecalibration of these measurements, considering that vinci is estimating thefringe visibility using a broadband k filter. we obtain uniform disk angulardiameters for alpha cen a and b of ud[a] = 8.314 +/- 0.016 mas and ud[b] =5.856 +/- 0.027 mas, and limb darkened angular diameters of ld[a] = 8.511 +/-0.020 mas and ld[b] = 6.001 +/- 0.034 mas. combining these values with theparallax from soderhjelm (1999), we derive linear diameters of d[a] = 1.224 +/-0.003 dsun and d[b] = 0.863 +/- 0.005 dsun. these values are compatible withthe masses published by thevenin et al.(2002) for both stars.

astro-ph;0309148	the diameter and evolutionary state of procyon a	we report the angular diameter measurement obtained with the vinci/vltiinstrument on the nearby star procyon a (alpha cmi a, f5iv-v), at a relativeprecision of +/- 0.9%. we obtain a uniform disk angular diameter in the k bandof ud = 5.376 +/- 0.047 mas and a limb darkened value of ld = 5.448 +/- 0.053mas. together with the hipparcos parallax, this gives a linear diameter of2.048 +/- 0.025 d_sun. we use this result in combination with spectroscopic,photometric and asteroseismic constraints to model this star with the cesamcode. one set of modeling parameters that reproduces the observations withintheir error bars are an age of 2314 myr, an initial helium mass fraction y_i =0.301 and an initial mass ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen z/x_i = 0.0314.we also computed the adiabatic oscillation spectrum of our model of procyon a,giving a mean large frequency separation of delta nu_0 = 54.7 microhz. thisvalue is in agreement with the seismic observations by martic et al. (1999,2001). the interferometric diameter and the asteroseismic large frequencyspacing together suggest a mass closer to 1.4 m_sun than to 1.5 m_sun. weconclude that procyon is currently ending its life on the main sequence, as itsluminosity class indicates.

astro-ph;0309784	vinci / vlti observations of main sequence stars	main sequence (ms) stars are by far the most numerous class in the universe.they are often somewhat neglected as they are relatively quiet objects (butexceptions exist), though they bear testimony of the past and future of oursun. an important characteristic of the ms stars, particularly the solar-typeones, is that they host the large majority of the known extrasolar planets.moreover, at the bottom of the ms, the red m dwarfs pave the way tounderstanding the physics of brown dwarfs and giant planets. we have measuredvery precise angular diameters from recent vinci/vlti interferometricobservations of a number of ms stars in the k band, with spectral types betweena1v and m5.5v. they already cover a wide range of effective temperatures andradii. combined with precise hipparcos parallaxes, photometry, spectroscopy aswell as the asteroseismic information available for some of these stars, theangular diameters put strong constraints on the detailed models of these stars,and therefore on the physical processes at play.

astro-ph;0310399	direct measurement of the size and shape of the present-day stellar wind  of eta carinae	we present new high angular resolution observations at near-ir wavelengths ofthe core of the luminous blue variable eta carinae, using naos-conica at thevlt and vinci at the vlt interferometer (vlti). the latter observations providespatial information on a scale of 5 milli-arcsec or ~11 au at the distance ofeta carinae. the present-day stellar wind of eta carinae is resolved on a scaleof several stellar radii. assuming spherical symmetry, we find a mass loss rateof 1.6x10^{-3} m_sun/yr and a wind clumping factor of 0.26. the vlti data takenat a baseline of 24 meter show that the object is elongated with a de-projectedaxis ratio of approximately 1.5; the major axis is aligned with that of thelarge bi-polar nebula that was ejected in the 19th century. the most likelyexplanation for this observation is a counter-intuitive model in which stellarrotation near the critical velocity causes enhanced mass loss along therotation axis. this results from the large temperature difference between poleand equator in rapidly rotating stars. eta carinae must rotate in excess of 90per cent of its critical velocity to account for the observed shape. the largeoutburst may have been shaped in a similar way. our observations provide strongsupport for the existence of a theoretically predicted rotational instability,known as the omega limit.

(1998)period-radius relation to estimate the linear diameters, we obtain thefollowing distances (statistical and systematic error bars are mentioned): d(xsgr) = 324 +/- 7 +/- 17 pc, d(eta aql) = 264 +/- 4 +/- 14 pc, d(w sgr) = 386+/- 9 +/- 21 pc, d(beta dor) = 326 +/- 4 +/- 19 pc, d(zeta gem) = 360 +/- 13+/- 22 pc, d(y oph) = 648 +/- 17 +/- 47 pc and d(l car) = 542 +/- 2 +/- 49 pc.

astro-ph;0312068	modeling of alpha cen and procyon using vlti observations	we present a novel approach to model the nearby stars alpha cen a &amp; b andprocyon a using asteroseismic and interferometric constraints. using the vinciinstrument installed at the vlt interferometer (vlti), the angular diameters ofthe alpha centauri system were measured with a relative precision of 0.2% and0.6%, respectively. from these values, we derive linear radii of r[a] = 1.224+/- 0.003 r_sun and r[b] = 0.863 +/- 0.005 r_sun. these radii are in excellentagreement with the models of thevenin et al. (2002), that use asteroseismicfrequencies as constraints (bouchy &amp; carrier 2001; bouchy &amp; carrier 2002). withthe same instrument, we also measured the angular diameter of procyon a. usingthe hipparcos parallax, we obtain a linear radius of 2.048 +/- 0.025 r_sun. weuse this result together with spectroscopic and photometric constraints tomodel this star with the cesam code. we also computed the adiabatic oscillationspectrum of our model of procyon a, giving a mean large frequency separation ofdelta nu_0 = 54.8 uhz, in agreement with the seismic observations by martic etal. (2001). our model favours a mass around 1.4 m_sun for procyon a.

astro-ph;0403497	vlti/vinci observations of the nucleus of ngc 1068 using the adaptive  optics system macao	we present the first near-infrared k-band long-baseline interferometricmeasurement of the prototype seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 with resolution lambda/b\~ 10 mas obtained with the very large telescope interferometer (vlti) and thetwo 8.2m unit telescopes ut2 and ut3. the adaptive optics system macao wasemployed to deliver wavefront-corrected beams to the k-band commissioninginstrument vinci. a squared visibility amplitude of 16.3 +/- 4.3 % was measuredfor ngc 1068 at a sky-projected baseline length of 45.8 m and azimuth angle44.9 deg. this value corresponds to a fwhm of the k-band intensity distributionof 5.0 +/- 0.5 mas (0.4 +/- 0.04 pc) at the distance of ngc 1068) if itconsists of a single gaussian component. taking into account k-band speckleinterferometry observations (wittkowski et al. 1998; weinberger et al. 1999;weigelt et al. 2004), we favor a multi-component model for the intensitydistribution where a part of the flux originates from scales clearly smallerthan about 5 mas (&lt;0.4 pc), and another part of the flux from larger scales.the k-band emission from the small (&lt; 5 mas) scales might arise fromsubstructure of the dusty nuclear torus, or directly from the central accretionflow viewed through only moderate extinction.

astro-ph;0404179	cepheid distances from infrared long-baseline interferometry - ii.  calibration of the period-radius and period-luminosity relations	using our interferometric observations of seven classical cepheids reportedin kervella et al. (2003, paper i), complemented by previously existingmeasurements, we derive new calibrations of the cepheids period-radius (p-r)and period-luminosity (p-l) relations. we obtain a p-r relation of log r =[0.767 +/- 0.009] log p + [1.091 +/- 0.011], only 1 sigma away from therelation obtained by gieren et al. (1998). we therefore confirm their p-rrelation at a level of delta(log r) = +/- 0.02. we also derive an originalcalibration of the p-l relation, assuming the slopes derived by gieren et al.(1998) from lmc cepheids, alpha_k = -3.267 +/- 0.042 and alpha_v = -2.769 +/-0.073. with a p-l relation of the form m = alpha (log p - 1) + beta, we obtainlog p = 1 reference points of beta(k) = -5.904 +/- 0.063 and beta(v) = -4.209+/- 0.075. our calibration in the v band is statistically identical to thegeometrical result of lanoix et al.

astro-ph;0506756	eta car through the eyes of interferometers	the core of the nebula surrounding eta carinae has recently been observedwith vlt/naco, vlti/vinci, vlti/midi and vlti/amber in order to spatially andspectrally constrain the warm dusty environment and the central object.narrow-band images at 3.74 and 4.05 micron reveal the structuredbutterfly-shaped dusty environment close to the central star with anunprecedented spatial resolution of about 60 mas. vinci has resolved thepresent-day stellar wind of eta carinae on a scale of several stellar radiiowing to the spatial resolution of the order of 5 mas (11 au). the vinciobservations show that the object is elongated with a de-projected axis ratioof approximately 1.5. moreover the major axis is aligned with that of the largebipolar nebula that was ejected in the 19th century. fringes have also beenobtained in the mid-ir with midi using baselines of 75m. a peak of correlatedflux of 100 jy is detected 0.3" south-east from the photocenter of the nebulaat 8.7 micron is detected. this correlated flux is partly attributed to thecentral object but it is worth noting that at these wavelengths, virtually allthe 0.5" x 0.5" central area can generate detectable fringes witnessing thelarge clumping of the dusty ejecta. these observations provide an upper limitfor the sed of the central source from 3.8 to 13.5 micron and constrain someparameters of the stellar wind which can be compared to hillier's model.lastly, we present the great potential of the amber instrument to study thenumerous near-ir emissive lines from the star and its close vicinity. inparticular, we discuss its ability to detect and follow the faint companion.

astro-ph;0507336	on the limb darkening, spectral energy distribution, and temperature  structure of procyon	we have fit synthetic visibilities from 3-d (co5bold + phoenix) and 1-d(phoenix, atlas 12) model stellar atmospheres of procyon (f5 iv) tohigh-precision interferometric data from the vlti interferometer (k-band) andfrom the mark iii interferometer (500 nm and 800 nm). these data sets provide atest of theoretical wavelength dependent limb-darkening predictions. the workof allende prieto et al. has shown that the temperature structure from aspatially and temporally averaged 3-d hydrodynamical model producessignificantly less limb darkening at 500 nm relative to the temperaturestructure of a 1-d marcs model atmosphere with a standard mixing-lengthapproximation for convection. our direct fits to the interferometric dataconfirm this prediction. a 1-d atlas 12 model with ``approximate overshooting''provides the required temperature gradient. we show, however, that 1-d modelscannot reproduce the ultraviolet spectrophotometry below 160 nm with effectivetemperatures in the range constrained by the measured bolometric flux andangular diameter. we find that a good match to the full spectral energydistribution can be obtained with a composite model consisting of a weightedaverage of twelve 1-d model atmospheres based on the surface intensitydistribution of a 3-d granulation simulation. we emphasize that 1-d models withovershooting may realistically represent the mean temperature structure off-type stars like procyon, but the same models will predict redder colors thanobserved because they lack the multicomponent temperature distribution expectedfor the surfaces of these stars.

astro-ph;0603327	first results from the chara array vii: long-baseline interferometric  measurements of vega consistent with a pole-on, rapidly rotating star	we have obtained high-precision interferometric measurements of vega with thechara array and fluor beam combiner in the k' band at projected baselinesbetween 103m and 273m. the measured visibility amplitudes beyond the first lobeare significantly weaker than expected for a slowly rotating star characterizedby a single effective temperature and surface gravity. our measurements, whencompared to synthetic visibilities and synthetic spectrophotometry from aroche-von zeipel gravity-darkened model atmosphere, provide strong evidence forthe model of vega as a rapidly rotating star viewed very nearly pole-on. ourbest fitting model indicates that vega is rotating at ~91% of its angularbreak-up rate with an equatorial velocity of 275 km/s. together with themeasured vsin(i), this velocity yields an inclination for the rotation axis of5 degrees. for this model the pole-to-equator effective temperature differenceis 2250 k, a value much larger than previously derived from spectral lineanalyses. the derived equatorial t_eff of 7900 k indicates vega's equatorialatmosphere may be convective and provides a possible explanation for thediscrepancy. the model has a luminosity of ~37 lsun, a value 35% lower thanvega's apparent luminosity based on its bolometric flux and parallax, assuminga slowly rotating star. the model luminosity is consistent with the meanabsolute magnitude of a0v stars. our model predicts the spectral energydistribution of vega as viewed from its equatorial plane; a model which may beemployed in radiative models for the surrounding debris disk.

astro-ph;0604260	circumstellar material in the vega inner system revealed by chara/fluor	only a handful of debris disks have been imaged up to now. due to the needfor high dynamic range and high angular resolution, very little is known aboutthe inner planetary region, where small amounts of warm dust are expected to befound. we investigate the close neighbourhood of vega with the help of infraredstellar interferometry and estimate the integrated k-band flux originating fromthe central 8 au of the debris disk. we performed precise visibilitymeasurements at both short (~30 m) and long (~150 m) baselines with the fluorbeam-combiner installed at the chara array (mt wilson, california) in order toseparately resolve the emissions from the extended debris disk (shortbaselines) and from the stellar photosphere (long baselines). after revisingvega's k-band angular diameter (3.202+/-0.005 mas), we show that a significantdeficit in squared visibility (1.88+/-0.34%) is detected at short baselineswith respect to the best-fit uniform disk stellar model. this deficit can beeither attributed to the presence of a low-mass stellar companion around vega,or as the signature of the thermal and scattered emissions from the debrisdisk. we show that the presence of a close companion is highly unlikely, aswell as other possible perturbations (stellar morphology, calibration), anddeduce that we have most probably detected the presence of dust in the closeneighbourhood of vega. the resulting flux ratio between the stellar photosphereand the debris disk amounts to 1.29+/-0.19% within the fluor field-of-view(~7.8 au). finally, we complement our k-band study with archival photometricand interferometric data in order to evaluate the main physical properties ofthe inner dust disk. the inferred properties suggest that the vega system couldbe currently undergoing major dynamical perturbations.
