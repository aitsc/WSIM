0905.2016	gyroid phase in nuclear pasta	nuclear matter is considered to be inhomogeneous at subnuclear densities thatare realized in supernova cores and neutron star crusts, and the structures ofnuclear matter change from spheres to cylinders, slabs, cylindrical holes andspherical holes as the density increases. in this letter, we discuss otherpossible structures, that is, gyroid and double-diamond morphologies, which areperiodic bicontinuous structures discovered in a block copolymer. utilizing thecompressible liquid drop model, we evaluate their surface and coulomb energiesand show that there is a chance of gyroid appearance near the transition pointfrom a cylinder to a slab. this interesting analogy between nuclear and polymersystems is not merely qualitative. the volume fraction at the phase transitionis also similar for the two systems. although the five shapes listed initiallyhave been long thought to be the only major constituents of so-called nuclearpasta at subnuclear densities, our findings imply that this may not be the caseand suggest that more detailed studies on nuclear pasta including the gyroidphase are needed.

0909.3622	ray-tracing analysis of anisotropic neutrino radiation for estimating  gravitational waves in core-collapse supernovae	we propose a ray-tracing method to estimate gravitational waves (gws)generated by anisotropic neutrino emission in supernova cores. to calculate thegravitational waveforms, we derive analytic formulae in a useful form, whichare applicable also for three-dimensional computations. pushed by evidence ofslow rotation prior to core-collapse, we focus on asphericities in neutrinoemission and matter motions outside the protoneutron star. based on thetwo-dimensional (2d) models, which mimic sasi-aided neutrino heatingexplosions, we compute the neutrino anisotropies via the ray-tracing method ina post-processing manner and calculate the resulting waveforms. with thesecomputations, it is found that the waveforms exhibit more variety in contrastto the ones previously estimated by the ray-by-ray analysis (e.g., kotake etal. (2007)). in addition to a positively growing feature, which was predictedto determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly, the waveforms are shownto exhibit large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of sasi.these features are found to stem from the excess of neutrino emission inlateral directions, which can be precisely captured by the ray-tracingcalculation. due to the negative contributions and the neutrino absorptionsappropriately taken into account by the ray-tracing method, the wave amplitudesbecome more than one-order-of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation,thus making their detections very hard for a galactic source.on the other hand,it is pointed out that the gw spectrum from matter motions have its peak near$\sim 100$ hz, which could be characteristic for the sasi-induced supernovaexplosions.(abridged)

1001.5084	impact of quarks and pions on dynamics and neutrino signal of black hole  formation in non-rotating stellar core collapse	in the formation process of black holes, the density and temperature ofmatter become sufficiently high for quarks and pions to appear. in this studywe numerically investigate stellar core collapse and black hole formationtaking into account the equations of state involving quarks and/or pions. inour simulations, we utilize a code that solves the general relativistichydrodynamics and neutrino transfer equations simultaneously, treating neutrinoreactions in detail under spherical symmetry. initial models with threedifferent masses, namely, 40, 100 and 375msolar, are adopted. our results showthat quarks and pions shorten the duration of neutrino emission if the collapsebounces before black hole formation. in addition, pions increase the luminosityand average energy of neutrinos before black hole formation. we also find thatthe hadron-quark phase transition leads to an interesting evolution oftemperature. moreover, the neutrino event number is evaluated for the currentlyoperating neutrino detector, superkamiokande, to confirm that it is not onlydetectable but also affected by the emergence of quarks and pions for galacticevents. while there are some issues, such as hyperons, beyond the scope of thisstudy, this is the first serious attempt to assess the impact of quarks andpions in dynamical simulations of black hole formation and will serve as animportant foundation for future studies.

1003.3308	the dynamics of three-planet systems: an approach from dynamical system	we study in detail the motions of three planets interacting with each otherunder the influence of a central star. it is known that the system with morethan two planets becomes unstable after remaining quasi-stable for long times,leading to highly eccentric orbital motions or ejections of some of theplanets. in this paper, we are concerned with the underlying physics for thisquasi-stability as well as the subsequent instability and advocate theso-called "stagnant motion" in the phase space, which has been explored in thefield of dynamical system. we employ the lyapunov exponent, the power spectraof orbital elements and the distribution of the durations of quasi-stablemotions to analyze the phase space structure of the three-planet system, thesimplest and hopefully representative one that shows the instability. we findfrom the lyapunov exponent that the system is almost non-chaotic in the initialquasi-stable state whereas it becomes intermittently chaotic thereafter. thenon-chaotic motions produce the horizontal dense band in the action-angle plotwhereas the voids correspond to the chaotic motions. we obtain power laws forthe power spectra of orbital eccentricities. power-law distributions are alsofound for the durations of quasi-stable states. all these results combinedtogether, we may reach the following picture: the phase space consists of theso-called kam tori surrounded by satellite tori and imbedded in the chaoticsea. the satellite tori have a self-similar distribution and are responsiblefor the scale-free power-law distributions of the duration times. the system istrapped around one of the kam torus and the satellites for a long time (thestagnant motion) and moves to another kam torus with its own satellites fromtime to time, corresponding to the intermittent chaotic behaviors.

1009.2326	jet propagations, breakouts and photospheric emissions in collapsing  massive progenitors of long duration gamma ray bursts	we investigate by two-dimensional axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamicalsimulations (1) jet propagations through an envelope of a rapidly rotating andcollapsing massive star, which is supposed to be a progenitor of long durationgamma ray bursts (grbs), (2) breakouts and subsequent expansions into stellarwinds and (3) accompanying photospheric emissions. we find that if the enveloperotates uniformly almost at the mass shedding limit, its outer part stopscontracting eventually when the centrifugal force becomes large enough. thenanother shock wave is formed, propagates outwards and breaks out of theenvelope into the stellar wind. which breaks out earlier, the jet or thecentrifugal bounce-induced shock, depends on the timing of jet injection. ifthe shock breakout occurs earlier owing to a later injection, the jetpropagation and subsequent photospheric emissions are affected substantially.we pay particular attention to observational consequences of the difference inthe timing of jet injection. we calculate optical depths to find the locationof photospheres, extracting densities and temperatures at appropriate retardedtimes from the hydrodynamical data. we show that the luminosity and observedtemperature of the photospheric emissions are both much lower than thosereported in previous studies. although luminosities are still high enough forgrbs, the observed temperature are lower than the energy at the spectral peakexpected by the yonetoku-relation. this may imply that energy exchanges betweenphotons and matter are terminated deeper inside or some non-thermal processesare operating to boost photon energies.

1203.6488	explosive nucleosynthesis in magnetohydrodynamical jets from collapsars  ii. heavy-element nucleosynthesis of s, r, p-processes	we investigate the nucleosynthesis in a massive star of 70 m_solar with solarmetallicity in the main sequence stage. the helium core mass after hydrogenburning corresponds to 32 m_solar. nucleosynthesis calculations have beenperformed during the stellar evolution and the jetlike supernova explosion of acollapsar model, where the weak s-, p-, and r-processes are taken into account.we confirm that s-elements of 60 &lt; a &lt; 90 are highly overproduced relative tothe solar abundances in the hydrostatic nucleosynthesis. during oxygen burning,p-elements of a &gt; 90 are produced via photodisintegrations of seed s-elements.however, the produced p-elements are disintegrated in later stages except for^{180}ta. in the explosive nucleosynthesis, elements of 90 &lt; a &lt; 160 aresignificantly overproduced relative to the solar values owing to the r-process.only heavy p-elements (n &gt; 50) are overproduced via the p-process. comparedwith the previous study of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations in thecollapsar model of 40 m_solar by fujimoto et al. 2007, 2008, our jet modelcannot contribute to the third peak of the solar r-elements and intermediatep-elements. averaging the overproduction factors over the progenitor masseswith the use of salpeter's imf, we suggest that the 70 m_solar star couldcontribute to the solar weak s-elements of 60 &lt; a &lt; 90 and neutron-richelements of 90 &lt; a &lt; 160. we confirm the primary synthesis of light p-elementsin the ejected matter of high peak temperature. the ejected matter has [sr/eu]\sim -0.4, which is different from that of a typical r-process-enriched starcs22892-052 ([sr/eu] \sim -1). we find that sr-y-zr isotopes are primarilysynthesized in the explosive nucleosynthesis in a similar process of theprimary production of light p-elements, which has been considered as one of thesites of a lighter element primary process (lepp).

1209.0596	semi-dynamical approach to the shock revival in core-collapse supernovae	we develop a new semi-dynamical method to study shock revival by neutrinoheating in core- collapse supernovae. our new approach is an extension of theprevious studies that employ spherically symmetric, steady, shocked accretionflows together with the light bulb approximation. the latter has been widelyused in the supernova community for the phenomenological investigation of thecriteria for successful supernova explosions. in the present approach, on theother hand, we get rid of the steady-state condition and take into accountshock wave motions instead. we have in mind the scenario that not the criticalluminosity but the critical fluctuation generated by hydrodynamicalinstabilities such as sasi and neutrino-driven convection in the post-shockregion determines the onset of shock revival. after confirming that the newapproach indeed captures the dynamics of revived shock wave qualitatively, wethen apply the method to various initial conditions and find that there is acritical fluctuation for shock revival, which can be well fit by the followingformula: f_crit ~ 0.8 * (m_in/1.4m_sun) * {1- (rsh/10^8cm)}, in which fcritdenotes the critical pressure fluctuation normalized by the unperturbedpost-shock value. min and rsh stand for the mass of the central compact objectand the shock radius, respectively. the critical fluctuation decreases with theshock radius, whereas it increases with the mass of the central object. wediscuss the possible implications of our results for 3d effects on shockrevival, which is currently controversial in the supernova community.

1209.4824	post-shock-revival evolutions in the neutrino-heating mechanism of  core-collapse supernovae	we perform some experimental simulations in spherical symmetry andaxisymmetry to understand the post-shock-revival evolution of core-collapsesupernovae. assuming that the stalled shock wave is relaunched by neutrinoheating and employing the so-called light bulb approximation, we induce shockrevival by raising the neutrino luminosity by hand up to the critical value,which is also de- termined by dynamical simulations. a 15m_{sun} progenitormodel is employed. we incorporate nuclear network calculations with aconsistent equation of state in the simulations to account for the energyrelease by nuclear reactions and their feedback to hydrodynamics. varying theshock-relaunch time rather arbitrarily, we investigate the ensuing long-termevolutions systematically, paying particular attention to the explosion energyand nucleosynthetic yields as a function of this relaunch time, or equivalentlythe accretion rate at shock revival. we study in detail how the diagnosticexplosion energy approaches the asymptotic value and which physical processescontribute to the explosion energy in what proportions as well as theirdependence on the relaunch time and the dimension of dynamics. we find that thecontribution of nuclear reactions to the explosion energy is comparable to orgreater than that of neutrino heating. in particular, recombinations aredominant over burnings in the contributions of nuclear reactions. interestingly1d models studied in this paper cannot produce the appropriate explosion energyand nickel mass simultaneously, overproducing nickels, whereas this problem isresolved in 2d models if the shock is relaunched at 300-400ms after bounce.

1210.5584	regular and non-regular solutions of the riemann problem in ideal  magnetohydrodynamics	we have built a code to numerically solve the riemann problem in idealmagnetohydrodynamics (mhd) for an arbitrary initial condition to investigate avariety of solutions more thoroughly. the code can handle not only regularsolutions, in which no intermediate shocks are involved, but also all types ofnon-regular solutions if any. as a first application, we explored theneighborhood of the initial condition that was first picked up by brio &amp; wu(1988) and has been frequently employed in the literature as a standard problemto validate numerical codes. contrary to the conventional wisdom that therewill always be a regular solution, we found an initial condition, for whichthere is no regular solution but a non-regular one. the latter solution hasonly regular solutions in its neighborhood and actually sits on the boundary ofregular solutions. this implies that the regular solutions are not sufficientto solve the ideal mhd riemann problem and suggests that at least some types ofnon-regular solutions are physical. we also demonstrate that the non-regularsolutions are not unique. in fact, we found for the brio &amp; wu initial conditionthat there are uncountably many non-regular solutions. this poses an intriguingquestion: why a particular non-regular solution is always obtained in numericalsimulations? this has important ramifications to the discussion of whichintermediate shocks are really admissible.

1211.6817	effects of resistivity on magnetized core-collapse supernovae	we studied roles of a turbulent resistivity in the core-collapse of astrongly magnetized massive star, carrying out 2d-resistive-mhd simulations.the three cases with different initial strengths of magnetic field and rotationare investigated; 1. strongly magnetized rotating core; 2.moderately magnetizedrotating core; 3. very strongly magnetized non-rotating core. in each case,both an ideal-mhd model and resistive-mhd models are computed. as a result ofcomputations, each model shows a matter eruption helped by a magneticacceleration (and also by a centrifugal acceleration in the rotating cases). wefound that a resistivity attenuates the explosion in case~1 and 2, while itenhances the explosion in case~3. we also found that in the rotating cases,main mechanisms for the amplification of a magnetic field in the post-bouncephase are an outward advection of magnetic field and a winding of poloidalmagnetic field-lines by differential rotation, which are somewhat dampened downwith the presence of a resistivity. although the magnetorotational instabilityseems to occur in the rotating models, it will play only a minor role in amagnetic field amplification. another impact of resistivity is that on theaspect ratio. in the rotating cases, a large aspect ratio of the ejectedmatters, $&gt; 2.5$, attained in a ideal-mhd model is reduced to some extent in aresistive model. these results indicate that a resistivity possibly plays animportant role in the dynamics of strongly magnetized supernovae.

1305.1508	new equations of state based on the liquid drop model of heavy nuclei  and quantum approach to light nuclei for core-collapse supernova simulations	we construct new equations of state for baryons at sub-nuclear densities forthe use in core-collapse simulations of massive stars. the abundance of variousnuclei is obtained together with thermodynamic quantities. a model free energyis constructed, based on the relativistic mean field theory for nucleons andthe mass formula for nuclei with the proton number up to ~ 1000. theformulation is an extension of the previous model, in which we adopted theliquid drop model to all nuclei under the nuclear statistical equilibrium. wereformulate the new liquid drop model so that the temperature dependences ofbulk energies could be taken into account. furthermore, we extend the region inthe nuclear chart, in which shell affects are included, by using theoreticalmass data in addition to experimental ones. we also adopt a quantum theoreticalmass evaluation of light nuclei, which incorporates the pauli- and self-energyshifts that are not included in the ordinary liquid drop model. the pastaphases for heavy nuclei are taken into account in the same way as in theprevious model. we find that the abundances of heavy nuclei are modified by theshell effects of nuclei and temperature dependence of bulk energies. thesechanges may have an important effect on the rates of electron captures andcoherent neutrino scatterings on nuclei in supernova cores. the abundances oflight nuclei are also modified by the new mass evaluation, which may affect theheating and cooling rates of supernova cores and shocked envelopes.

1305.1510	the influence of inelastic neutrino reactions with light nuclei on the  standing accretion shock instability in core-collapse supernovae	we perform numerical experiments to investigate the influence of inelasticneutrino reactions with light nuclei on the standing accretion shockinstability (sasi). the time evolution of shock waves is calculated with asimple light-bulb approximation for the neutrino transport and a multi-nucleiequation of state. the neutrino absorptions and inelastic interactions withdeuterons, tritons, helions and alpha particles are taken into account in thehydrodynamical simulations in addition to the ordinary charged-currentinteractions with nucleons. axial symmetry is assumed but no equatorialsymmetry is imposed. we show that the heating rates of deuterons reach as highas 10% of those of nucleons around the bottom of the gain region. on the otherhand, alpha particles are heated near the shock wave, which is important whenthe shock wave expands and the density and temperature of matter become low. itis also found that the models with heating by light nuclei have differentevolutions from those without it in the non-linear phase of sasi. this resultsis because matter in the gain region has a varying density and temperature andthere appear sub-regions that are locally rich in deuterons and alphaparticles. although the light nuclei are never dominant heating sources andthey work favorably for shock revival in some cases and unfavorably in othercases, they are non-negligible and warrant further investigation.

1308.0829	parametric study of flow patterns behind the standing accretion shock  wave for core-collapse supernovae	in this study, we conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulationssystematically to investigate the flow patterns behind the accretion shockwaves that are commonly formed in the post-bounce phase of core-collapsesupernovae. adding small perturbations to spherically symmetric, steady,shocked accretion flows, we compute the subsequent evolutions to find what flowpattern emerges as a consequence of hydrodynamical instabilities such asconvection and standing accretion shock instability (sasi) for differentneutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates. depending on these twocontrolling parameters, various flow patterns are indeed realized. we classifythem into three basic patterns and two intermediate ones; the former includessloshing motion (sl), spiral motion (sp) and multiple buoyant bubble formation(bb); the latter consists of spiral motion with buoyant-bubble formation (spb)and spiral motion with pulsationally changing rotational velocities (spp).although the post-shock flow is highly chaotic, there is a clear trend in thepattern realization. the sloshing and spiral motions tend to be dominant forhigh accretion rates and low neutrino luminosities, and multiple buoyantbubbles prevail for low accretion rates and high neutrino luminosities. it isinteresting that the dominant pattern is not always identical between thesemi-nonlinear and nonlinear phases near the critical luminosity; theintermediate cases are realized in the latter case. running several simulationswith different random perturbations, we confirm that the realization of flowpattern is robust in most cases.

1404.2646	critical surface for explosions of rotational core-collapse supernovae	the effect of rotation on the explosion of core-collapse supernovae isinvestigated systematically in three-dimensional simulations. in order toobtain the critical conditions for explosion as a function of mass accretionrate, neutrino luminosity, and specific angular momentum, rigidly rotatingmatter was injected from the outer boundary with an angular momentum, which isincreased every 500 ms. it is found that there is a critical value of thespecific angular momentum, above which the standing shock wave revives, for agiven combination of mass accretion rate and neutrino luminosity, i.e. anexplosion can occur by rotation even if the neutrino luminosity is lower thanthe critical value for a given mass accretion rate in non-rotational models.the coupling of rotation and hydrodynamical instabilities plays an importantrole to characterize the dynamics of shock revival for the range of specificangular momentum that are supposed to be realistic. contrary to expectationsfrom past studies, the most rapidly expanding direction of the shock wave isnot aligned with the rotation axis. being perpendicular to the rotation axis onaverage, it can be oriented in various directions. its dispersion is small whenthe spiral mode of the standing accretion shock instability (sasi) governs thedynamics, while it is large when neutrino-driven convection is dominant. as aresult of the comparison between 2d and 3d rotational models, it is found thatm=!0 modes of neutrino-driven convection or sasi are important for shockrevival around the critical surface.

1406.6414	the criterion of supernova explosion revisited: the mass accretion  history	by performing neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations in sphericalsymmetry (1d) and axial symmetry (2d) with different progenitor models bywoosley &amp; heger (2007) from 12 $m_{\odot}$ to 100 $m_{\odot}$, we find that all1d runs fail to produce an explosion and several 2d runs succeed. thedifference in the shock evolutions for different progenitors can be interpretedby the difference in their mass accretion histories, which are in turndetermined by the density structures of progenitors. the mass accretion historyhas two phases in the majority of the models: the earlier phase in which themass accretion rate is high and rapidly decreasing and the later phase with alow and almost constant accretion rate. they are separated by the so-calledturning point, the origin of which is a change of the accreting layer. we arguethat shock revival will most likely occur around the turning point and hencethat its location in the $\dot m$-$l_\nu$ plane will be a good measure for thepossibility of shock revival: if the turning point lies above the criticalcurve and the system stays there for a long time, shock revival will obtain. inaddition, we develop a phenomenological model to approximately evaluate thetrajectories in the $\dot m$-$l_\nu$ plane, which, after calibrating freeparameters by a small number of 1d simulations, reproduces the location of theturning point reasonably well by using the initial density structure ofprogenitor alone. we suggest the application of the phenomenological model to alarge collection of progenitors in order to infer without simulations whichones are more likely to explode.

1407.5632	three-dimensional boltzmann-hydro code for core-collapse in massive  stars i. special relativistic treatments	we propose a novel numerical method for solving multi-dimensional, specialrelativistic boltzmann equations for neutrinos coupled to hydrodynamicsequations. it is meant to be applied to simulations of core-collapsesupernovae. we handle special relativity in a non-conventional way, takingaccount of all orders of v/c. consistent treatment of advection and collisionterms in the boltzmann equations is the source of difficulties, which weovercome by employing two different energy grids: lagrangian remapped andlaboratory fixed grids. we conduct a series of basic tests and perform aone-dimensional simulation of core-collapse, bounce and shock-stall for a15m_{sun} progenitor model with a minimum but essential set of microphysics. wedemonstrate in the latter simulation that our new code is capable of handlingall phases in core-collapse supernova. for comparison, a non-relativisticsimulation is also conducted with the same code, and we show that they producequalitatively wrong results in neutrino transfer. finally, we discuss apossible incorporation of general relativistic effects in our method.

1504.01845	possible signatures of ejecta-companion interaction in iptf 13bvn	we investigate the possible effects of the supernova ejecta hitting thecompanion star in iptf 13bvn, focusing on the observable features when itbecomes visible. iptf 13bvn is a type ib supernova that may become the firstcase that its progenitor is identified as a binary by near future observations.according to calculations by bersten et al. (2014), the progenitor should havea mass $\approx3.5m_\odot$ to reproduce the supernova light curve, and suchcompact stars could only be produced via binary evolution. this is one of thereasons that we expect the progenitor to be a binary, but it should beconfirmed by observing the remaining companion after the supernova. theirevolutionary calculations suggest that the companion star will be anoverluminous ob star at the moment of supernova. with a combination ofhydrodynamical and evolutionary simulations, we find that the secondary starwill be heated by the supernova ejecta and expand to have larger luminositiesand lower surface effective temperatures. the star will look rather like a redsuper giant, and this should be taken into account when searching for thecompanion star in the supernova ejecta in future observations.

1506.02358	pre-supernova neutrino emissions from one cores in the progenitors of  core-collapse supernovae: are they distinguishable from those of fe cores?	aiming to distinguish two types of progenitors of core collapse supernovae,i.e., one with a core composed mainly of oxygen and neon (abbreviated as onecore) and the other with an iron core (or fe core), we calculated theluminosities and spectra of neutrinos emitted from these cores prior togravitational collapse, taking neutrino oscillation into account. we found thatthe total energies emitted as $\bar{\nu}_e$ from the one core are $\lesssim10^{46}\ {\rm erg}$, which is much smaller than $\sim 10^{47}\ {\rm erg}$ forfe cores. the average energy, on the other hand, is twice as large for the onecore as those for the fe cores. the neutrinos produced by the plasmon decays inthe one core are more numerous than those from the electron-positronannihilation in both cores but they have much lower average energies $\lesssim1\ {\rm mev}$. although it is difficult to detect the pre-supernova neutrinosfrom the one core even if it is located within 200$\ $pc from the earth, weexpect $ \sim 9 - 43$ and $\sim 7 - 61$ events for fe cores at kamland andsuper-kamiokande, respectively, depending on the progenitor mass andneutrino-mass hierarchy. these numbers might be increased by an order ofmagnitude if we envisage next-generation detectors such as juno. we will hencebe able to distinguish the two types of progenitors by the detection ornon-detection of the pre-supernova neutrinos if they are close enough($\lesssim1\ {\rm kpc}$).

1511.08148	a hydrodynamical study on the conversion of hadronic matter to quark  matter: i. shock-induced conversion	we study transitions of hadronic matter (hm) to 3-flavor quark matter (3qm)locally, regarding the conversion processes as combustion and describing themhydrodynamically. not only the jump condition on both sides of the conversionfront but the structures inside the front are also considered by taking intoaccount what happens during the conversion processes on the time scale of weakinteractions as well as equations of state (eos's) in the mixed phase. underthe assumption that hm is metastable with their free energies being larger thanthose of 3qm but smaller than those of 2-flavor quark matter (2qm), we considerthe transition via 2qm triggered by a rapid density rise in a shock wave. basedon the results, we discuss which combustion modes (strong/weak detonation) maybe realized. hm is described by an eos based on the relativistic mean fieldtheory and 2, 3qm's are approximated by the mit bag model. we demonstrate for awide range of bag constant and strong coupling constant in this combination ofeos's that the combustion may occur in the so-called endothermic regime, inwhich the hugoniot curve for combustion runs below the one for the shock wavein p-v plane, and which has no terrestrial counter part. we find that strongdetonation always occurs. depending on the eos of quark matter (qm) as well asthe density of hm and the mach number of the detonation front, deconfinementfrom hm to 2qm is either completed or not completed in the shock wave. in thelatter case, which is more likely if the eos of qm ensures that deconfinementoccurs above the nuclear saturation density and that the maximum mass of coldquark stars is larger than two solar mass, the conversion continues further viathe mixing state of hm and 3qm on the time scale of weak interactions.

astro-ph;0310017	general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars	we have performed 2.5-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) simulations of the gravitational collapse of a magnetized rotatingmassive star as a model of gamma ray bursts (grbs). the current calculationfocuses on general relativistic mhd with simplified microphysics (we ignoreneutrino cooling, physical equation of state, and photodisintegration).initially, we assume that the core collapse has failed in this star. a few$m_{\odot}$ black hole is inserted by hand into the calculation. thesimulations presented in the paper follow the accretion of gas into a blackhole that is assumed to have formed before the calculation begins.thesimulation results show the formation of a disk-like structure and thegeneration of a jetlike outflow inside the shock wave launched at the corebounce. we have found that the jet is accelerated by the magnetic pressure andthe centrifugal force and is collimated by the pinching force of the toroidalmagnetic field amplified by the rotation and the effect of geometry of thepoloidal magnetic field. the maximum velocity of the jet is mildly relativistic(0.3c). the velocity of the jet becomes larger as the initial rotationalvelocity of stellar matter gets faster. on the other hand, the dependence onthe initial magnetic field strength is a bit more complicated: the velocity ofthe jet increases with the initial field strength in the weak field regime,then is saturated at some intermediate field strength, and decreases beyond thecritical field strength. these results are related to the stored magneticenergy determined by the balance between the propagation time of the alfvenwave and the rotation time of the disk (or twisting time).

astro-ph;0401563	gravitational radiation from rotational core collapse: effects of  magnetic fields and realistic equation of states	we perform a series of two-dimensional, axisymmetric, magnetohydrodynamicsimulations of the rotational collapse of a supernova core. in order tocalculate the waveforms of the gravitational wave, we derive the quadrupoleformula including the contributions from the electromagnetic fields. recentstellar evolution calculations imply that the magnetic fields of the toroidalcomponents are much stronger than those of the poloidal ones at thepresupernova stage. thus, we systematically investigate the effects of thetoroidal magnetic fields on the amplitudes and waveforms. furthermore, weemploy the two kinds of the realistic equation of states, which are often usedin the supernova simulations. then, we investigate the effects of the equationof states on the gravitational wave signals. with these computations, we findthat the peak amplitudes are lowered by an order of 10% for the models with thestrongest toroidal magnetic fields. however, the peak amplitudes are mostlywithin sensitivity range of laser interferometers such as tama and the firstligo for a source at a distance of 10 kpc. furthermore, we point out that theamplitudes of second peaks are still within the detection limit of the firstligo for the source, although the characteristics of second peaks are reducedby the magnetic fields. we stress the importance of the detection, since itwill give us information about the angular momentum distribution of massiveevolved stars. when we compare the gravitational waves from the two realisticequation of states, significant differences are not found, except that thetypical frequencies of the gravitational wave become slightly higher for thesofter equation of state.

astro-ph;0404152	general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars:  rotating black hole cases	we have performed 2.5-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) simulations of collapsars including a rotating black hole. this paper isan extension of our previous paper (mizuno et al. 2004). the currentcalculation focuses on the effect of black hole rotation using generalrelativistic mhd with simplified microphysics. initially, we assume that thecore collapse is failed in this star. a few solar mass rotating black hole isinserted by hand into the calculation. we consider two cases, the co-rotatingcase and counter-rotating case with respect to the black hole rotation.although the counter-rotating case may be unrealistic for collapsar, we performas a maximally dragging case of magnetic field. the simulation results show theformation of a disk-like structure and the generation of a jet-like outflownear the central black hole. the jet-like outflow propagates outwardly with thetwisted magnetic field and becomes collimated. we have found that the jets aregenerated and accelerated mainly by the magnetic field. the total jet velocityin the rotating black hole case is comparable to that of the non-rotating blackhole case (mizuno et al. 2004), 0.3c. when the rotation of the black hole isfaster, the magnetic field is twisted strongly owing to the frame-draggingeffect. the magnetic energy stored by the twisting magnetic field is convertedto kinetic energy of the jet directly rather than propagating as an alfvenwave. thus, as the rotation of the black hole becomes faster, the poloidalvelocity of the jet becomes faster. in the rapidly rotating black hole case thejet-like outflow can be produced by the frame dragging effect only through thetwisting of magnetic field even if there is no stellar rotation.

astro-ph;0505611	the core-collapse supernova with "non-uniform" magnetic fields	we perform two-dimensional numerical simulations on the core-collapse of amassive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using anumerical code zeus-2d. changing field configurations and laws of differentialrotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of theseparameters on the dynamics. in our models, we do not solve the neutrinotransport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric eos that takes intoaccount the neutrino emissions. as a result of the calculations, we find thatthe field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core ifthe initial magnetic field is large enough. models with initially concentratedfields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than theuniform field. quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fastjet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(grb). the lorentz forcesexerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsiblefor these dynamics. the pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not leadto any explosion or matter ejection. this suggests the presupernova models ofheger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, isdisadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matterejection, either. in these models magnetic fields play no role as they do notgrow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressurecould be comparable to the matter pressure. this is because the exponentialfield growth as expected in mri is not seen in our models. the magnetic fieldis amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.

astro-ph;0606581	stability of the accretion flows with stalled shocks in core-collapse  supernovae	bearing in mind the application to the theory of core-collapse supernovae, weperformed a global linear analysis on the stability of spherically symmetricaccretion flows through a standing shock wave onto a proto neutron star. asunperturbed flows, we adopted the spherically symmetric steady solutions to theeuler equations obtained with realistic equation of state and formulae forneutrino reaction rates taken into account. then we solved the equations forlinear perturbations numerically, and obtained the eigen frequencies and eigenfunctions. we found (1) the flows are stable for all modes if the neutrinoluminosity is lower than $\sim 1\times 10^{52}$ ergs/s for$\dot{m}=1.0m_{\odot}/{\rm s}$. (2) for larger luminosities, the non-radialinstabilities are induced, probably via the advection-acoustic cycles.interestingly, the modes with $\ell=2$ and 3 become unstable at first forrelatively low neutrino luminosities, e.g. $\gtrsim 2-3\times 10^{52}$ ergs/sfor the same accretion rate, whereas the $\ell=1$ mode is the most unstable forhigher luminosities, $\sim 3-7\times 10^{52}$ ergs/s. these are all oscillatorymodes. (3) for still larger luminosities, $\sim 7\times 10^{52}$ ergs/s for$\dot{m}=1.0m_{\odot}/{\rm s}$, non-oscillatory modes, both radial andnon-radial, become unstable. these non-radial modes were identified asconvection. we confirmed the results obtained by numerical simulations that theinstabilities induced by the advection-acoustic cycles are more important thanthe convection for lower neutrino luminosities.

astro-ph;0607224	gravitational radiation from standing accretion shock instability in  core-collapse supernovae	we present the results of numerical experiments, in which we study how theasphericities induced by the growth of the standing accretion shock instability(sasi) produce the gravitational waveforms in the postbounce phase ofcore-collapse supernovae. to obtain the neutrino-driven explosions, weparameterize the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star andapproximate the neutrino transfer by a light-bulb scheme. we find that thewaveforms due to the anisotropic neutrino emissions show the monotonic increasewith time, whose amplitudes are up to two order-of-magnitudes larger than theones from the convective matter motions outside the protoneutron stars.  we point out that the amplitudes begin to become larger when the growth ofthe sasi enters the nonlinear phase, in which the deformation of the shocks andthe neutrino anisotropy become large. from the spectrum analysis of thewaveforms, we find that the amplitudes from the neutrinos are dominant over theones from the matter motions at the frequency below $\sim 100$ hz, which aresuggested to be within the detection limits of the detectors in the nextgeneration such as lcgt and the advanced ligo for a supernova at 10 kpc.  as a contribution to the gravitational wave background, we show that theamplitudes from this source could be larger at the frequency above $\sim$ 1 hzthan the primordial gravitational wave backgrounds, but unfortunately,invisible to the proposed space-based detectors.

astro-ph;0701643	the g-mode excitation in the proto neutron star by the standing  accretion shock instability	the so-called "acoustic revival mechanism" of core-collapse supernovaproposed recently by the arizona group is an interesting new possibility.aiming to understand the elementary processes involved in the mechanism, wehave calculated the eigen frequencies and eigen functions for the g-modeoscillations of a non-rotating proto neutron star. the possible excitation ofthese modes by the standing accretion shock instability, or sasi, is discussedbased on these eigen functions. we have formulated the forced oscillations of$g$-modes by the external pressure perturbations exerted on the proto neutronstar surface. the driving pressure fluctuations have been adopted from ourprevious computations of the axisymmetric sasi in the non-linear regime. wehave paid particular attention to low l modes, since these are the modes thatare dominant in sasi and that the arizona group claimed played an importantrole in their acoustic revival scenario. here l is the index of the sphericalharmonic functions, $y_l^m$. although the frequency spectrum of the non-linearsasi is broadened substantially by non-linear couplings, the typical frequencyis still much smaller than those of g-modes, the fact leading to a severeimpedance mismatch. as a result, the excitations of various $g$-modes arerather inefficient and the energy of the saturated g-modes is $\sim 10^{50}$ergor smaller, with the g_2-mode being the largest in our model. here the g_2-modehas two radial nodes and is confined to the interior of the convection region.the energy transfer rate from the g-modes to out-going sound waves is estimatedfrom the growth of the g-modes and found to be $\sim 10^{51}$erg/s in the modelstudied in this paper.

astro-ph;0702476	effects of qcd phase transition on gravitational radiation from  two-dimensional collapse and bounce of massive stars	we perform two-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamical core-collapse simulationsof massive stars accompanying the qcd phase transition. we study how the phasetransition affects the gravitational waveforms near the epoch of core-bounce.as for initial models, we change the strength of rotation and magnetic fields.particularly, the degree of differential rotation in the iron core (fe-core) ischanged parametrically. as for the microphysics, we adopt a phenomenologicalequation of state above the nuclear density, including two parameters to changethe hardness before the transition. we assume the first order phase transition,where the conversion of bulk nuclear matter to a chirally symmetric quark-gluonphase is described by the mit bag model. based on these computations, we findthat the phase transition can make the maximum amplitudes larger up to $\sim$10 percents than the ones without the phase transition. on the other hand, themaximum amplitudes become smaller up to $\sim$ 10 percents owing to the phasetransition, when the degree of the differential rotation becomes larger. wefind that even extremely strong magnetic fields $\sim 10^{17}$ g in theprotoneutron star do not affect these results.

0705.4350	numerical study on stellar core collapse and neutrino emission: probe  into the spherically symmetric black hole progenitors with 3 - 30msun iron  cores	the existence of various anomalous stars, such as the first stars in theuniverse or stars produced by stellar mergers, has been recently proposed. someof these stars will result in black hole formation. in this study, weinvestigate iron core collapse and black hole formation systematically for theiron-core mass range of 3 - 30msun, which has not been studied well so far.models used here are mostly isentropic iron cores that may be produced inmerged stars in the present universe but we also employ a model that is meantfor a population iii star and is obtained by evolutionary calculation. we solvenumerically the general relativistic hydrodynamics and neutrino transferequations simultaneously, treating neutrino reactions in detail under sphericalsymmetry. as a result, we find that massive iron cores with ~10msununexpectedly produce a bounce owing to the thermal pressure of nucleons beforeblack hole formation. the features of neutrino signals emitted from suchmassive iron cores differ in time evolution and spectrum from those of ordinarysupernovae. firstly, the neutronization burst is less remarkable or disappearscompletely for more massive models because the density is lower at the bounce.secondly, the spectra of neutrinos, except the electron type, are softer owingto the electron-positron pair creation before the bounce. we also study theeffects of the initial density profile, finding that the larger the initialdensity gradient is, the more steeply the neutronization burst declines.further more, we suggest a way to probe into the black hole progenitors fromthe neutrino emission and estimate the event number for the currently operatingneutrino detectors.

astro-ph;9709149	explosive nucleosynthesis in axisymmetrically deformed type ii  supernovae	explosive nucleosynthesis under the axisymmetric explosion in type iisupernova has been performed by means of two dimensional hydrodynamicalcalculations. we have compared the results with the observations of sn 1987a.our chief findings are as follows: (1) $^{44}ti$ is synthesized so much as toexplain the tail of the bolometric light curve of sn 1987a. we think this isbecause the alpha-rich freezeout takes place more actively under theaxisymmetric explosion. (2) $^{57}ni$ and $^{58}ni$ tend to be overproducedcompared with the observations. however, this tendency relies strongly on theprogenitor's model.  we have also compared the abundance of each element in the mass number range$a= 16-73$ with the solar values. we have found three outstanding features. (1)for the nuclei in the range $a=16-40$, their abundances are insensitive to theinitial form of the shock wave. this insensitivity is favored since thespherical calculations thus far can explain the solar system abundances in thismass range. (2) there is an enhancement around a=45 in the axisymmetricexplosion compared with the spherical explosion fairly well. in particular,$^{44}ca$, which is underproduced in the present spherical calculations, isenhanced significantly. (3) in addition, there is an enhancement around a=65.this tendency does not rely on the form of the mass cut but of the initialshock wave. this enhancement may be the problem of the overproduction in thismass range, although this effect would be relatively small since type isupernovae are chiefly responsible for this mass number range.

astro-ph;9809009	neutrino transport in type ii supernovae: boltzmann solver vs. monte  carlo method	we have coded a boltzmann solver based on a finite difference scheme (s_nmethod) aiming at calculations of neutrino transport in type ii supernovae.close comparison between the boltzmann solver and a monte carlo transport codehas been made for realistic atmospheres of post bounce core models under theassumption of a static background. we have also investigated in detail thedependence of the results on the numbers of radial, angular, and energy gridpoints and the way to discretize the spatial advection term which is used inthe boltzmann solver. a general relativistic calculation has been done for oneof the models. we find overall good agreement between the two methods. however,because of a relatively small number of angular grid points (which isinevitable due to limitations of the computation time) the boltzmann solvertends to underestimate the flux factor and the eddington factor outside the(mean) ``neutrinosphere'' where the angular distribution of the neutrinosbecomes highly anisotropic. this fact suggests that one has to be cautious inapplying the boltzmann solver to a calculation of the neutrino heating in thehot-bubble region because it might tend to overestimate the local energydeposition rate. a comparison shows that this trend is opposite to the resultsobtained with a multi-group flux-limited diffusion approximation of neutrinotransport. the accuracy of the boltzmann solver can be considerably improved byusing a variable angular mesh to increase the angular resolution in thesemi-transparent regime.

astro-ph;9907044	neutrino - nucleon reaction rates in the supernova core in the  relativistic random phase approximation	in view of the application to supernova simulations, we calculate neutrinoreaction rates with nucleons via the neutral and charged currents in thesupernova core in the relativistic random phase approximation (rpa) and studytheir effects on the opacity of the supernova core. the formulation is based onthe lagrangian employed in the calculation of nuclear equation of state (eos)in the relativistic mean field theory (rmf). the nonlinear meson terms aretreated appropriately so that the consistency of the density correlationderived in rpa with the thermodynamic derivative obtained from eos by rmf issatisfied in the static and long wave length limit. we employ pion and rhomeson exchange interactions together with the phenomenological landau-migdalparameters for the isospin-dependent nuclear interactions. we find that boththe charged and neutral current reaction rates are suppressed from the standardbruenn's approximate formula considerably in the high density regime. in thelow density regime, on the other hand, the vector current contribution to theneutrino-nucleon scattering rate is enhanced in the vicinity of the boundary ofthe liquid-gas phase transition, while the other contributions are moderatelysuppressed there also. in the high temperature regime or in the regime whereelectrons have a large chemical potential, the latter of which is importantonly for the electron capture process and its inverse process, the recoil ofnucleons cannot be neglected and further reduces the reaction rates withrespect to the standard approximate formula which discards any energy transferin the processes. these issues could have a great impact on the neutrinoheating mechanism of collapse-driven supernovae.

0811.0651	effects of rotation on standing accretion shock instability in nonlinear  phase for core-collapse supernovae	we studied the effects of rotation on standing accretion shock instability(sasi) by performing three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. taking intoaccount a realistic equation of state and neutrino heating/cooling, we prepareda spherically symmmetric and steady accretion flow through a standing shockwave onto a proto-neutron star (pns). when the sasi entered the nonlinearphase, we imposed uniform rotation on the flow advecting from the outerboundary of the iron core, whose specific angular momentum was assumed to agreewith recent stellar evolution models. using spherical harmonics in space andfourier decompositions in time, we performed mode analysis of the nonsphericaldeformed shock wave to observe rotational effects on the sasi in the nonlinearphase. we found that rotation imposed on the axisymmetric sasi did not make anyspiral modes and hardly affected sloshing modes, except for steady l=2, m=0modes. in contrast, rotation imposed on the non-axisymmetric flow increased theamplitude of spiral modes so that some spiral flows accreting on the pns weremore clearly formed inside the shock wave than without rotation. the amplitudesof spiral modes increased significantly with rotation in the progressivedirection.
