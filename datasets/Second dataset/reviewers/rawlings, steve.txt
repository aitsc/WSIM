0901.2517	evidence of a link between the evolution of clusters and their agn  fraction	we discuss the optical properties, x-ray detections, and active galacticnucleus (agn) populations of four clusters at z ~ 1 in the subaru-xmm deepfield (sxdf). the velocity distribution and plausible extended x-ray detectionsare examined, as well as the number of x-ray point sources and radio sourcesassociated with the clusters. we find that the two clusters that appearvirialised and have an extended x-ray detection contain few, if any, agn,whereas the two pre-virialised clusters have a large agn population. thisconstitutes evidence that the agn fraction in clusters is linked to theclusters' evolutionary stage. the number of x-ray agn in the pre-virialisedclusters is consistent with an overdensity of factor ~ 200; the radio agnappear to be clustered with a factor of three to six higher. the median k-bandluminosities of l_k = 1.7 +/- 0.7 l* for the x-ray sources and l_k = 2.3 +/-0.1 l* for the radio sources support the theory that these agn are triggered bygalaxy interaction and merging events in sub-groups with low internal velocitydistributions, which make up the cluster environment in a pre-virialisationevolutionary stage.

0905.4311	forecasts for dark energy measurements with future hi surveys	we use two independent methods to forecast the dark energy measurementsachievable by combining future galaxy redshift surveys based on the radio hiemission line with cosmic microwave background (cmb) data from the {\sl planck}satellite. in the first method we focus on the `standard ruler' provided by thebaryon acoustic oscillation (bao) length scale. in the second method we utilizeadditional information encoded in the galaxy power spectrum including galaxybias from velocity-space distortions and the growth of cosmic structure. wefind that a radio synthesis array with about 10 per cent of the collecting areaof the square kilometre array (ska), equipped with a wide ($10-100 ~ {\rmdeg}^2$) field-of-view, would have the capacity to perform a $20{,}000 ~ {\rmdeg}^2$ redshift survey to a maximum redshift $z_{\rm max} \sim 0.8$ andthereby produce dark energy measurements that are competitive with surveyslikely to be undertaken by optical telescopes around 2015. there would then bepowerful arguments for adding collecting area to such a `phase-1' ska becauseof the square-law scaling of survey speed with telescope sensitivity for hisurveys, compared to the linear scaling for optical redshift surveys. the fullska telescope should, by performing a $20{,}000 ~ {\rm deg}^2$ hi redshiftsurvey to $z_{\rm max} \sim 2$ around 2020, yield an accurate measurement ofcosmological parameters independent of cmb datasets. combining cmb ({\slplanck}) and galaxy power spectrum (ska) measurements will drive errors in thedark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$ well below the 1 per cent level.the major systematic uncertainty in these forecasts is the lack of directinformation about the mass function of high-redshift hi-emitting galaxies.

0907.1447	the discovery of a typical radio galaxy at z = 4.88	in this letter we report the discovery of a z=4.88 radio galaxy discoveredwith a new technique which does not rely on pre-selection of a sample based onradio properties such as steep-spectral index or small angular size. this radiogalaxy was discovered in the elais-n2 field and has a spectral index of alpha =0.75, i.e. not ultra-steep spectrum. it also has a luminosity consistent withbeing drawn from the break of the radio luminosity function and can thereforebe considered as a typical radio galaxy. using the spitzer-swire data over thisfield we find that the host galaxy is consistent with being similarly massiveto the lower redshift powerful radio galaxies (~1-3l*). we note however, thatat z=4.88 the h-alpha line is redshifted into the irac 3.6micron filter andsome of the flux in this band may be due to this rather than stellar continuumemission. the discovery of such a distant radio source from our initialspectroscopic observations demonstrate the promise of our survey for findingthe most distant radio sources.

0908.0724	compactness of cold gas in high-redshift galaxies	galaxies in the early universe were more compact and contained more moleculargas than today. in this paper, we revisit the relation between these empiricalfindings, and we quantitatively predict the cosmic evolution of the surfacedensities of atomic (hi) and molecular (h2) hydrogen in regular galaxies. ourmethod uses a pressure-based model for the h2/hi-ratio of the interstellarmedium, applied to ~3*10^7 virtual galaxies in the millennium simulation. wepredict that, on average, the hi-surface density of these galaxies saturates atsigma_hi&lt;10 msun/pc^2 at all redshifts (z), while h2-surface densities evolvedramatically as sigma_h2(1+z)^2.4. this scaling is dominated by a (1+z)^2surface brightness scaling originating from the (1+z)^-1 size scaling ofgalaxies at high z. current measurements of sigma_h2 at high z, derived fromco-observations, tend to have even higher values, which can be quantitativelyexplained by a selection bias towards merging systems. however, despite theconsistency between our high-z predictions and the sparse empirical data, weemphasize that the empirical data potentially suffer from serious selectionbiases and that the semi-analytic models remain in many regards uncertain. as acase study, we investigate the cosmic evolution of simulated galaxies, whichresemble the milky way at z=0. we explicitly predict their hi- andh2-distribution at z=1.5, corresponding to the co-detected galaxy bzk-21000,and at z=3, corresponding to the primary science goal of the atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma).

0908.0983	a virtual sky with extragalactic hi and co lines for the ska and alma	we present a sky simulation of the atomic hi emission line and the first tenco rotational emission lines of molecular gas in galaxies beyond the milky way.the simulated sky field has a comoving diameter of 500/h mpc, hence the actualfield-of-view depends on the (user-defined) maximal redshift zmax; e.g. forzmax=10, the field of view yields ~4x4 sqdeg. for all galaxies, we estimate theline fluxes, line profiles, and angular sizes of the hi and co emission lines.the galaxy sample is complete for galaxies with cold hydrogen masses above 10^8msun. this sky simulation builds on a semi-analytic model of the cosmicevolution of galaxies in a lambda-cold dark matter (lcdm) cosmology. theevolving cdm-distribution was adopted from the millennium simulation, an n-bodycdm-simulation in a cubic box with a side length of 500/h mpc. this side lengthlimits the coherence scale of our sky simulation: it is long enough to allowthe extraction of the baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) in the galaxy powerspectrum, yet the position and amplitude of the first acoustic peak will beimperfectly defined. this sky simulation is a tangible aid to the design andoperation of future telescopes, such the ska, the lmt, and alma. the resultspresented in this paper have been restricted to a graphical representation ofthe simulated sky and fundamental dn/dz-analyzes for peak flux density limitedand total flux limited surveys of hi and co. a key prediction is that hi willbe harder to detect at redshifts z&gt;2 than predicted by a no-evolution model.the future verification or falsification of this prediction will allow us toqualify the semi-analytic models.

0910.1099	millimetre observations of a sample of high-redshift obscured quasars	we present observations at 1.2 mm with mambo-ii of a sample of z&gt;~2radio-intermediate obscured quasars, as well as co observations of two sourceswith the plateau de bure interferometer. five out of 21 sources (24%) aredetected at a significance of &gt;=3sigma. stacking all sources leads to astatistical detection of &lt;s_1.2mm&gt;= 0.96+-0.11 mjy and stacking only thenon-detections also yields a statistical detection, with &lt;s_1.2mm&gt;= 0.51+-0.13mjy. this corresponds to a typical far-infrared luminosity l_fir~4x10^12 lsol.if the far-infrared luminosity is powered entirely by star-formation, and notby agn-heated dust, then the characteristic inferred star-formation rate is~700 msol yr-1. this far-infrared luminosity implies a dust mass ofm_dust~3x10^8 msol. we estimate that such large dust masses on kpc scales canplausibly cause the obscuration of the quasars. we present dust seds for oursample and derive a mean sed for our sample. this mean sed is not well fittedby clumpy torus models, unless additional extinction and far-infraredre-emission due to cool dust are included. there is a hint that the hostgalaxies of obscured quasars must have higher far-infrared luminosities andcool-dust masses and are therefore often found at an earlier evolutionary phasethan those of unobscured quasars. for one source at z=2.767, we detect theco(3-2) transition, with s_co delta nu=630+-50 mjy km s-1, corresponding tol_co(3-2)= 3.2x10^7 lsol, or l'_co(3-2)=2.4x10^10 k km s-1 pc2. for anothersource at z=4.17, the lack of detection of the co(4-3) line yields a limit ofl'_co(4-3)&lt;1x10^10 k km s-1 pc2. molecular gas masses, gas depletion timescalesand gas-to-dust ratios are estimated (abridged).

1004.1099	evidence of different star formation histories for high- and  low-luminosity radio galaxies	we present the results of our investigation into the stellar populations of24 radio galaxies at z~0.5 drawn from four complete, low-frequency selectedradio surveys. we use the strength of the 4000a break as an indicator of recentstar formation, and compare this with radio luminosity, optical spectralclassification and morphological classification. we find evidence of differentstar formation histories for high- and low-luminosity radio sources; our groupof low radio luminosity sources (typically fri-type sources) has systematicallyolder stellar populations than the higher radio luminosity group. our sample isalso fairly well divided by optical spectral classification. we find thatgalaxies classified as having low excitation spectra (legs) possess olderstellar populations than high excitation line objects (hegs), with the hegsshowing evidence for recent star formation. we also investigate the linkbetween radio morphology, as used by owen &amp; laing (1989), and the stellarpopulations. we find that there is a preference for the "fat-double" sources tohave older stellar populations than the "classical double" sources, althoughthis is also linked to these sources lying predominantly in the leg and hegcategories respectively. these results are consistent with the hypothesis thathegs are powered by accretion of cold gas, which could be supplied, forexample, by recent mergers, secular instabilities, or filamentary cold flows.these processes could also trigger star formation in the host galaxy. the hostgalaxies of the legs do not show evidence for recent star formation and aninflux of cold gas, and are consistent with being powered by the accretion ofthe hot phase of the inter-stellar medium.

1008.2344	the evolution of the fundamental plane of radio galaxies from z~0.5 to  the present day	we present deep spectroscopic data for a 24-object subsample of our full41-object z~0.5 radio galaxy sample in order to investigate the evolution ofthe fundamental plane of radio galaxies. we find that the low-luminosity,fri-type, radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with the localfundamental plane of radio galaxies defined by bettoni et al. when correctedfor simple passive evolution of their stellar populations. however, we findthat the higher luminosity, frii-type radio galaxies are inconsistent with thelocal fundamental plane if only passive evolution is considered, and findevidence for a rotation in the fundamental plane at z~0.5 when compared withthe local relation. we show that neither passive evolution, nor amass-dependent evolution in the mass-to-light ratio, nor an evolution in thesize of the host galaxies can, by themselves, plausibly explain the observedtilt. however, we suggest that some combination of all three effects, with sizeevolution as the dominant factor, may be sufficient to explain the differencebetween the planes. we also find evidence for a correlation between host galaxyvelocity dispersion and radio luminosity at the 97% significance level withinour sub-sample, although further observations are required in order todetermine whether this is different for the fri and frii radio sources.assuming that the m_bh - sigma relation still holds at z~0.5, this implies thatradio luminosity scales with black hole mass, in agreement with previousstudies.

0708.3838	spectroscopic follow-up of a cluster candidate at z = 1.45	we have obtained deep optical spectroscopic data of the highest-redshiftcluster candidate (z ~ 1.4, cvb13) selected by van breukelen et al. (2006) in aphotometric optical/infrared catalogue of the subaru xmm-newton deep field. thedata, which comprise 104 targeted galaxies, were taken with the deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph (deimos) on the keck 2 telescope and yielded 31secure redshifts in the range 1.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.54 within a 7' x 4' field centred oncvb13. instead of one massive cluster at z = 1.4, we find evidence for threeprojected structures at z = 1.40, z = 1.45, and z = 1.48. the moststatistically robust of these structures, at z = 1.454, has sixspectroscopically confirmed galaxies. its total mass is estimated at &gt; 10^14m_sun and it may therefore be termed a cluster. there is an x-ray source at thecluster position which is marginally spatially resolved but whose x-rayspectrum is too hard to be thermal cluster emission. its origin could be thesummed x-ray emission from active galaxies in, and projected onto, the cluster.serendipitously we have discovered a cluster at z = 1.28 with a mass of &gt; 10^14m_sun at the same position on the sky, comprising six spectroscopicallyconfirmed cluster galaxies and at least one additional radio source. theselection of cvb13 for the cluster catalogue was evidently aided by thesuperposition of other, presumably lower-mass, structures, whereas the singlecluster at z = 1.28 contained too few galaxies to be isolated by the samealgorithm. given the complicated nature of such structures, caution must beemployed when measuring the mass function of putative high-redshift clusterswith photometric techniques alone.

1010.0691	evidence for a maximum jet efficiency for the most powerful radio  galaxies	we use new mid-infrared (mid-ir) photometry from the spitzer space telescopeto study the relations between low-frequency radio luminosity density l_151mhz,mid-ir (12um rest-frame) luminosity l_12um, and optical-emission-line ([oii])luminosity l_[oii], for a complete sample of z~1 radio galaxies from the 3crr,6ce, 6c*, 7crs and toot00 surveys. the narrow redshift span of our sample(0.9&lt;z&lt;1.1) means that it is unbiased to evolutionary effects. we find evidencethat these three quantities are positively correlated. the scaling betweenl_12um and l_[oii] is similar to that seen in other agn samples, consistentwith both l_12um and l_[oii] tracing accretion rate. we show that the positivecorrelation between l_12um and l_151mhz implies that there is a genuine lack ofobjects with low values of l_12um at high values of l_151mhz. given that l_12umtraces accretion rate, while l_151mhz traces jet power, this can be understoodin terms of a minimum accretion rate being necessary to produce a given jetpower. this implies that there is a maximum efficiency with which accretedenergy can be chanelled into jet power and that this efficiency is of orderunity.

1102.2228	observational constraints on the spin of the most massive black holes  from radio observations	we use recent progress in simulating the production of magnetohydrodynamicjets around black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massiveblack holes, with masses &gt;~10^8 msol. assuming the jet efficiency depends onspin a, we can approximately reproduce the observed `radio loudness' of quasarsand the local radio luminosity function. using the x-ray luminosity functionand the local mass function of supermassive black holes, smbhs we can reproducethe individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- andlow-excitation narrow emission lines. the data favour spin distributions thatare bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximalspin. in the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similaramplitudes. for the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spinpeak is typically much smaller than that of the low-spin peak. a bimodalityshould be seen in the radio loudness of quasars. we predict that thelow-excitation galaxies are dominated by smbhs with masses &gt;~10^8 msol, down toradio luminosity densities ~10^21 w hz-1 sr-1 at 1.4~ghz. our model is alsoable to predict the radio luminosity function at z=1, and predicts it to bedominated by high-excitation galaxies above luminosity densities &gt;~10^26 w hz-1sr-1, in full agreement with the observations. from our parametrisation andusing the best fitting jet efficiencies there is marginal evidence forevolution in spin: the mean spin increases slightly from &lt;a&gt;~0.25 at z=1 to&lt;a&gt;~0.35 at z=0, and the fraction of smbhs with a&gt;=0.5 increases from0.16+-0.03 at z=1 to 0.24+-0.09 at z=0. our results are in excellent agreementwith the mean radiative efficiency of quasars, as well as recent cosmologicalsimulations. we discuss the implications in terms of accretion and smbhmergers, and galactic black holes (abridged).

1109.0997	evidence for cosmic evolution in the spin of the most massive black  holes	we use results from simulations of the production of magnetohydrodynamic jetsaround black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massive blackholes. we assume that the efficiency of jet production is a monotonic functionof spin a, as given by the simulations, and that the accretion flow geometry issimilarly thick for quasars accreting close to the eddington ratio and forlow-excitation radio galaxies accreting at very small eddington rates. we usethe ratio of the comoving densities of the jet power and the radiated accretionpower associated with supermassive black holes with mbh&gt;~10^8 msol to estimatethe cosmic history of the characteristic spin a. the evolution of this ratio,which increases with decreasing z, is consistent with a picture where the z~0active galactic nuclei have typically higher spins than those at z~2 (withtypical values a~0.35-0.95 and a~0.0-0.25 respectively). we discuss theimplications in terms of the relative importance of accretion and mergers inthe growth of supermassive black holes with mbh&gt;~10^8 msol.

1109.2514	evolution of the milky way in semi-analytic models: detecting cold gas  at z=3 with alma and ska	we forecast the abilities of the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array(alma) and the square kilometer array (ska) to detect co and hi emission linesin galaxies at redshift z=3. a particular focus is set on milky way (mw)progenitors at z=3 for their detection within 24 h constitutes a key sciencegoal of alma. the analysis relies on a semi-analytic model, which permits theconstruction of a mw progenitor sample by backtracking the cosmic history ofall simulated present-day galaxies similar to the real mw. results: (i) almacan best observe a mw at z=3 by looking at co(3-2) emission. the probability ofdetecting a random model mw at 3-sigma in 24 h using 75 km/s channels isroughly 50%, and these odds can be increased by co-adding the co(3-2) andco(4-3) lines. these lines fall into alma band 3, which therefore representsthe optimal choice towards mw detections at z=3. (ii) higher co transitionscontained in the alma bands geq6 will be invisible, unless the considered mwprogenitor coincidentally hosts a major starburst or an active black hole.(iii) the high-frequency array of ska, fitted with 28.8 ghz receivers, would bea powerful instrument for observing co(1-0) at z=3, able to detect nearly allsimulated mws in 24 h. (iv) hi detections in mws at z=3 using the low-frequencyarray of ska will be impossible in any reasonable observing time. (v) ska willnonetheless be a supreme ha survey instrument through its enormousinstantaneous field-of-view (fov). a one year pointed hi survey with an assumedfov of 410 sqdeg would reveal at least 10^5 galaxies at z=2.95-3.05. (vi) ifthe positions and redshifts of those galaxies are known from anoptical/infrared spectroscopic survey, stacking allows the detection of hi atz=3 in less than 24 h.

1201.3225	radio imaging of the subaru/xmm-newton deep field - iii. evolution of  the radio luminosity function beyond z=1	we present spectroscopic and eleven-band photometric redshifts for galaxiesin the 100-ujy subaru/xmm-newton deep field radio source sample. we find goodagreement between our redshift distribution and that predicted by the skasimulated skies project. we find no correlation between k-band magnitude andradio flux, but show that sources with 1.4-ghz flux densities below ~1mjy arefainter in the near-infrared than brighter radio sources at the same redshift,and we discuss the implications of this result for spectroscopically-incompletesamples where the k-z relation has been used to estimate redshifts. we use theinfrared--radio correlation to separate our sample into radio-loud andradio-quiet objects and show that only radio-loud hosts have spectral energydistributions consistent with predominantly old stellar populations, althoughthe fraction of objects displaying such properties is a decreasing function ofradio luminosity. we calculate the 1.4-ghz radio luminosity function (rlf) inredshift bins to z=4 and find that the space density of radio sources increaseswith lookback time to z~2, with a more rapid increase for more powerfulsources. we demonstrate that radio-loud and radio-quiet sources of the sameradio luminosity evolve very differently. radio-quiet sources display strongevolution to z~2 while radio-loud agns below the break in the radio luminosityfunction evolve more modestly and show hints of a decline in their spacedensity at z&gt;1, with this decline occurring later for lower-luminosity objects.if the radio luminosities of these sources are a function of their black holespins then slowly-rotating black holes must have a plentiful fuel supply forlonger, perhaps because they have yet to encounter the major merger that willspin them up and use the remaining gas in a major burst of star formation.

0802.2694	exploring the infrared/radio correlation at high redshift	we have analysed the 24um properties of a radio-selected sample in thesubaru-xmm/newton deep field in order to explore the behaviour of the fir/radiorelation at high redshifts. statistically, the correlation is described by q24,the ratio between the observed flux densities at 24um and 1.4ghz, respectively.using 24um data results in considerably more scatter in the correlation thanprevious work using data at 60-70um. nevertheless, we do observe a steadycorrelation as a function of redshift, up to z~3.5, suggesting its validityback to primeval times. we find q24 = 0.30 +/- 0.56 for the observed and q24 =0.71 +/- 0.47 for the k-corrected radio sample, based on sources with 300ujy &lt;s(1.4ghz) &lt; 3.2mjy and 24um detections. a suitable k-correction given by am82-like mid-ir template suggests no extreme silicate absorption in the bulk ofour radio sample. using thresholds in q24 to identify radio-excess sources, wehave been able to characterise the transition from radio-loud agn tostar-forming galaxies and radio-quiet agn at faint (&lt;1mjy) radio fluxdensities. our results are in broad agreement with previous studies which showa dominant radio-loud agn population at &gt;1mjy. the rest-frame u-b colours ofthe expected radio-excess population have redder distribution than those thatfollow the correlation. this is therefore a promising way to select obscuredtype-2 agn, with a radio loud nature, missed by deep x-ray observations.spectroscopic follow-up of these sources is required to fully test this method.

0803.2801	the subaru/xmm-newton deep field - ii. the 37 brightest radio sources	we study the 37 brightest radio sources in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field(sxdf). we have spectroscopic redshifts for 24 of 37 objects and photometricredshifts for the remainder, yielding a median redshift z_med for the wholesample of z_med ~= 1.1 and a median radio luminosity close to the `fri/frii'luminosity divide. using mid-ir (spitzer mips 24 um) data we expect to tracenuclear accretion activity, even if it is obscured at optical wavelengths,unless the obscuring column is extreme. our results suggest that above thefri/frii radio luminosity break most of the radio sources are associated withobjects that have excess mid-ir emission, only some of which are broad-lineobjects, although there is one clear low-accretion-rate object with an friradio structure. for extended steep-spectrum radio sources, the fraction ofobjects with mid-ir excess drops dramatically below the fri/frii luminositybreak, although there exists at least one high-accretion-rate `radio-quiet'qso. we have therefore shown that the strong link between radio luminosity (orradio structure) and accretion properties, well known at z ~ 0.1, persists to z~ 1. investigation of mid-ir and blue excesses shows that they are correlatedas predicted by a model in which, when significant accretion exists, a torus ofdust absorbs ~30% of the light, and the dust above and below the torus scatters&gt;~1% of the light.

astro-ph;0001327	the spectra and energies of classical double radio lobes	we compare two temporal properties of classical double radio sources: i)radiative lifetimes of synchrotron-emitting particles and ii) dynamical sourceages. we discuss how these can be quite discrepant from one another, renderinguse of the traditional spectral ageing method inappropriate: we contend thatspectral ages give meaningful estimates of dynamical ages only when these agesare &lt;&lt; 10^7 years. in juxtaposing the fleeting radiative lifetimes with sourceages which are significantly longer, a refinement of the paradigm for radiosource evolution is required. the changing spectra along lobes are explained,not predominantly by synchrotron ageing but, by gentle gradients in a magneticfield mediated by a low-gamma matrix which illuminates an energy-distributionof particles, controlled largely by classical synchrotron loss in the highmagnetic field of the hotspot. the energy in the particles is an order ofmagnitude higher than that inferred from the minimum-energy estimate, implyingthat the jet-power is of the same order as the accretion luminosity produced bythe quasar central engine. this refined paradigm points to a resolution of thefindings of rudnick et al (1994) and katz-stone &amp; rudnick (1994) that both thejaffe-perola and kardashev-pacholczyk model spectra are invariably poordescriptions of the curved spectral shape of lobe emission, and indeed that forcygnus a all regions of the lobes are characterised by a `universal spectrum'.[abridged]

astro-ph;0003461	the quasar fraction in low-frequency selected complete samples and  implications for unified schemes	low-frequency radio surveys are ideal for selecting orientation-independentsamples of extragalactic sources because the sample members are selected byvirtue of their isotropic steep-spectrum extended emission. we use the new 7credshift survey along with the brighter 3crr and 6c samples to investigate thefraction of objects with observed broad emission lines - the `quasar fraction'- as a function of redshift and of radio and narrow emission line luminosity.we find that the quasar fraction is more strongly dependent upon luminosity(both narrow line and radio) than it is on redshift. above a narrow [oii]emission line luminosity of log l_[oii] &gt; 35 w (or radio luminosity log l_151 &gt;26.5 w/hz/sr), the quasar fraction is virtually independent of redshift andluminosity; this is consistent with a simple unified scheme with an obscuringtorus with a half-opening angle theta_trans approx 53 degrees. for objects withless luminous narrow lines, the quasar fraction is lower. we show that this isnot due to the difficulty of detecting lower-luminosity broad emission lines ina less luminous, but otherwise similar, quasar population. we discuss evidencewhich supports at least two probable physical causes for the drop in quasarfraction at low luminosity: (i) a gradual decrease in theta_trans and/or agradual increase in the fraction of lightly-reddened (0 &lt; a(v) &lt; 5)lines-of-sight with decreasing quasar luminosity; and (ii) the emergence of adistinct second population of low luminosity radio sources which, like m87,lack a well-fed quasar nucleus and may well lack a thick obscuring torus.

astro-ph;0006081	on the redshift cut-off for flat-spectrum radio sources	we use data from the parkes half-jansky flat-spectrum (phjfs) sample(drinkwater et al. 1997) to constrain the cosmic evolution in the co-movingspace density of radio sources in the top decade of the flat-spectrum radioluminosity function (rlf). a consistent picture for the high-redshift evolutionis achieved using both simple parametric models, which are the first to allowfor distributions in both radio luminosity and spectral index, and variants ofthe v / v_max test, some of which incorporate the effects of radio spectralcurvature. for the most luminous flat-spectrum objects, the phjfs sample isextremely similar to that used by shaver et al. (1996, 1998) to argue for anabrupt `redshift cut-off': a decrease by a factor ~30 in space density betweena peak redshift z~2.5 and z~5. our analysis finds that the observable co-movingvolume is too small to make definitive statements about any redshift cut-offfor the most luminous flat-spectrum sources, although both constant-spacedensity (no cut-off) models and models with cut-offs as abrupt as thoseenvisaged by shaver et al. are outside the 90% confidence region. the inferencethat the decline in space density is most likely to be gradual, by a factor ~4between z~2.5 and z~5, is in accordance with previous work on the rlf by dunlop&amp; peacock (1990), but different to the abrupt decline favoured by studies ofoptically-selected quasars. dust obscuration provides one explanation for thisdifference. we show that a significant fraction of the most radio-luminousflat-spectrum objects are giga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) rather thandoppler-boosted (db) sources, complicating any interpretation of the redshiftcut-off.

astro-ph;0008067	cosmological studies from radio source samples	i review some recent cosmological studies based on redshift surveys of radiosources selected at low frequencies. the accretion rate onto the central blackhole is identified as the basis of a crude physical division of thelow-frequency population into two sub-populations: the first comprises`eddington-tuned' (high accretion rate) quasars and their torus-hiddencounterparts; the second comprises `starved quasars' like m87. there existremarkable similarities between the shapes and evolutionary behaviours of theluminosity functions of radio sources and radio-quiet quasars; all luminous agnare $\sim300-$times rarer at epochs corresponding to $z \sim 0$ than at $z \sim2.5$. i argue that any evidence that quasars were intrinsically rarer at $z\sim 5$ than at $z \sim 2.5$ is as yet both tentative and indirect. a simplecalculation suggests that the radio source population has been over-looked as apotentially important contributor to the entropy budget of the universe. arecent sub-mm survey of radio sources is used to demonstrate a connectionbetween the events which trigger jets and intense bursts of star formation, anda close link between the histories of star formation and agn activity isproposed. i discuss the aims and methods of future large redshift surveys ofradio sources, emphasising the importance of dovetailing these with thedevelopment of robust physical models for radio sources and theirepoch-dependent environments.

astro-ph;0010419	the radio luminosity function from the low-frequency 3crr, 6ce &amp; 7crs  complete samples	we measure the radio luminosity function (rlf) of steep-spectrum radiosources using three redshift surveys of flux-limited samples selected at low(151 &amp; 178 mhz) radio frequency, low-frequency source counts and the local rlf.the redshift surveys used are the new 7c redshift survey (7crs) and thebrighter 3crr and 6ce surveys totalling 356 sources with virtually completeredshift information. this yields unprecedented coverage of the radioluminosity versus z plane for steep-spectrum sources, and hence the mostaccurate measurements of the steep-spectrum rlf yet made. we find that a simpledual-population model for the rlf fits the data well, requiring differentialdensity evolution (with z) for the two populations. the low-luminositypopulation can be associated with radio galaxies with weak emission lines, andincludes sources with both fri and frii radio structures; its comoving spacedensity $\rho$ rises by about one dex between z~0 and z~1 but cannot yet bemeaningfully constrained at higher redshifts. the high-luminosity populationcan be associated with frii radio galaxies and quasars with strong emissionlines; its $\rho$ rises by nearly three dex between z~0 and z~2. these resultsmirror the situation seen in x-ray and optically-selected agn. the integratedradio luminosity density of the combination of the two populations iscontrolled by the value of $\rho$ at the low-luminosity end of the rlf of thehigh-luminosity population, a quantity which has been directly measured at z~1by the 7crs. we argue that robust determination of this quantity at higherredshifts requires a new redshift survey based on a large (~1000 source) sampleabout five times fainter than the 7crs.

astro-ph;0011082	extremely red galaxy counterparts to 7c radio sources	we present rijhk imaging of seven radio galaxies from the 7c redshift survey(7crs) which lack strong emission lines and we use these data to investigatetheir spectral energy distributions (seds) with models which constrain theirredshifts. six of these seven galaxies have extremely red colours (r-k&gt;5.5) andwe find that almost all of them lie in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2. we alsopresent near-infrared spectroscopy of these galaxies which demonstrate thattheir seds are not dominated by emission lines, although tentative lines,consistent with h-alpha at z=1.45 and z=1.61, are found in two objects.although the red colours of the 7crs galaxies can formally be explained bystellar populations which are either very old or young and heavily reddened,independent evidence favours the former hypothesis. at z~1.5 at least 1/4 ofpowerful radio jets are triggered in massive (&gt;l*) galaxies which formed thebulk of their stars several gyr earlier, that is at epochs corresponding toredshifts z&gt;5. if a similar fraction of all z~1.5 radio galaxies are old, thenextrapolation of the radio luminosity function shows that, depending on theradio source lifetimes, between 10-100% of the near-ir selected extremely redobject (ero) population undergo a radio outburst at epochs corresponding to1&lt;z&lt;2. an ero found serendipitously in the field of one of the 7crs radiosources appears to be a radio-quiet analogue of the 7crs eros with an emissionline likely to be [oii] at z=1.20. the implication is that some of the mostmassive elliptical galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at z&gt;5 and theseobjects probably undergo at least two periods of agn activity: one at highredshift during which the black hole forms and another one at an epochcorresponding to z~1.5.

astro-ph;0106127	a sample of 6c radio sources designed to find objects at redshift &gt; 4:  ii --- spectrophotometry and emission line properties	(abridged) this is the second in a series of three papers which present andinterpret basic observational data on the 6c* 151-mhz radio sample: alow-frequency selected sample which exploits filtering criteria based on radioproperties (steep spectral index and small angular size) to find radio sourcesat redshift z &gt; 4 within a 0.133sr patch of sky. we present results of aprogramme of optical spectroscopy which has yielded redshifts in the range 0.5&lt; z &lt; 4.4 for the 29 sources in the sample, all but six of which are secure. wefind that the fil tering criteria used for 6c* are very effective in excludingthe low-redshift, low-luminosity radio sources: the median redshift of 6c* isz~1.9 compared to z~1.1 for a complete sample matched in 151-mhz flux density.by combining the emission-line dataset for the 6c* radio sources with those forthe 3crr, 6ce and 7crs samples we establish that z &gt; 1.75 radio galaxies followa rough proportionality between lyalpha- and 151 mhz-luminosity which, likesimilar correlations seen in samples of lower-redshift radio sources, areindicative of a primary link between the power in the source of thephotoionising photons (most likely a hidden quasar nucleus) and the powercarried by the radio jets. we argue that radio sources modify theirenvironments and that the range of emission-line properties seen is determinedmore by the range of source age than by the range in ambient environment. thisis in accord with the idea that all high-redshift, high-luminosity radiosources are triggered in similar environments, presumably recently collapsedmassive structures.

astro-ph;0106130	a sample of 6c radio sources designed to find objects at redshift &gt; 4:  iii --- imaging and the radio galaxy k-z relation	in this paper, the third and final of a series, we present complete k-bandimaging and some complementary i-band imaging of the filtered 6c* sample. wefind no systematic differences between the k-z relation of 6c* radio galaxiesand those from complete samples, so the near-infrared properties of luminousradio galaxies are not obviously biased by the additional 6c* radio selectioncriteria (steep spectral index and small angular size). the 6c* k-z datasignificantly improve delineation of the k-z relation for radio galaxies athigh-redshift (z &gt;2). accounting for non-stellar contamination, and forcorrelations between radio luminosity and stellar mass, we find little supportfor previous claims that the underlying scatter in the stellar luminosity ofradio galaxies increases significantly at z &gt;2. in a particular spatially-flatuniverse with a cosmological constant, the most luminous radio sources appearto be associated with galaxies with a luminosity distribution with a high mean(~5 lstar), and a low dispersion (sigma ~ 0.5 mag) which formed their stars atepochs corresponding to z &gt;~2.5. this result is in line with recent sub-mmstudies of high-redshift radio galaxies and the inferred ages of extremely redobjects from faint radio samples.

astro-ph;0106473	on the redshift cut-off for steep-spectrum radio sources	we use three samples (3crr, 6ce and 6c*) selected at low radio frequency toconstrain the cosmic evolution in the radio luminosity function (rlf) for the`most luminous' steep-spectrum radio sources. although intrinsically rare, suchsources give the largest possible baseline in redshift for the completeflux-density-limited samples currently available. using parametric models todescribe the rlf which incorporate distributions in radio spectral shape andlinear size as well as the usual luminosity and redshift, we find that the dataare consistent with a constant comoving space density between z~2.5 and z~4.5.we find this model is favoured over a model with similar evolutionary behaviourto that of optically-selected quasars (i.e. a roughly gaussian distribution inredshift) with a probability ratio of ~25:1 and ~100:1 for spatially-flatcosmologies with omega_lambda = 0 and omega_lambda = 0.7 respectively. withinthe uncertainties, this evolutionary behaviour may be reconciled with theshallow decline preferred for the comoving space density of flat-spectrumsources by dunlop &amp; peacock (1990) and jarvis &amp; rawlings (2000), in line withthe expectations of unified schemes.

astro-ph;0109506	detection of a cmb decrement towards a cluster of mjy radiosources	we present the results of radio, optical and near-infrared observations ofthe field of toc j0233.3+3021, a cluster of millijansky radiosources from thetexox cluster survey. in an observation of this field with the ryle telescope(rt) at 15 ghz, we measure a decrement in the cosmic microwave background (cmb)of $-675 \pm 95 \mu$jy on the rt's $\approx$ 0.65 k$\lambda$ baseline. usingoptical and infrared imaging with the mcdonald 2.7-m smith reflector, calaralto 3.5-m telescope and ukirt, we identify the host galaxies of five of theradiosources and measure magnitudes of $r \approx 24$, $j \approx 20$, $k\approx 18$.  the cmb decrement is consistent with the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect of amassive cluster of galaxies, which if modelled as a spherical king profile ofcore radius $\theta_c = 20^{\prime\prime}$ has a central temperature decrementof $900 \mu$k. the magnitudes and colours of the galaxies are consistent withthose of old ellipticals at $z \sim 1$. we therefore conclude that tocj0233.3+3021 is a massive, high redshift cluster. these observations add to thegrowing evidence for a significant population of massive clusters at highredshift, and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining searches for agn`signposts' to clusters with the redshift-independence of the sz effect.

astro-ph;0110157	the optically-powerful quasar e1821+643 is associated with a 300-kpc  scale fri radio structure	we present a deep image of the optically-powerful quasar e1821+643 at 18cmmade with the very large array (vla). this image reveals radio emission, over280 kpc in extent, elongated way beyond the quasar's host galaxy. its radiostructure has decreasing surface brightness with increasing distance from thebright core, characteristic of fri sources (fanaroff &amp; riley 1974). its radioluminosity at 5ghz falls in the classification for `radio-quiet' quasars (it isonly 10^23.9 w/hz/sr; see e.g. kellermann et al 1994). its radio luminosity at151mhz (which is 10^25.3 w/hz/sr) is at the transition luminosity observed toseparate fris and friis. hitherto, no optically-powerful quasar had been foundto have a conventional fri radio structure. for searches at low-frequency thisis unsurprising given current sensitivity and plausible radio spectral indicesfor radio-quiet quasars. we demonstrate the inevitability of the extent of anyfrqi radio structures being seriously under-estimated by existing targettedfollow-up observations of other optically-selected quasars, which are typicallyshort exposures of z &gt; 0.3 objects, and discuss the implications for thepurported radio bimodality in quasars.  the nature of the inner arcsec-scale jet in e1821+643, together with itslarge-scale radio structure, suggest that the jet-axis in this quasar isprecessing (cf. galactic jet sources such as ss433). a possible explanation forthis is that its central engine is a binary whose black holes have yet tocoalesce. the ubiquity of precession in `radio-quiet' quasars, perhaps as ameans of reducing the observable radio luminosity expected in highly-accretingsystems, remains to be established.

astro-ph;0111559	a submillimetre difference between radio galaxies and radio quasars:  evidence for quasar-heated dust and synchronized submillimetre and radio  source activity	we present submillimetre photometry of 11 3cr and 6ce radio quasars ofsimilar 151-mhz radio luminosity and redshifts to the radio galaxies studied at1.3&lt;z&lt;2 by archibald et al. (2001). we detect all bar one quasar at 850microns, and five quasars are confirmed as dusty hyperluminous objects bydetections at shorter wavelengths. our observations reveal a clear differencebetween the submillimetre luminosity distributions of the radio quasars and amatched sample of radio galaxies: the quasars are ~5-times brighter than theradio galaxies and &gt;~2-times brighter accounting for possible synchrotroncontamination. this difference is in quantitative agreement with areceding-torus unified scheme for radio sources in which the torus openingangle depends on quasar optical luminosity, provided that there is a closerelationship between the optical and submillimetre luminosities. theimplication is that quasar-heated dust dominates the submillimetre emission forpowerful radio quasars at z~1.5. we find a significant anti-correlation betweensubmillimetre/far-infrared luminosity l_fir and radio source age in the sensethat hyperluminous quasars tend to be associated with young (&lt;10^7 yr) sources.this suggests that the processes controlling l_fir are synchronized with thejet-triggering event and that l_fir declines on a ~10^7 yr timescale. there isevidence for a small amount of obscuration in the hyperluminous quasars fromreddening and associated or broad absorption lines. we speculate that shortlyafter jet triggering, dust is more widely distributed than at later times andis heated by the quasar nucleus and/or a short-lived synchronized starburst.

astro-ph;0312401	no evidence for a different accretion mode for all 3cr fr i radio  galaxies	we have analyzed the optical and radio properties of a sample of 3cr fr iradio galaxies which have hubble space telescope imaging capable of detectingoptical cores. the jet powers of the fr i radio galaxies are estimated fromtheir low-frequency radio luminosities, and the optical core luminosity istaken as an upper limit on the emission from any unobscured accretion disc. weargue that if the accretion discs in these sources are assumed to be advectiondominated accretion flows (adafs), or adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (adios)flows, then the blandford-znajek mechanism (blandford &amp; znajek 1977) providesinsufficient power to explain the high radio luminosities of at least a third,and perhaps all, of the sample. we suggest instead that a significant fraction(the 'high-jet-power' third), and perhaps most, of the 3cr fr i radio galaxieshave normal accretion discs, but that their optical cores can be hidden, withany hst-detected optical synchrotron emission coming from jets on scales largerthan the obscuring material. a normal accretion disc hypothesis, at least forthe high-jet-power third of the 3cr fr is, explains why narrow-line luminositycorrelates with radio luminosity. it also explains why one object in the sample(3c 386) has an observed broad-line nucleus. we conclude that there is noevidence to suggest that there is a difference in accretion mode between fr iand fr ii radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0412509	implications for unified schemes from submillimetre and far-infrared  follow-up of radio-selected samples	we extend our previous analysis which used generalized luminosity functions(glfs) to predict the number of quasars and galaxies inlow-radio-frequency-selected samples as a function of redshift, radioluminosity, narrow-emission-line luminosity and type of unified scheme. ourextended analysis incorporates the observed submillimetre (850 micron) fluxdensities of radio sources, employs a new method which allows us to deal withnon detections, and focuses on the high-luminosity population. first, weconclude that the submillimetre luminosity l_{850} of low-frequency-selectedradio sources is correlated with the bolometric luminosity l_{bol} of theirquasar nuclei via an approximate scaling relation l_{850} \propto l_{bol}^{0.7\pm 0.2}. second, we conclude that there is quantitative evidence for areceding-torus-like physical process for the high-luminosity population withina two-population unified scheme for radio sources; this evidence comes from thefact that radio quasars are brighter in both narrow emission lines andsubmillimetre luminosity than radio galaxies matched in radio luminosity andredshift. third, we note that the combination of a receding-torus-like schemeand the assumption that the observed submillimetre emission is dominated byquasar-heated dust yields a scaling relation l_{850} \propto l_{bol}^{0.5}which is within the errors of that determined here for radio-selected quasars,and consistent with that inferred for radio-quiet quasars by willott, rawlings&amp; grimes (2003).

astro-ph;9802213	a spectroscopic study of iras f10214+4724	the z=2.286 iras galaxy f10214+4724 remains one of the most luminous galaxiesin the universe, despite its gravitational lens magnification. we presentoptical and near-infrared spectra of f10214+4724, with clear evidence for threedistinct components: lines of width ~1000 km/s from a seyfert-ii nucleus; &lt;~200km/s lines which are likely to be associated with star formation; and a broad~4000 km/s ciii] 1909ang emission line which is blue-shifted by ~1000 km/s withrespect to the seyfert-ii lines. our study of the seyfert-ii component leads toseveral new results, including: (i) from the double-peaked structure in the lyalpha line, and the lack of ly beta, we argue that the ly alpha photons haveemerged through a neutral column of n_h ~ 2.5 x 10^{25}/m^2, possibly locatedwithin the agn narrow-line region as argued in several high redshiftradiogalaxies. (ii) the resonant o vi 1032,1036ang doublet (previouslyidentified as ly beta) is in an optically thick (1:1) ratio. at face value thisimplies an an extreme density (n_e ~ 10^{17}/m^3) more typical of broad lineregion clouds. however, we attribute this instead to the damping wings of lybeta from the resonant absorption. (iii) a tentative detection of heii 1086suggests little extinction in the rest-frame ultraviolet.

astro-ph;9803017	a radio-jet -- galaxy interaction in 3c441	multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopy of the z=0.708 radio galaxy 3c441and a red aligned optical/infrared component are used to show that the moststriking aspect of the radio-optical ``alignment effect'' in this object is dueto the interaction of the radio jet with a companion galaxy in the same groupor cluster. the stellar population of the red aligned continuum component ispredominately old, but with a small post-starburst population superposed, andit is surrounded by a low surface-brightness halo, possibly a face-on spiraldisc. the [oiii]500.7/[oii]372.7 emission line ratio changes dramatically fromone side of the component to the other, with the low-ionisation materialapparently having passed through the bow shock of the radio source and beencompressed. a simple model for the interaction is used to explain the velocityshifts in the emission line gas, and to predict that the ism of the interactinggalaxy is likely to escape once the radio source bow shock has passed though.we also discuss another, much fainter, aligned component, and the sub-arcsecondscale alignment of the radio source host galaxy. finally we comment on theimplications of our explanation of 3c441 for theories of the alignment effect.

astro-ph;9806079	iras f10214+4724: the inner 100pc	we use new near-infrared spectroscopy and our published optical spectroscopyof the gravitationally-lensed seyfert-2 galaxy f10214+4724 to study both thelinks between the starburst and agn in this object and the properties of theinner narrow-line clouds. the uv spectrum is consistent with a compact,moderately- reddened starburst providing about half the uv light. spectroscopyof the halpha /[nii] line blend has enabled us to distinguish emission from thenarrow-line region of the seyfert-2 and a moderately-reddened emission lineregion which we argue is associated with the starburst. estimates of the starformation rate from the uv continuum flux and the halpha flux are broadlyconsistent. we can explain the unusual emission line properties of f10214+4724in terms of conventional models for nearby seyfert-2 galaxies if lensing ispreferentially magnifying the side of the inner narrow-line region between theagn and the observer, and the other side is both less magnified and partiallyobscured by the torus. the hydrogen densities of clouds in this region are highenough to make the balmer lines optically thick and to suppress forbiddenemission lines with low critical densities. we have deduced the column densityof both ionised and neutral gas in the narrow-line clouds, and the density ofthe ionised gas. using these we have been able to estimate the mass of theinner narrow-line clouds to be ~ 1 solar mass, and show that the gas:dust rationh/e(b-v) in these clouds must be ~1.3x10^{27}m^{-2}mag^{-1}, significantlyhigher than in the milky way. the cloud properties are consistent with thethose of the warm absorbers seen in the x-ray spectra of seyfert-1 galaxies.our results favour models in which narrow-line clouds start close to thenucleus and flow out.

astro-ph;9810197	the nature and evolution of classical double radio sources from complete  samples	we present a study of the trends in luminosity, linear size, spectral index,and redshift of classical double radio sources from three complete samplesselected at successively fainter low radio-frequency flux-limits. we have beenable to decouple the effects of the tight correlation between redshift andluminosity (inherent in any single flux-limited sample) which have hithertohindered interpretation of the relationships between these four sourceproperties. the major trends found are that (i) spectral indices increase withlinear size, (ii) rest-frame spectral indices have a stronger dependence onluminosity than on redshift except at high (ghz) frequencies, and that (iii)the linear sizes are smaller at higher redshifts. we reproduce the observeddependences in a model for radio sources (born throughout cosmic time accordingto a radio-source birth function) whose lobes are fed with asynchrotron-emitting population (whose energy distribution is governed bycompact hotspots), and which suffer inverse compton, synchrotron and adiabaticexpansion losses. in simulating the basic observed dependences, we find thatthere is no need to invoke any systematic change in the environments of theseobjects with redshift if the consequences of imposing a survey flux-limit onour simulated datasets are properly included in the model. we present evidencethat for a radio survey there is an unavoidable `youth--redshift degeneracy',even though radio sources are short-lived relative to the age of the universe;it is imperative to take this into account in studies which seemingly revealcorrelations of source properties with redshift such as the `alignment effect'.

(1996), hogg et al.

astro-ph;9901247	quasars from the 7c survey - i:sample selection and radio maps	we describe the selection of candidate radio-loud quasars obtained bycross-matching radio source positions from the low-frequency (151 mhz) 7csurvey with optical positions from five pairs of eo poss-i plates scanned withthe cambridge automatic plate-measuring machine (apm). the sky region studiedis centred at ra 10 h 28 m, dec +41 and covers 0.057 sr. we present vlaobservations of the quasar candidates, and tabulate various properties derivedfrom the radio maps. we discuss the selection criteria of the resulting `7cq'sample of radio-loud quasars. the 70 confirmed quasars, and some fraction ofthe 36 unconfirmed candidates, constitute a filtered sample with the followingselection criteria: 151-mhz flux density s151 &gt; 100 mjy; poss-i e-platemagnitude e approx r &lt; 20; and poss-i colour (o - e) &lt; 1.8; the effective areaof the survey drops significantly below s151 approx 200 mjy. we argue that thecolour criterion excludes few if any quasars, but note, on the basis of recentwork by willott et al. (1998b), that the e magnitude limit probably excludesmore than 50 per cent of the radio-loud quasars.

astro-ph;9902087	thermal-infrared imaging of 3c radio galaxies at z~1	we present the results of a programme of thermal-ir imaging of nineteen z~1radio galaxies from the 3cr and 3crr samples. we detect emission at l' (3.8um)from four objects; in each case the emission is unresolved at 1" resolution.fifteen radio galaxies remain undetected to sensitive limits of l'~15.5. usingthese data in tandem with archived hst data and near-ir spectroscopy we showthat 3 of the detected `radio galaxies' (3c22, 3c41, and 3c65) harbour quasarsreddened by av&lt;5. correcting for this reddening 3c22 and 3c41 are very similarto coeval 3c quasars, whilst 3c65 seems unusually underluminous. the fourthradio galaxy detection (3c265) is a more highly obscured (av~15) but otherwisetypical quasar which previously has been evident only in scattered light. wedetermine the fraction of dust-reddened quasars at z~1 to be 28(+25)(-13)% at90% confidence. on the assumption that the undetected radio galaxies harbourquasars similar to those in 3c22, 3c41 and 3c265 (as seems reasonable giventheir similar narrow emission line luminosities) we deduce extinctions of av&gt;15towards their nuclei. the contributions of reddened quasar nuclei to the totalk-band light ranges from ~0 per cent for the non-detections, through ~10 percent for 3c265 to ~80 per cent for 3c22 and 3c41. correcting for these effectsdoes not remove the previously reported differences between the k magnitudes of3c and 6c radio galaxies, so contamination by reddened quasar nuclei is not aserious problem for drawing cosmological conclusions from the k-z relation forradio galaxies. we discuss these results in the context of the `receding torus'model which predicts a small fraction of lightly-reddened quasars in samples ofhigh radio luminosity sources. we also examine the likely future importance ofthermal-ir imaging in the study of distant powerful radio sources.

astro-ph;9903314	radio-optical alignments in a low radio luminosity sample	we present an optically-based study of the alignment between the radio axesand the optical major axes of eight z~0.7 radio galaxies in a 7c sample. theradio galaxies in this sample are ~20-times less radio luminous than 3cgalaxies at the same redshift, and are significantly less radio-luminous thanany other well-defined samples studied to date. using nordic optical telescopeimages taken in good seeing conditions at rest-frame wavelengths just longwardof the 4000a break, we find a statistically significant alignment effect in the7c sample. furthermore, in two cases where the aligned components are wellseparated from the host we have been able to confirm spectroscopically thatthey are indeed at the same redshift as the radio galaxy. however, aquantitative analysis of the alignment in this sample and in a corresponding 3csample from hst archival data indicates that the percentage of aligned flux maybe lower and of smaller spatial scale in the 7c sample. our study suggests thatalignments on the 50-kpc scale are probably closely related to the radioluminosity, whereas those on the 15 kpc scale are not. we discuss these resultsin the context of popular models for the alignment effect.

astro-ph;9905333	the inevitable youthfulness of known high-redshift radio galaxies	radio galaxies can be seen out to very high redshifts, where in principlethey can serve as probes of the early evolution of the universe. here we showthat for any model of radio-galaxy evolution in which the luminosity decreaseswith time after an initial rapid increase (that is, essentially all reasonablemodels), all observable high-redshift radio-galaxies must be seen when thelobes are less than 10^7 years old. this means that high-redshift radiogalaxies can be used as a high-time-resolution probe of evolution in the earlyuniverse. moreover, this result helps to explain many observed trends ofradio-galaxy properties with redshift [(i) the `alignment effect' of opticalemission along radio-jet axes, (ii) the increased distortion in radiostructure, (iii) the decrease in physical sizes, (iv) the increase in radiodepolarisation, and (v) the increase in dust emission] without needing toinvoke explanations based on cosmology or strong evolution of the surroundingintergalactic medium with cosmic time, thereby avoiding conflict with currenttheories of structure formation.

astro-ph;9905358	optical spectroscopy of two overlapping, flux-density-limited samples of  radio sources in the north ecliptic cap, selected at 38 mhz and 151 mhz	we present the results of optical spectroscopy of two flux-density-limitedsamples of radio sources selected at frequencies of 38 and 151 mhz in the sameregion around the north ecliptic cap, the 8c-nec and 7c-iii samplesrespectively. both samples are selected at flux density levels ~20 timesfainter than samples based on the 3c catalogue. they are amongst the firstlow-frequency selected samples with no spectral or angular size selection forwhich almost complete redshift information has been obtained and they willtherefore provide a valuable resource for understanding the cosmic evolution ofradio sources and their hosts and environments. the 151-mhz 7c-iii sample isselected to have s_151 &gt;=0.5 jy and is the more spectroscopically complete; outof 54 radio sources fairly reliable redshifts have been obtained for 44objects. the 8c sample has a flux limit of s_38 &gt;=1.3 jy and contains 58sources of which 46 have fairly reliable redshifts. we discuss possible biasesin the observed redshift distribution, and some interesting individual objects.using the 8c-nec and 7c-iii samples in conjunction, we form the first sampleselected on low-frequency flux in the rest-frame of the source, rather than theusual selection on flux density in the observed frame. this allows us to removethe bias associated with an increasing rest-frame selection frequency withredshift. we investigate the difference this selection makes to correlations ofradio source properties with redshift and luminosity. we show in particularthat flux-density-based selection leads to an overestimate of the steepness ofthe correlation of radio source size with redshift.

astro-ph;9905388	the emission line - radio correlation for radio sources using the 7c  redshift survey	we have used narrow emission line data from the new 7c redshift survey toinvestigate correlations between the narrow-line luminosities and the radioproperties of radio galaxies and steep-spectrum quasars. the 7c redshift surveyis a low-frequency (151 mhz) selected sample with a flux-density limit about25-times fainter than the 3crr sample. by combining these samples, we can forthe first time distinguish whether the correlations present are controlled by151 mhz radio luminosity l_151 or redshift z. we find unequivocal evidence thatthe dominant effect is a strong positive correlation between narrow lineluminosity l_nlr and l_151, of the form l_nlr proportional to l_151 ^ 0.79 +/-0.04. correlations of l_nlr with redshift or radio properties, such as linearsize or 151 mhz (rest-frame) spectral index, are either much weaker or absent.we use simple assumptions to estimate the total bulk kinetic power q of thejets in frii radio sources, and confirm the underlying proportionality betweenjet power and narrow line luminosity first discussed by rawlings &amp; saunders(1991). we make the assumption that the main energy input to the narrow lineregion is photoionisation by the quasar accretion disc, and relate q to thedisc luminosity, q_phot. we find that 0.05 &lt; q / q_phot &lt; 1 so that the jetpower is within about an order of magnitude of the accretion disc luminosity.the most powerful radio sources are accreting at rates close to the eddingtonlimit of supermassive black holes (~ 10^9 - 10^10 solar masses), whilst lowerpower sources are accreting at sub-eddington rates.

astro-ph;9910422	the hyperluminous infrared quasar 3c 318 and its implications for  interpreting sub-mm detections of high-redshift radio galaxies	we present near-infrared spectroscopy and imaging of the compact steep-spectrum radio source 3c 318 which shows it to be a quasar at redshift z=1.574(the z=0.752 value previously reported is incorrect). 3c 318 is an iras, isoand scuba source so its new redshift makes it the most intrinsically luminousfar-infrared (fir) source in the 3c catalogue (there is no evidence of stronggravitational lensing effects). its bolometric luminosity greatly exceeds the10^13 solar luminosity level above which an object is said to be hyperluminous.its spectral energy distribution (sed) requires that the quasar heats the dustresponsible for the fir flux, as is believed to be the case in otherhyperluminous galaxies, and contributes (at the &gt;10% level) to the heating ofthe dust responsible for the sub-mm emission. we cannot determine whether astarburst makes an important contribution to the heating of the coolest dust,so evidence for a high star-formation rate (sfr) is circumstantial being basedon the high dust mass required by its sub-mm detection. we show that thecurrent sub-mm and fir data available for high-z radio galaxies are consistentwith seds similar to that of 3c 318. this indicates that at least some of thispopulation may be detected in the sub-mm because of dust heated by the quasarnucleus, and that interpreting sub-mm detection as evidence for very high sfrsmay not always be valid. we show that the 3c318 quasar is slightly reddened(a(v) ~ 0.5), the most likely cause of which is smc-type dust in the hostgalaxy. if very distant radio galaxies are reddened in a similar way then weshow that only slightly greater amounts of dust could obscure the quasars inthese sources, thus explaining the low fraction of quasars amongst the veryhigh redshift (z &gt; 3) objects in low-frequency radio-selected samples.
