0704.0148	reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from  equation-of-motion approach	the longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $t_1$ and $t_2$, insemiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approachfor different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. variousmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, thedresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phononinteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling dueto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of theelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfineinteraction are included. the relative contributions from these spindecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. in our calculation, thespin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have markedeffect in most cases. the equation-of-motion approach is applied in studyingboth the spin relaxation time $t_1$ and the spin dephasing time $t_2$, eitherin markovian or in non-markovian limit. when many levels are involved at finitetemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from thefermi golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. however, at hightemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use theequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. moreover, spindephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.

1012.0973	electron spin diffusion and transport in graphene	we investigate the spin diffusion and transport in a graphene monolayer onsio$_2$ substrate by means of the microscopic kinetic spin bloch equationapproach. the substrate causes a strong rashba spin-orbit coupling field $\sim0.15$ mev, which might be accounted for by the impurities initially present inthe substrate or even the substrate-induced structure distortion. by surfacechemical doping with au atoms, this rashba spin-orbit coupling is furtherstrengthened as the adatoms can distort the graphene lattice from $sp^2$ to$sp^3$ bonding structure. by fitting the au doping dependence of spinrelaxation from pi {\sl et al.} [phys. rev. lett. {\bf 104}, 187201 (2010)],the rashba spin-orbit coupling coefficient is found to increase approximatelylinearly from 0.15 to 0.23 mev with the increase of au density. with thisstrong spin-orbit coupling, the spin diffusion or transport length iscomparable with the experimental values. in the strong scattering limit(dominated by the electron-impurity scattering in our study), the spindiffusion is uniquely determined by the rashba spin-orbit coupling strength andinsensitive to the temperature, electron density as well as scattering. withthe presence of an electric field along the spin injection direction, the spintransport length can be modulated by either the electric field or the electrondensity.

1211.5055	kinetic theory of surface plasmon polariton in semiconductor nanowires	based on the semiclassical model hamiltonian of the surface plasmon polaritonand the nonequilibrium green-function approach, we present a microscopickinetic theory to study the influence of the electron scattering on thedynamics of the surface plasmon polariton in semiconductor nanowires. thedamping of the surface plasmon polariton originates from the resonantabsorption by the electrons (landau damping), and the corresponding dampingexhibits size-dependent oscillations and distinct temperature dependencewithout any scattering. the scattering influences the damping by introducing abroadening and a shifting to the resonance. to demonstrate this, we investigatethe damping of the surface plasmon polariton in inas nanowires in the presenceof the electron-impurity, electron-phonon and electron-electron coulombscatterings. the main effect of the electron-impurity and electron-phononscatterings is to introduce a broadening, whereas the electron-electron coulombscattering can not only cause a broadening, but also introduce a shifting tothe resonance. for inas nanowires under investigation, the broadening due tothe electron-phonon scattering dominates. as a result, the scattering has apronounced influence on the damping of the surface plasmon polariton: thesize-dependent oscillations are smeared out and the temperature dependence isalso suppressed in the presence of the scattering. these results demonstratethe the important role of the scattering on the surface plasmon polaritondamping in semiconductor nanowires.

1212.3661	spin-dependent inter- and intra-valley electron-phonon scattering in  germanium	we investigate the spin-dependent electron-phonon scatterings of the $l$ and$\gamma$ valleys and the band structure near the conduction band minima ingermanium. we first construct a $16\times16$ ${\bm k}\cdot{\bm p}$ hamiltonianin the vicinity of the $l$ point in germanium, which ensures the correctness ofthe band structure of the lowest three conduction bands and highest two valencebands. this hamiltonian facilitates the analysis of the spin-related propertiesof the conduction electrons. we then demonstrate the phonon-induced electronscatterings of the $l$ and $\gamma$ valleys, i.e., the intra-$\gamma$/ $l$valley, inter--$\gamma$-$l$ valley and inter--$l$-$l$ valley scatterings ingermanium. the selection rules and complete scattering matrices for thesescatterings are calculated, where the scattering matrices for theintra-$\gamma$ valley scattering, inter--$\gamma$-$l$ valley scattering and theoptical-phonon and the separated transverse-acoustic- andlongitudinal-acoustic-phonon contributions to the intra-$\gamma$ valleyscattering have not been reported in the literature. the coefficients in thesescattering matrices are obtained via the pseudo-potential calculation, whichalso verifies our selection rules and wave-vector dependence. we furtherdiscuss the elliott-yafet mechanisms in these electron-phonon scatterings withthe ${\bm k}$$\cdot$${\bm p}$ eigenstates at the $l$ and $\gamma$ valleys. ourinvestigation of these electron-phonon scatterings are essential for the studyof the optical orientation of spin and hot-electron relaxation in germanium.

1301.1092	hot-carrier transport and spin relaxation on the surface of topological  insulator	we study the charge and spin transport under high electric field (up toseveral kv/cm) on the surface of topological insulator bi$_2$se$_3$, where theelectron-surface optical phonon scattering dominates except at very lowtemperature. due to the spin mixing of conduction and valence bands, theelectric field not only accelerates electrons in each band, but also leads tointer-band precession. in the presence of the electric field, electrons cantransfer from the valence band to the conduction one via the inter-bandprecession and inter-band electron-phonon scattering. the electron density ineach band varies with the electric field linearly when the electric field isstrong. due to the spin-momentum locking, a transverse spin polarization, withthe magnitude proportional to the momentum scattering time, is induced by theelectric field. the induced spin polarization depends on the electric fieldlinearly when the latter is small. moreover, its magnitude is inverselyproportional to the temperature and is insensitive to the electron density athigh temperature. our investigation also reveals that due to the large relativestatic dielectric constant, the coulomb scattering is too weak to establish adrifted fermi distribution with a unified hot-electron temperature in thesteady state under the electric field. after turning off the electric field inthe steady state, the hot carriers cool down in a time scale of energyrelaxation which is very long (of the order of 100-1000 ps) while the spinpolarization relaxes in a time scale of momentum scattering which is quiteshort (of the order of 0.01-0.1 ps).

1306.3719	energy spectra of three electrons in sige/si/sige laterally coupled  triple quantum dots	we investigate the energy spectra of three electrons in sige/si/sigeequilateral triangular and symmetric linear triple quantum dots in the presenceof magnetic (in either faraday or voigt configuration) and electric fields withsingle valley approximation by using the real-space configuration interactionmethod. the strong electron-electron coulomb interaction, which is crucial tothe energy spectra, is explicitly calculated whereas the weak spin-orbitcoupling is treated perturbatively. in both equilateral triangular andsymmetric linear triple quantum dots, we find doublet-quartet transition ofground-state spin configuration by varying dot size or interdot distance in theabsence of external fields. this transition has not been reported in theliterature on triple quantum dots. in the magnetic-field (faradayconfiguration) dependence of energy spectra, we find anticrossings with largeenergy splittings between the energy levels with the same spin state in theabsence of the spin-orbit coupling. this anticrossing behavior originates fromthe triple quantum dot confinement potential. in addition, with the inclusionof the spin-orbit coupling, we find that all the intersections shown in theequilateral triangular case become anticrossing whereas only part of theintersections in symmetric linear case show anticrossing behavior in thepresence of magnetic field in either the faraday or voigt configuration. allthe anticrossing behaviors are analyzed based on symmetry consideration.moreover, we show that the electric field can effectively influence the energylevels and the charge configurations.

1308.0866	negative differential transmission in graphene	by using the kubo linear response theory with the keldysh green functionapproach, we investigate the mechanism leading to the negative differentialtransmission in system with the equilibrium electron density much smaller thanthe photon-excited one. it is shown that the negative differential transmissioncan appear at low probe-photon energy (in the order of the scattering rate) orat high energy (much larger than the scattering rate). for the low probe-photonenergy case, the negative differential transmission is found to come from theincrease of the intra-band conductivity due to the large variation of electrondistribution after the pumping. as for the high probe-photon energy case, thenegative differential transmission is shown to tend to appear with thehot-electron temperature being closer to the equilibrium one and the chemicalpotential higher than the equilibrium one but considerably smaller than half ofthe probe-photon energy. we also show that this negative differentialtransmission can come from both the inter- and the intra-band components of theconductivity. especially, for the inter-band component, its contribution to thenegative differential transmission is shown to come from both the hartree-fockself-energy and the scattering. furthermore, the influence of the coulomb-holeself-energy is also addressed.

0805.3280	kinetics of spin coherence of electrons in $n$-type inas quantum wells  under intense terahertz laser fields	spin kinetics in $n$-type inas quantum wells under intense terahertz laserfields is investigated by developing fully microscopic kinetic spin blochequations via the floquet-markov theory and the nonequilibrium green's functionapproach, with all the relevant scattering, such as the electron-impurity,electron-phonon, and electron-electron coulomb scattering explicitly included.we find that a {\em finite} steady-state terahertz spin polarization induced bythe terahertz laser field, first predicted by cheng and wu [appl. phys. lett.{\bf 86}, 032107 (2005)] in the absence of dissipation, exists even in thepresence of all the scattering. we further discuss the effects of the terahertzlaser fields on the spin relaxation and the steady-state spin polarization. itis found that the terahertz laser fields can {\em strongly} affect the spinrelaxation via hot-electron effect and the terahertz-field-induced effectivemagnetic field in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. the two effects competewith each other, giving rise to {\em non-monotonic} dependence of the spinrelaxation time as well as the amplitude of the steady state spin polarizationon the terahertz field strength and frequency. the terahertz field dependencesof these quantities are investigated for various impurity densities, latticetemperatures, and strengths of the spin-orbit coupling. finally, the importanceof the electron-electron coulomb scattering on spin kinetics is also addressed.

cond-mat;0503616	spin-hall effect in two-dimensional mesoscopic hole systems	the spin hall effect in two dimensional hole systems is studied by using thefour-terminal landauer-b\"{u}ttiker formula with the help of green functions.the spin hall effect exists even when there are {\em not} any correlationsbetween the spin-up and -down heavy holes (light holes) and when the$\gamma$-point degeneracy of the heavy hole and light hole bands is lifted bythe confinement or recovered by the strain. when only a heavy hole chargecurrent without any spin polarization is injected through one lead, under rightchoice of lead voltages, one can get a pure heavy (light) hole spin current,combined with a possible impure light (heavy) hole spin current from anothertwo leads. the spin hall coefficients of both heavy and light holes depend onthe fermi energy, devise size and the disorder strength. it is also shown thatthe spin hall effect of two dimensional hole systems is much more robust thanthat of electron systems with the rashba spin-orbit coupling and the spin hallcoefficients do not decrease with the system size but tend to some nonzerovalues when the disorder strength is smaller than some critical value.
