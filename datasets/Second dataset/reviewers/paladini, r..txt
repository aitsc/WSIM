0906.5025	evidence for dust evolution within the taurus complex from spitzer  images	we present spitzer images of the taurus complex (tc) and take advantage ofthe sensitivity and spatial resolution of the observations to characterize thediffuse ir emission across the cloud. this work highlights evidence of dustevolution within the translucent sections of the archetype reference forstudies of quiescent molecular clouds. we combine spitzer 160 um and iras 100um observations to produce a dust temperature map and a far-ir dust opacity mapat 5' resolution. the average dust temperature is about 14.5k with a dispersionof +/-1k across the cloud. the far-ir dust opacity is a factor 2 larger thanthe average value for the diffuse ism. this opacity increase and theattenuation of the radiation field (rf) both contribute to account for thelower emission temperature of the large grains. the structure of the tcsignificantly changes in the mid-ir images that trace emission from pahs andvsgs. we focus our analysis of the mid-ir emission to a range of eclipticlatitudes where the zodiacal light residuals are small. within this cloud area,there are no 8 and 24 um counterparts to the brightest 160 um emissionfeatures. conversely, the 8 and 24 um images reveal filamentary structure thatis strikingly inconspicuous in the 160 um and extinction maps. the ir colorsvary over sub-parsec distances across this filamentary structure. we comparethe observed colors with model calculations quantifying the impact of the rfintensity and the abundance of stochastically heated particles on the dust sed.to match the range of observed colors, we have to invoke variations by a factorof a few of both the interstellar rf and the abundance of pahs and vsgs. weconclude that within this filamentary structure a significant fraction of thedust mass cycles in and out the small size end of the dust size distribution.

0907.2216	re-analysis of the radio luminosity function of galactic hii regions	we have re-analyzed continuum and recombination lines radio data available inthe literature in order to derive the luminosity function (lf) of galactic hiiregions. the study is performed by considering the first and fourth galacticquadrants independently. we estimate the completeness level of the sample inthe fourth quadrant at 5 jy, and the one in the first quadrant at 2 jy. we showthat the two samples (fourth or first quadrant) include, as well as giant andsuper-giant hii regions, a significant number of sub-giant sources. the lf isobtained, in each galactic quadrant, with a generalized schmidt's estimatorusing an effective volume derived from the observed spatial distribution of theconsidered hii regions. the re-analysis also takes advantage of recentlypublished ancillary absorption data allowing to solve the distance ambiguityfor several objects. a single power-law fit to the lfs retrieves a slope equalto -2.23+/-0.07 (fourth quadrant) and to -1.85+/-0.11 (first quadrant). we alsofind marginal evidence of a luminosity break at l_knee = 10^23.45 erg s^(-1)hz^(-1) for the lf in the fourth quadrant. we convert radio luminosities intoequivalent h_alpha and lyman continuum luminosities to facilitate comparisonswith extra-galactic studies. we obtain an average total hii regions lymancontinuum luminosity of 0.89 +/- 0.23 * 10^(53) sec^(-1), corresponding to 30%of the total ionizing luminosity of the galaxy.

1002.4421	a catalog of mipsgal disk and ring sources	we present a catalog of 416 extended, resolved, disk- and ring-like objectsas detected in the mipsgal 24 micron survey of the galactic plane. this catalogis the result of a search in the mipsgal image data for generally circularlysymmetric, extended "bubbles" without prior knowledge or expectation of theirphysical nature. most of the objects have no extended counterpart at 8 or 70micron, with less than 20% detections at each wavelength. for the 54 objectswith central point sources, the sources are nearly always seen in all iracbands. about 70 objects (16%) have been previously identified, with another 35listed as iras sources. among the identified objects, those with centralsources are mostly listed as emission-line stars, but with other source typesincluding supernova remnants, luminous blue variables, and planetary nebulae.the 57 identified objects (of 362) without central sources are nearly all pne(~90%).which suggests that a large fraction of the 300+ unidentified objects inthis category are also pne. these identifications suggest that this isprimarily a catalog of evolved stars. also included in the catalog are twofilamentary objects that are almost certainly snrs, and ten unusual compactextended objects discovered in the search. two of these show remarkable spiralstructure at both 8 and 24 micron. these are likely background galaxiespreviously hidden by the intervening galactic plane.

1003.0866	young stellar objects and triggered star formation in the vulpecula ob  association	the vulpecula ob association, vulob1, is a region of active star formationlocated in the galactic plane at 2.3 kpc from the sun. previous studies suggestthat sequential star formation is propagating along this 100 pc long molecularcomplex. in this paper, we use spitzer mipsgal and glimpse data to reconstructthe star formation history of vulob1, and search for signatures of pasttriggering events. we make a census of young stellar objects (yso) in vulob1based on ir color and magnitude criteria, and we rely on the properties andnature of these ysos to trace recent episodes of massive star formation. wefind 856 yso candidates, and show that the evolutionary stage of the ysopopulation in vulob1 is rather homogeneous - ruling out the scenario ofpropagating star formation. we estimate the current star formation efficiencyto be ~8 %. we also report the discovery of a dozen pillar-like structures,which are confirmed to be sites of small scale triggered star formation.

1005.1783	a herschel study of yso evolutionary stages and formation timelines in  two fields of the hi-gal survey	we present a first study of the star-forming compact dust condensationsrevealed by herschel in the two 2 \times 2 \degr galactic plane fields centeredat [l;b] = [30\degr; 0 \degr] and [l;b] = [59\degr; 0 \degr], respectively, andobserved during the science demonstration phase for the herschel infraredgalactic plane survey (hi-gal) key-project. compact source catalogs extractedfor the two fields in the five hi-gal bands (70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m)were merged based on simple criteria of positional association and spectralenergy distribution (sed) consistency into a final catalog which contains onlycoherent seds with counterparts in at least three adjacent herschel bands.these final source lists contain 528 entries for the l = 30\degr field, and 444entries for the l = 59\degr field. the sed coverage has been augmented withancillary data at 24 $\mu$m and 1.1 mm. sed modeling for the subset of 318 and101 sources (in the two fields, respectively) for which the distance is knownwas carried out using both a structured star/disk/envelope radiative transfermodel and a simple isothermal grey-body. global parameters like mass,luminosity, temperature and dust properties have been estimated. the lbol/menvratio spans four orders of magnitudes from values compatible with thepre-protostellar phase to embedded massive zero-age main sequence stars.sources in the l = 59\degr field have on average lower l/m, possibly outliningan overall earlier evolutionary stage with respect to the sources in the l =30\degr field. many of these cores are actively forming high-mass stars,although the estimated core surface densities appear to be an order ofmagnitude below the 1 g cm$^{-2}$ critical threshold for high-mass starformation.

1005.3076	direct estimate of cirrus noise in herschel hi-gal images	in herschel images of the galactic plane and many star forming regions, amajor factor limiting our ability to extract faint compact sources is cirrusconfusion noise, operationally defined as the "statistical error to be expectedin photometric measurements due to confusion in a background of fluctuatingsurface brightness". the histogram of the flux densities of extracted sourcesshows a distinctive faint-end cutoff below which the catalog suffers fromincompleteness and the flux densities become unreliable. this empirical cutoffshould be closely related to the estimated cirrus noise and we show that thisis the case. we compute the cirrus noise directly, both on herschel images fromwhich the bright sources have been removed and on simulated images of cirruswith statistically similar fluctuations. we connect these direct estimates withthose from power spectrum analysis, which has been used extensively to predictthe cirrus noise and provides insight into how it depends on variousstatistical properties and photometric operational parameters. we reportmulti-wavelength power spectra of diffuse galactic dust emission from hi-galobservations at 70 to 500 microns within galactic plane fields at l= 30 degreesand l= 59 degrees. we find that the exponent of the power spectrum is about -3.at 250 microns, the amplitude of the power spectrum increases roughly as thesquare of the median brightness of the map and so the expected cirrus noisescales linearly with the median brightness. generally, the confusion noise willbe a worse problem at longer wavelengths, because of the combination of lowerangular resolution and the rising power spectrum of cirrus toward lower spatialfrequencies, but the photometric signal to noise will also depend on therelative spectral energy distribution of the source compared to the cirrus.

1005.3317	clouds, filaments and protostars: the herschel hi-gal milky way	we present the first results from the science demonstration phase for thehi-gal survey, the herschel key-project that will map the inner galactic planeof the milky way in 5 bands. we outline our data reduction strategy and presentsome science highlights on the two observed 2{\deg} x 2{\deg} tilesapproximately centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. the two regions areextremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows awidespread organization in filaments. source seds can be built for hundreds ofobjects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a goodfraction of them where the distance could be estimated. the compact sources(which we will call 'cores' in the following) are found for the most part to beassociated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averagedcolumn density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when athreshold around a_v of about 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l=59{\deg}field; a a_v value between 5 and 10 is found for the l=30{\deg} field, likelydue to the relatively larger distances of the sources. this outlines anexciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, whichlater fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level.in spite of core l/m ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, wefind core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. our results are ingood agreement with recent mhd numerical simulations of filaments forming fromlarge-scale converging flows.

1009.2779	variations of the spectral index of dust emissivity from hi-gal  observations of the galactic plane	variations in the dust emissivity are critical for gas mass determinationsderived from far-infrared observations, but also for separating dust foregroundemission from the cosmic microwave background (cmb). hi-gal observations allowus for the first time to study the dust emissivity variations in the innerregions of the galactic plane at resolution below 1 degree. we present maps ofthe emissivity spectral index derived from the combined herschel pacs 160 \mum, spire 250 \mu m, 350 \mu m, and 500 \mu m data, and the iris 100 \mu m data,and we analyze the spatial variations of the spectral index as a function ofdust temperature and wavelength in the two science demonstration phase hi-galfields, centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. applying two different methods,we determine both dust temperature and emissivity spectral index between 100and 500 \mu m, at an angular resolution of 4'. combining both fields, theresults show variations of the emissivity spectral index in the range 1.8-2.6for temperatures between 14 and 23 k. the median values of the spectral indexare similar in both fields, i.e. 2.3 in the range 100-500 \mu m, while themedian dust temperatures are equal to 19.1 k and 16.0 k in the l=30{\deg} andl=59{\deg} field, respectively. statistically, we do not see any significantdeviations in the spectra from a power law emissivity between 100 and 500 \mum. we confirm the existence of an inverse correlation between the emissivityspectral index and dust temperature, found in previous analyses.

1010.2774	dust in the diffuse emission of the galactic plane - the  herschel/spitzer sed fitting	the first herschel hi-gal images of the galactic plane unveil thefar-infrared diffuse emission of the interstellar medium with an unprecedentedangular resolution and sensitivity. in this paper, we present the firstanalysis of these data in combination with that of spitzer glimpse &amp; mipsgal.we selected a relatively diffuse and low excitation region of thel~59\,^{\circ} hi-gal science demonstration phase field to perform a pixel bypixel fitting of the 8 to 500 microns sed using the dustem dust emission model.we derived maps of the very small grains (vsg) and pah abundances from themodel. our analysis allows us to illustrate that the aromatic infrared bands(aib) intensity does not trace necessarily the pah abundance but rather theproduct of "abundance x column density x intensity of the exciting radiationfield". we show that the spatial structure of pacs70microns map resembles theshorter wavelengths (e.g. irac8microns) maps, because they trace both theintensity of exciting radiation field and column density. we also show that themodeled vsg contribution to pacs70microns (pacs160microns) band intensity canbe up to 50% (7%). the interpretation of diffuse emission spectra at thesewavelengths must take stochastically heated particles into account. finally,this preliminary study emphasizes the potential of analyzing the full dust sedsampled by herschel and spitzer data, with a physical dust model (dustem) toreach the properties of the dust at simultaneously large and small scales.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1101.3003	galactic cold cores ii. herschel study of the extended dust emission  around the first planck detections	within the project galactic cold cores we are carrying out herschelphotometric observations of cold interstellar clouds detected with the plancksatellite. the three fields observed as part of the herschel sciencedemonstration phase (sdp) provided the first glimpse into the nature of thesesources. we examine the properties of the dust emission within the fields. wedetermine the dust sub-millimetre opacity, look for signs of spatial variationsin the dust spectral index, and estimate how the apparent variations of theparameters could be affected by different sources of uncertainty. we use theherschel observations where the zero point of the surface brightness scale isset with the help of the planck satellite data. we derive the colourtemperature and column density maps of the regions and determine the dustopacity by a comparison with extinction measurements. by simultaneously fittingthe colour temperature and the dust spectral index values we look for spatialvariations in the apparent dust properties. with a simple radiative transfermodel we estimate to what extent these can be explained by line-of-sighttemperature variations, without changes in the dust grain properties. theanalysis of the dust emission reveals cold and dense clouds that coincide withthe planck sources and confirm those detections. the derived dust opacityvaries in the range kappa(250um) ~ 0.05-0.2 cm^2/g, higher values beingobserved preferentially in regions of high column density. the average dustspectral index beta is ~ 1.9-2.2. there are indications that beta increasestowards the coldest regions. the spectral index decreases strongly nearinternal heating sources but, according to radiative transfer models, this canbe explained by the line-of-sight temperature variations without a change inthe dust properties.

1104.2894	the mipsgal view of supernova remnants in the galactic plane	we report the detection of galactic supernova remnants (snrs) in themid-infrared (at 24 and 70 {\mu}m), in the coordinate ranges 10 &lt; l &lt; 65 degand 285 &lt; l &lt; 350 deg, |b| &lt; 1 deg, using the multiband imaging photometer(mips) aboard the spitzer space telescope. we search for infrared counterpartsto snrs in green's catalog and identify 39 out of 121, i.e., a detection rateof about 32%. such a relatively low detection fraction is mainly due toconfusion with nearby foreground/background sources and diffuse emission. thesnrs in our sample show a linear trend in [f8/f24] versus [f70/f24]. we comparetheir infrared fluxes with their corresponding radio flux at 1.4 ghz and findthat most remnants have ratios of 70 {\mu}m to 1.4 ghz characteristic of snrs(with the exception of a few which have ratios closer to those of h iiregions). furthermore, we retrieve a slope close to unity when correlatinginfrared (24 and 70 {\mu}m) with 1.4 ghz emission. our survey is moresuccessful in detecting remnants with bright x-ray emission, which we find iswell correlated with the 24 {\mu}m morphology. moreover, by comparing the poweremitted in x-ray, infrared and radio, we conclude that the energy released inthe infrared is comparable to the cooling in the x-ray range.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1108.2014	spitzer characterisation of dust in an anomalous emission region: the  perseus cloud	anomalous microwave emission is known to exist in the perseus cloud. one ofthe most promising candidates to explain this excess of emission is electricdipole radiation from rapidly rotating very small dust grains, commonlyreferred to as spinning dust. photometric data obtained with the spitzer spacetelescope have been reprocessed and used in conjunction with the dust emissionmodel dustem to characterise the properties of the dust within the cloud. thisanalysis has allowed us to constrain spatial variations in the strength of theinterstellar radiation field ($\chi_\mathrm{isrf}$), the mass abundances of thepahs and vsgs relative to the bgs (y$_\mathrm{pah}$ and y$_\mathrm{vsg}$), thecolumn density of hydrogen (n$_\mathrm{h}$) and the equilibrium dusttemperature (t$_\mathrm{dust}$). the parameter maps of y$_\mathrm{pah}$,y$_\mathrm{vsg}$ and $\chi_\mathrm{isrf}$ are the first of their kind to beproduced for the perseus cloud, and we used these maps to investigate thephysical conditions in which anomalous emission is observed. we find that inregions of anomalous emission the strength of the isrf, and consequently theequilibrium temperature of the dust, is enhanced while there is no significantvariation in the abundances of the pahs and the vsgs or the column density ofhydrogen. we interpret these results as an indication that the enhancement in$\chi_\mathrm{isrf}$ might be affecting the properties of the smallstochastically heated dust grains resulting in an increase in the spinning dustemission observed at 33 ghz. this is the first time that such an investigationhas been performed, and we believe that this type of analysis creates a newperspective in the field of anomalous emission studies, and represents apowerful new tool for constraining spinning dust models.

1111.1852	detection and characterization of a 500 mic dust emissivity excess in  the galactic plane using herschel/hi-gal observations	past and recent observations have revealed unexpected variations in thefir-mm dust emissivity. in the herschel spectral range, those are oftenreferred to as a 500{\mu}m emission excess. several dust emission models havebeen developed to interpret astrophysical data in the fir-mm domain. however,these are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions withobservations. in contrast, the recently revised two level system (tls) modelseems to provide a promising way of interpreting the existing data. the newlyavailable herschel hi-gal data which covers most of the inner milky-way offersa unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emissionproperties both with wavelength and environment. by combining the iris 100{\mu}m with the hi-gal 160, 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m data, we model the dustemission spectra in each pixel of the hi-gal maps, using both the tls modeland, for comparison, a single modified black-body fit. the effect oftemperature mixing along the line of sight is investigated. we find a slightdecrease in the dust temperature with distance from the galactic center. wealso report the detection of a significant 500 {\mu}m emissivity excess in theperipheral regions of the plane (35\circ&lt;|l|&lt;70\circ) of about 13-15% of theemissivity, that can reach up to 20% in some hii regions. we present thespatial distribution of the best-fit values for the two main parameters of thetls model, i.e. the charge correlation length, lc, used to characterize thedisordered charge distribution (dcd) part of the model, and the amplitude a ofthe tls processes, with respect to the dcd effect. they highlight the plausibleexistence of an overall gradient with distance to the galactic center. acomparison with previous findings in the solar neighborhood shows that thelocal value of the excess is less than expected from the galactic gradientobserved here.

1202.1672	galactic cold cores iii. general cloud properties	we examine the cloud structure around the planck detections in 71 fieldsobserved with the herschel spire instrument. we wish to determine the generalphysical characteristics of the fields and to examine the morphology of theclouds where the cold high column density clumps are found. we derive colourtemperature and column density maps of the fields. we examine the infraredspectral energy distributions of the main clumps. the clouds are categorisedaccording to their large scale morphology. with the help of recently releasedwise satellite data, we look for signs of enhanced mid-infrared scattering(coreshine), an indication of growth of the dust grains, and examine the starformation activity associated with the cold clumps. the mapped clouds havedistances ranging from ~100pc to several kiloparsecs and cover a range of sizesand masses from cores of less than 10 solar masses to clouds with masses inexcess of 10000 solar mass. most fields contain some filamentary structures andin about half of the cases a filament or a few filaments dominate themorphology. in one case out of ten, the clouds show a cometary shape or havesharp boundaries indicative of compression by an external force. the width ofthe filaments is typically ~0.2-0.3pc. however, there is significant variationfrom 0.1pc to 1pc and the estimates are sensitive to the methods used and thevery definition of a filament. enhanced mid-infrared scattering, coreshine, wasdetected in four clouds with six additional tentative detections. the cloudldn183 is included in our sample and remains the best example of thisphenomenon. about half of the fields are associated with active star formationas indicated by the presence of mid-infrared point sources. the mid-infraredsources often coincide with structures whose sub-millimetre spectra are stilldominated by the cold dust.

1205.4280	a multi-wavelength investigation of rcw175: an hii region harboring  spinning dust emission	using infrared, radio continuum and spectral observations, we performed adetailed investigation of the hii region rcw175. we determined that rcw175,which actually consists of two separate hii regions, g29.1-0.7 and g29.0-0.6,is located at a distance of 3.2+/-0.2 kpc. based on the observations we inferthat the more compact g29.0-0.6 is less evolved than g29.1-0.7 and was possiblyproduced as a result of the expansion of g29.1-0.7 into the surroundinginterstellar medium. we compute a star formation rate for rcw175 of(12.6+/-1.9)x10^{-5} m_{\sun}/yr, and identified 6 possible young stellarobject candidates within its vicinity. additionally, we estimate that rcw175contains a total dust mass of 215+/-53 m_{\sun}.  rcw175 has previously been identified as a source of anomalous microwaveemission (ame), an excess of emission at cm wavelengths often attributed toelectric dipole radiation from the smallest dust grains. we find that the amepreviously detected in rcw175 is not correlated with the smallest dust grains(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or small carbonaceous dust grains), butrather with the exciting radiation field within the region. this is a similarresult to that found in the perseus molecular cloud, another region whichharbors ame, suggesting that the radiation field may play a pivotal role in theproduction of this new galactic emission mechanism. finally, we suggest thatthese observations may hint at the importance of understanding the role playedby the major gas ions in spinning dust models.

1207.3675	the pre-launch planck sky model: a model of sky emission at  submillimetre to centimetre wavelengths	we present the planck sky model (psm), a parametric model for the generationof all-sky, few arcminute resolution maps of sky emission at submillimetre tocentimetre wavelengths, in both intensity and polarisation. several options areimplemented to model the cosmic microwave background, galactic diffuse emission(synchrotron, free-free, thermal and spinning dust, co lines), galactic h-iiregions, extragalactic radio sources, dusty galaxies, and thermal and kineticsunyaev-zeldovich signals from clusters of galaxies. each component issimulated by means of educated interpolations/extrapolations of data setsavailable at the time of the launch of the planck mission, complemented bystate-of-the-art models of the emission. distinctive features of thesimulations are: spatially varying spectral properties of synchrotron and dust;different spectral parameters for each point source; modeling of the clusteringproperties of extragalactic sources and of the power spectrum of fluctuationsin the cosmic infrared background. the psm enables the production of randomrealizations of the sky emission, constrained to match observational datawithin their uncertainties, and is implemented in a software package that isregularly updated with incoming information from observations. the model isexpected to serve as a useful tool for optimizing planned microwave andsub-millimetre surveys and to test data processing and analysis pipelines. itis, in particular, used for the development and validation of data analysispipelines within the planck collaboration. a version of the software that canbe used for simulating the observations for a variety of experiments is madeavailable on a dedicated website.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1210.3631	spitzer and herschel multiwavelength characterization of the dust  content of evolved hii regions	we have analyzed a uniform sample of 16 evolved hii regions located in a 2deg x 2 deg galactic field centered at (l,b) = (30 deg, 0 deg) and observed aspart of the herschel hi-gal survey. the evolutionary stage of these hii regionswas established using ancillary radio continuum data. by combining hi-gal pacs(70 micron, 160 micron) and spire (250 micron, 350 micron and 500 micron)measurements with mipsgal 24 micron data, we built spectral energydistributions (seds) of the sources and showed that a 2-component grey-bodymodel is a good representation of the data. in particular, wavelengths &gt; 70micron appear to trace a cold dust component, for which we estimated anequilibrium temperature of the big grains (bgs) in the range 20 - 30 k, whilefor lambda &lt; 70 micron, the data indicated the presence of a warm dustcomponent at temperatures of the order of 50 - 90 k. this analysis alsorevealed that dust is present in the interior of hii regions, although likelynot in a large amount. in addition, the data appear to corroborate thehypothesis that the main mechanism responsible for the (partial) depletion ofdust in hii regions is radiation-pressure-driven drift. in this framework, wespeculated that the 24 micron emission which spatially correlates with ionizedgas might be associated with either very small grain (vsg) or bg replenishment,as recently proposed for the case of wind-blown bubbles (wbb). finally, wefound that evolved hii regions are characterized by distinctive far-ir andsub-mm colors, which can be used as diagnostics for their identification inunresolved galactic and extragalactic regions.

1211.3747	an analysis of star formation with herschel in the hi-gal survey. i. the  science demonstration phase fields	the herschel survey of the galactic plane (hi-gal) provides a uniqueopportunity to study star formation over large areas of the sky and differentenvironments in the milky way. we use the best studied hi-gal fields to date,two 2x2 tiles centered on (l, b) = (30, 0) deg and (l, b) = (59, 0) deg, tostudy the star formation activity using a large sample of well selected youngstellar objects (ysos). we estimate the star formation rate (sfr) for thesefields using the number of candidate ysos and their average time scale to reachthe zero age main sequence, and compare it with the rate estimated using theirintegrated luminosity at 70 micron combined with an extragalactic starformation indicator. we measure a sfr of (9.5 +- 4.3)*10^{-4} msol/yr and (1.6+- 0.7)*10^{-4} msol/yr with the source counting method, in l=30 deg and l=59deg, respectively. results with the 70 micron estimator are (2.4 +-0.4)*10^{-4} msol/yr and (2.6 +- 1.1)*10^{-6} msol/yr. since the 70 micronindicator is derived from averaging extragalactic star forming complexes, weperform an extrapolation of these values to the whole milky way and obtainsfr_{mw} = (0.71 +- 0.13) msol/yr from l = 30 deg and sfr_{mw} = (0.10 +- 0.04)msol/yr from l=59 deg. the estimates in l=30 deg are in agreement with the mostrecent results on the galactic star formation activity, indicating that thecharacteristics of this field are likely close to those of the star-formationdominated galaxies used for its derivation. since the sky coverage is limited,this analysis will improve when the full hi-gal survey will be available.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1212.3269	on the limitations of the anomalous microwave emission emissivity	many studies of anomalous microwave emission (ame) have computed an ameemissivity to compare the strength of the ame detected in different regions.such a value is usually defined as the ratio between the intensity of the ameat 1 cm and the thermal dust emission at 100 \mu m. however, as studies ofgalactic dust emission have shown, the intensity of the thermal dust emissionat 100 \mu m is strongly dependent on the dust temperature, which has severeimplications for the ame emissivity defined in this way. in this work, weillustrate and quantify this effect and find that the ame emissivity decreasesby a factor of 11.1 between dust temperatures of 20 and 30 k. we, therefore,conclude that computing the ame emissivity relative to the 100 \mu m emissiondoes not allow for accurate comparisons between the ame observed in differentenvironments. with this in mind, we investigate the use of other tracers of thedust emission with which to compute the ame emissivity and we ultimatelyconclude that, despite the difficulty in deriving its value, the column densityof the dust would be the most suitable quantity with which to compute the ameemissivity.

1303.5073	planck 2013 results. xiii. galactic co emission	rotational transition lines of co play a major role in molecular radioastronomy and in particular in the study of star formation and the galacticstructure. although a wealth of data exists in the galactic plane and somewell-known molecular clouds, there is no available co high sensitivity all-skysurvey to date.  such all-sky surveys can be constructed using the \planck\ hfi data becausethe three lowest co rotational transition lines at 115, 230 and 345 ghzsignificantly contribute to the signal of the 100, 217 and 353 ghz hfi channelsrespectively. two different component separation methods are used to extractthe co maps from planck hfi data. the maps obtained are then compared to oneanother and to existing external co surveys. from these quality checks the bestco maps in terms of signal to noise and/or residual foreground contaminationare selected. three sets of velocity-integrated co emission maps are produced:type 1 maps of the co (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2) rotational transitions with lowforeground contamination but moderate signal-to-noise ratio; type 2 maps forthe (1-0) and (2-1) transitions with a better signal-to-noise ratio; and onetype 3 map, a line composite map with the best signal-to-noise ratio in orderto locate the faintest molecular regions. the maps are described in detail.they are shown to be fully compatible with previous surveys of parts of thegalactic plane and also of fainter regions out of the galactic plane. theplanck hfi velocity-integrated co maps for the (1-0), (2-1), and (3-2)rotational transitions provide an unprecedented all-sky co view of the galaxy.these maps are also of great interest to monitor potential co contamination oncmb \planck\ studies.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

1303.5075	planck 2013 results. xv. cmb power spectra and likelihood	we present the planck likelihood, a complete statistical description of thetwo-point correlation function of the cmb temperature fluctuations. we use thislikelihood to derive the planck cmb power spectrum over three decades in l,covering 2 &lt;= l &lt;= 2500. the main source of error at l &lt;= 1500 is cosmicvariance. uncertainties in small-scale foreground modelling and instrumentalnoise dominate the error budget at higher l's. for l &lt; 50, our likelihoodexploits all planck frequency channels from 30 to 353 ghz through a physicallymotivated bayesian component separation technique. at l &gt;= 50, we employ acorrelated gaussian likelihood approximation based on angular cross-spectraderived from the 100, 143 and 217 ghz channels. we validate our likelihoodthrough an extensive suite of consistency tests, and assess the impact ofresidual foreground and instrumental uncertainties on cosmological parameters.we find good internal agreement among the high-l cross-spectra with residualsof a few uk^2 at l &lt;= 1000. we compare our results with foreground-cleaned cmbmaps, and with cross-spectra derived from the 70 ghz planck map, and find broadagreement in terms of spectrum residuals and cosmological parameters. thebest-fit lcdm cosmology is in excellent agreement with preliminary planckpolarisation spectra. the standard lcdm cosmology is well constrained by planckby l &lt;= 1500. for example, we report a 5.4 sigma deviation from n_s /= 1.considering various extensions beyond the standard model, we find no indicationof significant departures from the lcdm framework. finally, we report a tensionbetween the best-fit lcdm model and the low-l spectrum in the form of a powerdeficit of 5-10% at l &lt;~ 40, significant at 2.5-3 sigma. we do not elaboratefurther on its cosmological implications, but note that this is our mostpuzzling finding in an otherwise remarkably consistent dataset.

1303.5082	planck 2013 results. xxii. constraints on inflation	we analyse the implications of the planck data for cosmic inflation. theplanck nominal mission temperature anisotropy measurements, combined with thewmap large-angle polarization, constrain the scalar spectral index to $n_s =0.9603 \pm 0.0073$, ruling out exact scale invariance at over 5 $\sigma$.planck establishes an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r &lt; 0.11(95% cl). the planck data thus shrink the space of allowed standardinflationary models, preferring potentials with v" &lt; 0. exponential potentialmodels, the simplest hybrid inflationary models, and monomial potential modelsof degree n &gt; 2 do not provide a good fit to the data. planck does not findstatistically significant running of the scalar spectral index, obtaining $dn_s/d ln k = -0.0134 \pm 0.0090$. several analyses dropping the slow-rollapproximation are carried out, including detailed model comparison andinflationary potential reconstruction. we also investigate whether theprimordial power spectrum contains any features. we find that models with aparameterized oscillatory feature improve the fit $\chi^2$ by ~ 10; however,bayesian evidence does not prefer these models. we constrain severalsingle-field inflation models with generalized lagrangians by combining powerspectrum data with bounds on $f_\mathrm{nl}$ measured by planck. the fractionalprimordial contribution of cdm isocurvature modes in the curvaton and axionscenarios has upper bounds of 0.25% or 3.9% (95% cl), respectively. in modelswith arbitrarily correlated cdm or neutrino isocurvature modes, ananticorrelation can improve $\chi^2$ by approximatively 4 as a result ofslightly lowering the theoretical prediction for the $\ell&lt;40$ multipolesrelative to the higher multipoles. nonetheless, the data are consistent withadiabatic initial conditions.

1304.4996	constraints on free-free emission from anomalous microwave emission  sources in the perseus molecular cloud	we present observations performed with the green bank telescope at 1.4 and 5ghz of three strips coincident with the anomalous microwave emission featurespreviously identified in the perseus molecular cloud at 33 ghz with the verysmall array. with these observations we determine the level of the lowfrequency (~1 - 5 ghz) emission. we do not detect any significant extendedemission in these regions and we compute conservative 3\sigma upper limits onthe fraction of free-free emission at 33 ghz of 27%, 12%, and 18% for the threestrips, indicating that the level of the emission at 1.4 and 5 ghz cannotaccount for the emission observed at 33 ghz. additionally, we find that the lowfrequency emission is not spatially correlated with the emission observed at 33ghz. these results indicate that the emission observed in the perseus molecularcloud at 33 ghz, is indeed in excess over the low frequency emission, henceconfirming its anomalous nature.

1305.1339	bayesian method for the analysis of the dust emission in the  far-infrared and submillimeter	we present a method, based on bayesian statistics, to fit the dust emissionparameters in the far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. the methodestimates the dust temperature and spectral emissivity index, plus theirrelationship, taking into account properly the statistical and systematicuncertainties. we test it on three sets of simulated sources detectable by theherschel space observatory in the pacs and spire spectral bands (70-500micron), spanning over a wide range of dust temperatures. the simulatedobservations are a one-component interstellar medium, and two two-componentsources, both warm (hii regions) and cold (cold clumps). we first define aprocedure to identify the better model, then we recover the parameters of themodel and measure their physical correlations by means of a monte carlo markovchain algorithm adopting multi-variate gaussian priors. in this process weassess the reliability of the model recovery, and of parameters estimation. weconclude that the model and parameters are properly recovered only undercertain circumstances, and that false models may be derived in some case. weapplied the method to a set of 91 starless cold clumps in an inter-arm regionof the galactic plane with low star formation activity, observed by herschel inthe hi-gal survey. our results are consistent with a temperature independentspectral index.

1307.6815	planck intermediate results. xiv. dust emission at millimetre  wavelengths in the galactic plane	we use planck hfi data combined with ancillary radio data to study theemissivity index of the interstellar dust emission in the frequency range 10 -353 ghz, or 3 - 0.8 mm, in the galactic plane. we analyse the region l=20 degr- 44 degr and |b| \leq 4 degr where the free-free emission can be estimatedfrom radio recombination line data. we fit the spectra at each sky pixel with amodified blackbody model and two spectral indices, beta_mm and beta_fir, belowand above 353 ghz respectively. we find that beta_mm is smaller than beta_firand we detect a correlation between this low frequency power-law index and thedust optical depth at 353 ghz, tau_353. the opacity spectral index beta_mmincreases from about 1.54 in the more diffuse regions of the galactic disk, |b|= 3 degr - 4 degr and tau_353 ~ 5 x 10^{-5}, to about 1.66 in the densestregions with an optical depth of more than one order of magnitude higher. weassociate this correlation with an evolution of the dust emissivity related tothe fraction of molecular gas along the line of sight. this translates intobeta_mm ~ 1.54 for a medium that is mostly atomic and beta_mm ~ 1.66 when themedium is dominated by molecular gas. we find that both the two-level systemmodel and the emission by ferromagnetic particles can explain the results. theresults improve our understanding of the physics of interstellar dust and leadtowards a complete model of the dust spectrum of the milky way fromfar-infrared to millimetre wavelengths.

1309.0382	planck 2013 results. xxx. cosmic infrared background measurements and  implications for star formation	we present new measurements of cib anisotropies using planck. combining hfidata with iras, the angular auto- and cross frequency power spectrum ismeasured from 143 to 3000 ghz, and the auto-bispectrum from 217 to 545 ghz. thetotal areas used to compute the cib power spectrum and bispectrum are about2240 and 4400 deg^2, respectively. after careful removal of the contaminants,and a complete study of systematics, the cib power spectrum and bispectrum aremeasured with unprecedented signal to noise ratio from angular multipolesell~150 to 2500, and ell~130 to 1100, respectively. two approaches aredeveloped for modelling cib power spectrum anisotropies. the first approachtakes advantage of the unique measurements by planck at large angular scales,and models only the linear part of the power spectrum, with a mean bias of darkmatter halos hosting dusty galaxies at a given redshift weighted by theircontribution to the emissivities. the second approach is based on a model thatassociates star-forming galaxies with dark matter halos and their subhalos,using a parametrized relation between the dust-processed infrared luminosityand (sub-)halo mass. the two approaches simultaneously fit all auto- and cross-power spectra very well. we find that the star formation history is wellconstrained up to z~2. however, at higher redshift, the accuracy of the starformation history measurement is strongly degraded by the uncertainty in thespectral energy distribution of cib galaxies. we also find that cib galaxieshave warmer temperatures as redshift increases. the cib bispectrum is steeperthan that expected from the power spectrum, although well fitted by a powerlaw; this gives some information about the contribution of massive halos to thecib bispectrum.

1309.1357	planck intermediate results. xv. a study of anomalous microwave emission  in galactic clouds	anomalous microwave emission (ame) is believed to be due to electric dipoleradiation from small spinning dust grains. the aim of this paper is astatistical study of the basic properties of ame regions and the environment inwhich they emit. we used wmap and planck maps, combined with ancillary radioand ir data, to construct a sample of 98 candidate ame sources, assembling sedsfor each source using aperture photometry on 1deg-smoothed maps from 0.408 ghzup to 3000 ghz. each spectrum is fitted with a simple model of free-free,synchrotron (where necessary), cosmic microwave background (cmb), thermal dust,and spinning dust components. we find that 42 of the 98 sources havesignificant (&gt;5sigma) excess emission at frequencies between 20 and 60 ghz. ananalysis of the potential contribution of optically thick free-free emissionfrom ultra-compact hii regions, using ir colour criteria, reduces thesignificant ame sample to 27 regions. the spectrum of the ame is consistentwith model spectra of spinning dust. the ame regions tend to be more spatiallyextended than regions with little or no ame. the ame intensity is stronglycorrelated with the submillimetre/ir flux densities and comparable to previousame detections in the literature. ame emissivity, defined as the ratio of ameto dust optical depth, varies by an order of magnitude for the ame regions. theame regions tend to be associated with cooler dust in the range 14-20 k and anaverage emissivity index of +1.8, while the non-ame regions are typicallywarmer, at 20-27 k. in agreement with previous studies, the ame emissivityappears to decrease with increasing column density. the emerging picture isthat the bulk of the ame is coming from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonsand small dust grains from the colder neutral interstellar medium phase(abridged).

1312.1300	planck 2013 results. xi. all-sky model of thermal dust emission	this paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the planck 857,545 and 353 ghz, and iras 100 micron data. using a modified black-body fit tothe data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, andspectral index over the 353-3000 ghz range. this model is a tightrepresentation of the data at 5 arc min. it shows variations of the order of 30% compared with the widely-used model of finkbeiner, davis, and schlegel. theplanck data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the wholesky, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared toprevious all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions. anincrease of the dust opacity at 353 ghz, tau_353/n_h, from the diffuse to thedenser interstellar medium (ism) is reported. it is associated with a decreasein the observed dust temperature, t_obs, that could be due at least in part tothe increased dust opacity. we also report an excess of dust emission at hicolumn densities lower than 10^20 cm^-2 that could be the signature of dust inthe warm ionized medium. in the diffuse ism at high galactic latitude, wereport an anti-correlation between tau_353/n_h and t_obs while the dustspecific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency(the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant. the implication is thatin the diffuse high-latitude ism tau_353 is not as reliable a tracer of dustcolumn density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlationof tau_353 with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements onstars is strong. to estimate galactic e(b-v) in extragalactic fields at highlatitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead ofthe dust optical depth, calibrated to e(b-v) using reddening measurements ofquasars deduced from sloan digital sky survey data.

1403.4723	planck intermediate results. xviii the millimetre and sub-millimetre  emission from planetary nebulae	late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-lossevents whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (cse).planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on asample of galactic planetary nebulae (pne) in the important and relativelyunexplored observational band between 30 and 857ghz. planck enables theassembly of comprehensive pne spectral energy distributions (seds) from radio{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. modelling of the derived seds provides uswith information on physical properties of cses and the mass content of bothmain components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-ir emission. in particular,the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. such quantities havealso been estimated for the very young pn crl618, where the strong variabilityobserved in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented theconstruction of its sed. a morphological study of the helix nebula has alsobeen performed. planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatialdistribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify differentcomponents, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope isinteracting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

1404.2285	characterizing the structure of diffuse emission in hi-gal maps	we present a study of the structure of the galactic interstellar mediumthrough the delta-variance technique, related to the power spectrum and thefractal properties of infrared/sub-mm maps. through this method, it is possibleto provide quantitative parameters which are useful to characterize differentmorphological and physical conditions, and to better constrain the theoreticalmodels. in this respect, the herschel infrared galactic plane survey carriedout at five photometric bands from 70 to 500 \mu m constitutes an uniquedatabase for applying statistical tools to a variety of regions across themilky way. in this paper, we derive a robust estimate of the power-law portionof the power spectrum of four contiguous 2{\deg}x2{\deg} hi-gal tiles locatedin the third galactic quadrant (217{\deg} &lt; l &lt; 225{\deg}, -2{\deg} &lt; b &lt;0{\deg}). the low level of confusion along the line of sight testified by coobservations makes this region an ideal case. we find very different values ofthe power spectrum slope from tile to tile but also from wavelength towavelength (2 &lt; \beta &lt; 3), with similarities between fields attributable tocomponents located at the same distance. thanks to the comparison with modelsof turbulence, an explanation of the determined slopes in terms of the fractalgeometry is also provided, and possible relations with the underlying physicsare investigated. in particular, an anti-correlation between ism fractaldimension and star formation efficiency is found for the two main distancecomponents observed in these fields. a possible link between the fractalproperties of the diff?use emission and the resulting clump mass function isdiscussed.

1405.0871	planck intermediate results. xix. an overview of the polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust	this paper presents the large-scale polarized sky as seen by planck hfi at353 ghz, which is the most sensitive planck channel for dust polarization. weconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction andpolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possiblesystematic effects. we find that the maximum observed dust polarizationfraction is high (pmax &gt; 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dustcolumn density (av &lt; 1mag) regions. there is a systematic decrease in the dustpolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret thefeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignmentpredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. we alsocharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angledispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,the polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated byfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field skyprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust columndensity. the polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with thedispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likelydue to fluctuations in the 3d magnetic field orientation along the line ofsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.we also compare the dustemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the planck lfi,with low-frequency radio data, and with faraday rotation measurements ofextragalactic sources. the two polarized components are globally similar instructure along the plane and notably in the fan and north polar spur regions.a detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust andcosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirmsthat much of the variation observed in the planck data is due to the 3dstructure of the magnetic field.

1405.0873	planck intermediate results. xxi. comparison of polarized thermal  emission from galactic dust at 353 ghz with interstellar polarization in the  visible	the planck survey provides unprecedented full-sky coverage of thesubmillimetre polarized emission from galactic dust, bringing new constraintson the properties of dust. the dust grains that emit the radiation seen byplanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in thevisible. comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellarpolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique newdiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. usingancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,we obtain the degree of polarization, $p_v$ , and the optical depth in the vband to the star, $\tau_v$. toward these stars we measure the submillimetrepolarized intensity, $p_s$, and total intensity, $i_s$, in the planck 353 ghzchannel. for those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium withcomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directionsclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visibleto find two ratios, $r_{s/v} = (p_s/i_s)/(p_v/\tau_v)$ and $r_{p/p} = p_s/p_v$, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the alignedgrain population alone. we find $r_{s/v}$ = 4.2, with statistical andsystematic uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3, respectively, and $r_{p/p}$ = 5.4 mjysr$^{-1}$, with uncertainties 0.2 and 0.3 mjy sr$^{-1}$, respectively. ourestimate of $r_{s/v}$ is compatible with predictions based on a range ofpolarizing dust models that have been developed for the diffuse interstellarmedium. however, our estimate of $r_{p/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,which are too low by a factor of about 2.5. this more discriminatingdiagnostic, $r_{p/p}$, indicates that changes to the optical properties in themodels of the aligned grain population are required.

1406.4443	the identification of filaments on far infrared and submillimiter  images. morphology, physical conditions and relation with star formation of  filamentary structure	observations of molecular clouds reveal a complex structure, with gas anddust often arranged in filamentary rather than spherical geometries. theassociations of pre- and proto- stellar cores with the filaments suggest adirect link with the process of star formation. any study of the properties ofsuch filaments requires a representative samples from different enviroments andso an unbiased detection method. we developed such an approach using thehessian matrix of a surface-brightness distribution to identify filaments anddetermine their physical and morphological properties. after testing the methodon simulated, but realistic filaments, we apply the algorithms tocolumn-density maps computed from herschel observations of the galactic planeobtained by the hi-gal project. we identified ~500 filaments, in the longituderange of l=216.5 to l=225.5, with lengths from ~1 pc up to ~30 pc and widthsbetween 0.1 pc and 2.5 pc. average column densities are between 10^20 cm^-2 and10^22 cm^-2. filaments include the majority of dense material with n_h_2 &gt;6x10^21cm^-2. we find that the pre- and proto-stellar compact sources alreadyidentified in the same region are mostly associated with filaments. however,surface densities in excess of the expected critical values for high-mass starformation are only found on the filaments, indicating that these structures arenecessary to channel material into the clumps. furthermore, we analyze thegravitational stability of filaments and discuss their relationship with starformation.

1406.5093	planck intermediate results. xxiii. galactic plane emission components  derived from planck with ancillary data	planck data when combined with ancillary data provide a unique opportunity toseparate the diffuse emission components of the inner galaxy. the purpose ofthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components inthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarifythe relationship between the various components. the region of the galacticplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emissionis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. the latitude widthsin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to fwhmz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. the four emissioncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwaveemission (ame), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. these components areidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (seds) at positionsalong the galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of planck(28.4-857ghz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3ghz pluswmap data at 23-94ghz, along with far-infrared (fir) data from dirbe and iras.the free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (rrl) data.ame is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on thegalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40ghz with a width in latitude similarto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4ghz emissionin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. the free-free component is the narrowest,reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced bythe narrow distribution of ob stars. it is the dominant emission on the planebetween 60 and 100ghz. rrls from this ionized gas are used to assess itsdistance, leading to a free-free z-width of fwhm ~100pc...(abridged)

1407.5452	planck intermediate results. xxv. the andromeda galaxy as seen by planck	the andromeda galaxy (m31) is one of a few galaxies that has sufficientangular size on the sky to be resolved by the planck satellite. planck hasdetected m31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dustemission with the high frequency instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiralarms and sub-features. we examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dustemission as seen by planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, andinvestigate the dust heating mechanism across m31. we find that dust dominatingthe longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffusestellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dustdominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellarpopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). we alsofit spectral energy distributions (seds) for individual 5' pixels and quantifythe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these differentheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature withgalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as wouldbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$k in the nucleus to14$\,$k outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. finally, we measure the integratedspectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a globaldust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$k with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-freeemission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$ghz, which corresponds to astar formation rate of around $0.12$m$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. we find a$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a30$\,$ghz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$jy, which is in line with expectations fromour galaxy.

1409.5738	planck intermediate results. xxx. the angular power spectrum of  polarized dust emission at intermediate and high galactic latitudes	the polarized thermal emission from galactic dust is the main foregroundpresent in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) at frequencies above 100ghz. we exploit the planck hfi polarization datafrom 100 to 353ghz to measure the dust angular power spectra $c_\ell^{ee,bb}$over the range $40&lt;\ell&lt;600$ well away from the galactic plane. these willbring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determinationof the level of contamination for cmb polarization experiments. we show thatstatistical properties of the emission can be characterized over largefractions of the sky using $c_\ell$. for the dust, they are well described bypower laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{ee,bb}=-2.42\pm0.02$. theamplitudes of the polarization $c_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in away similar to the intensity ones. the dust polarization frequency dependenceis consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and$t_d=19.6$k. we find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the galactic$b$- and $e$-modes of 0.5. we show that even in the faintest dust-emittingregions there are no "clean" windows where primordial cmb $b$-mode polarizationcould be measured without subtraction of dust emission. finally, we investigatethe level of dust polarization in the bicep2 experiment field. extrapolation ofthe planck 353ghz data to 150ghz gives a dust power$\ell(\ell+1)c_\ell^{bb}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$k$_{cmb}^2$ over the$40&lt;\ell&lt;120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is anadditional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the sameunits. this is the same magnitude as reported by bicep2 over this $\ell$ range,which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even inthe cleanest windows of the sky.

1409.6892	modeling and predicting the shape of the far-infrared to submillimeter  emission in ultra-compact hii regions and cold clumps	dust properties are very likely affected by the environment in which dustgrains evolve. for instance, some analyses of cold clumps (7 k- 17 k) indicatethat the aggregation process is favored in dense environments. however,studying warm (30 k-40 k) dust emission at long wavelength ($\lambda$$&gt;$300$\mu$m) has been limited because it is difficult to combine farinfared-to-millimeter (fir-to-mm) spectral coverage and high angular resolutionfor observations of warm dust grains. using herschel data from 70 to 500$\mu$m, which are part of the herschel infrared galactic (hi-gal) surveycombined with 1.1 mm data from the bolocam galactic plane survey (bgps), wecompared emission in two types of environments: ultra-compact hii (uchii)regions, and cold molecular clumps (denoted as cold clumps). with thiscomparison we tested dust emission models in the fir-to-mm domain thatreproduce emission in the diffuse medium, in these two environments (uchiiregions and cold clumps). we also investigated their ability to predict thedust emission in our galaxy. we determined the emission spectra in twelve uchiiregions and twelve cold clumps, and derived the dust temperature (t) using therecent two-level system (tls) model with three sets of parameters and theso-called t-$\beta$ (temperature-dust emissvity index) phenomenological models,with $\beta$ set to 1.5, 2 and 2.5. we tested the applicability of the tlsmodel in warm regions for the first time. this analysis indicates distincttrends in the dust emission between cold and warm environments that are visiblethrough changes in the dust emissivity index. however, with the use of standardparameters, the tls model is able to reproduce the spectral behavior observedin cold and warm regions, from the change of the dust temperature alone,whereas a t-$\beta$ model requires $\beta$ to be known.

1410.6119	spitzer/infrared spectrograph investigation of mipsgal 24 {\mu}m compact  bubbles : low resolution observations	we present spitzer/irs low resolution observations of 11 compactcircumstellar bubbles from the mipsgal 24 {\mu}m galactic plane survey. we findthat this set of mipsgal bubbles (mbs) is divided into two categories, and thatthis distinction correlates with the morphologies of the mbs in the mid- ir.the four mbs with central sources in the mid-ir exhibit dust-rich, lowexcitation spectra, and their 24 {\mu}m emission is accounted for by the dustcontinuum. the seven mbs without central sources in the mid-ir have spectradominated by high excitation gas lines (e.g., [o iv] 26.0 {\mu}m, [ne v] 14.3and 24.3 {\mu}m, [ne iii] 15.5 {\mu}m), and the [o iv] line accounts for 50 toalmost 100% of the 24 {\mu}m emission in five of them. in the dust-poor mbs,the [ne v] and [ne iii] line ratios correspond to high excitation conditions.based on comparisons with published irs spectra, we suggest that the dust-poormbs are highly excited planetary nebulae with peculiar white dwarfs (e.g.,[wr], novae) at their centers. the central stars of the four dust-rich mbs areall massive star candidates. dust temperatures range from 40 to 100 k in theouter shells. we constrain the extinction along the lines of sight from the irsspectra. we then derive distance, dust masses, and dust production rateestimates for these objects. these estimates are all consistent with the natureof the central stars. we summarize the identifications of mbs made to date anddiscuss the correlation between their mid-ir morphologies and natures.candidate be/b[e]/lbv and wr stars are mainly "rings" with mid-ir centralsources, whereas pne are mostly "disks" without mid-ir central sources.therefore we expect that most of the 300 remaining unidentified mbs will beclassified as pne.

1501.00922	planck intermediate results. xxxiv. the magnetic field structure in the  rosette nebula	planck has mapped the polarized dust emission over the whole sky, making itpossible to trace the galactic magnetic field structure that pervades theinterstellar medium (ism). we combine polarization data from planck withrotation measure (rm) observations towards a massive star-forming region, therosette nebula in the monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic fieldstructure and the impact of an expanding hii region on the morphology of thefield. we derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed toevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion ofionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ism. from the rm data weestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field ofabout 3microg (towards the observer) in the rosette nebula, for a uniformelectron density of about 12cm-3. the dust shell that surrounds the rosette hiiregion is clearly observed in the planck intensity map at 353 ghz, with apolarization signal significantly different from that of the local backgroundwhen considered as a whole. the planck observations constrain theplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the rosette's parentmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along thegalactic plane. the planck data are compared with the analytical model, whichpredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shellfor a given orientation of the field. this comparison leads to an upper limitof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic fieldin the rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of4%. this field direction can reproduce the rm values detected in the ionizedregion if the magnetic field strength in the monoceros molecular cloud is inthe range 6.5--9microg.

1501.02196	new radio observations of anomalous microwave emission in the hii region  rcw175	we have observed the hii region rcw175 with the 64m parkes telescope at8.4ghz and 13.5ghz in total intensity, and at 21.5ghz in both total intensityand polarization. high angular resolution, high sensitivity, and polarizationcapability enable us to perform a detailed study of the different constituentsof the hii region. for the first time, we resolve three distinct regions atmicrowave frequencies, two of which are part of the same annular diffusestructure. our observations enable us to confirm the presence of anomalousmicrowave emission (ame) from rcw175. fitting the integrated flux densityacross the entire region with the currently available spinning dust models,using physically motivated assumptions, indicates the presence of at least twospinning dust components: a warm component with a relatively large hydrogennumber density n_h=26.3/cm^3 and a cold component with a hydrogen numberdensity of n_h=150/cm^3. the present study is an example highlighting thepotential of using high angular-resolution microwave data to break modelparameter degeneracies. thanks to our spectral coverage and angular resolution,we have been able to derive one of the first ame maps, at 13.5ghz, showingclear evidence that the bulk of the ame arises in particular from one of thesource components, with some additional contribution from the diffusestructure. a cross-correlation analysis with thermal dust emission has shown ahigh degree of correlation with one of the regions within rcw175. in the centerof rcw175, we find an average polarized emission at 21.5ghz of2.2\pm0.2(rand.)\pm0.3(sys.)% of the total emission, where we have includedboth systematic and statistical uncertainties at 68% cl. this polarizedemission could be due to sub-dominant synchrotron emission from the region andis thus consistent with very faint or non-polarized emission associated withame.

1501.07092	galactic cold cores v. dust opacity	the project galactic cold cores has made herschel observations ofinterstellar clouds where the planck satellite survey has located cold andcompact clumps. the sources range from starless clumps to protostellar cores.we examine 116 herschel fields to estimate the submillimetre dust opacity andits variations. the submillimetre dust opacity was derived from herschel data,and near-infrared observations of the reddening of background stars areconverted into near-infrared optical depth. we studied the systematic errorsaffecting these parameters and used modelling to correct for the expectedbiases. the ratio of 250um and j band opacities is correlated with the cloudlocation and star formation activity. we find a median ratio oftau(250um)/tau(j)= (1.6+-0.2)*10^-3, which is more than three times the meanvalue in diffuse medium. assuming a spectral index beta=1.8 instead ofbeta=2.0, the value would be lower by ~30%. no significant systematic variationis detected with galactocentric distance or with galactic height. thetau(250um)/tau(j) maps reveal six fields with clear increase of submillimetreopacity of up to tau(250um)/tau(j) ~ 4*10^-3. these are all nearby fields withspatially resolved clumps of high column density. we interpret the increase inthe far-infrared opacity as a sign of grain growth in the densest and coldestregions of interstellar clouds.

1502.00612	a joint analysis of bicep2/keck array and planck data	we report the results of a joint analysis of data from bicep2/keck array andplanck. bicep2 and keck array have observed the same approximately 400 deg$^2$patch of sky centered on ra 0h, dec. $-57.5\deg$. the combined maps reach adepth of 57 nk deg in stokes $q$ and $u$ in a band centered at 150 ghz. planckhas observed the full sky in polarization at seven frequencies from 30 to 353ghz, but much less deeply in any given region (1.2 $\mu$k deg in $q$ and $u$ at143 ghz). we detect 150$\times$353 cross-correlation in $b$-modes at highsignificance. we fit the single- and cross-frequency power spectra atfrequencies $\geq 150$ ghz to a lensed-$\lambda$cdm model that includes dustand a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves (asparameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using a prior on thefrequency spectral behavior of polarized dust emission from previous \planck\analysis of other regions of the sky. we find strong evidence for dust and nostatistically significant evidence for tensor modes. we probe various modelvariations and extensions, including adding a synchrotron component incombination with lower frequency data, and find that these make littledifference to the $r$ constraint. finally we present an alternative analysiswhich is similar to a map-based cleaning of the dust contribution, and showthat this gives similar constraints. the final result is expressed as alikelihood curve for $r$, and yields an upper limit $r_{0.05}&lt;0.12$ at 95%confidence. marginalizing over dust and $r$, lensing $b$-modes are detected at$7.0\,\sigma$ significance.

1502.01588	planck 2015 results. x. diffuse component separation: foreground maps	planck has mapped the microwave sky in nine frequency bands between 30 and857 ghz in temperature and seven bands between 30 and 353 ghz in polarization.in this paper we consider the problem of diffuse astrophysical componentseparation, and process these maps within a bayesian framework to derive aconsistent set of full-sky astrophysical component maps. for the temperatureanalysis, we combine the planck observations with the 9-year wmap sky maps andthe haslam et al. 408 mhz map to derive a joint model of cmb, synchrotron,free-free, spinning dust, co, line emission in the 94 and 100 ghz channels, andthermal dust emission. full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutionsvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,relative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the skymodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. for polarization, the model includescmb, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. these models provide excellentfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 ukover 93% of the sky for all planck frequencies up to 353 ghz, and fractionalerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. the main limitations ofthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among thespinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observationsfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. themain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies areuncertainties in the 545 and 857 ghz calibration and zero-points. forpolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the100-353 ghz bands on large angular scales in the form oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digitalconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expectedto improve in the near future.

1502.02114	planck 2015 results. xx. constraints on inflation	we present the implications for cosmic inflation of the planck measurementsof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies in both temperature andpolarization based on the full planck survey. the planck full missiontemperature data and a first release of polarization data on large angularscales measure the spectral index of curvature perturbations to be$n_\mathrm{s} = 0.968 \pm 0.006$ and tightly constrain its scale dependence to$d n_s/d \ln k =-0.003 \pm 0.007$ when combined with the planck lensinglikelihood. when the high-$\ell$ polarization data is included, the results areconsistent and uncertainties are reduced. the upper bound on thetensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.002} &lt; 0.11$ (95% cl), consistent with theb-mode polarization constraint $r&lt; 0.12$ (95% cl) obtained from a jointbicep2/keck array and planck analysis. these results imply that $v(\phi)\propto \phi^2$ and natural inflation are now disfavoured compared to modelspredicting a smaller tensor-to-scalar ratio, such as $r^2$ inflation. threeindependent methods reconstructing the primordial power spectrum areinvestigated. the planck data are consistent with adiabatic primordialperturbations. we investigate inflationary models producing an anisotropicmodulation of the primordial curvature power spectrum as well as generalizedmodels of inflation not governed by a scalar field with a canonical kineticterm. the 2015 results are consistent with the 2013 analysis based on thenominal mission data.

1502.04123	planck intermediate results. xxxv. probing the role of the magnetic  field in the formation of structure in molecular clouds	within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) gould belt molecular clouds we evaluatestatistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected onthe plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of galactic dustobserved by planck at 353 ghz, and the gas column density structures,quantified by the gradient of the column density, $n_h$. the selected regions,covering several degrees in size, are analyzed at an effective angularresolution of 10' fwhm, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in thenearest cloud. the column densities in the selected regions range from $n_h\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulkof the molecular clouds. the relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixeland analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called"histogram of relative orientations". throughout this study, we assume that thepolarized emission observed by planck at 353 ghz is representative of theprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume aconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressivelywith increasing $n_h$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferredorientation to preferentially perpendicular. in simulations ofmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relativeorientation is a signature of alfv\'enic or sub-alfv\'enic turbulence, implyingthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scalesprobed by planck. we compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimateswe obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the planckobservations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation andevolution.

1502.05956	planck 2015 results. ix. diffuse component separation: cmb maps	we present foreground-reduced cmb maps derived from the full planck data setin both temperature and polarization. compared to the corresponding planck 2013temperature sky maps, the total data volume is larger by a factor of 3.2 forfrequencies between 30 and 70 ghz, and by 1.9 for frequencies between 100 and857 ghz. in addition, systematic errors in the forms oftemperature-to-polarization leakage, analogue-to-digital conversionuncertainties, and very long time constant errors have been dramaticallyreduced, to the extent that the cosmological polarization signal may now berobustly recovered on angular scales $\ell\gtrsim40$. on the very largestscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared tothe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\ell &lt; 20$ are accordinglysuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering. as in 2013,four different cmb component separation algorithms are applied to theseobservations, providing a measure of stability with respect to algorithmic andmodelling choices. the resulting polarization maps have rms instrumental noiseranging between 0.21 and 0.27$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 55 arcmin pixels,and between 4.5 and 6.1$\,\mu\textrm{k}$ averaged over 3.4 arcmin pixels. thecosmological parameters derived from the analysis of temperature power spectraare in agreement at the $1\sigma$ level with the planck 2015 likelihood.unresolved mismatches between the noise properties of the data and simulationsprevent a satisfactory description of the higher-order statistical propertiesof the polarization maps. thus, the primary applications of these polarizationmaps are those that do not require massive simulations for accurate estimationof uncertainties, for instance estimation of cross-spectra andcross-correlations, or stacking analyses.

1504.02096	unveiling the population of orphan gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets areoriented towards the observer. however, for each grb with a typical theta_jet,there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewherein space. these off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to thedeceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparableto the viewing angle. orphan afterglows (oa) should outnumber the currentpopulation of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not beenconclusively observed so far at any frequency. we compute the expected flux ofthe population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and x-ray bands througha population synthesis code of grbs and the standard afterglow emission model.we estimate the detection rate of oa by on-going and forthcoming surveys. theaverage duration of oa as transients above a given limiting flux is derived anddescribed with analytical expressions: in general oa should appear as dailytransients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radioband. we find that ~ 2 oa yr^-1 could already be detected by gaia and up to 20oa yr^-1 could be observed by the ztf survey. a larger number of 50 oa yr^-1should be detected by lsst in the optical band. for the x-ray band, ~ 26 oayr^-1 could be detected by the erosita. for the large population of oadetectable by lsst, the x-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for thebrightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm andradio band could be the key to disentangle their grb nature from otherextragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

1507.08774	carma observations of galactic cold cores: searching for spinning dust  emission	we present the first search for spinning dust emission from a sample of 34galactic cold cores, performed using the carma interferometer. for each of ourcores we use photometric data from the herschel space observatory to constrainn_{h}, t_{d}, n_{h}, and g_{0}. by computing the mass of the cores andcomparing it to the bonnor-ebert mass, we determined that 29 of the 34 coresare gravitationally unstable and undergoing collapse. in fact, we found that 6cores are associated with at least one young stellar object, suggestive oftheir proto-stellar nature. by investigating the physical conditions withineach core, we can shed light on the cm emission revealed (or not) by our carmaobservations. indeed, we find that only 3 of our cores have any significantdetectable cm emission. using a spinning dust model, we predict the expectedlevel of spinning dust emission in each core and find that for all 34 cores,the predicted level of emission is larger than the observed cm emissionconstrained by the carma observations. moreover, even in the cores for which wedo detect cm emission, we cannot, at this stage, discriminate between free-freeemission from young stellar objects and spinning dust emission. we emphasisethat, although the carma observations described in this analysis placeimportant constraints on the presence of spinning dust in cold, denseenvironments, the source sample targeted by these observations is notstatistically representative of the entire population of galactic cores.

astro-ph;0009135	power spectrum of the polarized diffuse galactic radio emission	we have analyzed the available polarization surveys of the galactic emissionto estimate to what extent it may be a serious hindrance to forthcomingexperiments aimed at detecting the polarized component of cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies. regions were identified for which independentdata consistently indicate that depolarization must be small. the powerspectrum of the polarized emission, in terms of antenna temperature, was foundto be described by $c_{\ell}\simeq (1.2\pm 0.8)\cdot 10^{-9}\cdot (\ell /450)^{-1.8\pm 0.3}\cdot (\nu/ 2.4{\rm ghz})^{-5.8}$ k$^{2}$, from arcminute todegree scales. data on larger angular scales ($\ell\le 100$) indicate a steeperslope $\sim \ell^{-3}$. we conclude that polarized galactic emission isunlikely to be a serious limitation to cmb polarization measurements at thehighest frequencies of the map and {\sc planck}/lfi instruments, at least for$\ell\ge 50$ and standard cosmological models. the weak correlation betweenpolarization and total power and the low polarization degree of radio emissionclose to the galactic plane, found also in low-depolarization regions, isinterpreted as due to large contributions to the observed intensity fromunpolarized sources, primarily strong hii regions, concentrated on the galacticplane. thus estimates of the power spectrum of total intensity at low galacticlatitudes are not representative of the spatial distribution of galacticemission far from the plane. both total power and polarized emissions showhighly significant deviations from a gaussian distribution.

astro-ph;0210226	a radio catalog of galactic hii regions for applications from decimeter  to millimeter wavelengths	by collecting the information from 24 previously published lists andcatalogs, we produce a comprehensive catalog (master catalog) of 1442 galactichii regions. for each object, we quote the original fluxes and diameters aswell as the available information on radio line velocities, line widths andline temperatures and the errors on these quantitities. references to theoriginal works are also reported. by exploiting all these data we produce asynthetic catalog of fluxes and diameters (with corresponding errors) at 2.7ghz. this choice is motivated by the extensive, although not complete,information available at this frequency, widely spread among many differentcatalogs, and by its relevance for both detailed studies on galactic hiiregions and the extrapolation up to millimetric wavelengths. the catalog can beused for detailed studies of galactic hii regions and, by extrapolation, forinvestigations of hii regions up to millimetric wavelengths. in particular, wediscuss the study of the effects of microwave emission from hii regions on thenew generation of cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments. we presentsimulations of the detection of hii regions in the high resolution cmb survey,and briefly analize some of the typical applications of our catalog to theevaluation of cmb anisotropy experiments such as calibration, beamreconstruction and straylight effects. the master catalog and the syntheticcatalog are available via ftp at: cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr. this work is related toplanck-lfi activities.

astro-ph;0303645	trade-off between angular resolution and straylight contamination in cmb  anisotropy experiments. ii. straylight evaluation	satellite cmb anisotropy missions and new generation of balloon-borne andground experiments, make use of complex multi-frequency instruments at thefocus of a meter class telescope. between 70 ghz and 300 ghz, where foregroundcontamination is minimum, it is extremely important to reach the best trade-offbetween the improvement of the angular resolution and the minimization of thestraylight contamination mainly due to the galactic emission. we focus here, asa working case, on the 30 and 100 ghz channels of the planck low frequencyinstrument (lfi). we evaluate the gsc introduced by the most relevant galacticforeground components for a reference set of optical configurations. we showthat it is possible to improve the angular resolution of 5-7% by keeping theoverall gsc below the level of few microkelvin. a comparison between the levelof straylight introduced by the different galactic components for differentbeam regions is presented. simple approximate relations giving the rms andpeak-to-peak levels of the gsc are provided. we compare the results obtained at100 ghz with those at 30 ghz, where gsc is more critical. finally, we comparethe results based on galactic foreground templates derived from radio and irsurveys with those based on wmap maps including cmb and extragalactic sourcefluctuations.

astro-ph;0309350	spatial distribution of galactic hii regions	we present a new, detailed, analysis of the spatial distribution of galactichii regions, exploiting a far richer database than used in previous analyses.galactocentric distances have been derived for 550 objects. distances from thesun could be unambiguously derived from velocity data for 117 of them, lyingeither outside the solar circle (84) or on a line-of-sight tangential to theirorbit (33). for 177 further sources, distance estimates are made possible bythe use of auxiliary data. a highly significant correlation between luminosityand linear diameter was found and the corresponding least-square linearrelationship in the log-log plane was used to resolve the distance ambiguityfor an additional 256 sources. within the solar circle the thickness of thedistribution of hii regions around the galactic plane was found to becomparable to that of ob stars (bronfman et al. 2000). at larger galactocentricradii the shape of the distribution reflects that of the warp, and itsthickness along the z axis increases with increasing distance from the galacticcentre. we also confirm, for a much larger sample, the previously reportedpositive gradient of electron temperature with galactocentric distance.

0808.3582	carma millimeter-wave aperture synthesis imaging of the hd 32297 debris  disk	we present the first detection and mapping of the hd 32297 debris disk at 1.3mm with the combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma).with a sub-arcsecond beam, this detection represents the highest angularresolution (sub)mm debris disk observation made to date. our model fits to thespectral energy distribution from the carma flux and new spitzer mipsphotometry support the earlier suggestion that at least two, possibly three,distinct grain populations are traced by the current data. the observedmillimeter map shows an asymmetry between the northeast and southwest disklobes, suggesting large grains may be trapped in resonance with an unseenexoplanet. alternatively, the observed morphology could result from the recentbreakup of a massive planetesimal. a similar-scale asymmetry is also observedin scattered light but not in the mid-infrared. this contrast between asymmetryat short and long wavelengths and symmetry at intermediate wavelengths is inqualitative agreement with predictions of resonant debris disk models. withresolved observations in several bands spanning over three decades inwavelength, hd 32297 provides a unique testbed for theories of grain andplanetary dynamics, and could potentially provide strong multi-wavelengthevidence for an exoplanetary system.

astro-ph;0504537	analysis of the thin layer of galactic warm ionized gas in the range 20  &lt; l &lt; 30 deg, -1.5 &lt; b &lt; +1.5 deg	we present an analysis of the thin layer of galactic warm ionized gas at anangular resolution ~ 10'. this is carried out using radio continuum data at 1.4ghz, 2.7 ghz and 5 ghz in the coordinate region 20 &lt; l &lt; 30 deg, -1.5 &lt; b &lt;+1.5 deg. for this purpose, we evaluate the zero level of the 2.7 and 5 ghzsurveys using auxiliary data at 2.3 ghz and 408 mhz. the derived zero levelcorrections are t_{zero}(2.7 ghz)=0.15 +/- 0.06 k and t_{zero}(5 ghz)=0.1 +/-0.05 k. we separate the thermal (free-free) and non-thermal (synchrotron)component by means of a spectral analysis performed adopting an antennatemperature spectral index -2.1 for the free-free emission, a realistic spatialdistribution of indices for the synchrotron radiation and by fitting,pixel-by-pixel, the galactic spectral index. we find that at 5 ghz, for |b| = 0deg, the fraction of thermal emission reaches a maximum value of 82%, while at1.4 ghz, the corresponding value is 68%. in addition, for the thermal emission,the analysis indicates a dominant contribution of the diffuse componentrelative to the source component associated with discrete hii regions.

astro-ph;0608189	spitzer sage survey of the large magellanic cloud ii: evolved stars and  infrared color magnitude diagrams	color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) are presented for the spitzer sage (surveyingthe agents of a galaxy's evolution) survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc).irac and mips 24 um epoch one data are presented. these data represent thedeepest, widest mid-infrared cmds of their kind ever produced in the lmc.combined with the 2mass survey, the diagrams are used to delineate the evolvedstellar populations in the large magellanic cloud as well as galacticforeground and extragalactic background populations. some 32000 evolved starsbrighter than the tip of the red giant branch are identified. of these,approximately 17500 are classified as oxygen-rich, 7000 carbon-rich, andanother 1200 as ``extreme'' asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. brightermembers of the latter group have been called ``obscured'' agb stars in theliterature owing to their dusty circumstellar envelopes. a large number (1200)of luminous oxygen--rich agb stars/m supergiants are also identified. finally,there is strong evidence from the 24 um mips channel that previouslyunexplored, lower luminosity oxygen-rich agb stars contribute significantly tothe mass loss budget of the lmc (1200 such sources are identified).

astro-ph;0611606	a broadband study of galactic dust emission	we have combined infrared data with hi, h2 and hii surveys in order tospatially decompose the observed dust emission into components associated withdifferent phases of the gas. an inversion technique is applied. for thedecomposition, we use the iras 60 and 100 micron bands, the dirbe 140 and 240micron bands, as well as archeops 850 and 2096 micron wavelengths. in addition,we apply the decomposition to all five wmap bands. we obtain longitude andlatitude profiles for each wavelength and for each gas component in carefullyselected galactic radius bins.we also derive emissivity coefficients for dustin atomic, molecular and ionized gas in each of the bins.the hi emissivityappears to decrease with increasing galactic radius indicating that dustassociated with atomic gas is heated by the ambient interstellar radiationfield (isrf). by contrast, we find evidence that dust mixed with molecularclouds is significantly heated by o/b stars still embedded in their progenitorclouds. by assuming a modified black-body with emissivity law lambda^(-1.5), wealso derive the radial distribution of temperature for each phase of the gas.all of the wmap bands except w appear to be dominated by emission fromsomething other than normal dust, most likely a mixture of thermalbremstrahlung from diffuse ionized gas, synchrotron emission and spinning dust.furthermore, we find indications of an emissivity excess at long wavelengths(lambda &gt; 850 micron) in the outer galaxy (r &gt; 8.9 kpc). this suggests eitherthe existence of a very cold dust component in the outer galaxy or atemperature dependence of the spectral emissivity index. finally, it is shownthat ~ 80% of the total fir luminosity is produced by dust associated withatomic hydrogen, in agreement with earlier findings by sodroski et al. (1997).
