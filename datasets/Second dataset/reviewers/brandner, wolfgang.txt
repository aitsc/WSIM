0901.1997	testing the models: nir imaging and spectroscopy of the benchmark  t-dwarf binary eps indi b	the relative roles of metallicity and surface gravity on the near-infraredspectra of late-t brown dwarfs are not yet fully understood, and evolutionarymodels still need to be calibrated in order to provide accurate estimates ofbrown dwarf physical parameters from measured spectra. the t-type brown dwarfseps indi ba and bb forming the tightly bound binary eps indi b, which orbitsthe k4v star eps indi a, are nowadays the only such benchmark t dwarfs forwhich all important physical parameters such as metallicity, age and mass are(or soon will be) known. we present spatially resolved vlt/naco images and lowresolution spectra of eps indi b in the j, h and k near-infrared bands. thespectral types of eps indi ba and bb are determined by direct comparison of theflux-calibrated jhk spectra with t dwarf standard template spectra and also bynir spectral indices. eps indi bb is confirmed as a t6 while the spectral typeof eps indi ba is t1.5 so somewhat later than the previously reported t1.constrained values for surface gravity and effective temperature are derived bycomparison with model spectra. the evolutionary models predict masses aroundabout 53 m_j for eps indi ba and about 34 m_j for eps indi bb, slightly higherthan previously reported values. the suppressed j-band and enhanced k-band fluxof eps indi ba indicates that a noticeable cloud layer is still present in at1.5 dwarf while no clouds are needed to model the spectrum of eps indi bb.

0904.1825	the evolution of massive ysos in the lmc: part i. identification and  spectral classification	we present and categorize spitzer irs spectra of 294 objects in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc) to create the largest and most complete catalog ofmassive young stellar object (yso) spectra in the lmc. target sources wereidentified from infrared photometry and multi-wavelength images indicative ofyoung, massive stars highly enshrouded in their natal gas and dust clouds. oursample primarily consists of 277 objects we identify as having spectralfeatures indicative of embedded ysos. the remaining sources are comprised of 7c-rich evolved sources, 8 sources dominated by broad silicate emission, and 1source with multiple broad emission features. those with yso-like spectra showa range of spectral features including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonemission, deep silicate absorption, fine-structure lines, and ice absorptionfeatures. based upon the relative strengths of these features, we haveclassified the yso candidates into several distinct categories using thewidely-used statistical procedure known as principal component analysis. wepropose that these categories represent a spectrum of evolutionary stagesduring massive yso formation. we conclude that massive pre-main sequence starsspend a majority of their massive, embedded lives emitting in the uv. half ofthe sources in our study have features typical of compact hii regions,suggesting that massive ysos can create a detectable compact hii regionhalf-way through the formation time present in our sample. this study alsoprovides a check on commonly used source-selection procedures including the useof photometry to identify ysos. we determine a high success rate (&gt;95%) ofidentifying objects with yso-like spectra can be achieved through careful useof infrared cmds, seds, and image inspections.

0706.3824	the very nearby m/t dwarf binary scr 1845-6357	the recently discovered star scr 1845-6357 is the first late m/t dwarf binarydiscovered. scr 1845 is a particular object due to its tight orbit (currentlyaround 4 au) and its proximity to the sun (3.85 pc). we present spatiallyresolved vlt/naco images and low resolution spectra of scr 1845 in the j, h andk near-infrared bands. since the t dwarf companion, scr 1845b, is so close tothe primary scr 1845a, orbital motion is evident even within a year. followingthe orbital motion, the binary's mass can be measured accurately within adecade, making scr 1845b a key t-dwarf mass-luminosity calibrator. the nirspectra allow for accurate determination of spectral type and also for roughestimates of the object's physical parameters. the spectral type of scr 1845bis determined by direct comparison of the flux calibrated jhk spectra with tdwarf standard template spectra and also by nir spectral indices obtained fromsynthetic photometry. constrained values for surface gravity, effectivetemperature and metallicity are derived by comparison with model spectra. ourdata prove that scr 1845b is a brown dwarf of spectral type t6 that isco-moving with and therefore gravitationally bound to the m8.5 primary. fittingthe nir spectrum of scr 1845b to model spectra yields an effective temperatureof about 950k and a surface gravity log(g)=5.1 (cgs) assuming solarmetallicity. mass and age of scr 1845b are in the range 40 to 50 jupiter massesand 1.8 to 3.1 gyr.

0706.4133	the proper motion of the arches cluster with keck laser-guide star  adaptive optics	we present the first measurement of the proper motion of the young, compactarches cluster near the galactic center from near-infrared adaptive optics (ao)data taken with the recently commissioned laser-guide star (lgs) at the keck10-m telescope. the excellent astrometric accuracy achieved with lgs-aoprovides the basis for a detailed comparison with vlt/naos-conica data taken4.3 years earlier. over the 4.3 year baseline, a spatial displacement of thearches cluster with respect to the field population is measured to be 24.0 +/-2.2 mas, corresponding to a proper motion of 5.6 +/- 0.5 mas/yr or 212 +/- 29km/s at a distance of 8 kpc. in combination with the known line-of-sightvelocity of the cluster, we derive a 3d space motion of 232 +/- 30 km/s of thearches relative to the field. the large proper motion of the arches cannot beexplained with any of the closed orbital families observed in gas clouds in thebar potential of the inner galaxy, but would be consistent with the archesbeing on a transitional trajectory from x1 to x2 orbits. we investigate acloud-cloud collision as the possible origin for the arches cluster. theintegration of the cluster orbit in the potential of the inner galaxy suggeststhat the cluster passes within 10 pc of the supermassive black hole only if itstrue gc distance is very close to its projected distance. a contribution ofyoung stars from the arches cluster to the young stellar population in theinner few parsecs of the gc thus appears increasingly unlikely. the measurementof the 3d velocity and orbital analysis provides the first observationalevidence that arches-like clusters do not spiral into the gc. this confirmsthat no progenitor clusters to the nuclear cluster are observed at the presentepoch.

(2009). the underlying data we use ispart of a new database from a deep near-infrared survey at the calar altoobservatory. the survey is more than four magnitudes deeper than the 2masssurvey and covers currently ~1.5 square degree. complementary opticalphotometry from sdss were available for roughly 1.0 square degree. afterselection of the candidates using different color indices, additionalphotometry from spitzer/irac was included in the analysis. in greater detail wefocus on two very faint objects for which we obtained j-band spectra. based oncomparison with reference spectra we derive a spectral type of l2+/-0.5 for oneobject, making it the object with the latest spectral type in taurus knowntoday. from models we find the effective temperature to be 2080+/-140 k and themass 5-15 jupiter masses. for the second source the j-band spectrum does notprovide a definite proof of the young, low-mass nature of the object as theexpected steep water vapor absorption at 1.33 micron is not present in thedata. we discuss the probability that this object might be a background giantor carbon star. if it were a young taurus member, however, a comparison totheoretical models suggests that it lies close to or even below the deuteriumburning limit (&lt;13 jupiter masses) as well. a first proper motion analysis forboth objects shows that they are good candidates for being taurus members.

1005.0620	discovery of a stellar companion to the nearby solar-analogue hd 104304	sun-like stars are promising candidates to host exoplanets and are oftenincluded in exoplanet surveys by radial velocity (rv) and direct imaging. inthis paper we report on the detection of a stellar companion to the nearbysolar-analogue star hd 104304, which previously was considered to host aplanetary mass or brown dwarf companion. we searched for close stellar andsubstellar companions around extrasolar planet host stars with high angularresolution imaging to characterize planet formation environments. the detectionof the stellar companion was achieved by high angular resolution measurements,using the "lucky imaging" technique at the eso ntt 3.5m with the astralux surinstrument. we combined the results with vlt/naco archive data, where thecompanion could also be detected. the results were compared to precise rvmeasurements of hd 104304, obtained at the lick and keck observatories from2001-2010.  we confirmed common proper motion of the binary system. a spectral type ofm4v of the companion and a mass of 0.21 m_sun was derived. due to comparison ofthe data with rv measurements of the unconfirmed planet candidate listed in theextrasolar planets encyclopaedia, we suggest that the discovered companion isthe origin of the rv trend and that the inclination of the orbit ofapproximately 35 degrees explains the relatively small rv signal.

0710.5891	integral field spectroscopy of l 449-1 -- a test case for spectral  differential imaging with sinfoni	spectral differential imaging is an increasingly used technique forground-based direct imaging searches for brown dwarf and planetary masscompanions to stars. the technique takes advantage of absorption features thatexist in these cool objects, but not in stars, and is normally implementedthrough simultaneous narrow-band imagers in 2 to 4 adjacent channels. however,by instead using an integral field unit, different spectral features could beused depending on the actual spectrum, potentially leading to greaterflexibility and stronger detection limits. in this paper, we present theresults of a test of spectral differential imaging using the sinfoni integralfield unit at the vlt to study the nearby active star l449-1. no convincingcompanion candidates are found. we find that the method provides a 3 sigmacontrast limit of 7.5 mag at 0.35", which is about 1.5 mag lower than fornaco-sdi at the same telescope, using the same integration time. we discuss thereasons for this, and the implications. in addition, we use the sinfoni data toconstrain the spectral type in the nir for l 449-1, and find a result betweenm3.0 and m4.0, in close agreement with a previous classification in the visualrange.

1207.2945	the gravity coud\'e infrared adaptive optics (ciao) system for the vlt  interferometer	gravity is a second generation instrument for the vlt interferometer,designed to enhance the near-infrared astrometric and spectro-imagingcapabilities of vlti. combining beams from four telescopes, gravity willprovide an astrometric precision of order 10 micro-arcseconds, imagingresolution of 4 milli-arcseconds, and low and medium resolutionspectro-interferometry, pushing its performance far beyond current infraredinterfero- metric capabilities. to maximise the performance of gravity,adaptive optics correction will be implemented at each of the vlt unittelescopes to correct for the effects of atmospheric turbulence. to achievethis, the gravity project includes a development programme for four newwavefront sensors (wfs) and nir-optimized real time control system. thesedevices will enable closed-loop adaptive correction at the four unit telescopesin the range 1.4-2.4 {\mu}m. this is crucially important for an efficientadaptive optics implementation in regions where optically bright referencessources are scarce, such as the galactic centre. we present here the design ofthe gravity wavefront sensors and give an overview of the expected adaptiveoptics performance under typical observing conditions. benefiting from newlydeveloped selex/eso saphira electron avalanche photodiode (eapd) detectorsproviding fast readout with low noise in the near-infrared, the ao systems areexpected to achieve residual wavefront errors of \leq400 nm at an operatingfrequency of 500 hz.

1212.3355	the arches cluster out to its tidal radius: dynamical mass segregation  and the effect of the extinction law on the stellar mass function	the galactic center is the most active site of star formation in the milkyway galaxy, where particularly high-mass stars have formed very recently andare still forming today. however, since we are looking at the galactic centerthrough the galactic disk, knowledge of extinction is crucial when studyingthis region. the arches cluster is a young, massive starburst cluster near thegalactic center. we observed the arches cluster out to its tidal radius usingks-band imaging obtained with naos/conica at the vlt combined with subaro/ciscoj-band data to gain a full understanding of the cluster mass distribution. weshow that the determination of the mass of the most massive star in the archescluster, which had been used in previous studies to establish an upper masslimit for the star formation process in the milky way, strongly depends on theassumed slope of the extinction law. assuming the two regimes of widely usedinfrared extinction laws, we show that the difference can reach up to 30% forindividually derived stellar masses and delta aks ~ 1 magnitude in acquiredks-band extinction, while the present-day mass function slope changes by ~ 0.17dex. the present-day mass function slope derived assuming the more recentextinction law increases from a flat slope of alpha_{nishi}=-1.50 \pm0.35 inthe core (r&lt;0.2 pc) to alpha_{nishi}=-2.21 \pm0.27 in the intermediate annulus(0.2 &lt;r&lt;0.4 pc), where the salpeter slope is -2.3. the mass function steepensto alpha_{nishi}=-3.21 \pm0.30 in the outer annulus (0.4&lt;r&lt;1.5 pc), indicatingthat the outer cluster region is depleted of high-mass stars. this picture isconsistent with mass segregation owing to the dynamical evolution of thecluster.

1302.5705	mapping h-band scattered light emission in the mysterious sr21  transitional disk	we present the first near infrared (nir) spatially resolved images of thecircumstellar transitional disk around sr21. these images were obtained withthe subaru hiciao camera, adaptive optics and the polarized differentialimaging (pdi) technique. we resolve the disk in scattered light at h-band forstellocentric 0.1"&lt;r&lt;0.6" (12&lt;r&lt;75au). we compare our results with previouslypublished spatially-resolved 880 micron continuum submillimeter array (sma)images that show an inner r&lt;36au cavity in sr21. radiative transfer modelsreveal that the large disk depletion factor invoked to explain sr21's sub-mmcavity cannot be "universal" for all grain sizes. even significantly moremoderate depletions (delta=0.1, 0.01 relative to an undepleted disk) than thosethat reproduce the sub-mm cavity (delta~10^-6) are inconsistent with our h-bandimages when they are assumed to carry over to small grains, suggesting thatsurface grains scattering in the nir either survive or are generated bywhatever mechanism is clearing the disk midplane. in fact, the radial polarizedintensity profile of our h-band observations is smooth and steeplyinwardly-increasing (r^-3), with no evidence of a break at the 36au sub-mmcavity wall. we hypothesize that this profile is dominated by an optically thindisk envelope or atmosphere component. we also discuss the compatibility of ourdata with the previously postulated existence of a sub-stellar companion tosr21 at r~10-20au, and find that we can neither exclude nor verify thisscenario. this study demonstrates the power of multiwavelength imaging oftransitional disks to inform modeling efforts, including the debate overprecisely what physical mechanism is responsible for clearing these disks oftheir large midplane grains.

1306.1887	high-contrast near-infrared imaging polarimetry of the protoplanetary  disk around ry tau	we present near-infrared coronagraphic imaging polarimetry of ry tau. thescattered light in the circumstellar environment was imaged at h-band at a highresolution (~0".05) for the first time, using subaru-hiciao. the observedpolarized intensity (pi) distribution shows a butterfly-like distribution ofbright emission with an angular scale similar to the disk observed atmillimeter wavelengths. this distribution is offset toward the blueshifted jet,indicating the presence of a geometrically thick disk or a remnant envelope,and therefore the earliest stage of the class ii evolutionary phase. we performcomparisons between the observed pi distribution and disk models with: (1) fullradiative transfer code, using the spectral energy distribution (sed) toconstrain the disk parameters; and (2) monochromatic simulations of scatteredlight which explore a wide range of parameters space to constrain the disk anddust parameters. we show that these models cannot consistently explain theobserved pi distribution, sed, and the viewing angle inferred by millimeterinterferometry. we suggest that the scattered light in the near-infrared isassociated with an optically thin and geometrically thick layer above the disksurface, with the surface responsible for the infrared sed. half of thescattered light and thermal radiation in this layer illuminates the disksurface, and this process may significantly affect the thermal structure of thedisk.

1306.6338	feedback regulated star formation: ii. dual constraints on the sfe and  the age spread of stars in massive clusters	we show that the termination of the star formation process by winds frommassive stars in protocluster forming clumps imposes dual constraints on thestar formation efficiencies (sfes) and stellar age spreads ($\delta \tau_{*}$)in stellar clusters. we have considered two main classes of clump models. oneclass of models in one in which the core formation efficiency (cfe) per unittime and as a consequence the star formation rate (sfr) is constant in time andanother class of models in which the cfe per unit time, and as a consequencethe sfr, increases with time. models with an increasing mode of star formationyield shorter age spreads (a few 0.1 myrs) and typically higher sfes thanmodels in which star formation is uniform in time. we find that the formermodels reproduce remarkably well the sfe$-\delta \tau_{*}$ values of starburstclusters such as ngc 3603 yc and westerlund 1, while the latter describe betterthe star formation process in lower density environments such as in the orionnebula cluster. we also show that the sfe and $\delta \tau_{*}$ of massiveclusters are expected to be higher in low metallicity environments. this couldbe tested with future large extragalactic surveys of stellar clusters. weadvocate that placing a stellar cluster on the sfe-$\delta \tau_{*}$ diagram isa powerful method to distinguish between different stellar clusters formationscenarios such as between generic gravitational instability of a gascloud/clump or as the result of cloud-cloud collisions. it is also a veryuseful tool for testing star formation theories and numerical models versus theobservations.

1409.8386	indications of m-dwarf deficits in the halo and thick disk of the galaxy	we compared the number of faint stars detected in deep survey fields with thecurrent stellar distribution model of the galaxy and found that the detectednumber in the h band is significantly smaller than the predicted number. thisindicates that m-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and thethick disk. we used archived data of several surveys in both the north andsouth field of goods (great observatories origins deep survey), mods ingoods-n, and ers and candels in goods-s. the number density of m-dwarfs in thehalo has to be 20+/-13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order forthe detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the h band to match withthe predicted value from the model. in the thick disk, the number density ofm-dwarfs must be reduced (52+/-13%) or the scale height must be decreased (~600pc). alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can besignificantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainlyconsists of faint m-dwarfs. our results imply that the m-dwarf population inregions distant from the galactic plane is significantly smaller thanpreviously thought. we then discussed the implications this has on thesuitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faintstars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fit numberdensities.

1506.05456	a lucky imaging search for stellar sources near 74 transit hosts	many transiting planet host stars lack high resolution imaging and thus closestellar sources can be missed. those unknown stars potentially bias thederivation of the planetary and stellar parameters from the transit lightcurve, no matter if they are bound or not. in addition, bound stellarcompanions interact gravitationally with the exoplanet host star, the disk andthe planets and can thus influence the formation and evolution of the planetarysystem strongly. we extended our high-resolution lucky imaging survey for closestellar sources by 74 transiting planet host stars. 39 of these stars lackprevious high-resolution imaging, 23 are follow up observations of companionsor companion candidates, and the remaining stars have been observed by otherswith ao imaging though in different bands. we determine the separation of allnew and known companion candidates and estimate the flux ratio in the observedbands. all observations were carried out with the lucky imaging camera astraluxnorte at the calar alto 2.2 m telescope in i' and z' passbands. we find newstellar sources within 1 arcsec to hat-p-27, hat-p-28, hat-p-35, wasp-76, andwasp-103, and between 1 and 4 arcsec to hat-p-29 and wasp-56.

(1994) whodetected that two third of the wider pairs with separations from 400 au to 6000au are coeval. however, unlike hartigan et al. for the wider pairs, we find nonon-coeval pairs among our sample. thus, the formation mechanism for asignificant fraction of the wider pre-main-sequence binaries might be differentfrom that of closer pre-main-sequence binaries. all of the latter appear tohave formed simultaneously.
