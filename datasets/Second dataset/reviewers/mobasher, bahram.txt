0902.3349	a deep vla radio continuum study of the core and outskirts of the coma  cluster	we present deep 1.4ghz very large array (vla) radio continuum observations oftwo ~half square degree fields in the coma cluster of galaxies. the two fields,"coma 1" and "coma 3," correspond to the cluster core and southwest infallregion and were selected on account of abundant pre-existing multiwavelengthdata. in their most sensitive regions the radio data reach 22 ujy rms per 4.4"beam, sufficient to detect (at 5-sigma) coma member galaxies with log(l) =20.11 w/hz. the full catalog of radio detections is presented herein andconsists of 1030 sources detected at &gt;=5 sigma, 628 of which are within thecombined coma 1 and coma 3 area. we also provide optical identifications of theradio sources using data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the depth ofthe radio observations allows us to detect agn in cluster elliptical galaxieswith mr &lt; -20.5 (ab magnitudes), including radio detections for all clusterellipticals with mr &lt; -21.8. at fainter optical magnitudes (-20.5 &lt; mr &lt;~ -19)the radio sources are associated with star-forming galaxies with star formationrates as low as 0.1 solar masses per year.

0902.3388	the radio luminosity function and galaxy evolution in the coma cluster	we investigate the radio luminosity function (rlf) and radio sourcepopulation for two fields within the coma cluster of galaxies. our vla datareach down to log(l) = 20.23 w/hz for coma, and we associate 249 sources withoptical counterparts from the sdss. comprehensive optical spectroscopyidentifies 38 of these as members of the coma cluster, evenly split between agnand star-forming galaxies (sfg). the radio-detected sfg are the dominantpopulation only for ~21 &lt; log(l) &lt; ~22 w/hz, an interesting result given thatstar formation dominates field rlfs for log(l) &lt; ~23. the majority of theradio-detected sfgs have characteristics of starbursts, including high specificstar formation rates and optical spectra with strong emission lines. inconjunction with prior studies on post-starburst galaxies within the comacluster, this is consistent with a picture in which late-type galaxies enteringcoma undergo a starburst prior to a rapid cessation of star formation.optically bright elliptical galaxies (mr &lt;= -20.5) make the largestcontribution to the radio luminosity function at both the high (log(l) &gt;~ 22.48w/hz) and low (log(l) &lt;~ 21 w/hz) ends. through a stacking analysis of theseoptically-bright ellipticals we find that they continue to harbor radio sourcesdown to log(l) = 19.48. however, contrary to published results for the virgocluster we find no evidence for the existence of a population of opticallyfaint (mr ~ -14) dwarf ellipticals hosting strong radio agn.

0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

0707.4505	the far-infrared luminosity function from goods-n: constraining the  evolution of infrared galaxies for z \leq 1	we present the ir luminosity function derived from ultra-deep 70 micronimaging of the goods-north field. the 70 micron observations are longward ofthe pah and silicate features which complicate work in the mir. we derivefar-infrared luminosities for the 143 sources with s_{70} &gt; 2 mjy (s/n &gt; 3\sigma). the majority (81%) of the sources have spectroscopic redshifts, andphotometric redshifts are calculated for the remainder. the ir luminosityfunction at four redshifts (z ~ 0.28, 0.48, 0.78, and 0.97) is derived andcompared to the local one. there is considerable degeneracy between luminosityand density evolution. if the evolving luminosity function is described as\rho(l, z) = (1 + z)^q \rho(l/(1 + z)^p, 0), we find q = -2.19p + 6.09. in thecase of pure luminosity evolution, we find a best fit of p =2.78^{+0.34}_{-0.32}. this is consistent with the results from 24 micron and1.4 ghz studies. our results confirm the emerging picture of strong evolutionin lirgs and ulirgs at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, but we find no evidence of significantevolution in the sub-lirg (l &lt; 10^{11} l_{\odot}) population for z &lt; 0.4.

1004.2498	deep galex observations of the coma cluster: source catalog and galaxy  counts	we present a source catalog from deep 26 ks galex observations of the comacluster in the far-uv (fuv; 1530 a) and near-uv (nuv; 2310 a) wavebands. theobserved field is centered 0.9 deg (1.6 mpc) south-west of the coma core, andhas full optical photometric coverage with sdss. the catalog consists of 9700galaxies with galex and sdss photometry, including 242spectroscopically-confirmed coma member galaxies that range from giant spiralsand elliptical galaxies to dwarf irregular and early-type galaxies. the fullmulti-wavelength catalog (cluster plus background galaxies) is ~80% complete tonuv=23 and fuv=23.5, and has a limiting depth at nuv=24.5 and fuv=25.0 whichcorresponds to a star formation rate of ~0.001 msun/yr at the distance of coma.our deep galex observations required a two-fold approach to generating a sourcecatalog: we used a bayesian deblending algorithm to measure faint and compactsources (using sdss coordinates as a position prior), and relied on the galexpipeline catalog for bright/extended objects. we performed simulations toassess the influence that systematic effects (e.g. object blends, sourceconfusion, eddington bias) have on source detection and photometry when usingboth methods. the bayesian deblending method roughly doubles the number ofsource detections and provides reliable photometry to a few magnitudes deeperthan the galex pipeline catalog. this method is also free from source confusionover the uv magnitude range studied here; conversely, we estimate that thegalex pipeline catalogs are confusion limited at magnitudes fainter than nuv~23and fuv~24. we have measured the total uv galaxy counts using our catalog andreport a ~50% excess of counts across fuv=22-23.5 and nuv=21.5-23 relative toprevious galex measurements, which is not attributed to cluster membergalaxies. our galaxy counts are a better match to deeper uv counts measuredwith hst.

1006.0978	a multi-wavelength approach to the properties of extremely red galaxy  populations: i - contribution to the star formation rate density and agn  content	we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the properties of extremely redgalaxy (erg) populations, selected in the goods-south/chandra deep field southfield. by using all the photometric and spectroscopic information available onlarge deep samples of eros (645 sources), ieros (294 sources), and drgs (350sources), we derive redshift distributions, identify agn powered andstar-formation powered galaxies, and, using the radio observations of thisfield, estimate robust (agn- and dust-unbiased) star formation rate densities(sfrd) for these populations. we also investigate the properties of "pure"(galaxies that conform to only one of the three erg criteria considered) and"combined" (galaxies that verify all three criteria) sub-populations. overall,a large number of agn are identified (up to ~30%, based on x-rays, andmid-infrared criteria), the majority of which are type-2 (obscured) objects.among ergs with no evidence for agn activity, we identify sub-populationscovering a wide range of average star-formation rates, from below 10 mo/yr toas high as 200 mo/yr. applying a redshift separation (1&lt;z&lt;2 and 2&lt;z&lt;3) we findsignificant evolution (an increase of a factor of 2 or higher) of sfrd for erosand drgs, while none is observed for ieros. the former populations cancontribute more than 20\% to the global sfrd at 2&lt;z&lt;3. the emission from agnactivity is typically not strong in the erg population, with agn increasing theaverage radio luminosity of erg sub-populations by, nominally, less than 20%.agn are common, however, and, if no discrimination is attempted, this couldsignificantly increase the sfrd estimate (by over 100% in some cases). thus,and while the contribution of star forming processes to the radio luminosity ingalaxies with agn remains uncertain, a comprehensive identification of agn inthese populations is necessary to obtain meaningful results.

1009.3504	a detailed study of photometric redshifts for goods-south galaxies	we use the deepest and the most comprehensive photometric data currentlyavailable for goods-south galaxies to measure their photometric redshifts. thephotometry includes vlt/vimos (u-band), hst/acs (f435w, f606w, f775w, andf850lp bands), vlt/isaac (j-, h-, and ks-bands), and four spitzer/irac channels(3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron). the catalog is selected in the z-band (f850lp)and photometry in each band is carried out using the recently completed tfitalgorithm, which performs psf matched photometry uniformly across differentinstruments and filters, despite large variations in psfs and pixel scales.photometric redshifts are derived using the goodz code, which is based on thetemplate fitting method using priors. the code also implements "training" ofthe template sed set, using available spectroscopic redshifts in order tominimize systematic differences between the templates and the seds of theobserved galaxies. our final catalog covers an area of 153 sq. arcmin andincludes photometric redshifts for a total of 32,505 objects. the scatterbetween our estimated photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma=0.040with 3.7% outliers to the full z-band depth of our catalog, decreasing tosigma=0.039 and 2.1% outliers at a magnitude limit m(z)&lt;24.5. this isconsistent with the best results previously published for goods-s galaxies,however, the present catalog is the deepest yet available and providesphotometric redshifts for significantly more objects to deeper flux limits andhigher redshifts than earlier works. furthermore, we show that the photometricredshifts estimated here for galaxies selected as dropouts are consistent withthose expected based on the lyman break technique.

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

0710.4552	evolution of the bar fraction in cosmos: quantifying the assembly of the  hubble sequence	we have analyzed the redshift-dependent fraction of galactic bars over0.2&lt;z&lt;0.84 in 2,157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the cosmos 2-squaredegree field. our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in anyprevious investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data thanthat available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxymorphology. we find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly withredshift. whereas in the local universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxiescontain bars (sb+sab), at z ~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. over thisredshift range the fraction of strong (sb) bars drops from about 30% to under10%. it is clear that when the universe was half its present age, the census ofgalaxies on the hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of thepresent day. a major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emergedfrom our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is astrong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. the barfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84whereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshiftbeyond z=0.3. there is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominatedsystems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards theco-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes. our results thus have importantramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggestingthat massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as aresult of the regulation of their star formation rate.

1201.2470	a type ia supernova at redshift 1.55 in hubble space telescope infrared  observations from candels	we report the discovery of a type ia supernova (snia) at redshift z=1.55 withthe infrared detector of the wide field camera 3 (wfc3-ir) on the hubble spacetelescope (hst). this object was discovered in candels imaging data of thehubble ultra deep field, and followed as part of the candels+clash supernovaproject, comprising the sn search components from those two hst multi-cycletreasury programs. this is the highest redshift snia with direct spectroscopicevidence for classification. it is also the first sn ia at z&gt;1 found andfollowed in the infrared, providing a full light curve in rest-frame opticalbands. the classification and redshift are securely defined from a combinationof multi-band and multi-epoch photometry of the sn, ground-based spectroscopyof the host galaxy, and wfc3-ir grism spectroscopy of both the sn and host.this object is the first of a projected sample at z&gt;1.5 that will be discoveredby the candels and clash programs. the full candels+clash sn ia sample willenable unique tests for evolutionary effects that could arise due todifferences in sn ia progenitor systems as a function of redshift. this high-zsample will also allow measurement of the sn ia rate out to z~2, providing acomplementary constraint on sn ia progenitor models.

0710.5532	supernova acceleration probe (snap): investigating photometric redshift  optimization	the aim of this paper is to investigate ways to optimize the accuracy ofphotometric redshifts for a snap like mission. we focus on how the accuracy ofthe photometric redshifts depends on the magnitude limit and signal-to-noiseratio, wave-length coverage, number of filters and their shapes and observedgalaxy type. we use simulated galaxy catalogs constructed to reproduce observedgalaxy luminosity functions from goods, and derive photometric redshifts usinga template fitting method. by using a catalog that resembles real data, we canestimate the expected number density of galaxies for which photometricredshifts can be derived. we find that the accuracy of photometric redshifts isstrongly dependent on the signal-to-noise (s/n) (i.e., s/n&gt;10 is needed foraccurate photometric redshifts). the accuracy of the photometric redshifts isalso dependent on galaxy type, with smaller scatter for earlier type galaxies.comparing results using different filter sets, we find that including theu-band is important for decreasing the fraction of outliers, i.e.,``catastrophic failures''. using broad overlapping filters with resolution~4gives better photometric redshifts compared to narrower filters (resolution&gt;~5) with the same integration time. we find that filters with square responsecurves result in a slightly higher scatter, mainly due to a higher fraction ofoutliers at faint magnitudes. we also compare a 9-filter set to a 17-filterset, where we assume that the available exposure time per filter in the latterset is half that of the first set. we find that the 9-filter set gives moreaccurate redshifts for a larger number of objects and reaches higher redshift,while the 17-filter set is gives better results at bright magnitudes.

1205.4764	a new infrared color criterion for the selection of 0&lt;z&lt;7 agn:  application to deep fields and implications for jwst surveys	[abridged] it is widely accepted that observations at mid-infrared (mid-ir)wavelengths enable the selection of galaxies with nuclear activity, which maynot be revealed even in the deepest x-ray surveys. in this work new near- andmid-ir color diagnostics are explored, aiming for improved efficiency - bettercompleteness and less contamination - in selecting agn out to very highredshifts. we restrict our study to the james webb space telescope wavelengthrange (0.6-27um). the criteria are created based on the predictions bystate-of-the-art galaxy and agn templates covering a wide variety of galaxyproperties, and tested against control samples with deep multi-wavelengthcoverage (ranging from the x-rays to radio frequencies). we show that thecolors ks-[4.5], [4.5]-[8.0], and [8.0]-[24] are ideal as agn/non-agndiagnostics at, respectively, z&lt;~1, 1&lt;~z&lt;~2.5, and z&gt;~2.5-3. however, when thesource redshift is unknown, these colors should be combined. we thus develop animproved ir criterion (using ks and irac bands, ki) as a new alternative atz&lt;~2.5. ki does not show improved completeness (50-60% overall) in comparisonto commonly used irac-based agn criteria, but is less affected by non-agncontamination (revealing a &gt;50-90% level of successful agn selection). we alsopropose kim (using ks, irac, and mips-24um bands, kim), which aims to selectagn hosts from local distances to as far back as the end of reionization(0&lt;z&lt;~7) with reduced non-agn contamination. however, the necessarytesting-constraints and the small control-sample sizes prevent the confirmationof its improved efficiency at z&lt;~2.5. overall, kim shows a ~30-40% completenessand a &gt;70-90% level of successful agn selection. ki and kim are built to bereliable against a ~10-20% error in flux, are based on existing filters, andare suitable for immediate use.

1208.6031	ly{\alpha} emission from high redshift sources in cosmos	we investigate spectroscopically measured ly{\alpha} equivalent widths andescape fractions of 244 sources of which 95 are lyman break galaxies (lbgs) and106 lyman alpha emitters (laes) at z~4.2, z~4.8, and z~5.6 selected fromintermediate and narrow band observations. the sources were selected from thecosmic evolution survey (cosmos), and observed with the deimos spectrograph. wefind that the distribution of equivalent widths shows no evolution withredshift for both the lbg selected sources and the intermediate/narrowbandlaes. we also find that the ly{\alpha} escape fraction of intermediate andnarrow band laes is on average higher and has a larger variation than theescape fraction of lbg selected sources. the escape fraction does not show adependence with redshift. similar to what has been found for laes at lowredshifts, the sources with the highest extinctions show the lowest escapefractions. the range of escape fractions increases with decreasing extinction.this is evidence that the dust extinction is the most important factoraffecting the escape of ly{\alpha} photons, but at low extinctions otherfactors such as hi covering fraction and gas kinematics can be just aseffective at inhibiting the escape of ly{\alpha} photons.

1304.0768	the discovery of the most distant known type ia supernova at redshift  1.914	we present the discovery of a type ia supernova (sn) at redshift $z = 1.914$from the candels multi-cycle treasury program on the \textit{hubble spacetelescope (hst)}. this sn was discovered in the infrared using the wide-fieldcamera 3, and it is the highest-redshift type ia sn yet observed. we classifythis object as a sn\,ia by comparing its light curve and spectrum with those ofa large sample of type ia and core-collapse supernovae (sne). its apparentmagnitude is consistent with that expected from the $\lambda$cdm concordancecosmology. we discuss the use of spectral evidence for classification of $z &gt;1.5$ sne\,ia using {\it hst} grism simulations, finding that spectral dataalone can frequently rule out sne\,ii, but distinguishing between sne\,ia andsne\,ib/c can require prohibitively long exposures. in such cases, aquantitative analysis of the light curve may be necessary for classification.our photometric and spectroscopic classification methods can aid thedetermination of sn rates and cosmological parameters from the fullhigh-redshift candels sn sample.

1308.4683	hot-dust (690k) luminosity density and its evolution in the last 7.5gyr	[abridged] we study the contribution of hot-dust to the luminosity density ofgalaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. using the spitzer-irac data in thecosmos field, we estimate the contribution from hot-dust at rest-frame 4.2um(from ~0 &lt; z &lt; ~0.2 up to ~0.5 &lt; z &lt; ~0.9). this wavelength corresponds toblack-body temperature of ~690k. the contribution due to stellar emission isestimated from the rest-frame 1.6um luminosity (assumed to result from stellaremission alone) and subtracted from the mid-infrared luminosity of galaxies tomeasure hot-dust emission. in order to attempt the study of the 3.3um-pahfeature, we use the rest-frame 4.2um to infer the hot-dust flux at 3.3um. thisstudy is performed for different spectral types of galaxies: early-type,late-type, starburst, and ir-selected agn. we find that: (a) the decrease ofthe hot-dust luminosity density since ~0.5 &lt; z &lt; ~1 is steeper (by at least~0.5dex) compared to that of the cold-dust, giving support to the scenariowhere galaxy obscuration increases with redshift, as already proposed in theliterature; (b) hot-dust and pah emission evolution seems to be correlated withstellar mass, where rest-frame 1.6um luminous non-agn galaxies (i.e., massivesystems) show a stronger decrement (with decreasing redshift) in hot-dust andpah emission than the less luminous (less massive) non-agn galaxies; (c)despite comprising &lt; ~3% of the total sample, agn contribute as much as a thirdto the hot-dust luminosity density at z &lt; 1 and clearly dominate the bright-endof the total hot-dust luminosity density function at ~0.5 &lt; z &lt; ~0.9; (d) theaverage dust-to-total luminosity ratio increases with redshift, whilepah-to-total luminosity ratio remains fairly constant; (e) at m_1.6 &gt; -25, thedust-to-total and pah-to-total luminosity ratios increase with decreasingluminosity, but deeper data is required to confirm this result.

1308.5353	a critical assessment of photometric redshift methods: a candels  investigation	we present results from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels) photometric redshift methods investigation. in thisinvestigation, the results from eleven participants, each using a differentcombination of photometric redshift code, template spectral energydistributions (seds) and priors, are used to examine the properties ofphotometric redshifts applied to deep fields with broad-band multi-wavelengthcoverage. the photometry used includes u-band through mid-infrared filters andwas derived using the tfit method. comparing the results, we find that there isno particular code or set of template seds that results in significantly betterphotometric redshifts compared to others. however, we find codes producing thelowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimizephotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting oradding extra smoothing errors. these results therefore stress the importance ofthe training procedure. we find a strong dependence of the photometric redshiftaccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. on the other hand, wefind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift andgalaxy color. we find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshifterrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to thatexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. we find that all codes show astatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. however, the biasis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates theerrors. finally, we find that combining results from multiple codessignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.we discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometricredshifts and error estimates.

1311.1503	the stellar mass function of star-forming galaxies and the  mass-dependent sfr function since z=2.23 from hizels	we explore a large uniformly selected sample of h${\alpha}$ selectedstar-forming galaxies (sfgs) at z=0.40,0.84,1.47,2.23 to unveil the evolutionof the star formation rate (sfr) function and the stellar mass function. wefind strong evolution in the sfr function, with the typical sfr of sfgsdeclining exponentially with time in the last 11gyrs assfr$^*$(t[gyr])=10$^{4.23/t+0.37}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, but with no evolutionin the faint-end slope, ${\alpha}\approx$-1.6. the stellar mass function ofsfgs, however, reveals little evolution: ${\alpha} \approx$-1.4,m$^*$$\approx$10$^{11.2\pm0.2}$ m$_{\odot}$ and just a slight increase of$\approx$2.3x in ${\phi}^*$ from z=2.23 to z=0.4. the stellar mass densitywithin sfgs has been roughly constant since z=2.23 at$\approx$10$^{7.65\pm0.08}$ m$_{\odot}$mpc$^{-3}$, comprising $\approx$100% ofthe stellar mass density in all galaxies at z=2.23, and declining to$\approx$20% by z=0.4, driven by the rise of the passive population. we findthat sfgs with m$\approx$10$^{10.0\pm0.2}$ m$_{\odot}$ contribute most to thesfr density (${\rho}_{\rm sfr}$) per dlog$_{10}$m, and that there is nosignificant evolution in the fractional contribution from sfgs of differentmasses to ${\rho}_{\rm sfr}$ or ${\rho}_{\rm sfr}$(dlog$_{10}$m)$^{-1}$ sincez=2.23. instead, we show that the decline of sfr$^*$ and of ${\rho}_{\rm sfr}$are primarily driven by an exponential decline in sfrs at all masses. ourresults have important implications not only on how sfgs need to be quenchedacross cosmic time, but also on the driver(s) of the exponential decline insfr$^*$ from $\approx$66 m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ to $\approx$5m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ since z=2.23.

[abridged:conclusion on survey strategy. see manuscript.] finally, when the james webbspace telescope comes online, the broad-band filters 2.0um, 4.4um, 7.7um, and18um will be key to disentangle agn from non-agn dominated seds at depths wherespectroscopy becomes impractical.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

1402.0510	physical properties of emission-line galaxies at z ~ 2 from  near-infrared spectroscopy with magellan fire	we present results from near-infrared spectroscopy of 26 emission-linegalaxies at z ~ 2 obtained with the fire spectrometer on the magellan baadetelescope. the sample was selected from the wisp survey, which uses thenear-infrared grism of the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 to detectemission-line galaxies over 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3. our fire follow-up spectroscopy(r~5000) over 1.0-2.5 micron permits detailed measurements of physicalproperties of the z~2 emission-line galaxies. dust-corrected star formationrates for the sample range from ~5-100 m_sun yr-1. we derive a medianmetallicity for the sample of ~0.45 z_sun, and the estimated stellar massesrange from ~10^8.5 - 10^9.5 m_sun. the average ionization parameters measuredfor the sample are typically much higher than what is found for localstar-forming galaxies. we derive composite spectra from the fire sample, fromwhich we infer typical nebular electron densities of ~100-400 cm^-3. based onthe location of the galaxies and composite spectra on bpt diagrams, we do notfind evidence for significant agn activity in the sample. most of the galaxiesas well as the composites are offset in the bpt diagram toward higher [oiii]/h-beta at a given [n ii]/h-alpha, in agreement with other observations ofz &gt; 1 star-forming galaxies, but composite spectra derived from the sample donot show an appreciable offset from the local star-forming sequence on the [oiii]/h-beta versus [s ii]/h-alpha diagram. we infer a high nitrogen-to-oxygenabundance ratio from the composite spectrum, which may contribute to the offsetof the high-redshift galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [oiii]/h-beta versus [n ii]/h-alpha diagram. we speculate that the elevatednitrogen abundance could result from substantial numbers of wolf-rayet stars instarbursting galaxies at z~2.

1402.3268	properties of submillimeter galaxies in the candels goods-s field	we derive physical properties of 10 submillimeter galaxies located in thecandels coverage of the goods-s field. the galaxies were first identified assubmillimeter sources with the laboca bolometer and subsequently targeted for870um continuum observation with alma. the high angular resolution of the almaimaging allows secure counterparts to be identified in the candels multibanddataset. the candels data provide deep photometric data from uv throughnear-infrared wavelengths. using synthetic spectral energy distributions, wederive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, extinction, ages, and the starformation history. the redshift range is z=1.65-4.76, with two of the galaxieslocated at z&gt;4. two smg counterparts have stellar masses 2-3 orders ofmagnitude lower than the rest. the remaining smg counterparts have stellarmasses around 1x10^11 msun. the stellar population in the smgs is typicallyolder than the expected duration of the submillimeter phase, suggesting thatthe star formation history of submillimeter galaxies is more complex than asingle burst. non-parametric morphology indices suggest that the smgcounterparts are among the most asymmetric systems compared with galaxies ofthe same stellar mass and redshift. the hst images shows that 3 of the smgs areassociated with on-going mergers. the remaining counterparts are isolated.estimating the dust and molecular gas mass from the submm fluxes, and comparingwith our stellar masses shows that the molecular gas mass fraction of smgs is~28% and that the final stellar mass is likely to be (1-2)x10^11 msun.

1405.4869	rapid decline of lyman-alpha emission toward the reionization era	the observed deficit of strongly lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;6.5 isattributed to either increasing neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium(igm) and/or to the evolving galaxy properties. to investigate this, we haveperformed very deep near-ir spectroscopy of z&gt;7 galaxies using mosfire on thekeck-i telescope. we measure the lyman-alpha fraction at z~8 (combinedphotometric redshift peak at z=7.7) using two methods. first, we derivednly{\alpha}/ntot directly using extensive simulations to correct forincompleteness. second, we used a bayesian formalism (introduced by treu et al.2012) that compares the z&gt;7 galaxy spectra to models of the lyman-alphaequivalent width (wly{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. we explored two simpleevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where lyman-alpha is attenuated in allgalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolutionor a slowly increasing igm opacity), and patchy evolution where lyman-alpha isblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the igm being opaque alongonly some fraction of sightlines). the bayesian formalism places strongerconstraints compared with the direct method. combining our data with that inthe literature we find that at z~8 the lyman-alpha fraction has dropped by afactor &gt;3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy scenarioscompared to the z~6 values. furthermore, we find a tentative evidence that thedata favor the patchy scenario over smooth (with "positive" bayesian evidence),extending trends observed at z~7 to higher redshift. if this decrease is aresult of reionization as predicted by theory, then our data imply the volumeaveraged neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm to be &gt;0.3 suggesting that thereionization of the universe is in progress at z~8.

1407.1834	the interstellar medium and feedback in the progenitors of the compact  passive galaxies at z~2	quenched galaxies at z&gt;2 are nearly all very compact relative to z~0,suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,rapid cessation of star-formation. we present restframe uv spectra oflyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors ofquenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes andhigh surface density of star-formation. we compare their uv properties to thoseof more extended lbgs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).we find that candidate progenitors have faster ism gas velocities and higherequivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocityspread among absorbing clouds. candidates deviate from the relationship betweenequivalent widths of lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in thattheir lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,possibly indicating that the neutral hi fraction is patchy such thatlyman-alpha photons can escape. we detect stronger civ p-cygni features(emission and absorption) and heii emission in candidates, indicative of largerpopulations of metal rich wolf-rayet stars compared to non-candidates. thefaster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and lyman-alpha propertiesof candidates are consistent with their ism being subject to more energeticfeedback than non-candidates. together with their larger metallicity (implyingmore evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, ifspeculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them asprogenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. we propose that massive, compact galaxiesundergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gasaccretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized lbgsat these early epochs.

1407.6012	the relation between sfr and stellar mass for galaxies at 3.5 $\le z\le$  6.5 in candels	distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formationrates (sfr) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxyformation. here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatterof the sfr-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ usingmulti-wavelength photometry in goods-s from the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and spitzer extended deep survey. wedescribe an updated, bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method thatincorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories thatare constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions(starburst and small magellanic cloud). from $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forminggalaxies in candels follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar massand sfr that follows sfr $\sim$ $m_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. this evolution requires a star formationhistory that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the sfrs ofindividual galaxies rise with time). the observed scatter in the sfr-stellarmass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{sfr}/\mathrm{m}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})&lt;0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log m_\star/\mathrm{m}_\odot &gt; 9$ dex.assuming that the sfr is tied to the net gas inflow rate (sfr $\sim$$\dot{m}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is alsosmaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass andredshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.we further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected onthe basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolutionin the sfr-stellar mass relation.

1408.2521	the mosdef survey: mass, metallicity, and star-formation rate at z~2.3	we present results on the z~2.3 mass-metallicity relation (mzr) using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. we use aninitial sample of 87 star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic coverage ofh\beta, [oiii]\lambda 5007, h\alpha, and [nii]\lambda 6584 rest-frame opticalemission lines, and estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance based on the n2 ando3n2 strong-line indicators. we find a positive correlation between stellarmass and metallicity among individual z~2.3 galaxies using both the n2 and o3n2indicators. we also measure the emission-line ratios and corresponding oxygenabundances for composite spectra in bins of stellar mass. among compositespectra, we find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellarmass, offset ~0.15-0.3 dex below the local mzr. when the sample is divided atthe median star-formation rate (sfr), we do not observe significant sfrdependence of the z~2.3 mzr among either individual galaxies or compositespectra. we furthermore find that z~2.3 galaxies have metallicities ~0.1 dexlower at a given stellar mass and sfr than is observed locally. this offsetsuggests that high-redshift galaxies do not fall on the local "fundamentalmetallicity relation" among stellar mass, metallicity, and sfr, and may provideevidence of a phase of galaxy growth in which the gas reservoir is built up dueto inflow rates that are higher than star-formation and outflow rates. however,robust conclusions regarding the gas-phase oxygen abundances of high-redshiftgalaxies await a systematic reappraisal of the application of locallycalibrated metallicity indicators at high redshift.

1408.3684	a study of massive and evolved galaxies at high redshift	we use data taken as part of hst/wfc3 observations of the cosmic assemblynear-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) to identify massiveand evolved galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;4.5. this is performed using the strength of thebalmer break feature at rest-frame 3648a, which is a diagnostic of the age ofthe stellar population in galaxies. using wfc3 h-band selected catalog for thecandels goods-s field and deep multi-waveband photometry from optical (hst) tomid-infrared (spitzer) wavelengths, we identify a population of old and evolvedpost-starburst galaxies based on the strength of their balmer breaks (balmerbreak galaxies- bbgs). the galaxies are also selected to be bright inrest-frame near-ir wavelengths and hence, massive. we identify a total of 16bbgs. fitting the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the bbgs show that thecandidate galaxies have average estimated ages of ~800 myr and average stellarmasses of ~5x10^10 m_sun, consistent with being old and massive systems. two ofour bbg candidates are also identified by the criteria that is sensitive tostar forming galaxies (lbg selection). we find a number density of ~3.2x10^-5mpc^-3 for the bbgs corresponding to a mass density of ~2.0x10^6 m_sun/mpc^3 inthe redshift range covering the survey. given the old age and the passiveevolution, it is argued that some of these objects formed the bulk of theirmass only a few hundred million years after the big bang.

1409.4791	kpc-scale properties of emission-line galaxies	we perform a detailed study of the resolved properties of emission-linegalaxies at kpc-scale to investigate how small-scale and global properties ofgalaxies are related. 119 galaxies with high-resolution keck/deimos spectra areselected to cover a wide range in morphologies over the redshift range0.2&lt;z&lt;1.3. using the hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging data taken as a part of thecandels project, for each galaxy we perform sed fitting per resolution element,producing resolved rest-frame u-v color, stellar mass, star formation rate, ageand extinction maps. we develop a technique to identify blue and red "regions"within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps. as expected, forany given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surfacedensities and older ages compared to the blue regions. furthermore, we quantifythe spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshiftand stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions towardthe centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift orstellar mass. we find that the "main sequence" of star forming galaxies existsamong both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blueregions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.6 dex. the blue regions show higher specific star formation rates (ssfr)than their red counterparts with the ssfr decreasing since z~1, driverprimarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the sfrs at a giverresolution element.

1409.6522	the mosdef survey: optical agn diagnostics at z~2.3	we present results from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey onrest-frame optical agn identification and completeness at z~2.3. with oursample of 50 galaxies and 10 x-ray and ir-selected agn with measured h-beta,[oiii], h-alpha, and [nii] emission lines, we investigate the location of agnin the bpt, mex (mass-excitation), and cex (color-excitation) diagrams. we findthat the bpt diagram works well to identify agn at z~2.3 and that the z~0agn/star-forming galaxy classifications do not need to shift substantially atz~2.3 to robustly separate these populations. however, the mex diagram fails toidentify all of the agn identified in the bpt diagram, and the cex diagram issubstantially contaminated at high redshift. we further show that agn samplesselected using the bpt diagram have selection biases in terms of both hoststellar mass and stellar population, in that agn in low mass and/or highspecific star formation rate galaxies are difficult to identify using the bptdiagram. these selection biases become increasingly severe at high redshift,such that optically-selected agn samples at high redshift will necessarily beincomplete. we also find that the gas in the narrow-line region appears to bemore enriched than gas in the host galaxy for at least some mosdef agn.however, agn at z~2 are generally less enriched than local agn with the samehost stellar mass.

1409.7071	the mosdef survey: excitation properties of $z\sim 2.3$ star-forming  galaxies	we present results on the excitation properties of z~2.3 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. with itscoverage of the full suite of strong rest-frame optical emission lines, mosdefprovides an unprecedented view of the rest-frame optical spectra of arepresentative sample of distant star-forming galaxies. we investigate thelocations of z~2.3 mosdef galaxies in multiple emission-line diagnosticdiagrams. these include the [oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha and [oiii]/hb vs. [sii]/ha"bpt" diagrams, as well as the o_32 vs. r_23 excitation diagram. we recover thewell-known offset in the star-forming sequence of high-redshift galaxies in the[oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha bpt diagram relative to sdss star-forming galaxies.however, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is lesssignificant than for rest-frame-uv selected and emission-line selected galaxiesat z~2. furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearingwithin the low-mass half of the z~2.3 mosdef sample, where galaxies are shiftedtowards higher [nii]/ha at fixed [oiii]/hb. within the [oiii]/hb vs. [sii]/haand o_32 vs. r_23 diagrams, we find that z~2.3 galaxies are distributed likelocal ones, and therefore attribute the shift in the [oiii]/hb vs. [nii]/ha bptdiagram to elevated n/o abundance ratios among lower-mass (m_*&lt;10^10 m_sun)high-redshift galaxies. the variation in n/o ratios calls into question the useat high redshift of oxygen abundance indicators based on nitrogen lines, butthe apparent invariance with redshift of the excitation sequence in the o_32vs. r_23 diagram paves the way for using the combination of o_32 and r_23 as anunbiased metallicity indicator over a wide range in redshift. this indicatorwill allow for an accurate characterization of the shape and normalization ofthe mass-metallicity relationship over more than 10 gyr.

1412.5916	sub-megaparsec individual photometric redshift estimation from cosmic  web constraints	we present a method, photoweb, for estimating photometric redshifts ofindividual galaxies, and their equivalent distance, with megaparsec and evensub-megaparsec accuracy using the cosmic web as a constraint over photo-zestimates. photoweb redshift errors for individual galaxies are of the order ofdelta_z = 0.0007, compared to errors of delta_z = 0.02 for current photo-ztechniques. the mean redshift error is of the order of 0.00005-0.0004 comparedto mean errors in the range delta_z =z 0.001-0.01 for the best availablephoto-z estimates in the literature. current photo-z techniques based on thespectral energy distribution of galaxies and projected clustering produceredshift estimates with large errors due to the poor constraining power thegalaxy's spectral energy distribution and projected clustering can provide. thecosmic web, on the other hand, provides the strongest constraints on theposition of galaxies. the network of walls, filaments and voids occupy ~%10 ofthe volume of the universe, yet they contain ~%95 of galaxies. the cosmic web,being a cellular system with well-defined boundaries, sets a restricted set ofintermittent positions a galaxy can occupy along a given line-of-sight. usingthe information in the density field computed from spectroscopic redshifts wecan narrow the possible locations of a given galaxy along the line of sightfrom a single broad probability distribution (from photo-z) to one or a fewnarrow peaks. our first results improve previous photo-z errors by more thanone order of magnitude allowing sub-megaparsec errors in some cases. suchaccurate estimates for tens of millions of galaxies will allow unprecedentedgalaxy-lss studies. in this work we apply our technique to the sdss photo-zgalaxy sample and discuss its performance and future improvements.

1502.07355	identification of the brightest ly\alpha\ emitters at z=6.6:  implications for the evolution of the luminosity function in the  re-ionisation era	using wide field narrow-band surveys, we provide a new measurement of the$z=6.6$ lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (lae) luminosity function (lf), whichconstraints the bright end for the first time. we use a combination of archivalnarrow-band nb921 data in uds and new nb921 measurements in sa22 andcosmos/ultravista, all observed with the subaru telescope, with a total area of$\sim 5$ deg$^2$. we exclude lower redshift interlopers by using broad-bandoptical and near-infrared photometry and also exclude three supernovae withdata split over multiple epochs. combining the uds and cosmos samples we findno evolution of the bright end of the ly$\alpha$ lf between $z=5.7$ and $6.6$,which is supported by spectroscopic follow-up, and conclude that sources with\emph{himiko}-like luminosity are not as rare as previously thought, withnumber densities of $\sim 1.5\times10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$. combined with ourwide-field sa22 measurements, our results indicate a non-schechter-like brightend of the lf at $z=6.6$ and a different evolution of \emph{observed} faint andbright laes. this differential evolution is also seen in the spectroscopicfollow-up of uv selected galaxies and is now also confirmed for ly$\alpha$emitters, and we argue that it may be an effect of re-ionisation. using atoy-model, we show that such differential evolution of the lf is expected,since brighter sources are able to ionise their surroundings earlier, such thatly$\alpha$ photons are able to escape. our targets are excellent candidates fordetailed follow-up studies and provide the possibility to give a unique view onthe earliest stages in the formation of galaxies and re-ionisation process.

1503.00004	evolution of the h$\beta$+[oiii] and [oii] luminosity functions and the  [oii] star-formation history of the universe up to $z$ ~ 5 from hizels	we investigate the evolution of the h$\beta$+[oiii] and [oii] luminosityfunctions from $z \sim 0.8$ to $\sim5$ in four redshift slices per emissionline using data from the high-{\it z} emission line survey (hizels). this isthe first time that the h$\beta$+[oiii] and [oii] luminosity functions havebeen studied at these redshifts in a self-consistent analysis. this is also thelargest sample of [oii] and h$\beta$+[oiii] emitters (3475 and 3298 emitters,respectively) in this redshift range, with large co-moving volumes $\sim 1\times 10^6$ mpc$^{-3}$ in two independent volumes (cosmos and uds), greatlyreducing the effects of cosmic variance. the emitters were selected by acombination of photometric redshift and color-color selections, as well asspectroscopic follow-up, including recent spectroscopic observations usingdeimos and mosfire on the keck telescopes and fmos on subaru. we find a strongincrease in $l_\star$ and a decrease in $\phi_\star$ for both h$\beta$+[oiii]and [oii] emitters. we derive the [oii] star-formation history of the universesince $z\sim5$ and find that the cosmic sfrd rises from $z \sim 5$ to $\sim 3$and then drops towards $z \sim 0$. we also find that our star-formation historyis able to reproduce the evolution of the stellar mass density up to $z\sim 5$based only on a single tracer of star-formation. when comparing theh$\beta$+[oiii] sfrds to the [oii] and h$\alpha$ sfrd measurements in theliterature, we find that there is a remarkable agreement, suggesting that theh$\beta$+[oiii] sample is dominated by star-forming galaxies at high-$z$ ratherthan agns.

1503.07879	a comparative study of density field estimation for galaxies: new  insights into the evolution of galaxies with environment in cosmos out to z~3	it is well-known that galaxy environment has a fundamental effect in shapingits properties. we study the environmental effects on galaxy evolution, with anemphasis on the environment defined as the local number density of galaxies.the density field is estimated with different estimators (weighted adaptivekernel smoothing, 10$^{th}$ and 5$^{th}$ nearest neighbors, voronoi anddelaunay tessellation) for a k$_{s}&lt;$24 sample of $\sim$190,000 galaxies in thecosmos field at 0.1$&lt;$z$&lt;$3.1. the performance of each estimator is evaluatedwith extensive simulations. we show that overall, there is a good agreementbetween the estimated density fields using different methods over $\sim$2 dexin overdensity values. however, our simulations show that adaptive kernel andvoronoi tessellation outperform other methods. using the voronoi tessellationmethod, we assign surface densities to a mass complete sample of quiescent andstar-forming galaxies out to z$\sim$3. we show that at a fixed stellar mass,the median color of quiescent galaxies does not depend on their hostenvironment out to z$\sim$3. we find that the number and stellar mass densityof massive ($&gt;$10$^{11}$m$_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies have notsignificantly changed since z$\sim$3, regardless of their environment. however,for massive quiescent systems at lower redshifts (z$\lesssim$1.3), we find asignificant evolution in the number and stellar mass densities in denserenvironments compared to lower density regions. our results suggest that therelation between stellar mass and local density is more fundamental than thecolor-density relation and that environment plays a significant role inquenching star formation activity in galaxies at z$\lesssim$1.

1504.01734	evidence for popiii-like stellar populations in the most luminous  lyman-$\alpha$ emitters at the epoch of re-ionisation: spectroscopic  confirmation	faint lyman-$\alpha$ (ly$\alpha$) emitters become increasingly rarer towardsthe re-ionisation epoch (z~6-7). however, observations from a very large(~5deg$^2$) ly$\alpha$ survey at z=6.6 (matthee et al. 2015) show that this isnot the case for the most luminous emitters. here we present follow-upobservations of the two most luminous z~6.6 ly$\alpha$ candidates in the cosmosfield: `masosa' and `cr7'. we used x-shooter, sinfoni and fors2 (vlt), anddeimos (keck), to confirm both candidates beyond any doubt. we find redshiftsof z=6.541 and z=6.604 for masosa and cr7, respectively. masosa has a strongdetection in ly$\alpha$ with a line width of $386\pm30$ km/s (fwhm) and withhigh ew$_0$ (&gt;200 \aa), but it is undetected in the continuum. cr7, with anobserved ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $10^{43.93\pm0.05}$erg/s is the most luminously$\alpha$ emitter ever found at z&gt;6. cr7 reveals a narrow ly$\alpha$ line with$266\pm15$ km/s fwhm, being detected in the nir (rest-frame uv, with$\beta=-2.3\pm0.1$) with an excess in $j$, and also strongly detected inirac/spitzer. we detect a narrow heii1640$\aa$ emission line ($6\sigma$) whichexplains the excess seen in the $j$ band photometry (ew$_0$~80 \aa). we find noother emission lines from the uv to the nir in our x-shooter spectra(heii/oiii]1663a&gt;3 and heii/ciii]1908a&gt;2.5). we find that cr7 is best explainedby a combination of a popiii-like population which dominates the rest-frame uvand the nebular emission, and a more normal stellar population which dominatesthe mass. hst/wfc3 observations show that the light is indeed spatiallyseparated between a very blue component, coincident with ly$\alpha$ and heiiemission, and two red components (~5 kpc away), which dominate the mass. ourfindings are consistent with theoretical predictions of a popiii wave, withpopiii star formation migrating away from the original sites of star formation.

1504.02782	the mosdef survey: measurements of balmer decrements and the dust  attenuation curve at redshifts z~1.4-2.6	we present results on the dust attenuation curve of z~2 galaxies using earlyobservations from the mosfire deep evolution field (mosdef) survey. our sampleconsists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts inthe range z= 1.36-2.59 and high s/n measurements of, or upper limits on, theh-alpha and h-beta emission lines obtained with keck/mosfire. we constructcomposite seds of galaxies in bins of specific sfr and balmer optical depth inorder to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the uv throughnear-ir for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. our results implyan attenuation curve that is very similar to the smc extinction curve atwavelengths redward of 2500 angstroms. at shorter wavelengths, the shape of thecurve is identical to that of the calzetti relation, but with a lowernormalization (r_v). hence, the new attenuation curve results in sfrs that are~20% lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtainedwith the calzetti attenuation curve. moreover, we find that the difference inthe reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellarcontinuum correlates strongly with sfr, such that for dust-corrected sfrslarger than 20 msun/yr assuming a chabrier imf, the nebular emission linessuffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. a simplemodel that can account for these trends is one in which the uv through opticalstellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, whilethe nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated bydustier stellar populations for galaxies with large sfrs, as a result of theincreased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. consequently, uv- andsed-based sfrs may underestimate the total sfr at even modest levels of ~20msun/yr.

1505.01501	a critical assessment of stellar mass measurement methods	in this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of randomand systematic errors in stellar mass measurement for galaxies using theirspectral energy distributions (seds). we use mock galaxy catalogs withsimulated multi-waveband photometry (from u-band to mid-infrared) and knownredshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. givendifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric s/nratios, sed fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies andcorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs toquantify these effects individually. we studied the sensitivity of stellar massestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, starformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometricuncertainties, extinction and age. for each simulated galaxy, the differencebetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulationcatalogs, $\delta\log(m)$, was calculated and used to identify the mostfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. we measured differentcomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). nosignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all havingcomparable scatter; (2). a source of error is found to be due to photometricuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). the medianof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the massassociated with any given galaxy; (4). the deviations in stellar mass stronglycorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).the scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, withthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes andinclusion of nebular emission lines studied.

1509.03318	mapping the galaxy color-redshift relation: optimal photometric redshift  calibration strategies for cosmology surveys	calibrating the photometric redshifts of &gt;10^9 galaxies for upcoming weaklensing cosmology experiments is a major challenge for the astrophysicscommunity. the path to obtaining the required spectroscopic redshifts fortraining and calibration is daunting, given the anticipated depths of thesurveys and the difficulty in obtaining secure redshifts for some faint galaxypopulations. here we present an analysis of the problem based on theself-organizing map, a method of mapping the distribution of data in ahigh-dimensional space and projecting it onto a lower-dimensionalrepresentation. we apply this method to existing photometric data from thecosmos survey selected to approximate the anticipated euclid weak lensingsample, enabling us to robustly map the empirical distribution of galaxies inthe multidimensional color space defined by the expected euclid filters.mapping this multicolor distribution lets us determine where - in galaxy colorspace - redshifts from current spectroscopic surveys exist and where they aresystematically missing. crucially, the method lets us determine whether aspectroscopic training sample is representative of the full photometric spaceoccupied by the galaxies in a survey. we explore optimal sampling techniquesand estimate the additional spectroscopy needed to map out the color-redshiftrelation, finding that sampling the galaxy distribution in color space in asystematic way can efficiently meet the calibration requirements. while theanalysis presented here focuses on the euclid survey, similar analysis can beapplied to other surveys facing the same calibration challenge, such as des,lsst, and wfirst.

(1993) and hopkins et al.(1999). the redshifts are confined to a narrow range around z~0.2, to avoiddifferential evolution, with a radio luminosity close to l* where the galaxiesdominate the comoving volume-averaged star formation rate. we find clearlydisturbed morphologies resembling those of ultraluminous infrared galaxies,indicating that galaxy interactions may be the dominant mechanism fortriggering star formation at these epochs. the morphologies are also clearlydifferent from coeval quasars and radiogalaxies, as found in star-forminggalaxies selected at other wavelengths. this may prove challenging for modelswhich propose direct causal links between agn evolution and the cosmic starformation history at these epochs. the asymmetries are typically much largerthan seen in the cfrs at similar redshifts, optical luminosities andhalpha-derived star formation rates, indicating the possible existence of anobscuration-related morphological bias in such samples.

astro-ph;0008027	the effect of dust on photometric redshift measurement; a  self-consistent technique	a new method is developed for estimating photometric redshifts to galaxies,using realistic template seds, extending over four decades in wavelength (i.e.from 0.05 micron to 1 mm). the template seds are constructed for four differentspectral types of galaxies (elliptical, spiral, irregular and starburst),satisfying the following characteristics: a). they are normalised to producethe observed colours of galaxies at z ~ 0; b). incorporate thechemo-photometric spectral evolution of galaxies of different types, inagreement with the observations; c). allow treatment of dust contribution andits evolution with redshift, consistent with the spectral evolution model; d).include absorption and re-emission of radiation by dust and hence, realisticestimates of the far-infrared radiation; e). include correction forinter-galactic absorption by lyman continuum and lyman forest. using thesetemplate seds, the photometric redshifts are estimated to an accuracy of ~0.11. the effect on the estimated photometric redshifts, due to assumptions inthe evolutionary population synthesis models, are investigated and discussed.  the simultaneous and self-consistent modelling of both the photometric andchemical evolution of galaxies and the effect of dust, makes this techniqueparticularly useful for high redshift galaxies. moreover, since the templateseds (at different redshifts) cover the range from uv to far-infrared andsub-mm wavelengths, one could consistently use the optimised seds to estimatethe contribution from individual galaxies to these wavelengths, where noobservational data are available.

astro-ph;0104425	a comparison of independent star formation diagnostics for a uv-selected  sample of nearby galaxies	we present results from a decimetric radio survey undertaken with the verylarge array as part of a longer term goal to inter-compare star formation anddust extinction diagnostics, on a galaxy by galaxy basis, for a representativesample of nearby galaxies. for our survey field, selected area 57, starformation rates derived from 1.4ghz luminosities are compared with earliernebular emission line and ultraviolet (uv) continuum diagnostics. we find broadcorrelations, over several decades in luminosity, between h-alpha, the uvcontinuum and 1.4ghz diagnostics. however, the scatter in these relations isfound to be larger than observational errors, with offsets between the observedrelations and those expected assuming constant star-formation histories andluminosity-independent extinction models. we investigate the physical origin ofthe observed relations, and conclude the discrepancies between differentstar-formation diagnostics can only be partly explained by simple models ofdust extinction in galaxies. these models cannot by themselves explain all theobserved differences, introducing the need for temporally varyingstar-formation histories and/or more complex models of extinction, to explainthe entire dataset.

astro-ph;0111038	substructure in the coma cluster: giants vs dwarfs	the processes that form and shape galaxy clusters, such as infall, mergersand dynamical relaxation, tend to generate distinguishable differences betweenthe distributions of a cluster's giant and dwarf galaxies. thus the dynamics ofdwarf galaxies in a cluster can provide valuable insights into its dynamicalhistory. with this in mind, we look for differences between the spatial andvelocity distributions of giant (b&lt;18) and dwarf (b&gt;18) galaxies in the comacluster. our redshift sample contains new measurements from the 2df and wyffosspectrographs, making it more complete at faint magnitudes than any previouslystudied sample of coma galaxies. it includes 745 cluster members - 452 giantsand 293 dwarfs. we find that the line-of-sight velocity distribution of thegiants is significantly non-gaussian, but not that for the dwarfs. a battery ofstatistical tests of both the spatial and localised velocity distributions ofthe galaxies in our sample finds no strong evidence for differences between thegiant and dwarf populations. these results rule out the cluster as a wholehaving moved significantly towards equipartition, and they are consistent withthe cluster having formed via mergers between dynamically-relaxed subclusters.

0808.2746	relation between stellar mass and star formation activity in galaxies	for a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts fromthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), we examine the evolution of starformation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. we estimate thecosmic star formation rates (sfr) over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, using therest-frame 2800 a flux (corrected for extinction). we find the mean sfr to be astrong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, withmassive systems (log (m/m(sun)) &gt; 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)to the total star formation rate density (sfrd).  combining data from the cosmos and gemini deep deep survey (gdds), we extendthe sfrd-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. for massive galaxies,we find a steep increase in the sfrd-z relation to z~2; for the less massivesystems, the sfrd which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. thisimplies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activityat earlier epochs (z &gt; 2) than the lower mass galaxies.  we study changes in the sfrds as a function of both redshift and stellar massfor galaxies of different spectral types. we find that the slope of the sfrd-zrelation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of theirstellar mass. for low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution tothe cosmic sfrd comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massivesystems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

astro-ph;0309039	observing the formation of the hubble sequence in the great  observatories origins deep survey	understanding the physical formation of the hubble sequence remains one ofthe most important unsolved astrophysical problems. searches for proto-disksand proto-ellipticals can now be effectively done using deep wide-field hubblespace telescope images taken with the new advanced camera for surveys. throughan analysis of concentrations (c), asymmetries (a) and clumpiness values (s)(cas) of galaxies found in the goods field south, we are able to identifyobjects possibly forming onto the hubble sequence. using this approach, wedetect a sizeable population of star forming luminous diffuse objects and starforming luminous asymmetric objects between redshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2. thesegalaxies have extremely low light concentrations, or high asymmetries, withabsolute magnitudes m_b &lt; -19. the luminous diffuse objects are found inabundance between z = 1 - 2, with fewer objects at z &gt; 2 and z &lt; 1. theluminous asymmetric objects are found at a similar abundance, with a peak atz~1. we argue that these galaxies are a subset of modern disks and ellipticalsin formation. the co-moving volume density of the luminous diffuse objectsbetween z = 1 - 2 is similar to the local density of bright disk galaxies, withvalues ~5*10^{5} gpc^{-3}. the seds of these objects are mostly consistent withstarbursts, or star-forming normal galaxies, with average uncorrected forextinction star formation rates of ~4 m_0 yr^{-1}. these galaxies also host35-40% of the star formation activity at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. we briefly discuss theimplications of these objects for understanding the origin of the hubblesequence.

astro-ph;0309067	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies in the great  observatories origins deep survey as a test of galaxy formation scenarios	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies is often used toattempt to discriminate between the classical view of galaxy formation, inwhich present-day luminous galaxies were assembled at early times and evolvedue to the passive aging of their stellar populations, and that of hierarchicalstructure formation, in which galaxies were assembled more recently via themerging of smaller objects. we carry out such a test here, by computing thedistribution of photometric redshifts of k_ab&lt;22 galaxies in the greatobservatories origins deep field survey goods southern field, and comparing theresults with predictions from a semi-analytic model based on hierarchicalstructure formation, and a classical `passive evolution' model. we find thatthe redshift distributions at z &lt;~ 1.5 of both the hierarchical and passivemodels are very similar to the observed one. at z&gt;~1.5, the hierarchical modelshows a deficit of galaxies, while the passive model predicts an excess. weinvestigate the nature of the observed galaxies in the redshift range where themodels diverge, and find that the majority have highly disturbed morphologies,suggesting that they may be merger-induced starbursts. while the hierarchicalmodel used here does not produce these objects in great enough numbers, theappearance of this population is clearly in better qualitative agreement withthe hierarchical picture than with the classical passive evolution scenario. weconclude that the observations support the general framework of hierarchicalformation, but suggest the need for new or modified physics in the models.

astro-ph;0309187	morphologies and spectral energy distributions of extremely red galaxies  in the goods-south field	using u'- through ks-band imaging data in the goods-south field, we constructa large, complete sample of 275 ``extremely red objects'' (eros; k_s&lt;22.0,r-k_s&gt;3.35; ab), all with deep hst/acs imaging in b_435, v_606, i_775, andz_850, and well-calibrated photometric redshifts. quantitative concentrationand asymmetry measurements fail to separate eros into distinct morphologicalclasses. we therefore visually classify the morphologies of all eros into fourbroad types: ``early'' (elliptical-like), ``late'' (disk galaxies),``irregular'' and ``other'' (chain galaxies and low surface brightnessgalaxies), and calculate their relative fractions and comoving space densities.for a broad range of limiting magnitudes and color thresholds, the relativenumber of early-type eros is approximately constant at 33-44%, and the comovingspace densities of early- and late-type eros are comparable. mean rest-framespectral energy distributions (seds) at wavelengths between 0.1 and 1.2 um areconstructed for all eros. the seds are extremely similar in their range ofshapes, independent of morphological type. the implication is that anydifferences between the broad-band seds of early-type eros and the other typesare relatively subtle, and there is no robust way of photometricallydistinguishing between different morphological types with usualoptical/near-infrared photometry.

astro-ph;0402512	type ia supernova discoveries at z&gt;1 from the hubble space telescope:  evidence for past deceleration and constraints on dark energy evolution	we have discovered 16 type ia supernovae (sne ia) with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence forcosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration.these objects, discovered during the course of the goods acs treasury program,include 6 of the 7 highest-redshift sne ia known, all at z&gt;1.25, and populatethe hubble diagram in unexplored territory. the luminosity distances to theseand 170 previous sne ia are provided. a purely kinematic interpretation of thesn ia sample provides evidence at the &gt; 99% confidence level for a transitionfrom deceleration to acceleration or similarly, strong evidence for a cosmicjerk. using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between thetwo epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46 +/- 0.13. the data are consistentwith the cosmic concordance model of omega_m ~ 0.3, omega_lambda~0.7(chi^2_dof=1.06), and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dustas an alternative to dark energy. for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. when combined with external flat-universe constraints we find w=-1.02+ 0.13 - 0.19 (and $&lt;-0.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed staticequation of state of dark energy, p = w\rho c^2. joint constraints on both therecent equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, and its time evolution, dw/dz,are a factor of ~8 more precise than its first estimate and twice as precise asthose without the sne ia discovered with hst. our constraints are consistentwith the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant(i.e., w_0 = -1.0, dw/dz = 0), and are inconsistent with very rapid evolutionof dark energy. we address consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate ofthe universe.

astro-ph;0505297	the evolution of the optical and near-infrared galaxy luminosity  functions and luminosity densities to z~2	using hubble space telescope and ground-based u through k- band photometryfrom the great observatories origins deep survey (goods), we measure theevolution of the luminosity function and luminosity density in the rest-frameoptical (ubr) to z ~ 2, bridging the poorly explored ``redshift desert''between z~1 and z~2. we also use deep near-infrared observations to measure theevolution in the rest-frame j-band to z~1. compared to local measurements fromthe sdss, we find a brightening of the characteristic magnitude, (m*), by ~2.1,\~0.8 and ~0.7 mag between z=0.1 and z=1.9, in u, b, and r bands, respectively.the evolution of m* in the j-band is in the opposite sense, showing a dimmingbetween redshifts z=0.4 and z=0.9. this is consistent with a scenario in whichthe mean star formation rate in galaxies was higher in the past, while the meanstellar mass was lower, in qualitative agreement with hierarchical galaxyformation models. we find that the shape of the luminosity function is stronglydependent on spectral type and that there is strong evolution with redshift inthe relative contribution from the different spectral types to the luminositydensity.  we find good agreement in the luminosity function derived from an r-selectedand a k-selected sample at z~1, suggesting that optically selected surveys ofsimilar depth (r &lt; 24) are not missing a significant fraction of objects atthis redshift relative to a near-infrared-selected sample. we compare therest-frame b-band luminosity functions from z~0--2 with the predictions of asemi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy formation, and find qualitativelygood agreement. in particular, the model predicts at least as many opticallyluminous galaxies at z~1--2 as are implied by our observations.

astro-ph;0602428	on the cross-correlation of sub-mm sources and optically-selected  galaxies	bright sub-mm galaxies are expected to arise in massive highly-biased haloes,and hence exhibit strong clustering. we argue that a valuable tool formeasuring these clustering properties is the cross-correlation of sub-mmgalaxies with faint optically-selected sources. we analyze populations ofscuba-detected and optical galaxies in the goods-n survey area. usingoptical/ir photometric-redshift information, we search for correlations inducedby two separate effects: (1) cosmic magnification of background sub-mm sourcesby foreground dark matter haloes traced by optical galaxies at lower redshifts;and (2) galaxy clustering due to sub-mm and optical sources tracing the samepopulation of haloes where their redshift distributions overlap. regardingcosmic magnification, we find no detectable correlation. our null result isconsistent with a theoretical model for the cosmic magnification, and we showthat a dramatic increase in the number of sub-mm sources will be required tomeasure the effect reliably. regarding clustering, we find evidence at the3.5-sigma level for a cross-correlation between sub-mm and optical galaxiesanalyzed in identical photometric redshift slices. the data hint that thesub-mm sources have an enhanced bias parameter compared to theoptically-selected population (with a significance of 2-sigma). the nextgeneration of deep sub-mm surveys can potentially perform an accuratemeasurement of each of these cross-correlations, adding a new set ofdiagnostics for understanding the development of massive structure in theuniverse.

astro-ph;0701480	cosmos: 3d weak lensing and the growth of structure	we present a three dimensional cosmic shear analysis of the hubble spacetelescope cosmos survey, the largest ever optical imaging program performed inspace. we have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortionscaused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as afunction of redshift. using both 2d and 3d analyses, we measure cosmologicalparameters omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, thenormalization of the matter power spectrum. the introduction of redshiftinformation tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces therelative sampling (or "cosmic") variance compared to recent surveys that may belarger but are only two dimensional. from the 3d analysis, we findsigma_8*(omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits,including both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in thetotal budget. indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods isnow the dominant source of uncertainty. assuming instead a baseline cosmologyto fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structureon both linear and non-linear physical scales. our results thus demonstrate aproof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposedfor future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space.

astro-ph;0701594	dark matter maps reveal cosmic scaffolding	ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for onlyone-sixth of the total matter in the universe. the remainder is a mysterious"dark matter" component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thusneither emits nor reflects light. as dark matter cannot be seen directly usingtraditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties.it does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed throughgravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by thegravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. this is a purelygeometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive toall matter -- whether baryonic or dark. here we show high fidelity maps of thelarge-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. wefind a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect inmassive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. our results areconsistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, inwhich the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filamentsthen into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas canaccumulate, and stars can be built.

astro-ph;0701875	redshifts of emission line objects in the hubble ultra deep field	we present redshifts for 115 emission line objects in the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf) identified through the grism acs program for extragalactic science(grapes) project using the slitless grism spectroscopy mode of the acs cameraon the hubble space telescope (hst). the sample was selected by an emissionline search on all extracted 1-dimensional grapes spectra. we identify theemission lines using line wavelength ratios where multiple lines are detectedin the grism wavelength range (5800a &lt; lambda &lt; 9600a), and using photometricredshift information where multiple lines are unavailable. we then deriveredshifts using the identified lines. our redshifts are accurate to delta(z) =0.009, based on both statistical uncertainty estimates and comparison withpublished ground-based spectra. over 40% of our sample is fainter than typicalmagnitude limits for ground-based spectroscopy (with i_{ab}&gt;25 mag). suchemission lines would likely remain undiscovered without our deep survey. theemission line objects fall into 3 categories: 1) most are low to moderateredshift galaxies (0 &lt; z &lt; 2), including many actively star forming galaxieswith strong hii regions; 2) 9 are high redshift (4 &lt; z &lt; 7) lyman-alphaemitters; and 3) at least 3 are candidate agns.

astro-ph;9708226	near-infrared luminosity function and colours of dwarf galaxies in the  coma cluster	we present k-band observations of the low-luminosity galaxies in the comacluster, which are responsible for the steep upturn in the optical luminosityfunction at m_r ~ -16, discovered recently. the main results of this study are(i) the optical$-$near-infrared colours of these galaxies imply that they aredwarf spheroidals. the median m-k colour for galaxies with -19.3 &lt; m_k &lt; -16.3is 3.6 mag. (ii) the k-band luminosity function in the coma cluster at thefaint-end is not wee constrained, because of the uncertainties due to thefield-to-field variance of the background. however, within the estimate largeerrors, it is consistent with the r-band luminosity function, shifted by$\sim3$ magnitudes. (iii) many of the cluster dwarfs lie in a region of the b-kvs. b-r colour-colour diagram where background galaxies are rare local dwarfspheroidal galaxies lie in this region too. this suggests that a bettermeasurement of the k-band cluster luminosity function can be made if thefield-to-field variance of the background can be measured as a function ofcolour. (iv) if we assume that none of the galaxies in the region of the b-kvs. b-r plane given in (iii) in our cluster fields are background, and that allthe cluster galaxies with $15.5 &lt; k &lt; 18.5$ lie in this region of the plane,then we measure alpha = -1.41 +/- 0.35 for -19.3 &lt; m_k &lt; -16.3, where alpha isthe logarithmic slope of the luminosity function.

astro-ph;9805282	evolution of the near-infrared luminosity function in rich galaxy  clusters	we present the k-band (2.2 microns) luminosity functions of the x-rayluminous clusters ms1054-0321 (z=0.82), ms0451-0305 (z=0.55), abell 963(z=0.206), abell 665 (z=0.182) and abell 1795 (z=0.063) down to absolutemagnitudes m_k = -20. our measurements probe fainte absolute magnitudes than doany previous studies of the near-infrared luminosity function of clusters. allclusters are found to have similar luminosity functions within the errors, whenthe galaxy populations are evolved to redshift $z=0$. it iw known that the mostmassive bound systems in the universe at all redshifts are x-ray luminousclusters. therefore, assuming that the clusters in our sample correspond to asingle population seen at different redshifts, the results here imply that notonly had the stars in present-day ellipticals in rich clusters formed by z=0.8,but that they existed in as luminous galaxies then as they do today.  additionally, the clusters have k-band luminosity functions which appear tobe consistent with the kband field luminosity function in the range -24 &lt; m_k &lt;-22, although the uncertainties in both the field and cluster samples arelarge.

astro-ph;9901299	galaxy clustering at z ~ 2 and halo radii	the amplitude of the angular two-point galaxy correlation function w(\theta)for galaxies at z~2 is estimated for galaxies in the hubble deep field by usinga u &lt; 27 complete sub-sample.  (i) it is confirmed that the amplitude of the correlation can be correctedfor the integral constraint without having to make assumptions about the shapeof the correlation function and by avoiding the introduction of linear errorterms. the estimate using this technique is w(5'') = 0.10 \pm 0.09.  (ii) if the biases introduced in faint galaxy selection due to obscuration bylarge objects are not corrected for by masking areas around them, then theestimate would be w(5'') =0.16\pm 0.07.  (iii) the effective (3-d) galaxy pair separation at 5'' and this redshiftrange is ~ 25-250 /h kpc, so the correction to the spatial correlation function\xi(r) due to exclusion of overlapping galaxy dark matter haloes should beconsidered. for clustering stable in proper units in an \omega=1,\lambda=0universe, our w(5\arcs) estimate (a) implies a present-day correlation lengthof r_0 ~ 2.6^{+1.1}_{-1.7}/h mpc if halo overlapping is ignored, but (b) for apresent-day correlation length of r_0=5.5/h mpc implies that a typical haloexclusion radius is r_halo=70^{+420}_{-30}/h kpc.  (iv) the decreasing correlation period (dcp) of a high initial bias in thespatial correlation function is not detected at this redshift. for an\omega=1,\lambda=0 universe and (proper) stable clustering, possible detectionsof the dcp in other work would imply that \xi at redshifts greater than z_t =1.7\pm0.9 would be [(1+z)/(1+z_t)]^{2.1\pm3.6} times higher than at z_t, whichis consistent with our lack of a detection at z ~ 2.
