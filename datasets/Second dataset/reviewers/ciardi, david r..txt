1005.3890	modeling multi-wavelength stellar astrometry. i. sim lite observations  of interacting binaries	interacting binaries consist of a secondary star which fills or is very closeto filling its roche lobe, resulting in accretion onto the primary star, whichis often, but not always, a compact object. in many cases, the primary star,secondary star, and the accretion disk can all be significant sources ofluminosity. sim lite will only measure the photocenter of an astrometrictarget, and thus determining the true astrometric orbits of such systems willbe difficult. we have modified the eclipsing light curve code (orosz &amp;hauschildt 2000) to allow us to model the flux-weighted reflex motions ofinteracting binaries, in a code we call reflux. this code gives us sufficientflexibility to investigate nearly every configuration of interacting binary. wefind that sim lite will be able to determine astrometric orbits for allsufficiently bright interacting binaries where the primary or secondary stardominates the luminosity. for systems where there are multiple components thatcomprise the spectrum in the optical bandpass accessible to sim lite, we findit is possible to obtain absolute masses for both components, althoughmulti-wavelength photometry will be required to disentangle the multiplecomponents. in all cases, sim lite will at least yield accurate inclinations,and provide valuable information that will allow us to begin to understand thecomplex evolution of mass-transferring binaries. it is critical that sim litemaintains a multi-wavelength capability to allow for the proper deconvolutionof the astrometric orbits in multi-component systems.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1105.4647	kepler-10c, a 2.2-earth radius transiting planet in a multiple system	the kepler mission has recently announced the discovery of kepler-10 b, thesmallest exoplanet discovered to date and the first rocky planet found by thespacecraft. a second, 45-day period transit-like signal present in thephotometry from the first eight months of data could not be confirmed as beingcaused by a planet at the time of that announcement. here we apply thelight-curve modeling technique known as blender to explore the possibility thatthe signal might be due to an astrophysical false positive (blend). to aid inthis analysis we report the observation of two transits with the spitzer spacetelescope at 4.5 {\mu}m. when combined they yield a transit depth of 344 \pm 85ppm that is consistent with the depth in the kepler passband (376 \pm 9 ppm,ignoring limb darkening), which rules out blends with an eclipsing binary of asignificantly different color than the target. using these observations alongwith other constraints from high resolution imaging and spectroscopy we areable to exclude the vast majority of possible false positives. we assess thelikelihood of the remaining blends, and arrive conservatively at a false alarmrate of 1.6 \times 10-5 that is small enough to validate the candidate as aplanet (designated kepler-10 c) with a very high level of confidence. theradius of this object is measured to be rp = 2.227+0.052 -0.057 earth radii.kepler-10 c represents another example (with kepler-9 d and kepler-11 g) ofstatistical "validation" of a transiting exoplanet, as opposed to the usual"confirmation" that can take place when the doppler signal is detected ortransit timing variations are measured. it is anticipated that many of kepler'ssmaller candidates will receive a similar treatment since dynamicalconfirmation may be difficult or impractical with the sensitivity of currentinstrumentation.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1205.5535	adaptive optics images of kepler objects of interest	all transiting planets are at risk of contamination by blends with nearby,unresolved stars. blends dilute the transit signal, causing the planet toappear smaller than it really is, or produce a false positive detection whenthe target star is blended with eclipsing binary stars. this paper reports onhigh spatial-resolution adaptive optics images of 90 kepler planetarycandidates. companion stars are detected as close as 0.1 arcsec from the targetstar. images were taken in the near-infrared (j and ks bands) with aries on themmt and pharo on the palomar hale 200-inch. most objects (60%) have at leastone star within 6 arcsec separation and a magnitude difference of 9. eighteenobjects (20%) have at least one companion within 2 arcsec of the target star; 6companions (7%) are closer than 0.5 arcsec. most of these companions werepreviously unknown, and the associated planetary candidates should receiveadditional scrutiny. limits are placed on the presence of additional companionsfor every system observed, which can be used to validate planets statisticallyusing the blender method. validation is particularly critical for low-mass,potentially earth-like worlds, which are not detectable with current-generationradial velocity techniques. high-resolution images are thus a crucial componentof any transit follow-up program.

1206.1510	the ptf orion project: a possible planet transiting a t-tauri star	we report observations of a possible young transiting planet orbiting apreviously known weak-lined t-tauri star in the 7-10 myr old orion-ob1a/25-oriregion. the candidate was found as part of the palomar transient factory (ptf)orion project. it has a photometric transit period of 0.448413 +- 0.000040days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 ptf data. follow-up low-precisionradial velocity (rv) observations and adaptive optics imaging suggest that thestar is not an eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a backgroundsource is blended with the target and mimicking the observed transit. rvobservations with the hobby-eberly and keck telescopes yield an rv that has thesame period as the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transitcenter by approximately -0.22 periods. the amplitude (half range) of the rvvariations is 2.4 km/s and is comparable with the expected rv amplitude thatstellar spots could induce. the rv curve is likely dominated by stellar spotmodulation and provides an upper limit to the projected companion mass of m_psin i_orb &lt; 4.8 +- 1.2 m_jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, iorb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit light curve, we findan upper limit on the mass of the planetary candidate of m_p &lt; 5.5 +- 1.4m_jup. this limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,its roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active massloss and evaporation.

1307.5842	the same frequency of planets inside and outside open clusters of stars	most stars and their planets form in open clusters. over 95 per cent of suchclusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubicparsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apartwithin a few hundred million years. older open clusters have survived by virtueof being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) whenthey formed. such clusters represent a stellar environment very different fromthe birthplace of the sun and other planet-hosting field stars. so far morethan 800 planets have been found around sun-like stars in the field. the fieldplanets are usually the size of neptune or smaller. in contrast, only fourplanets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with massessimilar to or greater than that of jupiter. here we report observations of thetransits of two sun-like stars by planets smaller than neptune in thebillion-year-old open cluster ngc6811. this demonstrates that small planets canform and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequencyand properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planetsaround field stars in the galaxy.

1308.0629	measurement of spin-orbit misalignment and nodal precession for the  planet around pre-main-sequence star ptfo 8-8695 from gravity darkening	ptfo 8-8695b represents the first transiting exoplanet candidate orbiting apre-main-sequence star. we find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of ptfo8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate,gravity-darkened stellar disk. we simultaneously and self-consistently fit twoseparate lightcurves observed in 2009 december and 2010 december. our twoself-consistent fits yield m_p = 3.0 m_jup and m_p = 3.6 m_jup for assumedstellar masses of m_* = 0.34 m_sun and m_* = 0.44 m_sun respectively. the twofits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. these massdeterminations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strengthof the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate ptfo 8-8695b as justthe second hot jupiter known to orbit an m-dwarf. our fits show a high degreeof spin-orbit misalignment in the ptfo 8-8695 system: 69 +/- 2 or 73.1 +/- 0.5degrees, in the two cases. the large misalignment is consistent with thehypothesis that planets become hot jupiters with random orbital planealignments early in a system's lifetime. we predict that as a result of thehighly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for monthsat a time over the course of the system's precession period. the precessing,gravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbitinclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changingstellar inclination that would manifest as varying v sin i, changing projectedspin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the rossiter-mclaughlin effect,changing transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differinglightcurves as a function of wavelength. our measured planet radii of 1.64r_jup and 1.68 r_jup in each case are consistent with a young,hydrogen-dominated planet that results from a hot-start formation mechanism.

1407.3344	influence of stellar multiplicity on planet formation. ii. planets are  less common in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500 au	almost half of the stellar systems in the solar neighborhood are made up ofmultiple stars. in multiple-star systems, planet formation is under thedynamical influence of stellar companions, and the planet occurrence rate isexpected to be different from that for single stars. there have been numerousstudies on the planet occurrence rate of single star systems. however, to fullyunderstand planet formation, the planet occurrence rate in multiple-starsystems needs to be addressed. in this work, we {{infer}} the planet occurrencerate in multiple-star systems by measuring the stellar multiplicity rate forplanet host stars. for a sub-sample of 56 $kepler$ planet host stars, we useadaptive optics (ao) imaging and the radial velocity (rv) technique to searchfor stellar companions. the combination of these two techniques results in highsearch completeness for stellar companions. we detect 59 visual stellarcompanions to 25 planet host stars with ao data. {{three stellar companions arewithin 2$^{\prime\prime}$, and 27 within 6$^{\prime\prime}$. we also detect 2possible stellar companions (koi 5 and koi 69) showing long-term rvacceleration.}} after correcting for a bias against planet detection inmultiple-star systems due to flux contamination, we find that planet formationis suppressed in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500 au.specifically, we find that compared to single star systems, planets inmultiple-star systems occur $4.5\pm3.2$, $2.6\pm1.0$, and $1.7\pm0.5$ timesless frequently when a stellar companion is present at a distance of 10, 100,and 1000 au, respectively. this conclusion applies only to circumstellarplanets; the planet occurrence rate for circumbinary planets requires furtherinvestigation.

1409.8156	kepler-424 b: a "lonely" hot jupiter that found a companion	hot jupiter systems provide unique observational constraints for migrationmodels in multiple systems and binaries. we report on the discovery of thekepler-424 (koi-214) two-planet system, which consists of a transiting hotjupiter (kepler-424b) in a 3.31-d orbit accompanied by a more massive outercompanion in an eccentric (e=0.3) 223-d orbit. the outer giant planet,kepler-424c, is not detected to transit the host star. the masses of bothplanets and the orbital parameters for the second planet were determined usingprecise radial velocity (rv) measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het)and its high resolution spectrograph (hrs). in stark contrast to smallerplanets, hot jupiters are predominantly found to be lacking any nearbyadditional planets, the appear to be "lonely" (e.g. steffen et al.~2012). thismight be a consequence of a highly dynamical past of these systems. thekepler-424 planetary system is a system with a hot jupiter in a multiplesystem, similar to upsilon andromedae. we also present our results forkepler-422 (koi-22), kepler-77 (koi-127; gandolfi et al.~2013), kepler-43(koi-135; bonomo et al.~2012), and kepler-423 (koi-183). these results arebased on spectroscopic data collected with the nordic optical telescope (not),the keck 1 telescope and het. for all systems we rule out false positives basedon various follow-up observations, confirming the planetary nature of thesecompanions. we performed a comparison with planetary evolutionary models whichindicate that these five hot jupiters have a heavy elements content between 20and 120 m_earth.

1503.03516	understanding the effects of stellar multiplicity on the derived planet  radii from transit surveys: implications for kepler, k2, and tess	we present a study on the effect of undetected stellar companions on thederived planetary radii for the kepler objects of interest (kois). the currentproduction of the koi list assumes that the each koi is a single star. notaccounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets towardssmaller radii. the bias towards smaller radii depends on the properties of thecompanion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companionstars. defining a planetary radius correction factor $x_r$, we find that if thekois are assumed to be single, then, {\it on average}, the planetary radii maybe underestimated by a factor of $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.5$. if typicalradial velocity and high resolution imaging observations are performed and nocompanions are detected, this factor reduces to $\langle x_r \rangle \approx1.2$. the correction factor $\langle x_r \rangle$ is dependent upon the primarystar properties and ranges from $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.6$ for a and fstars to $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.2$ for k and m stars. for missions likek2 and tess where the stars may be closer than the stars in the kepler targetsample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the radius correctionfactor to $\langle x_r \rangle \approx 1.1$. finally, we show that if thestellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, occurrence ratecalculations for earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of smallplanets by as much as $15-20$\%.

1505.01845	the five planets in the kepler-296 binary system all orbit the primary:  a statistical and analytical analysis	kepler-296 is a binary star system with two m-dwarf components separated by0.2 arcsec. five transiting planets have been confirmed to be associated withthe kepler-296 system; given the evidence to date, however, the planets couldin principle orbit either star. this ambiguity has made it difficult toconstrain both the orbital and physical properties of the planets. using bothstatistical and analytical arguments, this paper shows that all five planetsare highly likely to orbit the primary star in this system. we performed amarkov-chain monte carlo simulation using a five transiting planet model,leaving the stellar density and dilution with uniform priors. using importancesampling, we compared the model probabilities under the priors of the planetsorbiting either the brighter or the fainter component of the binary. a modelwhere the planets orbit the brighter component, kepler-296a, is stronglypreferred by the data. combined with our assertion that all five planets orbitthe same star, the two outer planets in the system, kepler-296 ae andkepler-296 af, have radii of 1.53 +/- 0.26 and 1.80 +/- 0.31 r_earth,respectively, and receive incident stellar fluxes of 1.40 +/- 0.23 and 0.62 +/-0.10 times the incident flux the earth receives from the sun. this level ofirradiation places both planets within or close to the circumstellar habitablezone of their parent star.

1508.06502	a comparison of spectroscopic versus imaging techniques for detecting  close companions to kepler objects of interest	(abbreviated) kepler planet candidates require both spectroscopic and imagingfollow-up observations to rule out false positives and detect blended stars.[...] in this paper, we examine a sample of 11 kepler host stars withcompanions detected by two techniques -- near-infrared adaptive optics and/oroptical speckle interferometry imaging, and a new spectroscopic deblendingmethod. we compare the companion teff and flux ratios (f_b/f_a, where a is theprimary and b is the companion) derived from each technique, and find no caseswhere both companion parameters agree within 1sigma errors. in 3/11 cases thecompanion teff values agree within 1sigma errors, and in 2/11 cases thecompanion f_b/f_a values agree within 1sigma errors. examining each keplersystem individually considering multiple avenues (isochrone mapping, contrastcurves, probability of being bound), we suggest two cases for which thetechniques most likely agree in their companion detections (detect the samecompanion star). overall, our results support the advantage the spectroscopicdeblending technique has for finding very close-in companions ($\theta\lesssim$0.02-0.05") that are not easily detectable with imaging. however, wealso specifically show how high-contrast ao and speckle imaging observationsdetect companions at larger separations ($\theta \geq$0.02-0.05") that aremissed by the spectroscopic technique, provide additional information forcharacterizing the companion and its potential contamination (e.g., pa,separation, $\delta$m), and cover a wider range of primary star effectivetemperatures. the investigation presented here illustrates the utility ofcombining the two techniques to reveal higher-order multiples in knownplanet-hosting systems.

astro-ph;0106184	altair's oblateness and rotation velocity	we present infrared interferometric angular size measurements for the a7iv-vstar altair which indicate a non-circular projected disk brightnessdistribution. given the known rapid rotation of this star, we model the data asarising from an elongated rigid atmosphere. to first order, an ellipse may befit to our interferometric diameter measurements, with major and minor axes of2a=3.461+-0.038 milliarcseconds (mas) and 2b=3.037+-0.069 mas, respectively,for a difference of 424+-79 microarcseconds between 2a and 2b, and with anaxial ratio of a/b =1.140+-0.029. assuming that the apparent oblateness of thephotosphere is due to the star's rapid rotation, a more rigorous evaluation ofthe observation data in the context of a rigidly rotating roche model showsthat an estimate of v sin i = 210+-13 km/s can be derived that is independentof spectroscopic techniques. also derived are values for the mean effectivetemperature, the mean linear radius, and an observational constraint upon thethe relationship between rotation velocity and stellar inclination isestablished. altair is the first main sequence star for which directobservations of an oblate photosphere have been reported, and the first starforwhich v sin i has been established from observations of the star'sphotospheric geometry.

astro-ph;0608083	spitzer observations of var her 04: possible detection of dust formation  in a super-outbursting toad	we present four mips (24 \micron) and two irac (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0\micron) spitzer observations of the newly discovered tremendous outburstamplitude dwarf nova (toad) var her 04 during decline from super-outburst. thefour mips observations span 271 days and the two irac observations span 211days. along the line-of-sight to var her 04, there is a foreground m-starwithin 1\arcsec of the variable; as a result, all of the spitzer photometrypresented in this paper is a blend of the foreground m-star and var her 04. weestimate the quiescent level of the toad to be $\delta v=4-5$ magnitudes belowthat of the m-star. based upon the spectral energy distribution and the 2masscolors, we find the m-star to be an m3.5v dwarf at a distance of 80-130 pc.based upon its outburst amplitude and quiescent apparent magnitude, we estimatethe distance to var her 04 to be 200-400 pc, suggesting that the line-of-sightforeground star is physically unrelated to the cataclysmic variable. all of thespitzer photometry is consistent with the photospheric emission of theline-of-sight m3.5v star, except for one 24 \micron observation obtained afterthe variable re-brightened. this 24 \micron flux density is 75 $\mu$jy($4\sigma$) above the preceding and following mips observations. we tentativelysuggest that the mid-infrared brightening of 75 $\mu$jy may be associated witha dust formation event in the super-outburst ejecta. assuming a dusttemperature of 100-400 k, we have estimated the amount of dust required. wefind $10^{-13}-10^{-11}$ m$_\odot$ of dust is needed, consistent with amountsof mass ejection in toads expected during super-outburst, and possibly makingtoads important contributors to the recycling of the interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0612723	the angular diameter of $\lambda$ bo\"{o}tis}	using the chara array and the palomar testbed interferometer, the chemicallypeculiar star $\lambda$ bo\"{o}tis has been spatially resolved. we havemeasured the limb darkened angular diameter to be $\theta_{ld} = 0.533\pm0.029$mas, corresponding to a linear radius of $r_{\star} = 1.70 \pm 0.10 r_\odot$.the measured angular diameter yields an effective temperature for $\lambda$ booof $t_{eff} = 8887 \pm 242$ k. based upon literature surface gravity estimatesspanning $\log{(g)} = 4.0-4.2$ $[\rm{cm s}^{-\rm{2}}]$, we have derived astellar mass range of $m_{\star} = 1.1 - 1.7$ $m_\odot$. for a given surfacegravity, the linear radius uncertainty contributes approximately$\sigma(m_\star) = 0.1-0.2 m_\odot$ to the total mass uncertainty. theuncertainty in the mass (i.e., the range of derived masses) is primarily aresult of the uncertainty in the surface gravity. the upper bound of ourderived mass range ($\log(g)=4.2, m_\star = 1.7\pm0.2 m_\odot$) is consistentwith 100-300 myr solar-metallicity evolutionary models. the mid-range of ourderived masses ($\log(g)=4.1, m_\star = 1.3\pm0.2 m_\odot$) is consistent with2-3 gyr metal-poor evolutionary models. a more definitive surface gravitydetermination is required to determine a more precise mass for $\lambda$ boo.

0811.0363	observations of v592 cassiopeiae with the spitzer space telescope - dust  in the mid-infrared	we present the ultraviolet-optical-infrared spectral energy distribution ofthe low inclination novalike cataclysmic variable v592 cassiopeiae, includingnew mid-infrared observations from 3.5-24 microns obtained with the spitzerspace telescope. at wavelengths shortward of 8 microns, the spectral energydistribution of v592 cas is dominated by the steady state accretion disk, butthere is flux density in excess of the summed stellar components and accretiondisk at longer wavelengths. reproducing the observed spectral energydistribution from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths can be accomplishedby including a circumbinary disk composed of cool dust, with a maximum inneredge temperature of ~500 k. the total mass of circumbinary dust in v592 cas(~10^21 g) is similar to that found from recent studies of infrared excess inmagnetic cvs, and is too small to have a significant effect on the long-termsecular evolution of the cataclysmic variable. the existence of circumbinarydust in v592 cas is possibly linked to the presence of a wind outflow in thissystem, which can provide the necessary raw materials to replenish thecircumbinary disk on relatively short timescales, and/or could be a remnantfrom the common envelope phase early in the formation history of the system.
