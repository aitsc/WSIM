0901.2587	the wigglez dark energy survey: small-scale clustering of lyman break  galaxies at z &lt; 1	the wigglez dark energy survey is a large-scale structure survey ofintermediate-redshift uv-selected emission-line galaxies scheduled to cover1000 sq deg, spanning a broad redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. the main scientificgoal of the survey is the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) inthe galaxy clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than previousstudies. the bao may be applied as a standard cosmological ruler to constraindark energy models. based on the first 20% of the dataset, we present initialresults concerning the small-scale clustering of the wigglez targets, togetherwith survey forecasts. the wigglez galaxy population possesses a clusteringlength r_0 = 4.40 +/- 0.12 mpc/h, which is significantly larger than z=0uv-selected samples, with a slope gamma = 1.92 +/- 0.08. this clustering lengthis comparable to z=3 lyman break galaxies with similar uv luminosities. thefull survey, scheduled for completion in 2010, will map an effective volumev_eff ~ 1 gpc^3 (evaluated at a scale k = 0.15 h/mpc) and will measure theangular-diameter distance and hubble expansion rates in three redshift binswith accuracies ~ 5%. we will determine the value of a constant dark energyequation-of-state parameter, w, with a higher precision than existingsupernovae observations using an entirely independent technique. the wigglezand supernovae measurements lie in highly complementary directions in the planeof w and the matter density omega_m. the forecast using the full combination ofwigglez, supernovae and cmb datasets is a marginalized error sigma(w) = 0.07,providing a robust and precise measurement of the properties of dark energyincluding cross-checking of systematic errors.

0907.1416	the hi gas content of galaxies around abell 370, a galaxy cluster at z =  0.37	we used observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope to measure theatomic hydrogen gas content of 324 galaxies around the galaxy cluster abell 370at a redshift of z = 0.37 (a look-back time of ~4 billion years). the hi 21-cmemission from these galaxies was measured by coadding their signals usingprecise optical redshifts obtained with the anglo-australian telescope. theaverage hi mass measured for all 324 galaxies is (6.6 +- 3.5)x10^9 solarmasses, while the average hi mass measured for the 105 optically blue galaxiesis (19.0 +- 6.5)x10^9 solar masses. the significant quantities of gas foundaround abell 370, suggest that there has been substantial evolution in the gascontent of galaxy clusters since redshift z = 0.37. the total amount of hi gasfound around abell 370 is up to ~8 times more than that seen around the comacluster, a nearby galaxy cluster of similar size. despite this higher gascontent, abell 370 shows the same trend as nearby clusters, that galaxies closeto the cluster core have lower hi gas content than galaxies further away. theabell 370 galaxies have hi mass to optical light ratios similar to local galaxysamples and have the same correlation between their star formation rate and himass as found in nearby galaxies. the average star formation rate derived from[oii] emission and from de-redshifted 1.4 ghz radio continuum for the abell 370galaxies also follows the correlation found in the local universe. the largeamounts of hi gas found around the cluster can easily be consumed by theobserved star formation rate in the galaxies over the ~4 billion years (from z= 0.37) to the present day.

0911.4246	the wigglez dark energy survey: survey design and first data release	the wigglez dark energy survey is a survey of 240,000 emission line galaxiesin the distant universe, measured with the aaomega spectrograph on the 3.9-manglo-australian telescope (aat). the target galaxies are selected usingultraviolet photometry from the galex satellite, with a flux limit of nuv&lt;22.8mag. the redshift range containing 90% of the galaxies is 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0. theprimary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acousticoscillations (bao) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies atlook-back times of 4-8 gyrs. detailed forecasts indicate the survey willmeasure the bao scale to better than 2% and the tangential and radial acousticwave scales to approximately 3% and 5%, respectively.  this paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, aswell as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction, and redshiftmeasurement techniques employed. it also presents an analysis of the propertiesof the target galaxies, including emission line diagnostics which show thatthey are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and hubble space telescope images,which show they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. inconjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for thefirst 100,000 galaxies measured for the project.

0911.5347	the wigglez dark energy survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy  intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts	correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between theintrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be inducedby tidal fields. these correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts(z&lt;0.35) for bright red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), andfor which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window intogalaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant forcurrent and future weak lensing surveys. measurements of these alignments atintermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shearobservations are very important for understanding the origin and redshiftevolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensingmeasurements. we present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement forblue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from sdss and spectroscopicredshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. our null detection allows us toplace upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by bluegalaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not requiresignificant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 sdss observations.also, combining the sdss and wigglez constraints gives us a long redshiftbaseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contaminationof the cosmic shear power spectrum. assuming that the alignments can beexplained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we findthat a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, cfhtls-like surveywould be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, sdss andwigglez) or +/-0.03 (wigglez alone) due to intrinsic alignments.

1010.1262	high star formation rates as the origin of turbulence in early and  modern disk galaxies	high spatial and spectral resolution observations of star formation andkinematics in early galaxies have shown that two-thirds are massive rotatingdisk galaxies with the remainder being less massive non-rotating objects. theline of sight averaged velocity dispersions are typically five times higherthan in today's disk galaxies. this has suggested thatgravitationally-unstable, gas-rich disks in the early universe are fuelled bycold, dense accreting gas flowing along cosmic filaments and penetrating hotgalactic gas halos. however these accreting flows have not been observed, andcosmic accretion cannot power the observed level of turbulence. here we reporton a new sample of rare high-velocity-dispersion disk galaxies we havediscovered in the nearby universe where cold accretion is unlikely to drivetheir high star-formation rates. we find that the velocity dispersion is mostfundamentally correlated with their star-formation rates, and not their massnor gas fraction, which leads to a new picture where star formation itself isthe energetic driver of galaxy disk turbulence at all cosmic epochs.

1101.0568	the stellar populations of early-type galaxies -- ii. the effects of  environment and mass	the degree of influence that environment and mass have on the stellarpopulations of early-type galaxies is uncertain. in this paper we present theresults of a spectroscopic analysis of the stellar populations of early-typegalaxies aimed at addressing this question. the sample of galaxies is drawnfrom four clusters, with &lt;z&gt;=0.04, and their surrounding structure extending to~10r_{vir}. we find that the distributions of the absorption-line strengths andthe stellar population parameters age, metallicity and alpha-element abundanceratio do not differ significantly between the clusters and their outskirts, butthe tight correlations found between these quantities and velocity dispersionwithin the clusters are weaker in their outskirts. all three stellar populationparameters of cluster galaxies are positively correlated with velocitydispersion. galaxies in clusters form a homogeneous class of objects that havesimilar distributions of line-strengths and stellar population parameters, andfollow similar scaling relations regardless of cluster richness or morphology.we estimate the intrinsic scatter of the gaussian distribution of metallicitiesto be 0.3 dex, while that of the alpha-element abundance ratio is 0.07 dex. thee-folding time of the exponential distribution of galaxy ages is estimated tobe 900 myr. the intrinsic scatters of the metallicity and alpha-elementabundance ratio distributions can almost entirely be accounted for by thecorrelations with velocity dispersion and the intrinsic scatter about theserelations. this implies that a galaxies mass plays the major role indetermining its stellar population.

1104.2948	the wigglez dark energy survey: the growth rate of cosmic structure  since redshift z=0.9	we present precise measurements of the growth rate of cosmic structure forthe redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, using redshift-space distortions in thegalaxy power spectrum of the wigglez dark energy survey. our results, whichhave a precision of around 10% in four independent redshift bins, are well-fitby a flat lcdm cosmological model with matter density parameter omega_m = 0.27.our analysis hence indicates that this model provides a self-consistentdescription of the growth of cosmic structure through large-scale perturbationsand the homogeneous cosmic expansion mapped by supernovae and baryon acousticoscillations. we achieve robust results by systematically comparing our datawith several different models of the quasi-linear growth of structure includingempirical models, fitting formulae calibrated to n-body simulations, andperturbation theory techniques. we extract the first measurements of the powerspectrum of the velocity divergence field, p_vv(k), as a function of redshift(under the assumption that p_gv(k) = -sqrt[p_gg(k) p_vv(k)] where g is thegalaxy overdensity field), and demonstrate that the wigglez galaxy-masscross-correlation is consistent with a deterministic (rather than stochastic)scale-independent bias model for wigglez galaxies for scales k &lt; 0.3 h/mpc.measurements of the cosmic growth rate from the wigglez survey and othercurrent and future observations offer a powerful test of the physical nature ofdark energy that is complementary to distance-redshift measures such assupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.

1105.2862	the wigglez dark energy survey: testing the cosmological model with  baryon acoustic oscillations at z=0.6	we measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) in the galaxyclustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z=0.6, using thedistribution of n=132,509 emission-line galaxies in the wigglez dark energysurvey. we quantify baos using three statistics: the galaxy correlationfunction, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by xu etal. (2010). the results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0%measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of theacoustic parameter "a(z)" introduced by eisenstein et al. (2005) we finda(z=0.6) = 0.452 +/- 0.018). both baos and power spectrum shape informationcontribute toward these constraints. the statistical significance of thedetection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to awiggle-free model, is 3.2-sigma. the ratios of our distance measurements tothose obtained using baos in the distribution of luminous red galaxies atredshifts z=0.2 and z=0.35 are consistent with a flat lambda cold dark mattermodel that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation. the addition of the currentwigglez data results in a ~ 30% improvement in the measurement accuracy of aconstant equation-of-state, w, using bao data alone. based solely on geometricbao distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w &lt; -1/3) is required with aprobability of 99.8%, providing a consistency check of conclusions based onsupernovae observations. further improvements in cosmological constraints willresult when the wigglez survey dataset is complete.

1106.3366	the 6df galaxy survey: baryon acoustic oscillations and the local hubble  constant	we analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6df galaxy survey(6dfgs) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) signal. the 6dfgs baodetection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at z_{\rm eff}= 0.106. we achieve a distance measure of d_v(z_{\rm eff}) = 456\pm27 mpc and ameasurement of the distance ratio, r_s(z_d)/d_v(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.336\pm0.015(4.5% precision), where r_s(z_d) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch z_d.the low effective redshift of 6dfgs makes it a competitive and independentalternative to cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the hubbleconstant. we find a hubble constant of h_0 = 67\pm3.2 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1} (4.8%precision) that depends only on the wmap-7 calibration of the sound horizon andon the galaxy clustering in 6dfgs. compared to earlier bao studies at higherredshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. thesensitivity to h_0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energyequation of state parameter w and h_0 in the cmb data. we determine that w =-0.97\pm0.13, using only wmap-7 and bao data from both 6dfgs and\citet{percival:2009xn}. we also discuss predictions for the large scalecorrelation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the wallaby blind h{\sci} survey (with the australian ska pathfinder, askap), and the proposed taipanall-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the uk schmidt telescope (ukst). wefind that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the bao peak,making wallaby the first radio galaxy survey to do so. we also predict thattaipan has the potential to constrain the hubble constant with 3% precision.

1108.0635	galaxy and mass assembly: stellar mass estimates	this paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically-derived stellarmass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z &lt; 0.65) galaxies in the galaxy andmass assembly (gama) spectroscopic redshift survey. these masses, as well asthe full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public aspart of gama data release 2. although the gama database does include nirphotometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fitsis significantly poorer when these nir data are included. further, for a largefraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from theoptical-plus-nir photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred fromthe optical data alone. this may indicate problems in our stellar populationlibrary, or nir data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for futureversions of the catalogue. for now, we have chosen to base our stellar massestimates on optical photometry only. in light of our decision to ignore theavailable nir data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained basedon optical data alone. we use generic properties of stellar populationsynthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle avery good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, m*/li. further, we use theobserved relation between restframe (g-i) and m*/li for real gama galaxies toargue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves,(g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate m*/li to an accuracy of &lt; ~0.1dex. this 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-m*/li relation offers a simple andtransparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimaldata, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their resultsto z &lt; ~0.4 measurements from gama.

1108.2637	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic expansion history  using the alcock-paczynski test and distant supernovae	astronomical observations suggest that today's universe is dominated by adark energy of unknown physical origin. one of the most notable consequences inmany models is that dark energy should cause the expansion of the universe toaccelerate: but the expansion rate as a function of time has proven verydifficult to measure directly. we present a new determination of the cosmicexpansion history by combining distant supernovae observations with ageometrical analysis of large-scale galaxy clustering within the wigglez darkenergy survey, using the alcock-paczynski test to measure the distortion ofstandard spheres. our result constitutes a robust and non-parametricmeasurement of the hubble expansion rate as a function of time, which wemeasure with 10-15% precision in four bins within the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt;0.9. we demonstrate that the cosmic expansion is accelerating, in a mannerindependent of the parameterization of the cosmological model (althoughassuming cosmic homogeneity in our data analysis). furthermore, we find thatthis expansion history is consistent with a cosmological-constant dark energy.

1110.1916	the 6df galaxy survey: stellar population trends across and through the  fundamental plane	we present results from an analysis of stellar population parameters for 7132galaxies in the 6dfgs fundamental plane (fp) sample. we bin the galaxies alongthe axes, $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$, of the tri-variate gaussian to which we havefit the galaxy distribution in effective radius, surface brightness, andcentral velocity dispersion (fp space), and compute median values of stellarage, [fe/h], [z/h], and [$\alpha$/fe]. we determine the directions of thevectors in fp space along which each of the binned stellar populationparameters vary most strongly. in contrast to previous work, we find stellarpopulation trends not just with velocity dispersion and fp residual, but withradius and surface brightness as well. the most remarkable finding is that thestellar population parameters vary through the plane ($v_1$ direction) andacross the plane ($v_3$ direction), but show no variation at all along theplane ($v_2$ direction). the $v_2$ direction in fp space roughly corresponds to`luminosity density'. we interpret a galaxy's position along this vector asbeing closely tied to its merger history, such that early-type galaxies withlower luminosity density are more likely to have undergone major mergers. thisconclusion is reinforced by an examination of the simulations of kobayashi(2005), which show clear trends of merger history with $v_2$.

1110.2784	accretion of the magellanic system onto the galaxy	our galaxy is surrounded by a large family of dwarf galaxies of which themost massive are the large and small magellanic clouds (lmc and smc). recentevidence suggests that systems with the mass of the local group accretegalaxies in smaller groups rather than individually. if so, at least some ofthe galaxy's dwarfs may have fallen in with the lmc and smc, and were formed aspart of the magellanic system in the nearby universe. we use the latestmeasurements of the proper motions of the lmc and smc and a multicomponentmodel of the galactic potential to explore the evolution of these galaxyconfigurations under the assumption that the magellanic system may once havecontained a number of bound dwarf galaxies. we compare our results to theavailable kinematic data for the local dwarf galaxies, and examine whether thismodel can account for recently discovered stellar streams and the planardistribution of milky way satellites. we find that in situations where the lmcand smc are bound to the milky way, the kinematics of draco, sculptor, sextans,ursa minor and the sagittarius stream are consistent with having fallen inalong with the magellanic system. these dwarfs, if so associated, will likelyhave been close to the tidal radius of the lmc originally and are unlikely tohave affected each other throughout the orbit. however there are clear cases,such as carina and leo i, that cannot be explained this way

1204.4725	the 6df galaxy survey: z \approx 0 measurement of the growth rate and  sigma_8	we present a detailed analysis of redshift-space distortions in the two-pointcorrelation function of the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs). the k-band selectedsub-sample which we employ in this study contains 81971 galaxies distributedover 17000deg^2 with an effective redshift z = 0.067. by modelling the 2dgalaxy correlation function, xi(r_p,pi), we measure the parameter combinationf(z)sigma_8(z) = 0.423 +/- 0.055. alternatively, by assuming standard gravitywe can break the degeneracy between sigma_8 and the galaxy bias parameter, b.combining our data with the hubble constant prior from riess et al (2011), wemeasure sigma_8 = 0.76 +/- 0.11 and omega_m = 0.250 +/- 0.022, consistent withconstraints from other galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave background datafrom wmap7. combining our measurement of fsigma_8 with wmap7 allows us to testthe relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constrainingthe growth index of density fluctuations, gamma. using only 6dfgs and wmap7data we find gamma = 0.547 +/- 0.088, consistent with the prediction of generalrelativity. we note that because of the low effective redshift of 6dfgs ourmeasurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmologicalmodel (alcock-paczynski effect). we also show that our conclusions are notsensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. usinga fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fsigma_8 forthe wallaby survey and the proposed taipan survey. the wallaby survey will beable to measure fsigma_8 with a precision of 4-10%, depending on the modellingof non-linear structure formation. this is comparable to the predictedprecision for the best redshift bins of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss), demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant roleto play in future tests of dark energy and modified gravity.

1205.6812	the wigglez dark energy survey: the transition to large-scale cosmic  homogeneity	we have made the largest-volume measurement to date of the transition tolarge-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. we use the wigglezsurvey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200,000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volumeof ~1 (gpc/h)^3. a new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented,which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and whichcan be easily compared between different surveys. due to the large cosmic depthof wigglez (up to z=1) we are able to make the first measurement of thetransition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. the mean number ofgalaxies n(&lt;r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r^3 within1%, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1% of d_2=3,at radii larger than 71 \pm 8 mpc/h at z~0.2, 70 \pm 5 mpc/h at z~0.4, 81 \pm 5mpc/h at z~0.6, and 75 \pm 4 mpc/h at z~0.8. we demonstrate the robustness ofour results against selection function effects, using a lcdm n-body simulationand a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. the results are inexcellent agreement with both the lcdm n-body simulation and an analytical lcdmprediction. we can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension belowd_2=2.97 on scales from ~80 mpc/h up to the largest scales probed by ourmeasurement, ~300 mpc/h, at 99.99% confidence.

1206.0385	the 6df galaxy survey: the near-infrared fundamental plane of early-type  galaxies	we determine the near-infrared fundamental plane (fp) for $\sim10^4$early-type galaxies in the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs). we fit the distributionof central velocity dispersion, near-infrared surface brightness and half-lightradius with a three-dimensional gaussian model using a maximum likelihoodmethod. for the 6dfgs $j$ band sample we find a fp with$r_{e}$\,$\propto$\,$\sigma_0^{1.52\pm0.03}i_{e}^{-0.89\pm0.01}$, similar toprevious near-ir determinations and consistent with the $h$ and $k$ bandfundamental planes once allowance is made for differences in mean colour. theoverall scatter in $r_e$ about the fp is $\sigma_r$,=,29%, and is thequadrature sum of an 18% scatter due to observational errors and a 23%intrinsic scatter. because of the distribution of galaxies in fp space,$\sigma_r$ is not the distance error, which we find to be $\sigma_d$,=,23%.using group richness and local density as measures of environment, andmorphologies based on visual classifications, we find that the fp slopes do notvary with environment or morphology. however, for fixed velocity dispersion andsurface brightness, field galaxies are on average 5% larger than galaxies inhigher-density environments, and the bulges of early-type spirals are onaverage 10% larger than ellipticals and lenticulars. the residuals about the fpshow significant trends with environment, morphology and stellar population.the strongest trend is with age, and we speculate that age is the mostimportant systematic source of offsets from the fp, and may drive the othertrends through its correlations with environment, morphology and metallicity.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

1212.3610	the 6df galaxy survey: dependence of halo occupation on stellar mass	in this paper we study the stellar-mass dependence of galaxy clustering inthe 6df galaxy survey. the near-infrared selection of 6dfgs allows morereliable stellar mass estimates compared to optical bands used in other galaxysurveys. using the halo occupation distribution (hod) model, we investigate thetrend of dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction with stellar mass bymeasuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(r_p)$. we find that thetypical halo mass ($m_1$) as well as the satellite power law index ($\alpha$)increase with stellar mass. this indicates, (1) that galaxies with higherstellar mass sit in more massive dark matter halos and (2) that these moremassive dark matter halos accumulate satellites faster with growing masscompared to halos occupied by low stellar mass galaxies. furthermore we find arelation between $m_1$ and the minimum dark matter halo mass ($m_{\rm min}$) of$m_1 \approx 22\,m_{\rm min}$, in agreement with similar findings for sdssgalaxies. the satellite fraction of 6dfgs galaxies declines with increasingstellar mass from 21% at $m_{\rm stellar} = 2.6\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,m_{\odot}$to 12% at $m_{\rm stellar} = 5.4\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,m_{\odot}$ indicating thathigh stellar mass galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies. we compareour results to two different semi-analytic models derived from the millenniumsimulation, finding some disagreement. our results can be used for placing newconstraints on semi-analytic models in the future, particularly the behaviourof luminous red satellites. finally we compare our results to studies of halooccupation using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing. we find good overall agreement,representing a valuable crosscheck for these two different tools of studyingthe matter distribution in the universe.

1302.5178	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic growth rate with  the two-point galaxy correlation function	the growth history of large-scale structure in the universe is a powerfulprobe of the cosmological model, including the nature of dark energy. we studythe growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift $z = 0.9$ using more than$162{,}000$ galaxy redshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. we divide thedata into four redshift slices with effective redshifts $z =[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]$ and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-pointgalaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to theline-of-sight. after simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor werecover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed$\lambda$cdm input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20% in eachredshift slice. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details ofthe assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making closecomparison with a set of n-body simulations for calibration. our measurementsare consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similardataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. wedetermine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametricmanner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, andinvestigate the alcock-paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial modelon the results. our techniques should prove useful for current and futuregalaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensionalcorrelation function.

1407.0390	the gigaparsec wigglez simulations: characterising scale dependant bias  and associated systematics in growth of structure measurements	we use the gigaparsec wigglez (gigglez) simulations to characterise galaxybias and its scale dependence for a range of redshifts and halo masses in astandard $\lambda$lcdm cosmology. assuming bias converges to a scaleindependent form at large scales, we develop a phenomenological model whichfully expresses the mass and redshift dependence of bias and its scaledependence in real or redshift space. we then use this to illustrate howscale-dependent bias can systematically skew measurements of the growth-rate ofcosmic structure obtained from redshift-space distortion measurements. whendata is fit only to scales $k_{\rm max}{\le}0.1$ $[h^{-1} \rm{mpc}]^{-1}$, wefind that these effects are significant only for large biases ($b{\gtrsim}3$)at large redshifts ($z{\gtrsim}1$). however, when smaller scales areincorporated ($k_{\rm max}{\le}0.2$ $[h^{-1} \rm{mpc}]^{-1}$) to increasemeasurement precision, the combination of reduced statistical uncertainty andincreased scale dependent bias can result in highly significant systematics formost large halos across all redshifts. we identify several new interestingaspects of bias, including a significant large-scale bias boost for small halosat low-redshifts due to substructure effects ($\sim$20\% for milky way-likesystems) and a nearly redshift-independent halo mass (corresponding to aredshift-space bias of ${\sim}1.5$) for which halo bias has little-or-no scaledependence on scales greater than $3$ $[h^{-1} {\rm mpc}]$. this suggests anoptimal strategy of targeting bias ${\sim}{1.5}$ systems for clustering studieswhich are dominated by systematic uncertainties in how observed halo (orgalaxy) distributions map to their underlying mass distribution, such ascosmological measurements of neutrino masses. code for generating our fittingformula is publicly available at http://gbpoole.github.io/poole_2014a_code/(abridged)

0803.4032	the effects of stellar populations on galaxy scaling relations in the  6df galaxy survey	we present an analysis of the stellar populations in a sample of ~7000galaxies from the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs). we derive ages and metallicitiesusing stellar population models. we also derive dynamical masses and dynamicalmass-to-light ratios by combining central velocity dispersions with globalphotometry in b, r and k bands. together, these data allow to reduce thedegeneracies between age, metallicity and star formation burst-strength thathave limited previous studies. we find old galaxies exhibit a mass-metallicityrelation with slope d[fe/h]/dlogm = 0.25, while young galaxies show slopesconsistent with zero. when we account for the effects of the mass-metallicityrelation, we obtain a single, consistent relation between mass-to-light ratioand mass for old galaxies in all passbands. as we have accounted for stellarpopulation effects, this relation must have a dynamical origin. however, wedemonstrate that any simple trend between mass-to-light-ratio and mass orluminosity is inconsistent with the observations, and that a more complexrelationship must exist. we find the central regions of galaxies often exhibityoung stellar populations. however it is only in the lowest-mass galaxies(~10^{10} m$_{\odot}$) that these populations are evident in the globalphotometry. in higher-mass galaxies, young central populations have decreasinginfluence on the global photometry, with there being no discernible impact ingalaxies more massive than ~2x10^{11} m$_{\odot}$. we conclude that the youngstellar populations detected in spectroscopic studies are generally centrallyconcentrated, and that there is an upper limit on the mass of star-formingevents in massive galaxies. these results have ramifications for mass-to-lightratios estimated from photometric observations.

1409.6161	the 6df galaxy survey: peculiar velocity field and cosmography	we derive peculiar velocities for the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs) and describethe velocity field of the nearby ($z&lt;0.055$) southern hemisphere. the surveycomprises 8885 galaxies for which we have previously reported fundamental planedata. we obtain peculiar velocity probability distributions for the redshiftspace positions of each of these galaxies using a bayesian approach. accountingfor selection bias, we find that the logarithmic distance uncertainty is 0.11dex, corresponding to $26\%$ in linear distance. we use adaptive kernelsmoothing to map the observed 6dfgs velocity field out to $cz \sim 16,000$\kms, and compare this to the predicted velocity fields from the pscz surveyand the 2mass redshift survey. we find a better fit to the pscz prediction,although the reduced $\chi^2$ for the whole sample is approximately unity forboth comparisons. this means that, within the observational uncertainties dueto redshift independent distance errors, observed galaxy velocities and thosepredicted by the linear approximation from the density field agree. however, wefind peculiar velocities that are systematically more positive than modelpredictions in the direction of the shapley and vela superclusters, andsystematically more negative than model predictions in the direction of thepisces-cetus supercluster, suggesting contributions from volumes not covered bythe models.

1505.05518	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): trends in galaxy colours, morphology,  and stellar populations with large scale structure, group, and pair  environments	we explore trends in galaxy properties with mpc-scale structures usingcatalogues of environment and large scale structure from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. existing gama catalogues of large scale structure,group and pair membership allow us to construct galaxy stellar mass functionsfor different environmental types. to avoid simply extracting the knownunderlying correlations between galaxy properties and stellar mass, we create amass matched sample of galaxies with stellar masses between $9.5 \leq\log{m_*/h^{-2} m_{\odot}} \leq 11$ for each environmental population. usingthese samples, we show that mass normalised galaxies in different large scaleenvironments have similar energy outputs, $u-r$ colours, luminosities, andmorphologies. extending our analysis to group and pair environments, we showgalaxies that are not in groups or pairs exhibit similar characteristics toeach other regardless of broader environment. for our mass controlled sample,we fail to see a strong dependence of s\'{e}rsic index or galaxy luminosity onhalo mass, but do find that it correlates very strongly with colour. repeatingour analysis for galaxies that have not been mass controlled introduces andamplifies trends in the properties of galaxies in pairs, groups, and largescale structure, indicating that stellar mass is the most important predictorof the galaxy properties we examine, as opposed to environmentalclassifications.

1511.06930	the 6df galaxy survey: bulk flows on $50-70 h^{-1}$ mpc scales	we measure the bulk flow of the local universe using the 6df galaxy surveypeculiar velocity sample (6dfgsv), the largest and most homogeneous peculiarvelocity sample to date. 6dfgsv is a fundamental plane sample of $\sim10^4$peculiar velocities covering the whole southern hemisphere for galacticlatitude $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$, out to redshift ${z=0.0537}$. we apply the `minimumvariance' bulk flow weighting method, which allows us to make a robustmeasurement of the bulk flow on scales of $50$ and $70\,h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$. weinvestigate and correct for potential bias due to the lognormal velocityuncertainties, and verify our method by constructing $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ 6dfgsvmock catalogues incorporating the survey selection function. for a hemisphereof radius $50\,h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$ we find a bulk flow amplitude of$u=248\pm58\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the direction $(l,b) =(318^\circ\pm20^\circ,40^\circ\pm13^\circ)$, and for $70\,h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$ wefind $u=243\pm58\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, in the same direction. ourmeasurement gives us a constraint on $\sigma_8$ of $1.01^{+1.07}_{-0.58}$. ourresults are in agreement with other recent measurements of the direction of thebulk flow, and our measured amplitude is consistent with a $\lambda{\rm cdm}$prediction.

astro-ph;0008418	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions -  vii. peculiar velocities and bulk motions	we present peculiar velocities for 84 clusters of galaxies in two largevolumes at distances between 6000 and 15000 km/s in the directions ofhercules-corona borealis and perseus-pisces-cetus. these velocities are basedon fundamental plane (fp) distance estimates for early-type galaxies in eachcluster. we fit the fp using a maximum likelihood algorithm which accounts forboth selection effects and measurement errors, and yields fp parameters withsmaller bias and variance than other fitting procedures. we find a best-fit fpwith coefficients consistent with the best existing determinations. we measurethe bulk motions of the sample volumes using the 50 clusters with thebest-determined peculiar velocities. we find the bulk motions in both regionsare small, and consistent with zero at about the 5% level. the efar results arein agreement with the small bulk motions found by dale et al. (1999) on similarscales, but are inconsistent with pure dipole motions having the largeamplitudes found by lauer &amp; postman (1994) and hudson et al. (1999). thealignment of the efar sample with the lauer &amp; postman dipole produces a strongrejection of a large-amplitude bulk motion in that direction, but the rejectionof the hudson et al. result is less certain because their dipole lies at alarge angle to the main axis of the efar sample. we find the bulk motion of oursample is consistent with most cosmological models that approximately reproducethe shape and normalisation of the observed galaxy power spectrum. we concludethat existing measurements of large-scale bulk motions provide no significantevidence against standard models for the formation of structure.

astro-ph;0012456	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions vi:  the maximum likelihood gaussian algorithm	the efar project is designed to measure the properties and peculiar motionsof early-type galaxies in two distant regions. here we describe the maximumlikelihood algorithm we developed to investigate the correlations between theparameters of the efar database. one-, two-, and three-dimensional gaussianmodels are constructed to determine the mean value and intrinsic spread of theparameters, and the slopes and intrinsic parallel and orthogonal spread of themgb'-mg2, mg2-sigma, mgb'-sigma relations, and the fundamental plane. in thelatter case, the cluster peculiar velocities are also determined. we show thatthis method is superior to ``canonical'' approaches of least-squares type,which give biased slopes and biased peculiar velocities. we test the algorithmwith monte carlo simulations of mock efar catalogues and derive the systematicand random errors on the estimated parameters. we find that random errors arealways dominant. we estimate the influence of systematic errors due to the wayclusters were selected and the hard limits and uncertainties in the selectionfunction parameters for the galaxies. we explore the influence of uniformdistributions in the fundamental plane parameters and the errors. we concludethat the mean peculiar motions of the efar clusters can be determined reliably.in particular, the placement of the two efar sample regions relative to thelauer and postman dipole allows us to strongly constrain the amplitude of thebulk motion in this direction.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0207504	early-type galaxies in low-density environments	we describe the construction and study of an objectively-defined sample ofearly-type galaxies in low-density environments. the sample galaxies areselected from a recently-completed redshift survey using uniform andreadily-quantified isolation criteria, and are drawn from a sky area of ~700deg^2, to a depth of 7000 k/ms and an apparent magnitude limit of b_j &lt; 16.1.their early-type (e/s0) morphologies are confirmed by subsequent ccd imaging.five out of the nine sample galaxies show signs of morphological peculiaritysuch as tidal debris or blue circumnuclear rings. we confirm that e/s0 galaxiesare rare in low-density regions, accounting for only ~8% of the total galaxypopulation in such environments. we present spectroscopic observations of ninegalaxies in the sample, which are used, in conjunction with updated stellarpopulation models, to investigate star-formation histories. environmentaleffects on early-type galaxy evolution are investigated by comparison with asample of fornax cluster e/s0s. results from both samples are compared withpredictions from semi-analytic galaxy formation models. the mg-sig relation ofe/s0s in low-density regions is shown to be indistinguishable from that of thefornax sample. luminosity-weighted stellar ages and metallicities aredetermined by considering various combinations of line-indices. at a givenluminosity, the e/s0 galaxies in low-density regions are younger than the e/s0sin clusters (by ~2-3 gyr), and also more metal-rich (by ~0.2 dex). we inferthat an anti-correlation of age and metallicity effects is responsible formaintaining the zero-point of the mg-sig relation. the youngest galaxies in oursample show clear morphological signs of interaction.

astro-ph;0311379	galaxy ecology: groups and low-density environments in the sdss and  2dfgrs	we analyse the observed correlation between galaxy environment and h-alphaemission line strength, using volume-limited samples and group catalogues of24968 galaxies drawn from the 2df galaxy redshift survey (mb&lt;-19.5) and thesloan digital sky survey (mr&lt;-20.6). we characterise the environment by 1)sigma_5, the surface number density of galaxies determined by the projecteddistance to the 5th nearest neighbour; and 2) rho1.1 and rho5.5,three-dimensional density estimates obtained by convolving the galaxydistribution with gaussian kernels of dispersion 1.1 mpc and 5.5 mpc,respectively. we find that star-forming and quiescent galaxies form twodistinct populations, as characterised by their h-alpha equivalent width,ew(ha). the relative numbers of star-forming and quiescent galaxies variesstrongly and continuously with local density. however, the distribution ofew(ha) amongst the star-forming population is independent of environment. thefraction of star-forming galaxies shows strong sensitivity to the density onlarge scales, rho5.5, which is likely independent of the trend with localdensity, rho1.1. we use two differently-selected group catalogues todemonstrate that the correlation with galaxy density is approximatelyindependent of group velocity dispersion, for sigma=200-1000 km/s. even in thelowest density environments, no more than ~70 per cent of galaxies showsignificant h-alpha emission. based on these results, we conclude that thepresent-day correlation between star formation rate and environment is a resultof short-timescale mechanisms that take place preferentially at high redshift,such as starbursts induced by galaxy-galaxy interactions.

astro-ph;0407537	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: luminosity functions by density  environment and galaxy type	we use the 2df galaxy redshift survey to measure the dependence of thebj-band galaxy luminosity function on large-scale environment, defined bydensity contrast in spheres of radius 8h-1mpc, and on spectral type, determinedfrom principal component analysis. we find that the galaxy populations at bothextremes of density differ significantly from that at the mean density. thepopulation in voids is dominated by late types and shows, relative to the mean,a deficit of galaxies that becomes increasingly pronounced at magnitudesbrighter than m_bj-5log10h &lt;-18.5. in contrast, cluster regions have a relativeexcess of very bright early-type galaxies with m_bj-5log10h &lt; -21. differencesin the mid to faint-end population between environments are significant: atm_bj-5log10h=-18 early and late-type cluster galaxies show comparableabundances, whereas in voids the late types dominate by almost an order ofmagnitude. we find that the luminosity functions measured in all densityenvironments, from voids to clusters, can be approximated by schechterfunctions with parameters that vary smoothly with local density, but in afashion which differs strikingly for early and late-type galaxies. theseobserved variations, combined with our finding that the faint-end slope of theoverall luminosity function depends at most weakly on density environment, mayprove to be a significant challenge for models of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0701211	the glare survey ii. faint z=6 ly-alpha line emitters in the hudf	the galaxy population at z~6 has been the subject of intense study in recentyears, culminating in the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) -- the deepest imagingsurvey yet. a large number of high redshift galaxy candidates have beenidentified within the hudf, but until now analysis of their properties has beenhampered by the difficulty of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for these faintgalaxies. our ''gemini lyman-alpha at reionisation era'' (glare) project hasbeen designed to undertake spectroscopic follow up of faint (z'&lt;28.5) i'-dropgalaxies at z~6 in the hudf. in a previous paper we presented preliminaryresults from the first 7.5 hours of data from glare. in this paper we detailthe complete survey. we have now obtained 36 hours of spectroscopy on a singlegmos slitmask from gemini-south, with a spectral resolution oflambda/delta(lambda) ~ 1000. we identify five strong lyman-alpha emitters atz&gt;5.5, and a further nine possible line emitters with detections at lowersignificance. we also place tight constraints on the equivalent width oflyman-alpha emission for a further ten i'-drop galaxies and examine theequivalent width distribution of this faint spectroscopic sample of z~6galaxies. we find that the fraction of galaxies with little or no emission issimilar to that at z~3, but that the z~6 population has a tail of sources withhigh rest frame equivalent widths. possible explanations for this effectinclude a tendency towards stronger line emission in faint sources, which mayarise from extreme youth or low metallicity in the lyman-break population athigh redshift, or possibly a top-heavy initial mass function.

astro-ph;0701668	the hi content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24	we use observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) tomeasure the atomic hydrogen gas content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24(i.e. a look-backtime of ~3 gyr). the sample of galaxies studied were selectedfrom halpha-emitting field galaxies detected in a narrow-band imaging surveywith the subaru telescope. the anglo-australian telescope was used to obtainprecise optical redshifts for these galaxies. we then coadded the hi 21 cmemission signal for all the galaxies within the gmrt spectral line data cube.  from the coadded signal of 121 galaxies, we measure an average atomichydrogen gas mass of (2.26 +- 0.90)*10^9 solar masses. we translate this hisignal into a cosmic density of neutral gas at z = 0.24 of omega_gas = (0.91 +-0.42)*10^-3. this is the current highest redshift at which omega_gas has beenconstrained from 21 cm emission and our value is consistent with that estimatedfrom damped lyman-alpha systems around this redshift. we also find that thecorrelations between the halpha luminosity and the radio continuum luminosityand between the star formation rate and the hi gas content in star-forminggalaxies at z = 0.24 are consistent with the correlations found at z = 0. thesetwo results suggest that the star formation mechanisms in field galaxies ~3 gyrago were not substantially different from the present, even though the starformation rate is 3 times higher.

astro-ph;9401028	high-resolution imaging of faint blue galaxies	we have used hrcam on the cfht to obtain subarcsecond images of 26 galaxieswith z=0.1--0.7. the primary sample of 17 galaxies have enhanced star formationindicated by [oii] equivalent widths greater than 20\aa, while the comparisonsample of 9 galaxies have equivalent widths less than 10\aa. by fitting disksor bulges to bvi images we derive scalelengths for the blue and red stellarpopulations and locate the star-formation in each galaxy. thesemoderate-redshift galaxies generally have straightforward low-redshiftanalogues, in that their colours, sizes and luminosities are consistent withthose of various types of z$\approx$0 galaxies. the star-forming objects havestructures consistent with the full range of present-day disk galaxies, andabsolute magnitudes m$^\ast$$-$1 to m$^\ast$+5. some have star-formationconcentrated in their nuclei but in most it occurs across the entire disk. wefind companions at projected distances closer than 10 kpc for 30% of thestar-forming galaxies, whereas none of the comparison sample have such closecompanions. this provides the first direct evidence linking interactions ormergers to the increased fraction of star-forming field galaxies at moderateredshifts.

astro-ph;9502016	the abell cluster inertial frame	a re-analysis of lauer \&amp; postman's (1994; lp) finding that the abell clusterinertial frame (acif), defined by the 119 abell clusters within 15,000 km/s, ismoving at almost 700 km/s with respect to the cosmic microwave background. sucha motion is inconsistent with most cosmological models at a confidence level of95% or higher. we obtain an exact expression for a cluster's peculiar velocityin terms of the residual magnitude about the mean relation between the metricluminosity of brightest cluster galaxies and the slope of their luminosityprofiles. we compare this to the approximation used by lp. we develop a maximumlikelihood procedure for recovering the local group motion from the scatter inthis relation which yields an unbiased estimate for the motion withsignificantly smaller uncertainties than lp's method. we re-analyse lp's dataand find that the local group is moving relative to the acif at 626 (+/-242)km/s towards l=216, b=-28 (+/-20). this implies that the acif is itself movingrelative to the cosmic microwave background at 764 (+/-160) km/s towards l=341,b=49 (+/-20). this motion is consistent with that derived by lp but has a 10%larger amplitude and 20% smaller errors, making it even harder to reconcilewith cosmological models.

astro-ph;9508070	structure and dynamics of the coma cluster	we examine the structure and dynamics of the galaxies in the coma clusterusing a catalog of 552 redshifts including 243 new measurements. the velocitydistribution is shown to be non-gaussian due to structure associated with thegroup of galaxies around ngc4839, 40 arcmin sw of the cluster core. we apply amixture-modelling algorithm to the galaxy sample and obtain a robust partitioninto two subclusters which we use to examine the system's dynamics. we findthat the late-type galaxies are freely-falling into a largely virialisedcluster core dominated by early types. we obtain a virial mass for the maincluster in close agreement with the estimates derived from recent x-ray data.the mass of the ngc4839 group is about 5-10% the mass of the main cluster.assuming the main cluster and the ngc4839 group follow a linear two-body orbit,the favored solution has the two clusters lying at 74 degrees to the line ofsight at a true separation of 0.8 mpc and moving together at 1700 km/s. thecluster core shows evidence of an ongoing merger between two subclusterscentered in projection on the dominant galaxies ngc4874 and ngc4889 but offsetin velocity by 300 km/s and 1100 km/s respectively. combining these resultswith x-ray and radio observations, and an interpretation of the presence orlack of an extended halo around the dominant galaxies, we develop a mergerhistory for the coma cluster.

astro-ph;9512057	autofib redshift survey - i. evolution of the galaxy luminosity function	we present a detailed determination of the restframe b-band galaxy luminosityfunction (lf) as a function of redshift and star formation activity from z=0 toz=0.75. the dataset used for this purpose is a combined sample of over 1700redshifts spanning a wide range in apparent magnitude, 11.5&lt;b&lt;24.0, which weterm the autofib redshift survey. the sample includes various earliermagnitude-limited surveys constructed by our team as well as a new survey of1026 redshifts measured for galaxies at intermediate magnitudes. the largerange in apparent magnitude sampled allows us to investigate both the nature ofthe lf at low redshift (z&lt;0.1) and possible evolution in its shape to z=0.75.we find that earlier bright surveys have underestimated the absolutenormalisation of the lf. because the shape of the local lf does not change withthe survey apparent magnitude limit, it seems unlikely that the localdeficiency arises from an underestimated population of low luminosity galaxies.furthermore, surface brightness losses cannot be significant unless theyconspire to retain the lf shape over a variety of detection thresholds. ourdata directly demonstrates that the b-band lf evolves with redshift. thisevolution is best represented as a steepening of the faint-end slope of the lf,from alpha=-1.1 at low redshift to alpha=-1.5 at z=0.5. using [oii] emission asan indicator of star formation activity, we show that the lf of quiescentgalaxies has remained largely unchanged since z=0.5, whereas the luminositydensity of star-forming galaxies has declined by nearly a factor of 2. thesteepening of the overall lf with lookback time is a direct consequence of theincreasing space density of blue star-forming galaxies at moderate redshifts.

astro-ph;9610036	autofib redshift survey: ii -- the evolution of the galaxy luminosity  function by spectral type	we determine the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) as afunction of spectral type using the autofib redshift survey, a compendium ofover 1700 galaxy redshifts in various magnitude-limited samples spanningb_j=11.5-24.0. to carry out this analysis we have developed a cross-correlationtechnique which classifies faint galaxy spectra into one of six types based onlocal galaxy templates. tests and simulations show that this technique yieldsclassifications correct to within one type for more than 90% of the galaxies inour sample. we have also developed extensions of the step-wise maximumlikelihood method and the sty parametric method for estimating lfs which areapplicable to recovering an evolving lf from multiple samples. we find that:(i) the spectra and lf of e/s0 galaxies show no appreciable evolution out to atleast z ~ 0.5. (ii) early-type spirals show modest evolution, characterised bya gradual steepening of the faint end of their lf with redshift. (iii) out to z~ 0.5, the overall evolution of the galaxy population is dominated by changesseen in late-type spirals. the characteristic luminosity (l^*) of thesegalaxies appears to brighten with redshift and there are signs of strongdensity evolution (a rapid increase in \phi^*). these effects appear to beluminosity dependent so that the lf steepens at higher redshift. these trendsare accompanied by a steep increase in the median [oii] equivalent width,implying a rapid increase in the star-formation rate with redshift at fixedluminosity---a given star-formation rate is found at higher redshift ingalaxies of higher luminosity. we find that these conclusions are robust withrespect to spectral classification errors and the luminosity functionestimator.

astro-ph;9701020	some effects of galaxy structure and dynamics on the fundamental plane	we examine the effects on the fundamental plane (fp) of structural departuresfrom an r^{1/4} galaxy light profile. we also explore the use of volumetric aswell as projected galaxy parameters. we fit the sersic r^{1/n} law to thev-band light profiles of 26 virgo ellipticals, where `n' is a shape parameterthat allows for structural differences amongst the profiles. the galaxy lightprofiles show a trend of systematic departures from a de vaucouleurs r^{1/4}law, in the sense that `n' increases with increasing effective half-lightradius r_{e}. adjustments to the measured velocity dispersion are also made,based upon the theoretical velocity dispersion profile shapes of the differentr^{1/n} light profiles. we find that allowing for broken structural homologythrough fitting r^{1/n} profiles, but still using central velocity dispersions,actually increases the departure of the observed fp from the virial plane - theincrease in effective radius with galaxy luminosity (and `n') is over-balancedby an associated decrease in the mean surface brightness. in examining the useof volumetric quantities and allowing for the different velocity dispersionprofiles corresponding to the observed light profiles, we find that use of thevolumetric velocity dispersion at the volumetric half-light radius decreasesthe departure of the fp from the virial plane. through use of the jeanshydrodynamical equation, we further convert the projected central aperturevelocity dispersion, sigma_{0}, into the infinite aperture velocity dispersion,sigma_{tot,n} (which is equal to one-third of the virial velocity dispersion).using both the r^{1/n} fit parameters and sigma_{tot,n} we obtain for the fp,r_{e,n}~sigma_{tot,n}^{1.44+/-0.11}sigma_{e,n}^{-0.93+/-0.08}, where r_{e,n}and sigma_{e,n} are the radius and surface brightness terms.

astro-ph;9806331	extended stellar kinematics of elliptical galaxies in the fornax cluster	we present extended stellar kinematics for a sample of 13 elliptical galaxiesin the fornax cluster. major-axis velocity dispersion profiles (vdps) androtation curves (rcs) are given for 12 of the galaxies. a major feature of thisdata is the spatial extension: for 8 galaxies the data extends beyond 1 r_e,and for 5 it extends beyond 2 r_e. compared to the previously available data,this corresponds to an increase in spatial coverage by a factor from 1 to 5.five of the ellipticals in the sample turn out to be rotationally-supportedsystems, having positive rotation parameter log (v/sigma)*. one of these five,and another 3 galaxies from the remaining sample, display evidence for bar-likekinematics. the data indicate that the true number of `dynamically hot' stellarsystems, is much lower than previously thought: of the es in the present sampleonly 1/4 are confirmed as `pressure-supported' systems. the data reveal a hostof individual peculiarities, like: wiggles, strong gradients, and asymmetriesin the rotation curve and/or in the velocity dispersion profile, thus showingthat the presence of kinematically distinct components and/or triaxiality is acommon characteristic of this class of object.

astro-ph;9808276	measurement of star-formation rate from h-alpha in field galaxies at z=1	we report the results of j-band infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 13 z=1field galaxies drawn from the canada-france redshift survey, targeting galaxieswhose redshifts place the rest frame h-alpha line emission from hii regions inbetween the bright night sky oh lines. as a result we detect emission down to aflux limit of ~10^{-16} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} corresponding to a luminosity limitof ~10^{41} ergs at this redshift for a h_0=50 km s^{-1} mpc,^{-1} q_0=0.5cosmology. from these luminosities we derive estimates of the star-formationrates in these galaxies which are independent of previous estimates based upontheir rest-frame ultraviolet (2800a) luminosity. the mean star-formation rateat z=1, from this sample, is found to be at least three times as high as theultraviolet estimates. the standard dust extinction in these galaxies isinferred to be a_v=0.5-1.0 mags, comparable to local field galaxies, suggestingthat the bulk of star-formation is not heavily obscured unless one uses greyerextinction laws. star-forming galaxies have the bluest colours and apreponderance of disturbed/interacting morphologies. we also investigate theeffects of particular star-formation histories, in particular the role ofbursts vs continuous star-formation in changing the detailed distribution of uvto h-alpha emission. generally we find that models dominated by short,overlapping, bursts at typically 0.2 gyr intervals provide a better model forthe data than a constant rate of star-formation. the star-formation history ofthe universe from balmer lines is compiled and found to be typically 2--3\timeshigher than that inferred from the uv {\em at all redshifts}. it can not yet beclearly established whether the star-formation rate falls off or remainsconstant at high-redshift.

astro-ph;9811089	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions - v.  the mg-sigma relation, age and metallicity	we examine the mg-sigma relation for early-type galaxies in the efar sampleand its dependence on cluster properties. a maximum likelihood fit gives globalmg-sigma relations of mgb'=0.131log(sigma)-0.131 and mg2=0.257log(sigma)-0.305,with intrinsic scatter of 0.016 mag in mgb' and 0.023 mag in mg2. the zeropointfor cd galaxies is higher than for e/s0 galaxies, implying cds are older and/ormore metal-rich than e/s0s with the same sigma. mg-sigma zeropoint variationsbetween clusters are consistent with the number of galaxies observed percluster and the global intrinsic scatter in mg-sigma. we find no significantcorrelation between the mg-sigma zeropoint and the cluster velocity dispersion,x-ray luminosity or x-ray temperature over a wide range in cluster mass. wecompare the intrinsic scatter in the mg-sigma and fundamental plane (fp)relations with stellar population models to constrain the dispersion in ages,metallicities and m/l ratios for early-type galaxies at fixed sigma. variationsin age alone or metallicity alone cannot explain the measured intrinsic scatterin both mg-sigma and the fp. we derive the joint constraints on the dispersionin age and metallicity implied by the scatter in the mg-sigma and fp relationsfor a simple gaussian model. we find upper limits on the dispersions at fixedsigma of 32% in dt/t and 38% in dz/z if variations in age and metallicity areuncorrelated; only strongly anti-correlated variations lead to significantlyhigher upper limits. the joint distribution of residuals from the mg-sigma andfp relations is only marginally consistent with a model having no correlationbetween age and metallicity, and is better-matched by a model in which age andmetallicity variations are moderately anti-correlated, with younger galaxiesbeing more metal-rich.

astro-ph;9811241	the peculiar motions of early-type galaxies in two distant regions - ii.  the spectroscopic data	we present the spectroscopic data for the galaxies studied in the efarproject, which is designed to measure the properties and peculiar motions ofearly-type galaxies in two distant regions. we have obtained 1319 spectra of714 early-type galaxies over 33 observing runs on 10 different telescopes. wedescribe the observations and data reductions used to measure redshifts,velocity dispersions and the mgb and mg2 lick linestrength indices. detailedsimulations and intercomparison of the large number of repeat observations leadto reliable error estimates for all quantities. the measurements from differentobserving runs are calibrated to a common zeropoint or scale before beingcombined, yielding a total of 706 redshifts, 676 velocity dispersions, 676 mgblinestrengths and 582 mg2 linestrengths. the median estimated errors in thecombined measurements are dcz=20 km/s, dsigma/sigma=9.1%, dmgb/mgb=7.2% anddmg2=0.015 mag. comparison of our measurements with published datasets shows nosystematic errors in the redshifts or velocity dispersions and only smallzeropoint corrections to bring our linestrengths onto the standard lick system.we have assigned galaxies to physical clusters by examining the line-of-sightvelocity distributions based on efar and zcat redshifts, together with theprojected distributions on the sky. we derive mean redshifts and velocitydispersions for these clusters, which will be used in estimating distances andpeculiar velocities and to test for trends in the galaxy population withcluster mass. the spectroscopic parameters presented here for 706 galaxiescombine high quality data, uniform reduction and measurement procedures, anddetailed error analysis. they form the largest single set of velocitydispersions and linestrengths for early-type galaxies published to date.

0810.2115	topology of non-linear structure in the 2df galaxy redshift survey	we study the evolution of non-linear structure as a function of scale insamples from the 2df galaxy redshift survey, constituting over 221 000 galaxiesat a median redshift of z=0.11. the two flux-limited galaxy samples, locatednear the southern galactic pole and the galactic equator, are smoothed withgaussian filters of width ranging from 5 to 8 mpc/h to produce a continuousgalaxy density field. the topological genus statistic is used to measure therelative abundance of overdense clusters to void regions at each scale; theseresults are compared to the predictions of analytic theory, in the form of thegenus statistic for i) the linear regime case of a gaussian random field; andii) a first-order perturbative expansion of the weakly non-linear evolvedfield. the measurements demonstrate a statistically significant detection of anasymmetry in the genus statistic between regions corresponding to low- andhigh-density volumes of the universe. we attribute the asymmetry to thenon-linear effects of gravitational evolution and biased galaxy formation, anddemonstrate that these effects evolve as a function of scale. we find thatneither analytic prescription satisfactorily reproduces the measurements,though the weakly non-linear theory yields substantially better results in somecases, and we discuss the potential explanations for this result.
