0902.4704	the sins survey: broad emission lines in high-redshift star-forming  galaxies	high signal-to-noise, representative spectra of star-forming galaxies at z~2,obtained via stacking, reveal a high-velocity component underneath the narrowh-alpha and [nii] emission lines. when modeled as a single gaussian, this broadcomponent has fwhm &gt; 1500 km/s; when modeled as broad wings on the h-alpha and[nii] features, it has fwhm &gt; 500 km/s. this feature is preferentially found inthe more massive and more rapidly star-forming systems, which also tend to beolder and larger galaxies. we interpret this emission as evidence of eitherpowerful starburst-driven galactic winds or active supermassive black holes. ifgalactic winds are responsible for the broad emission, the observed luminosityand velocity of this gas imply mass outflow rates comparable to the starformation rate. on the other hand, if the broad line regions of active blackholes account for the broad feature, the corresponding black holes masses areestimated to be an order of magnitude lower than those predicted by localscaling relations, suggesting a delayed assembly of supermassive black holeswith respect to their host bulges.

1004.0331	a wide area survey for high-redshift massive galaxies. ii. near-infrared  spectroscopy of bzk-selected massive star-forming galaxies	results are presented from nir spectroscopy of a sample of bzk-selected,massive star-forming galaxies (sbzks) at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.3 that were obtained withohs/cisco at subaru and with sinfoni at vlt. among the 28 sbzks observed, haemission was detected in 14 objects, and for 11 of them the [nii]6583 was alsomeasured. multiwavelength photometry was also used to derive stellar masses andextinction parameters, whereas ha and [nii] have allowed us to estimate sfr,metallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. in order to enforceagreement between sfrs from ha with those derived from rest-frame uv and mir,additional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in hii regions)was required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the uvcontinuum. we have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as wellas the relation between stellar mass and specific sfr, and compared them to theresults in other studies. at a given stellar mass, the sbzks appear to havebeen already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forminggalaxies of similar mass. the sbzks presented here tend to have highermetallicities compared to those of uv-selected galaxies, indicating that nirselected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population. the sbzksshow specific sfrs that are systematically higher, by up to ~2 orders ofmagnitude, compared to those of local galaxies of the same mass. the empiricalcorrelations between stellar mass and metallicity, and stellar mass andspecific sfr are then compared with those of population synthesis modelsconstructed either with the simple closed-box assumption, or within an infallscenario. within the assumptions that are built-in such models, it appears thata short timescale for the star-formation (~100 myr) and large initial gas massappear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously.

1011.0457	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: metallicity estimates for the  stellar population and exoplanet hosts	we present new uv-to-ir stellar photometry of four low-extinction windows inthe galactic bulge, obtained with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble spacetelescope (hst). using our five bandpasses, we have defined reddening-freephotometric indices sensitive to stellar effective temperature and metallicity.we find that the bulge populations resemble those formed via classicaldissipative collapse: each field is dominated by an old (~10 gyr) populationexhibiting a wide metallicity range (-1.5 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.5). we detect ametallicity gradient in the bulge population, with the fraction of stars atsuper-solar metallicities dropping from 41% to 35% over distances from thegalactic center ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 kpc. one field includes candidateexoplanet hosts discovered in the sweeps hst transit survey. our measurementsfor 11 of these hosts demonstrate that exoplanets in the distinct bulgeenvironment are preferentially found around high-metallicity stars, as in thesolar neighborhood, supporting the view that planets form more readily inmetal-rich environments.

1105.4176	the first detection of blue straggler stars in the milky way bulge	we report the first detections of blue straggler stars (bss) in the bulge ofthe milky way galaxy. proper motions from extensive space-based observationsalong a single sight-line allow us to separate a sufficiently clean andwell-characterized bulge sample that we are able to detect a small populationof bulge objects in the region of the color-magnitude diagram commonly occupiedyoung objects and blue strgglers. however, variability measurements of theseobjects clearly establish that a fraction of them are blue stragglers. out ofthe 42 objects found in this region of the color-magnitude diagram, we estimatethat at least 18 are genuine bss. we normalize the bss population by ourestimate of the number of horizontal branch stars in the bulge in order tocompare the bulge to other stellar systems. the bss fraction is clearlydiscrepant from that found in stellar clusters. the blue straggler populationof dwarf spheroidals remains a subject of debate; some authors claim ananticorrelation between the normalised blue straggler fraction and integratedlight. if this trend is real, then the bulge may extend it by three orders ofmagnitude in mass. conversely, we find that the genuinely young (~5gy oryounger) population in the bulge, must be at most 3.4% under the mostconservative scenario for the bss population.

1106.1205	discovery of cold, pristine gas possibly accreting onto an overdensity  of star-forming galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6	we report the discovery of large amounts of cold (t ~ 10^4 k), chemicallyyoung gas in an overdensity of galaxies at redshift z ~ 1.6 in the greatobservatories origins deep survey southern field (goods-s). the gas isidentified thanks to the ultra-strong mg ii absorption features it imprints inthe rest-frame uv spectra of galaxies in the background of the overdensity.there is no evidence that the optically-thick gas is part of any massive galaxy(i.e. m_star &gt; 4x10^9 m_sun), but rather is associated with the overdensity;less massive and fainter galaxies (25.5 &lt; z_850 &lt; 27.5 mag) have too large animpact parameter to be causing ultra-strong absorption systems, based on ourknowledge of such systems. the lack of corresponding fe ii absorption features,not detected even in co-added spectra, suggests that the gas is chemically morepristine than the ism and outflows of star-forming galaxies at similarredshift, including those in the overdensity itself, and comparable to the mostmetal-poor stars in the milky way halo. a crude estimate of the projectedcovering factor of the high-column density gas (n_h &gt;~ 10^20 cm-2) based on theobserved fraction of galaxies with ultra-strong absorbers is c_f ~ 0.04. abroad, continuum absorption profile extending to the red of the interstellar mgii absorption line by &lt;~ 2000 km/s is possibly detected in two independentco-added spectra of galaxies of the overdensity, consistent with a large-scaleinfall motion of the gas onto the overdensity and its galaxies. overall, thesefindings provides the first tentative evidence of accretion of cold, chemicallyyoung gas onto galaxies at high redshift, possibly feeding their star formationactivity. the fact that the galaxies are members of a large structure, asopposed to field galaxies, might play a significant role in our ability todetect the accreting gas.

1203.1221	the imf from low to high redshift	from time to time, and quite more frequently in recent years, claims appearfavoring a variable initial mass function (imf), one way or another, either intime or space. in this chapter we add our two pennies of wisdom, illustratinghow the imf affects various properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters. westart by showing that even relatively small variations of the imf slope havelarge effects on the demography of stellar populations, moving the bulk of thestellar mass from one end to the other of the distribution. we then point outhow the slope of the imf in different mass ranges controls specific majorproperties of galaxies and clusters. the slope of the imf below ~1 solar masscontrols the m/l ratio of local ellipticals, whereas the slope between ~1 and~1.4 solar masses controls the evolution with redshift of such ratio, hence ofthe fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. similarly, the slope between ~1and ~40 solar masses drives the ratio of the global metal mass in clusters ofgalaxies to their total luminosity. while we believe that it is perfectlylegitimate to entertain the notion that the imf may not be universal, ourmessage is that when proposing imf variations to ease a specific problem thenone should not neglect to explore the full consequences of the invokedvariations.  this paper is integrally reproduced from chapter 8 of the book by l. greggioand a. renzini: stellar populations. a user guide from low to high redshift(2011, wiley-vhc verlag-gmbh &amp; co., isbn 9783527409181), whose index is alsoappended.

1204.4727	shocked superwinds from the z~2 clumpy star-forming galaxy, zc406690	we have obtained high-resolution data of the z 2 ring-like, clumpystar-forming galaxy (sfg) zc406690 using the vlt/sinfoni with ao (in k-band)and in seeing-limited mode (in h- and j-band). our data includes all of themain strong optical emission lines: [oii], [oiii], ha, hb, [nii] and [sii]. wefind broad, blueshifted ha and [oiii] emission line wings in the spectra of thegalaxy's massive, star-forming clumps (sigma \sim 85 km s^-1) and even broaderwings (up to 70% of the total ha flux, with sigma \sim 290 km s^-1) in regionsspatially offset from the clumps by \sim 2 kpc. the broad emission likelyoriginates from large-scale outflows with mass outflow rates from individualclumps that are 1-8x the sfr of the clumps. based on emission line ratiodiagnostics ([nii]/ha and [sii]/ha) and photoionization and shock models, wefind that the emission from the clumps is due to a combination ofphotoionization from the star-forming regions and shocks generated in theoutflowing component, with 5-30% of the emission deriving from shocks. in termsof the ionization parameter (6x10^7-10^8 cm/s, based on both the sfr and theo32 ratio), density (local electron densities of 300-1800 cm^-3 in and aroundthe clumps, and ionized gas column densities of 1200-8000 msol/pc^2), and sfr(10-40 msol/yr), these clumps more closely resemble nuclear starburst regionsof local ulirgs and dwarf irregulars than hii regions in local galaxies.however, the star-forming clumps are not located in the nucleus as in localstarburst galaxies but instead are situated in a ring several kpc from thecenter of their high-redshift host galaxy, and have an overall disk-likemorphology. the two brightest clumps are quite different in terms of theirinternal properties, energetics and relative ages, and thus we are given aglimpse at two different stages in the formation and evolution of rapidlystar-forming giant clumps at high-z.

1207.6639	shards: an optical spectro-photometric survey of distant galaxies	(abridged) we present the survey for high-z absorption red and dead sources(shards), an eso/gtc large program carried out with gtc/osiris. shards is anultra-deep optical spectro-photometric survey of the goods-n field (130arcmin^2) at wavelengths 500 to 950 nm and using 24 contiguous medium-bandfilters (spectral resolution r 50). the data reach 26.5 mag (&gt;3-sigma level)with sub-arcsec seeing in all bands. shards main goal is obtaining accuratephysical properties of interm- and high-z galaxies using well-sampled opticalseds with sufficient spectral resolution to measure absorption and emissionfeatures. among the different populations of high-z galaxies, shards principaltargets are massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1. in this paper, we outline theobservational strategy and include a detailed discussion of the specialreduction and calibration procedures applied to the gtc/osiris data. we presentscience demonstration results about the detection and study of emission-linegalaxies (star-forming and agn) at z=0-5. we also analyze the seds for a sampleof 27 quiescent massive galaxies at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.4. we discuss on the improvementsintroduced by the shards dataset in the analysis of their sfh and stellarproperties. we discuss the systematics arising from the use of differentstellar population libraries. we find that the uv-to-mir seds of the massivequiescent galaxies at z=1.0-1.5 are well described by an exponential decayingsfh with scale tau=100-200 myr, age 1.5-2.0 gyr, solar or slightly sub-solarmetallicity, and moderate extinction, a(v)~0.5 mag. we also find that galaxieswith masses above m* are typically older than lighter galaxies, as expected ina downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. this trend is, however, modeldependent, i.e., it is significantly more evident in the results obtained withsome stellar population synthesis libraries and almost absent in others.

1211.6160	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: the nature of  dispersion dominated galaxies	we analyze the spectra, spatial distributions and kinematics of ha, [nii] and[sii] emission in a sample of 42, z~2.2 uv/optically selected star forminggalaxies (sfgs) from the sins &amp; zc-sinf surveys, 35 of which were observed inthe adaptive optics mode of sinfoni. this is supplemented by kinematic datafrom 48 z~1-2.5 galaxies from the literature. we find that the kinematicclassification of the high-z sfgs as `dispersion dominated' or `rotationdominated' correlates most strongly with their intrinsic sizes. smallergalaxies are more likely `dispersion-dominated' for two main reasons: 1) therotation velocity scales linearly with galaxy size but intrinsic velocitydispersion does not depend on size, and as such, their ratio is systematicallylower for smaller galaxies, and 2) beam smearing strongly decreases large-scalevelocity gradients and increases observed dispersion much more for galaxieswith sizes at or below the resolution. dispersion dominated sfgs may thus haveintrinsic properties similar to `rotation dominated' sfgs, but are primarilymore compact, lower mass, less metal enriched and may have higher gasfractions, plausibly because they represent an earlier evolutionary state.

1303.5059	gas-regulation of galaxies: the evolution of the cosmic ssfr, the  metallicity-mass-sfr relation and the stellar content of haloes	a very simple physical model of galaxies, in which the formation of stars isinstantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir, links togetherthree different aspects of the evolving galaxy population:(a) the cosmic timeevolution of the specific star-formation rate ssfr relative to the growth ofhaloes, (b) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and overcosmic time, and (c) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of haloes. ifthe sfr efficiency and wind mass loading are constant, the ssfr is set to thespecific accretion rate of the galaxy: more realistic situations lead to anssfr which is perturbed from this identity. the metallicity is set by theinstantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past historyof the system. the regulator system naturally produces a z(mstar, sfr)relation, with sfr as a second parameter in the mass-metallicity relation. thiswill be the same at all epochs unless the efficiency and mass-loading changewith time, naturally producing a so-called "fundamental metallicity relation".the observed z(mstar) relation of sdss galaxies implies a strong dependence ofstellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint end slopes of thestellar and halo mass-functions in standard {\lambda}cdm. it also boosts thessfr relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a differentdependence on mass, both of which are observed. the derived z(mstar, sfr)relation for the regulator system is fit to published z(mstar, sfr) data. thefitted efficiency is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletiontimescales in galaxies while the fitted mass-loading is also plausible. themodel also successfully reproduces the mass-metallicity relation ofstar-forming galaxies at z ~ 2.

1305.0583	hubble space telescope imaging of the binary nucleus of the planetary  nebula egb 6	egb 6 is an ancient, low-surface-brightness planetary nebula. the centralstar, also cataloged as pg 0950+139, is a very hot daoz white dwarf (wd) withan apparent m dwarf companion, unresolved from the ground but detectedinitially through excesses in the jhk bands. its kinematics indicatesmembership in the galactic disk population. inside of egb 6 is an extremelydense emission knot -- completely unexpected since significant mass loss fromthe wd should have ceased ~10^5 y ago. the electron density of the compactnebula is very high (2.2x10^6 cm^-3), as indicated by collisional de-excitationof forbidden emission lines. hubble space telescope imaging and grismspectroscopy are reported here. these resolve the wd and apparent dm companion-- at a separation of 0."166, or a projected 96(+204,-45) au at the estimateddistance of 576(+1224, -271) pc (using the v magnitude). much to our surprise,we found that the compact emission nebula is superposed on the dm companion,far from the photoionizing radiation of the wd. moreover, a a strikingmid-infrared excess has recently been reported in spitzer/irac and mips bands,best fit with two dust shells. the derived ratio l_ir/l_wd = 2.7 x 10^-4 is thelargest yet found for any wd or planetary nucleus. the compact nebula hasmaintained its high density for over three decades. we discuss two possibleexplanations for the origin and confinement of the compact nebula, neither ofwhich is completely satisfactory. this leaves the genesis and confinement ofthe compact nebula an astrophysical puzzle, yet similar examples appear in theliterature.

1305.3617	calibrating stellar population models with magellanic cloud star  clusters	stellar population models are commonly calculated using star clusters ascalibrators for those evolutionary stages that depend on free parameters.however, discrepancies exist among different models, even if similar sets ofcalibration clusters are used. with the aim of understanding thesediscrepancies, and of improving the calibration procedure, we consider a set of43 magellanic cloud (mc) clusters taking age and photometric information fromthe literature. we carefully assign ages to each cluster based on up-to-datedeterminations ensuring that these are as homogeneous as possible. to cope withstatistical fluctuations, we stack the clusters in five age bins deriving foreach of them integrated luminosities and colors. we find that clusters becomeabruptly red in optical and optical-ir colors as they age from ~0.6 to 1 gyr,which we interpret as due to the development of a well-populated thermallypulsing asymptotic giant branch (tp-agb). we argue that other studies missedthis detection because of coarser age binnings. maraston (2005; m05) andgirardi et al. (2010) models predict the presence of a populated tp-agb at ~0.6gyr, with a correspondingly very red integrated color, at variance with thedata; bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) and conroy et al. (2009) models run within theerror bars at all ages. the discrepancy between the synthetic colors of m05models and the average colors of mc clusters results from the now obsolete agescale adopted. finally, our finding that the tp-agb phase appears to developbetween ~0.6-1 gyr is dependent on the adopted age scale for the clusters andmay have important implications for stellar evolution.

1410.0681	the quenching of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in the reionization era	we present new constraints on the star formation histories of six ultra-faintdwarf galaxies: bootes i, canes venatici ii, coma berenices, hercules, leo iv,and ursa major i. our analysis employs a combination of high-precisionphotometry obtained with the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble spacetelescope, medium-resolution spectroscopy obtained with the deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph on the w.m. keck observatory, and updatedvictoria-regina isochrones tailored to the abundance patterns appropriate forthese galaxies. the data for five of these milky way satellites are best fit bya star formation history where at least 75% of the stars formed by z~10 (13.3gyr ago). all of the galaxies are consistent with 80% of the stars forming byz~6 (12.8 gyr ago) and 100% of the stars forming by z~3 (11.6 gyr ago). thesimilarly ancient populations of these galaxies support the hypothesis thatstar formation in the smallest dark matter sub-halos was suppressed by a globaloutside influence, such as the reionization of the universe.

1502.01027	an objective definition for the main sequence of star-forming galaxies	the main sequence (ms) of star-forming galaxies plays a fundamental role indriving galaxy evolution and in our efforts to understand it. however,different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope andshape of the ms. these discrepancies arise mainly from the different selectioncriteria adopted to isolate star-forming galaxies, that may include or excludegalaxies with specific star formation rate (sfr) substantially below the msvalue. to obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose anobjective definition of the ms that does not rely at all on a pre-selection ofstar-forming galaxies. constructing the 3d sfr-mass-number plot, the ms is thendefined as the ridge line of the star-forming peak, as illustrated with variousfigures. the advantages of such definition are manifold. if generally adoptedit will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups usingthe same star formation rate (sfr) and stellar mass diagnostics, or tohighlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. all this couldhelp understanding ms galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibriumand would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenchinggalaxies.

1503.06107	star formation and quenching among the most massive galaxies at z~1.7	we have conducted a detailed object-by-object study of a mass-complete(m*&gt;10^11 m_sun) sample of 56 galaxies at 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 2 in the goods-south field,showing that an accurate de-blending in mips/24um images is essential toproperly assign to each galaxy its own star formation rate (sfr), whereas anautomatic procedure often fails. this applies especially to galaxies with sfrsbelow the main sequence (ms) value, which may be in their quenching phase.after that, the sample splits evenly between galaxies forming stars within afactor of 4 of the ms rate (~45%), and sub-ms galaxies with sfrs ~10-1000 timessmaller (~55%). we did not find a well defined class of intermediate, transientobjects below the ms, suggesting that the conversion of a massive ms galaxyinto a quenched remnant may take a relatively short time (&lt;1 gyr), though alarger sample should be analyzed in the same way to set precise limits on thequenching timescale. x-ray detected agns represent a ~30% fraction of thesample, and are found among both star-forming and quenched galaxies. themorphological analysis revealed that ~50% of our massive objects arebulge-dominated, and almost all ms galaxies with a relevant bulge componenthost an agn. we also found sub-ms sfrs in many bulge-dominated systems,providing support to the notion that bulge growth, agn activity and quenchingof star formation are closely related to each other.

0805.1512	rates, progenitors and cosmic mix of type ia supernovae	following an episode of star formation, type ia supernova events occur overan extended period of time, following a distribution of delay times (ddt). wecritically discuss some empirically-based ddt functions that have been proposedin recent years, some favoring very early (prompt) events, other very late(tardy) ones, and therefore being mutually exclusive. we point out that in bothcases the derived ddt functions are affected by dubious assumptions, andtherefore there is currently no ground for claiming either a ddt stronglypeaked at early times, or at late ones. theoretical ddt functions are known toaccommodate both prompt as well as late snia events, and can account for allavailable observational constraints. recent observational evidence exists thatboth single degenerate and double degenerate precursors may be able ofproducing snia events. we then explore on the basis of plausible theoreticalmodels the possible variation with cosmic time of the mix between the eventsproduced by the two different channels, which in principle could lead tosystematics effects on the snia properties with redshift.

1507.04439	discovery of massive, mostly star-formation quenched galaxies with  extremely large lyman-alpha equivalent widths at z ~ 3	we report a discovery of 6 massive galaxies with both extremely large lyaequivalent width and evolved stellar population at z ~ 3. these massiveextremely strong lya emitting objects (maestlos) have been discovered in ourlarge-volume systematic survey for strong lya emitters (laes) with twelveoptical intermediate-band data taken with subaru/suprime-cam in the cosmosfield. based on the sed fitting analysis for these laes, it is found that thesemaestlos have (1) large rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0(lya) ~ 100--300 a,(2) m_star ~ 10^10.5--10^11.1 m_sun, and (3) relatively low specific starformation rates of sfr/m_star ~ 0.03--1 gyr^-1. three of the 6 maestlos haveextended ly$\alpha$ emission with a radius of several kpc although they showvery compact morphology in the hst/acs images, which correspond to therest-frame uv continuum. since the maestlos do not show any evidence for agns,the observed extended lya emission is likely to be caused by star formationprocess including the superwind activity. we suggest that this new class oflaes, maestlos, provides a missing link from star-forming to passively evolvinggalaxies at the peak era of the cosmic star-formation history.

astro-ph;0001312	wwhat heavy elements in clusters of galaxies tell about clusters and  galaxies	clusters of galaxies allow a direct estimate of the metallicity and metalproduction yield on the largest scale so far. the ratio of the total iron massin the icm to the total optical luminosity of the cluster (the ironmass-to-light-ratio) is the same for all clusters which icm is hotter than$\sim 2$ kev, and the elemental proportions (i.e. the [$\alpha$/fe] ratio)appear to be solar. the simplest interpretation of these evidences is that boththe imf as well the relative contributions of sn types are universal. currentlyavailable abundances in cooler clusters and groups are much more uncertain,possibly due to insufficiently accurate atomic physics data for multi-electronions, or to the icm being multi-phase, or to a combination thereof. thisuncertainty automatically extends to the reality of radial abundance gradientsso far reported in cool clusters. it is emphasized that most metals reside inthe icm rather than in galaxies, which demonstrates that energetic windsoperated early in the evolution of massive galaxies, the likely producers ofmost metals now in the icm. the icm metallicity is also used to set asemiempirical constraint of $\sim 0.1$ kev per particle to the icm {\itpreheating} due to supernova driven galactic winds. a lower limit of theuniverse global metallicity at $z=3$ is also mentioned.

astro-ph;0309067	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies in the great  observatories origins deep survey as a test of galaxy formation scenarios	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies is often used toattempt to discriminate between the classical view of galaxy formation, inwhich present-day luminous galaxies were assembled at early times and evolvedue to the passive aging of their stellar populations, and that of hierarchicalstructure formation, in which galaxies were assembled more recently via themerging of smaller objects. we carry out such a test here, by computing thedistribution of photometric redshifts of k_ab&lt;22 galaxies in the greatobservatories origins deep field survey goods southern field, and comparing theresults with predictions from a semi-analytic model based on hierarchicalstructure formation, and a classical `passive evolution' model. we find thatthe redshift distributions at z &lt;~ 1.5 of both the hierarchical and passivemodels are very similar to the observed one. at z&gt;~1.5, the hierarchical modelshows a deficit of galaxies, while the passive model predicts an excess. weinvestigate the nature of the observed galaxies in the redshift range where themodels diverge, and find that the majority have highly disturbed morphologies,suggesting that they may be merger-induced starbursts. while the hierarchicalmodel used here does not produce these objects in great enough numbers, theappearance of this population is clearly in better qualitative agreement withthe hierarchical picture than with the classical passive evolution scenario. weconclude that the observations support the general framework of hierarchicalformation, but suggest the need for new or modified physics in the models.

astro-ph;0402422	rr lyrae stars in the andromeda halo from deep imaging with the advanced  camera for surveys	we present a complete census of rr lyrae stars in a halo field of theandromeda galaxy. these deep observations, taken as part of a program tomeasure the star formation history in the halo, spanned a period of 41 dayswith sampling on a variety of time scales, enabling the identification of shortand long period variables. although the long period variables cannot be fullycharacterized within the time span of this program, the enormous advance insensitivity provided by the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble spacetelescope allows accurate characterization of the rr lyrae population in thisfield. we find 29 rrab stars with a mean period of 0.594 days, 25 rrc starswith a mean period of 0.316 days, and 1 rrd star with a fundamental period of0.473 days and a first overtone period of 0.353 days. these 55 rr lyrae starsimply a specific frequency s_rr=5.6, which is large given the high meanmetallicity of the halo, but not surprising given that these stars arise fromthe old, metal-poor tail of the distribution. this old population in theandromeda halo cannot be clearly placed into one of the oosterhoff types: theratio of rrc/rrabc stars is within the range seen in oosterhoff ii globularclusters, the mean rrab period is in the gap between oosterhoff types, and themean rrc period is in the range seen in oosterhoff i globular clusters. theperiods of these rr lyraes suggest a mean metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.6, whiletheir brightness implies a distance modulus to andromeda of 24.5+/-0.1, in goodagreement with the cepheid distance.

0808.4095	origin of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters and their  helium enrichment	the various scenarios proposed for the origin of the multiple,helium-enriched populations in massive globular clusters are criticallycompared to the relevant constraining observations. among accretion ofhelium-rich material by pre-existing stars, star formation out of ejecta frommassive agb stars or from fast rotating massive stars, and pollution bypopulation iii stars, only the agb option appears to be viable. accretion orstar formation out of outflowing disks would result in a spread of heliumabundances, thus failing to produce the distinct, chemically homogeneoussub-populations such as those in the clusters $\omega$ cen and ngc 2808.pollution by population iii stars would fail to produce sub-populationsselectively enriched in helium, but maintaining the same abundance of heavyelements. still, it is argued that for the agb option to work two conditionsshould be satisfied: i) agb stars experiencing the hot bottom burning process(i.e., those more massive than $\sim 3 \msun$) should rapidly eject theirenvelope upon arrival on the agb, thus experiencing just a few third dredge-upepisodes, and ii) clusters with multiple, helium enriched populations should bethe remnants of much more massive systems, such as nucleated dwarf galaxies, asindeed widely assumed.

astro-ph;0512001	deep photometry of andromeda reveals striking similarities in the tidal  stream and spheroid populations	we present a color-magnitude diagram (cmd) for a field in the giant tidalstream of the andromeda galaxy (m31). these observations, taken with theadvanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope, are 50% complete atv~30 mag, reaching 1 mag below the oldest main-sequence turnoff. strikingsimilarities between the stream and a previous spheroid cmd imply they havevery similar age and metallicity distributions, but present something of anenigma; we speculate on possible interpretations of this result, but note thatnone are without problems. distinct multiple turnoffs, as might be expectedfrom pulses of star formation caused by interaction with andromeda, are notapparent in the stream cmd. star formation in both fields lasted about 6billion years, building up to relatively high metallicities and being largelycomplete 6 billion years ago. the close similarity of the spheroid and streamsuggests that both may have derived from the same event; it would be worthexploring to what extent stars in these structures are the remnants of a diskgalaxy that interacted with m31, or even were disrupted from the m31 diskitself by the interaction.

astro-ph;0603479	stellar population diagnostics of elliptical galaxy formation	major progress has been achieved in recent years in mapping the properties ofpassively-evolving, early-type galaxies (etg) from the local universe all theway to redshift ~2. here, age and metallicity estimates for local cluster andfield etgs are reviewed as based on color-magnitude, color-sigma, andfundamental plane relations, as well as on spectral-line indices diagnostics.the results of applying the same tools at high redshifts are then discussed,and their consistency with the low-redshift results is assessed. most low- aswell as high-redshift (z~1) observations consistently indicate 1) a formationredshift z&gt;~3 for the bulk of stars in cluster etgs, with their counterparts inlow-density environments being on average ~1-2 gyr younger, i.e., formed atz&gt;~1.5-2, 2) the duration of the major star formation phase anticorrelates withgalaxy mass, and the oldest stellar populations are found in the most massivegalaxies. with increasing redshift there is evidence for a decrease in thenumber density of etgs, especially of the less massive ones, whereas existingdata appear to suggest that most of the most-massive etgs were already fullyassembled at z~1. beyond this redshift, the space density of etgs startsdropping significantly, and as etgs disappear, a population of massive,strongly clustered, starburst galaxies progressively becomes more and moreprominent, which makes them the likely progenitors to etgs.

astro-ph;0607637	the detailed star formation history in the spheroid, outer disk, and  tidal stream of the andromeda galaxy	using the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope, we haveobtained deep optical images reaching stars well below the oldest main sequenceturnoff in the spheroid, tidal stream, and outer disk of the andromeda galaxy.we have reconstructed the star formation history in these fields by comparingtheir color-magnitude diagrams to a grid of isochrones calibrated to galacticglobular clusters observed in the same bands. each field exhibits an extendedstar formation history, with many stars younger than 10 gyr but few youngerthan 4 gyr. considered together, the star counts, kinematics, and populationcharacteristics of the spheroid argue against some explanations for itsintermediate-age, metal-rich population, such as a significant contributionfrom stars residing in the disk or a chance intersection with the stream'sorbit. instead, it is likely that this population is intrinsic to the innerspheroid, whose highly-disturbed structure is clearly distinct from thepressure-supported metal-poor halo that dominates farther from the galaxy'scenter. the stream and spheroid populations are similar, but not identical,with the stream's mean age being ~1 gyr younger; this similarity suggests thatthe inner spheroid is largely polluted by material stripped from either thestream's progenitor or similar objects. the disk population is considerablyyounger and more metal-rich than the stream and spheroid populations, but notas young as the thin disk population of the solar neighborhood; instead, theouter disk of andromeda is dominated by stars of age 4 - 8 gyr, resembling themilky way's thick disk. the disk data are inconsistent with a populationdominated by ages older than 10 gyr, and in fact do not require any stars olderthan 10 gyr.

0809.1682	stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from deep hst acs/wfc  photometry	we present stellar proper motions in the galactic bulge from the sagittariuswindow eclipsing extrasolar search (sweeps) project using acs/wfc on hst.proper motions are extracted for more than 180,000 objects, with &gt;81,000measured to accuracy better than 0.3 mas/yr in both coordinates. we reportseveral results based on these measurements: 1. kinematic separation of bulgefrom disk allows a sample of &gt;15,000 bulge objects to be extracted based on&gt;6-sigma detections of proper motion, with &lt;0.2% contamination from the disk.this includes the first detection of a candidate bulge blue stragglerpopulation. 2. armed with a photometric distance modulus on a star by starbasis, and using the large number of stars with high-quality proper motionmeasurements to overcome intrinsic scatter, we dissect the kinematic propertiesof the bulge as a function of distance along the line of sight. this allows usto extract the stellar circular speed curve from proper motions alone, which wecompare with the circular speed curve obtained from radial velocities. 3. wetrace the variation of the {l,b} velocity ellipse as a function of depth. 4.finally, we use the density-weighted {l,b} proper motion ellipse produced fromthe tracer stars to assess the kinematic membership of the sixteen transitingplanet candidates discovered in the sagittarius window; the kinematicdistribution of the planet candidates is consistent with that of the disk andbulge stellar populations.

astro-ph;0610098	transiting extrasolar planetary candidates in the galactic bulge	more than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered around relativelynearby stars, primarily through the doppler line shifts owing to the reflexmotions of their host stars, and more recently through transits of some planetsacross the face of the host stars. the detection of planets with the shortestknown periods, 1.2 to 2.5 days, has mainly resulted from transit surveys whichhave generally targeted stars more massive than 0.75 m_sun. here we report theresults from a planetary transit search performed in a rich stellar fieldtowards the galactic bulge. we discovered 16 candidates with orbital periodsbetween 0.4 and 4.2 days, five of which orbit stars of 0.44 to 0.75 m_sun. intwo cases, radial-velocity measurements support the planetary nature of thecompanions. five candidates have orbital periods below 1.0 day, constituting anew class of ultra-short-period planets (uspps), which occur only around starsof less than 0.88 m_sun. this indicates that those orbiting very close to moreluminous stars might be evaporatively destroyed, or that jovian planets aroundlower-mass stars might migrate to smaller radii.

astro-ph;0702448	the extended star formation history of the andromeda spheroid at twenty  one kiloparsecs on the minor axis	using the hst acs, we have obtained deep optical images of a southeastminor-axis field in the andromeda galaxy, 21 kpc from the nucleus. in both starcounts and metallicity, this field represents a transition zone between themetal-rich, highly-disturbed inner spheroid that dominates within 15 kpc andthe metal-poor, diffuse population that dominates beyond 30 kpc. thecolor-magnitude diagram reaches well below the oldest main-sequence turnoff inthe population, allowing a reconstruction of the star formation history in thisfield. compared to the spheroid population at 11 kpc, the population at 21 kpcis ~1.3 gyr older and ~0.2 dex more metal-poor, on average. however, like thepopulation at 11 kpc, the population at 21 kpc exhibits an extended starformation history; one third of the stars are younger than 10 gyr, althoughonly a few percent are younger than 8 gyr. the relatively wide range ofmetallicity and age is inconsistent with a single, rapid star-formationepisode, and instead suggests that the spheroid even at 21 kpc is dominated bythe debris of earlier merging events likely occurring more than 8 gyr ago.

astro-ph;9604179	the white dwarf distance to the globular cluster ngc 6752 (and its age)  with the hubble space telescope (based on observations made with the nasa/esa  hubble space telescope (hst))	deep hubble space telescope (hst) observations with wfpc2 of the nearbyglobular cluster ngc 6752 have allowed us to obtain accurate photometry for thecluster white dwarfs (wd). a sample of local wds of known trigonometricparallax and mass close to that of the cluster wds have also been observed withwfpc2. matching the cluster and the local wd sequences provides a directmeasure of the distance to the cluster: $(m-m)_\circ=13.05$, with anuncertainty less than $\pm0.1$ mag which allows a substantial reduction in theuncertainty in the age of the cluster. indeed, coupling this value of thecluster distance to the cluster metallicity, helium abundance and$\alpha$-element enhancement [$\alpha$/fe]=0.5 yields an age of 15.5 gyr and14.5 gyr using evolutionary models that do not include or do include heliumdiffusion, respectively. the uncertainty affecting these age determinations is$\sim 10\%$. the majority of the cluster wds appear to be of the da variety,while the color-magnitude location of two wds is consistent with the db type.this suggests a cluster db/da ratio similar to that of wds in the solarneighborhood.

astro-ph;9609046	the iron discrepancy in elliptical galaxies after asca	we present estimates for the iron content of the stellar and diffusedcomponents of elliptical galaxies, as derived respectively from integratedoptical spectra and from asca x-ray observations. a macroscopic discrepancyemerges between the expected iron abundances in the hot interstellar medium(ism) and what is indicated by the x-ray observations, especially whenallowance is made for the current iron enrichment by type ia supernovae. thisstrong discrepancy, that in some extreme instances may be as large as a factorof $\sim 20$, calls into question our current understanding of supernovaenrichment and chemical evolution of galaxies. we discuss several astrophysicalimplications of the inferred low iron abundances in the ism, including thechemical evolution of galaxies and cluster of galaxies, the evolution of gasflows in ellipticals, and the heating of the intracluster medium. some of theconsequences appear hard to accept, and in the attempt to avoid some of thesedifficulties we explore ways of hiding or diluting iron in the ism ofellipticals. none of these possibilities appears astrophysically plausible, andwe alternatively rise the question of the reliability of iron-l linediagonostic tools. various thin plasma emission models are shown to give ironabundances that may differ significantly, especially at low temperatures ($kt\lsim 1$ kev). from a collection of asca and other x-ray observatory data, itis shown that current thin plasma codes tend to give very low iron abundanceswhen the temperature of the objects is below $\sim 1$ kev. we conclude that --besides rethinking the chemical evolution of galaxies -- one should alsoconsider the possibility that existing thin plasma models may incorporateinaccurate atomic physics for the ions responsible for the iron-l complex.

astro-ph;9705039	discovery of extended blue horizontal branches in two metal-rich  globular clusters	we have used wfpc2 to construct b, v color-magnitude diagrams of fourmetal-rich globular clusters, ngc 104 (47 tuc), ngc 5927, ngc 6388, and ngc6441. all four clusters have well populated red horizontal branches (rhb), asexpected for their metallicity. however, ngc 6388 and 6441 also exhibit aprominent blue hb (bhb) extension, including stars reaching as faint in v asthe turnoff luminosity. this discovery demonstrates directly for the first timethat a major population of hot hb stars can exist in old, metal-rich systems.this may have important implications for the interpretation of the integratedspectra of elliptical galaxies.  the cause of the phenomenon remains uncertain. we examine the possibilitythat ngc 6388 and 6441 are older than the other clusters, but a simpledifference in age may not be sufficient to produce the observed distributionsalong the hb. the high central densities in ngc 6388 and 6441 suggest that theexistence of the blue hb (bhb) tails might be caused by stellar interactions inthe dense cores of these clusters, which we calculate to have two of thehighest collision rates among globular clusters in the galaxy. tidal collisionsmight act in various ways to enhance loss of envelope mass, and thereforepopulate the blue side of the hb. however, the relative frequency of tidalcollisions does not seem large enough (compared to that of the clusters withpure rhbs) to account for such a drastic difference in hb morphology. while acombination of an age difference and dynamical interactions may help, primafacie the lack of a radial gradient in the bhb/rhb star ratio seems to argueagainst dynamical effects playing a role.

astro-ph;9706083	iron as a tracer in galaxy clusters and groups	available x-ray data are collected and organized concerning the iron and gascontent of galaxy clusters and groups, together with the optical luminosity,mass and iron abundance of cluster galaxies. several astrophysical inferencesare then drawn, including the evidence for rich clusters having evolved withoutmuch baryon exchange with their surrondings, and having experienced verysimilar star formation histories. groups are much gas-poor compared toclusters, and appear instead to have shed a major fraction of their originalcosmic share of baryons, which indicates that galaxy clusters cannot haveformed by assembling groups similar to the present day ones. it is argued thatthis favors low-$\omega$ universes, in which the growth of rich clusters isvirtually complete at high redshifts. it is also argued that elementalabundance ratios in clusters are nearly solar, which is consistent with asimilar proportion of supernovae of type ia and type ii having enriched boththe solar neghborhood as well clusters as a whole. much of the iron in clustersappears to reside in the intracluster medium rather than inside galaxies. itappears that the baryon to star conversion in clusters has been nearly asefficient as currently adopted for the universe as a whole. yet the metallicityof the clusters is $\sim 5$ times higher than the global metallicity adoptedfor the nearby universe. it is concluded that the intergalactic medium shouldhave a metallicity $\sim 1/3$ solar if stellar nucleosynthesis has proceeded instars within field galaxies with the same efficiency as in stars withinclusters of galaxies.

astro-ph;9802186	the stellar populations of pixels and frames	derived from first physical principles, a few simple rules are presented thatcan help in both the planning and interpretation of ccd and ir-array cameraobservations of resolvable stellar populations. these rules concern the overallsize of the population sampled by a frame as measured by its total luminosity,and allow to estimate the number of stars (in all evolutionary stages) that areincluded in the frame. the total luminosity sampled by each pixel (orresolution element) allows instead to estimate to which depth meaningfulstellar photometry can be safely attempted, and below which crowding makes itimpossible. simple relations give also the number of pixels (resolutionelements) in the frame that will contain an unresolved blend of two stars ofany kind. it is shown that the number of such blends increases quadraticallywith both the surface brightness of the target, as well as with the angularsize of the pixel (or resolution element). a series of examples are presentedillustrating how the rules are practically used in concrete observationalsituations. application of these tools to existing photometric data for theinner parts of the bulge of m31, m32 and ngc 147 indicates that no solidevidence has yet emerged for the presence of a significant intermediate agepopulation in these objects.

astro-ph;9810066	cluster vs. field elliptical galaxies and clues on their formation	using new observations for a sample of 931 early-type galaxies we investigatewhether the \mg2--\so relation shows any dependence on the local environment.the galaxies have been assigned to three different environments depending onthe local overdensity: clusters, groups, and field, having used ourcompleteredshift database to guide the assignment of galaxies. it is found thatcluster, group and field early-type galaxies follow almost identical \mg2--\so\relations, with the largest \mg2 zero-point difference (clusters minus field)being only $0.007\pm 0.002$ mag. no correlation of the residuals is found withthe morphological type or the bulge to disk ratio. using stellar populationmodels in a differential fashion, this small zero-point difference implies aluminosity-weighted age difference of only $\sim 1$ gyr between thecorresponding stellar populations, with field galaxies being younger. themass-weighted age difference could be significantly smaller, if minor events oflate star formation took place preferentially in field galaxies. we combinethese results with the existing evidence for the bulk of stars in clusterearly-type galaxies having formed at very high redshift, and conclude that thebulk of stars in galactic spheroids had to form at high redshifts ($z\gsim 3$),no matter whether such spheroids now reside in low or high density regions. thecosmological implications of these findings are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;9902361	chemical evolution on the scale of clusters of galaxies, and beyond	clusters of galaxies allow a direct estimate of the metallicity and metalproduction yield on the largest scale so far. the ratio of the total iron massin the icm to the total optical luminosity of the cluster (the ironmass-to-light-ratio) is the same for all clusters which icm is hotter than$\sim 2$ kev, and the elemental proportions (i.e. the [$\alpha$/fe] ratio)appear to be solar. from these evidences it is argued that both the imf as wellthe relative contributions of sn types are likely to be universal. constraintson the past sn activity in galaxy clusters are then derived, and support isgiven to the notion that the average snia rate was much higher in the past,i.e. at least 10 times more than currently observed in local ellopticals. it isalso argued that cluster metallicity ($\sim 1/3$ solar) should be taken asrepresentative of the low-z universe as a whole. there is now compellingevidence that the bulk of stars in cluster as well as in field ellipticals andbulges formed at high redshifts ($z\gsim 3$). since such stars account for atleast $\sim 30%$ of the baryons now locked into stars, it is argued that atleast 30% of stars and metals formed before $z\simeq 3$. as a consequence, themetallicity of the universe at z=3 is predicted to be $\sim 1/10$ solar. thisrequires the cosmic star formation rate to run at least flat from $z\sim 1$ to$\sim 5$, which appears to agree with the most recent derect determinations ofthe star formation rate in lyman-break galaxies.
