0903.3950	molecular hydrogen deficiency in hi-poor galaxies and its implications  for star formation	we use a sample of 47 homogeneous and high sensitivity co images taken fromthe nobeyama and bima surveys to demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, asignificant number (~40%) of hi-deficient nearby spiral galaxies are alsodepleted in molecular hydrogen. while hi-deficiency by itself is not asufficient condition for molecular gas depletion, we find that h2 reduction isassociated with the removal of hi inside the galaxy optical disk. thosehi-deficient galaxies with normal h2 content have lost hi mainly from outsidetheir optical disks, where the h2 content is low in all galaxies. this findingis consistent with theoretical models in which the molecular fraction in agalaxy is determined primarily by its gas column density. our result issupported by indirect evidence that molecular deficient galaxies form stars ata lower rate or have dimmer far infrared fluxes than gas rich galaxies, asexpected if the star formation rate is determined by the molecular hydrogencontent. our result is consistent with a scenario in which, when the atomic gascolumn density is lowered inside the optical disk below the critical valuerequired to form molecular hydrogen and stars, spirals become quiescent andpassive evolving systems. we speculate that this process would act on thetime-scale set by the gas depletion rate and might be a first step for thetransition between the blue and red sequence observed in the color-magnitudediagram.

0904.4725	wavelength accuracy of the keck hires spectrograph and measuring changes  in the fine structure constant	we report on an attempt to accurately wavelength calibrate four nights ofdata taken with the keck hires spectrograph on qso phl957, for the purpose ofdetermining whether the fine structure constant was different in the past.using new software and techniques, we measured the redshifts of various ni ii,fe ii, si ii, etc. lines in a damped ly-alpha system at z=2.309. roughly halfthe data was taken through the keck iodine cell which contains thousands ofwell calibrated iodine lines. using these iodine exposures to calibrate thenormal th-ar keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, anddrifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. these offsets correspond to anabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about delta z=10^{-5} (delta lambda= 0.02ang), with daily drifts of around delta z=5x10^{-6} (delta lambda =0.01 ang),and multiday drifts of nearly delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 ang). the causes of thewavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the finestructure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m/s, thislevel of systematic uncertainty makes may make it difficult to use keck hiresdata to constrain the change in the fine structure constant. using ourcalibrated data, we applied both our own fitting software and standard fittingsoftware to measure (delta alpha)/alpha, but discovered that we could obtainresults ranging from significant detection of either sign, to strong nulllimits, depending upon which sets of lines and which fitting method was used.we thus speculate that the discrepant results on (delta alpha)/alpha reportedin the literature may be due to random fluctuations coming from under-estimatedsystematic errors in wavelength calibration and fitting procedure.

0905.1042	metal-enriched plasma in protogalactic halos: a survey of n v absorption  in high-z damped &amp; sub-damped lyman-alpha systems	we continue our recent work to characterize the plasma content ofhigh-redshift damped and sub-damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas/sub-dlas), whichrepresent multi-phase gaseous (proto)galactic disks and halos seen toward abackground source. we survey n v absorption in a sample of 91 dlas and 18sub-dlas in the redshift range 1.67&lt;z&lt;4.28 with unblended coverage of the n vdoublet, using data from vlt/uves, keck/hires, and keck/esi. in dlas, we findeight secure n v detections, four marginal detections, and 79 non-detections.the detection rate of n v in dlas is therefore 13^{+5}_{-4}%. two sub-dla n vdetections are found among a sample of 18, at a similar detection rate of11^{+15}_{-7}%. we show that the n v detection rate is a strong function ofmetallicity, increasing by a factor of ~4 at [n/h]=[ni/hi]&gt;-2.3. the n v andciv component b-value distributions in dlas are statistically similar, but themedian b(n v) of 18 km/s is lower than the median b(o vi) of 25 km/s. some ~20%of the n v components have b&lt;10 km/s and thus arise in warm photoionized plasmaat log (t/k)&lt;4.92; local sources of ionizing radiation (as opposed to theextragalactic background) are required to keep the cloud sizes physicallyreasonable. the nature of the remaining ~80% of (broad) n v components isunclear; models of radiatively-cooling collisionally-ionized plasma atlog(t/k)=5.2-5.4 are fairly successful in reproducing the observed integratedhigh-ion column density ratios and the component line widths, but we cannotrule out photoionization by local sources. finally, we identify several unusualdlas with extremely low metallicity (&lt;0.01 solar) but strong high-ionabsorption [log n(n v)&gt;14 or log n(o vi)&gt;14.2] that present challenges toeither galactic inflow or outflow models.

0905.3768	casting light on the 'anomalous' statistics of mg ii absorbers toward  gamma-ray burst afterglows: the incidence of weak systems	we revisit echelle spectra (spectral resolution r ~ 40000) of 8 gamma-rayburst afterglows to obtain the incidence (dn/dz) of weak intervening mg iisystems at a mean redshift of &lt;z&gt; = 1.5. we show that dn/dz of systems havingrestframe equivalent widths 0.07 a &lt; w_r(mgii) &lt; 1 a toward grbs isstatistically consistent with the incidence toward qsos. our result is incontrast to the results for mg ii systems having w_r &gt; 1 a, where dn/dz towardgrbs has been found to be larger than toward qsos by a factor of ~ 4. weconfirm the overdensity albeit at a factor of ~ 3 only. this suggests that anyexplanation for the grb/qso discrepancy, be it intrinsic to the absorbers or aselection effect, should be inherent only to the galaxies that host strongabsorbers in the line-of-sight to grbs. we argue that, of all scenarios thathave been proposed, lensing amplification is the one that could explain thestrong mg ii enhancement while allowing for no significant enhancement in theweak absorbers.

0906.0983	on the absence of high metallicity-high column density damped lyman  alpha systems: molecule formation in a two-phase interstellar medium	we argue that the lack of observed damped lyman alpha (dla) systems thatsimultaneously have high hi columns densities and high metallicities resultsnaturally from the formation of molecules in the cold phase of a two-phaseatomic medium in pressure balance. our result applies equally well in diffusesystems where the ultraviolet radiation field is dominated by the extragalacticbackground and in dense star-forming ones, where the local radiation field islikely to be orders of magnitude higher. we point out that such aradiation-insensitive model is required to explain the absence of high column -high metallicity systems among dlas observed using gamma-ray burst afterglows,since these are likely subjected to strong radiation fields created by activestar formation in the grb host galaxy. moreover, we show that the observedrelationship between the maximum atomic gas column in dlas sets a firm upperlimit on the fraction of the mass in these systems that can be in the warm,diffuse phase. finally, we argue that our result explains the observed lack ofin situ star formation in dla systems.

0906.3347	the last eight-billion years of intergalactic civ evolution	we surveyed the hst uv spectra of 49 low-redshift quasars for z &lt; 1 civcandidates, relying solely on the characteristic wavelength separation of thedoublet. after consideration of the defining traits of civ doublets (e.g.,consistent line profiles, other associated transitions, etc.), we defined asample of 38 definite (group g = 1) and five likely (g = 2) doublets with restequivalent widths w_r for both lines detected at &gt;= 3 sigma. we conductedmonte-carlo completeness tests to measure the unblocked redshift (dz) andco-moving pathlength (dx) over which we were sensitive to civ doublets of arange of equivalent widths and column densities. the absorber line density of(g = 1+2) doublets is dn/dx = 4.1+0.7/-0.6 for log n(c^+3) &gt;= 13.2, and dn/dxhas not evolved significantly since z = 5. the best-fit power-law to the g = 1frequency distribution of column densities f(n(c^+3)) = k(n(c^+3)/n_0)^alpha_nhas coefficient k = (0.67+0.18/-0.16) x 10^-14 cm^2 and exponent alpha_n =-1.50+0.17/-0.19, where n_0 = 10^14 cm^-2. using the power-law model off(n(c^+3)), we measured the c^+3 mass density relative to the critical density:omega(c^+3) = (6.20+1.82/-1.52) x 10^-8 for 13 &lt;= log n(c^+3) &lt;= 15. this valueis a 2.8+/-0.7 increase in omega(c^+3) compared to the error-weighted mean fromseveral 1 &lt; z &lt; 5 surveys for civ absorbers. a simple linear regression toomega(c^+3) over the age of the universe indicates that omega(c^+3) has slowlybut steadily increased from z = 5 --&gt; 0, with domega(c^+3)/dt_age =(0.42+/-0.2) x 10^-8 gyr^-1.

0907.0231	galaxies probing galaxies: cool halo gas from a z = 0.47 post-starburst  galaxy	we study the cool gas around a galaxy at z = 0.4729 using keck/lrisspectroscopy of a bright (b = 21.7) background galaxy at z = 0.6942 at atransverse distance of 16.5/h_70 kpc. the background galaxy spectrum revealsstrong feii, mgii, mgi, and caii absorption at the redshift of the foregroundgalaxy, with a mgii 2796 rest equivalent width of 3.93 +/- 0.08 angstroms,indicative of a velocity width exceeding 400 km/s. because the backgroundgalaxy is large (&gt; 4/h_70 kpc), the high covering fraction of the absorbing gassuggests that it arises in a spatially extended complex of cool clouds withlarge velocity dispersion. spectroscopy of the massive (log m_*/m_sun = 11.15+/- 0.08) host galaxy reveals that it experienced a burst of star formationabout 1 gyr ago and that it harbors a weak agn. we discuss the possible originsof the cool gas in its halo, including multiphase cooling of hot halo gas, coldinflow, tidal interactions, and galactic winds. we conclude the absorbing gaswas most likely ejected or tidally stripped from the interstellar medium of thehost galaxy or its progenitors during the past starburst event. adopting thelatter interpretation, these results place one of only a few constraints on theradial extent of cool gas driven or stripped from a galaxy in the distantuniverse. future studies with integral field unit spectroscopy of spatiallyextended background galaxies will provide multiple sightlines throughforeground absorbers and permit analysis of the morphology and kinematics ofthe gas surrounding galaxies with a diverse set of properties and environments.

0907.1661	grb 090426: the environment of a rest-frame 0.35-second gamma-ray burst  at redshift z=2.609	we present the discovery of an absorption-line redshift of z = 2.609 for grb090426, establishing the first firm lower limit to a redshift for a gamma-rayburst with an observed duration of &lt;2 s. with a rest-frame burst duration oft_90z = 0.35 s and a detailed examination of the peak energy of the event, wesuggest that this is likely (at &gt;90% confidence) a member of the short/hardphenomenological class of grbs. from analysis of the optical-afterglow spectrumwe find that the burst originated along a very low hi column density sightline,with n_hi &lt; 3.2 x 10^19 cm^-2. our grb 090426 afterglow spectrum also appearsto have weaker low-ionisation absorption (si ii, c ii) than ~95% of previousafterglow spectra. finally, we also report the discovery of a blue, veryluminous, star-forming putative host galaxy (~2 l*) at a small angular offsetfrom the location of the optical afterglow. we consider the implications ofthis unique grb in the context of burst duration classification and ourunderstanding of grb progenitor scenarios.

0907.4392	an observational determination of the proton to electron mass ratio in  the early universe	in an effort to resolve the discrepancy between two measurements of thefundamental constant mu, the proton to electron mass ratio, at early times inthe universe we reanalyze the same data used in the earlier studies. ouranalysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption lines in archival vlt/uvesspectra of the damped lyman alpha systems in the qsos q0347-383 and q0405-443yields a combined measurement of a (delta mu)/mu value of (-7 +/- 8) x 10^{-6},consistent with no change in the value of mu over a time span of 11.5gigayears. here we define (delta mu) as (mu_z - mu_0) where mu_z is the valueof mu at a redshift of z and mu_0 is the present day value. our null result isconsistent with the recent measurements of king et al. 2009, (delta mu)/u =(2.6 +/- 3.0) x 10^{-6}, and inconsistent with the positive detection of achange in mu by reinhold et al. 2006. both of the previous studies and thisstudy are based on the same data but with differing analysis methods.improvements in the wavelength calibration over the uves pipeline calibrationis a key element in both of the null results. this leads to the conclusion thatthe fundamental constant mu is unchanged to an accuracy of 10^{-5} over thelast 80% of the age of the universe, well into the matter dominated epoch. thislimit provides constraints on models of dark energy that invoke rolling scalarfields and also limits the parameter space of super symmetric or string theorymodels of physics. new instruments, both planned and under construction, willprovide opportunities to greatly improve the accuracy of these measurements.

0908.3485	direct evidence of cold gas in dla 0812+32b	we present the first direct evidence for cold gas in a high redshift dlagalaxy. we measured several multiplets of weak neutral carbon (ci) transitionsin order to perform a curve of growth analysis. a delta chi-squared testconstrains the best fit doppler parameter, b = 0.33_{-0.04}^{+0.05} km/s, andlogn(ci) = 13.30 +- 0.2 cm^-2. this doppler parameter constrains the kinetictemperature of the gas to t &lt;= 78 k (t &lt;= 115 k, 2 sigma). we used theassociated ci fine structure lines to constrain the volume density of the gas,n(hi) ~ 40 - 200 cm^-3 (2 sigma), resulting in a lower limit on the cloud sizeof approximately 0.1 - 1 parsec. while it is difficult to determine themetallicity of the cold component, the absence of cr ii indicates that the coldcloud suffers a high level of dust depletion. additionally, the large amount oflyman and werner-band molecular hydrogen absorption (log n(h2)_{total} = 19.88cm^-2, f_{h_2} &gt;= 0.06) with an excitation temperature of t_{ex} = 46 k asdetermined by the rotational j = 0 and j = 1 states, is consistent with thepresence of cold gas. we propose that this cloud may be gravitationallyconfined and may represent a transition gas-phase from primarily neutral atomicgas, to a colder, denser molecular phase that will eventually host starformation.

0910.0009	a direct measurement of the igm opacity to hi ionizing photons	we present a new method to directly measure the opacity from hi lyman limit(ll) absorption k_ll along quasar sightlines by the intergalactic medium (igm).the approach analyzes the average (``stacked'') spectrum of an ensemble ofquasars at a common redshift to infer the mean free path (mfp) to ionizingradiation. we apply this technique to 1800 quasars at z=3.50-4.34 drawn fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss), giving the most precise measurements onk_ll at any redshift. from z=3.6 to 4.3, the opacity increases steadily asexpected and is well parameterized by mfp = (48.4 +/- 2.1) - (38.0 +/-5.3)*(z-3.6) h^-1 mpc (proper distance). the relatively high mfp valuesindicate that the incidence of systems which dominate k_ll evolves lessstrongly at z&gt;3 than that of the lya forest. we infer a mean free path threetimes higher than some previous estimates, a result which has importantimplications for the photo-ionization rate derived from the emissivity of starforming galaxies and quasars. finally, our analysis reveals a previouslyunreported, systematic bias in the sdss quasar sample related to the survey'scolor targeting criteria. this bias potentially affects all z~3 igm studiesusing the sdss database.

0912.0292	a definitive survey for lyman limit systems at z~3.5 with the sloan  digital sky survey	we perform a semi-automated survey for tau&gt;=2 lyman limit systems (llss) inquasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey, data release 7. from astarting sample of 2473 quasars with zem=3.6-4.4, we analyze 469 spectrameeting strict seletion criteria for a total redshift path dz=93.8 and identify192 intervening systems at z&gt;3.3. the incidence of tau&gt;=2 llss per unitredshift, l(z), is well described by a single-power law at these redshifts:l(z) = c_lls [(1+z)/(1+z_*)]^gamma, with z_*=3.7, c_lls = 1.9+/-0.2, and gamma= 5.2+/-1.5 (68% c.l.). these values are systematically lower than previousestimates (especially at z&lt;4) but are consistent with recent measurements ofthe mean free path to ionizing radiation. extrapolations of this power-law toz=0 are inconsistent with previous estimations of l(z) at z&lt;1 and suggest abreak at z~2, similar to that observed for the lya forest. our results alsoindicate that the systems giving rise to lls absorption decrease by ~50% incomoving number density and/or physical size from z=4 to 3.3, perhaps due to anenhanced extragalactic ultraviolet background. the observations place anintegral constraint on the hi frequency distribution f(n_hi,x) and indicatethat the power-law slope beta= dln[f(n,x)]/dln[n] is likely shallower than beta= -1 at n_hi=10^18 cm^-2. including other constraints on f(n_hi,x) from theliterature, we infer that beta is steeper than beta = -1.7 at n_hi~10^15 cm^-2,implying at least two inflections in f(n_hi,x). we also perform a survey forproximate llss (pllss) and find that l(z)_plls is systematically lower ~25%than intervening systems. finally, we estimate that systematic effects imposean uncertainty of 10-20% in the l(z) measurements; these effects may limit theprecision of all future surveys.

0912.0293	the keck+magellan survey for lyman limit absorption ii: a case study on  metallicity variations	we present an absorption line analysis of the lyman limit system (lls) atz=3.55 in our magellan/mike spectrum of pks2000-330. our analysis of the lymanlimit and full hi lyman series constrains the total hi column density of thells (n_hi = 10^[18.0 +/- 0.25] cm^{-2} for b_hi &gt;= 20 km/s) and also the n_hivalues of the velocity subsystems comprising the absorber. we measure ioniccolumn densities for metal-line transitions associated with the subsystems anduse these values to constrain the ionization state (&gt;90% ionized) and relativeabundances of the gas. we find an order of magnitude dispersion in themetallicities of the subsystems, marking the first detailed analysis ofmetallicity variations in an optically thick absorber. the results indicatethat metals are not well mixed within the gas surrounding high $z$ galaxies.assuming a single-phase photoionization model, we also derive an n_h-weightedmetallicity, &lt;[si/h]&gt; = -1.66 +/- 0.25, which matches the mean metallicity inthe neutral ism in high z damped lya systems (dlas). because the line densityof llss is ~10 times higher than the dlas, we propose that the former dominatethe metal mass-density at z~3 and that these metals reside in the galaxy/igminterface. considerations of a multi-phase model do not qualitatively changethese conclusions. finally, we comment on an anomalously large o^0/si^+ ratioin the lls that suggests an ionizing radiation field dominated by soft uvsources (e.g. a starburst galaxy). additional abundance analysis is performedon the super-lls systems at z=3.19.

1004.2715	the nature of proximate damped lyman alpha systems	we present high resolution echelle spectra of 7 proximate damped lyman alpha(pdla) systems whose relative velocity separation from the background quasar isdelta v &lt; 3000 km/s. combining our sample with a further 9 pdlas from theliterature we compare the chemical properties of the proximate systems with acontrol sample of intervening dlas. taken at face value, the sample of 16 pdlasexhibits a wide range of metallicities, ranging from z ~ 1/3 z_sun down to z ~1/1000 z_sun, including the dla with the lowest n(siii)/n(hi) yet reported inthe literature. we find several pieces of evidence that indicate enhancedionization and the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum in pdlas which lead toproperties that contrast with the intervening dlas, particularly when the n(hi)is low. the abundances of zn, si and s in pdlas with log n(hi) &gt; 21, whereionization corrections are minimized, are systematically higher than theintervening population by a factor of around 3. we also find possible evidencefor a higher fraction of nv absorbers amongst the pdlas, although thestatistics are still modest. 6/7 of our echelle sample show high ionizationspecies (siiv, civ, ovi or nv) offset by &gt;100 km/s from the main low ionabsorption. we analyse fine-structure transitions of cii* and siii* toconstrain the pdla distance from the qso. lower limits range from tens of kpcup to &gt;160 kpc for the most stringent limit. we conclude that (at least some)pdlas do exhibit different characteristics relative to the interveningpopulation out to 3000 km/s (and possibly beyond). nonetheless, the pdlasappear distinct from lower column density associated systems and the inferredqso-absorber separations mean they are unlikely to be associated with the qsohost. we speculate that the pdlas preferentially sample more massive galaxiesin more highly clustered regions of the high redshift universe.

1004.3347	galex far-uv color selection of uv-bright high-redshift quasars	we study the small population of z&gt;2.7 quasars detected by galex, whosefar-uv emission is not extinguished by intervening hi lyman limit systems.these quasars are of particular importance to detect intergalactic heiiabsorption along their sightlines. we correlate verified z&gt;2.7 quasars to thegalex gr4 source catalog, yielding 304 s/n&gt;3 sources. however, ~50% of theseare only detected in the galex nuv band, signaling the truncation of the fuvflux by low-redshift lyman limit systems. we exploit the galex uv color to cullthe most promising targets for follow-up studies, with blue (red) galex colorsindicating transparent (opaque) sightlines. monte carlo simulations indicate aheii detection rate of ~60% for quasars with fuv-nuv&lt;1 at z&lt;3.5, a ~50%increase over galex searches that do not include color information. we regard52 quasars detected at s/n&gt;3 to be most promising for hst follow-up, with anadditional 114 quasars if we consider s/n&gt;2 detections in the fuv. sdssprovides just half of the nuv-bright quasars that should have been detected bysdss &amp; galex. we revise the sdss quasar selection function, finding that sdsssystematically misses quasars with blue u-g&lt;2 colors at 3&lt;z&lt;3.5 due to overlapwith the stellar locus in color space. our color-dependent sdss selectionfunction naturally explains the inhomogeneous u-g color distribution of sdssquasars with redshift and the color difference between color-selected andradio-selected sdss quasars. moreover, it yields excellent agreement betweenthe observed and the predicted number of uv-bright sdss quasars. we confirm ourprevious claims that sdss preferentially selects 3&lt;z&lt;3.5 quasars withintervening hi lyman limit systems. our results imply that broadband opticalcolor surveys for 3&lt;z&lt;3.5 quasars have likely underestimated their spacedensity by selecting igm sightlines with an excess of strong hi absorbers.

1006.1364	directly imaging damped lyman-alpha galaxies at z&gt;2. i: methodology and  first results	we present the methodology for, and the first results from, a new imagingprogram aimed at identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of dampedlyman-alpha absorbers (dlas) at z&gt;2. we target quasar sightlines with multipleoptically-thick hi absorbers and use the higher-redshift system as a "blockingfilter" (via its lyman-limit absorption) to eliminate all far-ultraviolet (fuv)emission from the quasar. this allows us to directly image the rest-frame fuvcontinuum emission of the lower-redshift dla, without any quasar contaminationand with no bias towards large impact parameters. we introduce a formalismbased on galaxy number counts and bayesian statistics with which we quantifythe probability that a candidate is the dla host galaxy. this method will allowthe identification of a bona fide sample of dlas that are too faint to bespectroscopically confirmed. the same formalism can be adopted to the study ofother quasar absorption line systems (e.g. mgii absorbers). we have appliedthis imaging technique to two qso sightlines. for the z~2.69 dla towardsj073149+285449, a galaxy with impact parameter b=1.54"=11.89 kpc and impliedstar formation rate (sfr) of ~5 m/yr is identified as the most reliablecandidate. in the case of the z~2.92 dla towards j211444-005533, no likely hostis found down to a 3-sigma sfr limit of 1.4 m/yr. studying the hi columndensity as a function of the impact parameter, including 6 dlas with knownhosts from the literature, we find evidence that the observed hi distributionis more extended than what is generally predicted from numerical simulation.

1006.4119	keck esi observations of metal-poor damped lyman-{\alpha} systems	we present the first results from a survey of sdss quasars selected forstrong h i damped lyman-{\alpha} (dla) absorption with corresponding lowequivalent width absorption from strong low-ion transitions (e.g. c ii{\lambda}1334 and si ii {\lambda}1260). these metal-poor dla candidates wereselected from the sdss dr5 quasar spectroscopic database, and comprise a largenew sample for probing low metallicity galaxies. medium-resolution echellettespectra from the keck esi spectrograph for an initial sample of 35 systems wereobtained to explore the metal-poor tail of the dla distribution and toinvestigate the nucleosynthetic patterns at these metallicities. we haveestimated saturation corrections for the moderately under-resolved spectra, andsystems with very narrow doppler parameter (b \le 5 km s-1) will likely haveunderestimated abundances. for those systems with doppler parameters b &gt; 5 kms-1, we have measured low metallicity dla gas with [x/h] &lt; -2.4 for at leastone of c, o, si, or fe. assuming non-saturated components, we estimate thatseveral dla systems have [x/h] &lt; -2.8, including five dla systems with both lowequivalent widths and low metallicity in transitions of both c ii and o i. allof the measured dla metallicities, however, exceed or are consistent with ametallicity of at least 1/1000 of solar, regardless of the effects ofsaturation in our spectra. our results indicate that the metal-poor tail ofgalaxies at z \sim 3 drops exponentially at [x/h]&lt; -3. the observed ratio of[c/o] for values of [o/h] &lt; -2.5 exceeds values seen in moderate metallicitydla systems, and also exceeds theoretical nucleosynthesis predictions forhigher mass population iii stars.

1007.0014	ionization corrections in a multi-phase interstellar medium: lessons  from a z~2 sub-dla	we present a high resolution (fwhm=2.7 km/s), high s/n echelle spectrum forthe z = 2.26 qso j2123-0050 and determine elemental abundances for the z = 2.06sub-dla in its line of sight. this high redshift sub-dla has a complexkinematic structure and harbours detections of neutral (si, ci), singly (e.g.cii, sii) and multiply ionized (e.g. civ, siiv) species as well as molecular hand hd. the plethora of detected transitions in various ionization stages isindicative of a complex multi-phase structure present in this high redshiftgalaxy. we demonstrate that the ionization corrections in this sub-dla aresignificant (up to ~0.7 dex). for example, if no ionization correction isapplied, a super-solar metallicity is derived ([s/h] = +0.36), whereas a singlephase ionization correction reduces this to [s/h] = -0.19. the theoreticalimpact of a multi-phase medium is investigated through cloudy modelling and itis found that the abundances of si, s and fe are always over-estimated (by upto 0.15 dex in our experiments) if a single-phase is assumed. therefore,although cloudy models improve estimates of metal column densities, thesimplification of a single phase medium leaves a systematic error in theresult, so that even ionization-corrected abundances may still be too high.without ionization corrections the properties of this sub-dla appear to requireextreme scenarios of nucleosynthetic origins. after ionization corrections areapplied the ism of this galaxy appears to be similar to some of the sightlinesthrough the milky way.

1008.2383	what drives the expansion of giant hii regions?: a study of stellar  feedback in 30 doradus	observations show that star formation is an inefficient and slow process.this result can be attributed to the injection of energy and momentum by starsthat prevents free-fall collapse of molecular clouds. the mechanism of thisstellar feedback is debated theoretically: possible sources of pressure includethe classical warm hii gas, the hot gas generated by shock-heating from stellarwinds and supernovae, direct radiation of stars, and the dust-processedradiation field trapped inside the hii shell. in this paper, we measureobservationally the pressures associated with each component listed aboveacross the giant hii region 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud. weexploit high-resolution, multi-wavelengh images (radio, infrared, optical, andx-ray) to map these pressures as a function of position. we find that radiationpressure dominates within 75 pc of the central star cluster, r136, while thehii gas pressure dominates at larger radii. by contrast, the dust-processedradiation pressure and hot gas pressure are generally weak and not dynamicallyimportant, although the hot gas pressure may have played a more significantrole at early times. based on the low x-ray gas pressures, we demonstrate thatthe hot gas is only partially confined and must be leaking out the hii shell.additionally, we consider the implications of a dominant radiation pressure onthe early dynamics of 30 doradus.

1008.3397	low-ionization line emission from starburst galaxies: a new probe of  galactic-scale outflows	we study the kinematically narrow, low-ionization line emission from abright, starburst galaxy at z = 0.69 using slit spectroscopy obtained withkeck/lris. the spectrum reveals strong absorption in mgii and feii resonancetransitions with doppler shifts of -200 to -300 km/s, indicating a cool gasoutflow. emission in mgii near and redward of systemic velocity, in concertwith the observed absorption, yields a p cygni-like line profile similar tothose observed in the ly alpha transition in lyman break galaxies. further, themgii emission is spatially resolved, and extends significantly beyond theemission from stars and hii regions within the galaxy. assuming the emissionhas a simple, symmetric surface brightness profile, we find that the gasextends to distances &gt; ~7 kpc. we also detect several narrow feii*fine-structure lines in emission near the systemic velocity, arising fromenergy levels which are radiatively excited directly from the ground state. wesuggest that the mgii and feii* emission is generated by photon scattering inthe observed outflow, and emphasize that this emission is a generic predictionof outflows. these observations provide the first direct constraints on theminimum spatial extent and morphology of the wind from a distant galaxy.estimates of these parameters are crucial for understanding the impact ofoutflows in driving galaxy evolution.

1008.4676	understanding physical conditions in high redshift galaxies through c i  fine structure lines: data and methodology	we probe the physical conditions in high redshift galaxies, specifically, thedamped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) using neutral carbon (ci) fine structurelines and molecular hydrogen (h2). we report five new detections of ci andanalyze the ci in an additional 2 dlas with previously published data. we alsopresent one new detection of h2 in a dla. we present a new method of analysisthat simultaneously constrains \emph{both} the volume density and thetemperature of the gas, as opposed to previous studies that a priori assumed agas temperature. we use only the column density of ci measured in the finestructure states and the assumption of ionization equilibrium in order toconstrain the physical conditions in the gas. we present a sample of 11 civelocity components in 6 dlas and compare their properties to those derived bythe global cii* technique. the resulting median values for this sample are:&lt;n(hi)&gt; = 69 cm^{-3}, &lt;t&gt; = 50 k, and &lt;log(p/k)&gt; = 3.86 cm^{-3} k, withstandard deviations, sigma_{n(hi)} = 134 cm^{-3}, sigma_t = 52 k, andsigma_{log(p/k)} = 3.68 cm^{-3} k. this can be compared with the integratedmedian values for the same dlas : &lt;n(hi)&gt; = 2.8 cm^{-3}, &lt;t&gt; = 139 k, and&lt;log(p/k)&gt; = 2.57 cm^{-3} k, with standard deviations sigma_{n(hi)} = 3.0cm^{-3}, sigma_t = 43 k, and sigma_{log(p/k)} = 0.22 cm^{-3} k. interestingly,the pressures measured in these high redshift ci clouds are similar to thosefound in the milky way. we conclude that the ci gas is tracing ahigher-density, higher-pressure region, possibly indicative of post-shock gasor a photodissociation region on the edge of a molecular cloud. we speculatethat these clouds may be direct probes of the precursor sites of star formationin normal galaxies at high redshift.

1010.5244	metallicities and dust content of proximate damped lyman alpha systems  in the sloan digital sky survey	composite spectra of 85 proximate absorbers (log n(hi)&gt;20 and velocitydifference between the absorption and emission redshift, dv&lt;10,000 km/s) in thesdss are used to investigate the trends of metal line strengths with velocityseparation from the qso. we construct composites in 3 velocity bins: dv&lt;3000km/s, 3000&lt;dv&lt;6000 km/s and dv&gt;6000 km/s, with further sub-samples toinvestigate the metal line dependence on n(hi) and qso luminosity. low (e.g.siii and feii) and high ionization (e.g. siiv and civ) species alike haveequivalent widths (ews) that are larger by factors of 1.5 -- 3 in the dv&lt;3000km/s composite, compared to the dv&gt;6000 km/s spectrum. the ews show an evenstronger dependence on dv if only the highest neutral hydrogen column density(log n(hi)&gt;20.7) absorbers are considered. we conclude that pdlas generallyhave higher metallicities than intervening absorbers, with the enhancementbeing a function of both dv and n(hi). it is also found that absorbers nearqsos with lower rest-frame uv luminosities have significantly stronger metallines. we speculate that absorbers near to high luminosity qsos may have hadtheir star formation prematurely quenched. finally, we search for the signatureof dust reddening by the pdlas, based on an analysis of the qso continuumslopes relative to a control sample and determine a limit of e(b-v)&lt;0.014 foran smc extinction curve. this work provides an empirical motivation fordistinguishing between proximate and intervening dlas, and establishes aconnection between the qso environment and galaxy properties at high redshifts.

1011.0750	the last eight-billion years of intergalactic siiv evolution	we identified 24 siiv absorption systems with z &lt;~ 1 from a blind survey of49 low-redshift quasars with archival hubble space telescope ultravioletspectra. we relied solely on the characteristic wavelength separation of thedoublet to automatically detect candidates. after visual inspection, we defineda sample of 20 definite (group g = 1) and 4 "highly-likely" (g = 2) doubletswith rest equivalent widths w_r for both lines detected at &gt; 3 sigma. theabsorber line density of the g = 1 doublets was dn_siiv/dx = 1.4+0.4/-0.3 forlog n(si+3) &gt; 12.9. the best-fit power law to the g = 1 frequency distributionof column densities f(n(si+3)) had normalization k = (1.2+0.5/-0.4) x 10^-14cm2 and slope alpha = -1.6+0.3/-0.3. using the power-law model of f(n(si+3)),we measured the si+3 mass density relative to the critical density: omega(si+3)= (3.7+2.8/-1.7) x 10^-8 for 13 &lt; log n(si+3) &lt; 15. from monte carlo samplingof the distributions, we estimated our value to be a factor of 4.8+3.0/-1.9higher than the 2 &lt; z &lt; 4.5 &lt;omega(si+3)&gt;. from a simple linear fit toomega(si+3) over the age of the universe, we estimated a slow and steadyincrease from z = 5.5 --&gt; 0 with domega/dt_age = (0.61+/-0.23) x 10^-8 gyr^-1.we compared our ionic ratios n(si+3)/n(c+3) to a 2 &lt; z &lt; 4.5 sample andconcluded, from survival analysis, that the two populations are similar, withmedian &lt;n(si+3)/n(c+3)&gt; = 0.16.

1102.3444	simple models of metal-line absorption and emission from cool gas  outflows	we analyze the absorption and emission-line profiles produced by a set ofsimple, cool gas wind models motivated by galactic-scale outflow observations.we implement monte carlo radiative transfer techniques that track thepropagation of scattered and fluorescent photons to generate 1d spectra and 2dspectral images. we focus on the mgii 2796,28303 doublet and feii uv1 multipletat ~2600a, but the results are applicable to other transitions that traceoutflows (e.g. nai, lya, siii). by design, the resonance transitions showblue-shifted absorption but one also predicts strong resonance andfine-structure line-emission at roughly the systemic velocity. thisline-emission `fills-in' the absorption reducing the equivalent width by up to50%, shift the absorption-lin centroid by tens of km/s, and reduce theeffective opacity near systemic. analysis of cool gas outflows that ignoresthis line-emission may incorrectly infer that the gas is partially covered,measure asignificantly lower peak optical depth, and/or conclude that gas atsystemic velocity is absent. because the feii lines are connected byoptically-thin transitions to fine-structure levels, their profiles moreclosely reproduce the intrinsic opacity of the wind. together these resultsnaturally explain the absorption and emission-line characteristics observed forstar-forming galaxies at z&lt;1. we also study a scenario promoted to describe theoutflows of z~3 lyman break galaxies and find prfiles inconsistent with theobservations due to scattered photon emission. although line-emissioncomplicates the analysis of absorption-line profiles, the surface brightnessprofiles offer a unique means of assessing the morphology and size ofgalactic-scale winds. furthermore, the kinematics and line-ratios offerpowerful diagnostics of outflows, motivating deep, spatially-extendedspectroscopic observations.

1103.1890	probing the igm/galaxy connection iv: the lco/wfccd galaxy survey of 20  fields surrounding uv bright quasars	we publish the survey for galaxies in 20 fields containing ultraviolet brightquasars (with z_em 0.1 to 0.5) that can be used to study the associationbetween galaxies and absorption systems from the low-z intergalactic medium(igm). the survey is magnitude limited (r~19.5 mag) and highly complete out to10' from the quasar in each field. it was designed to detect dwarf galaxies (l~ 0.1 l*) at an impact parameter rho 1mpc (z=0.1) from a quasar. the completesample (all 20 fields) includes r-band photometry for 84718 sources andconfirmed redshifts for 2800 sources. this includes 1198 galaxies with 0.005 &lt;z &lt; (z_em - 0.01) at a median redshift of 0.18, which may associated with igmabsorption lines. all of the imaging was acquired with cameras on the swope 40"telescope and the spectra were obtained via slitmask observations using thewfccd spectrograph on the dupont 100" telescope at las campanas observatory(lco). this paper describes the data reduction, imaging analysis, photometry,and spectral analysis of the survey. we tabulate the principal measurements forall sources in each field and provide the spectroscopic dataset online.

1103.1891	probing the igm/galaxy connection v: on the origin of lya and ovi  absorption at z&lt;0.2	we analyze the association of galaxies to lya and ovi absorption, the mostcommonly detected transitions in the low-z intergalactic medium (igm), in thefields of 14 quasars with z_em = 0.06-0.57. confirming previous studies, weobserve a high covering fraction for lya absorption to impact parameter rho =300kpc: 33/37 of our l&gt;0.01l* galaxies show lya equivalent width w_lya&gt;50ma.galaxies of all luminosity l&gt;0.01l* and spectral type are surrounded by adiffuse and ionized circumgalactic medium (cgm), whose baryonic mass isestimated at ~10^(10.5 +/- 0.3) msun for a constant n_h. the virialized halosand extended cgm of present-day galaxies are responsible for most strong lyaabsorbers (w_lya &gt; 300ma) but cannot reproduce the majority of observed linesin the lya forest. we conclude that the majority of lya absorption withw_lya=30-300ma occurs in the cosmic web predicted by cosmological simulationsand estimate a characteristic width for these filaments of ~400kpc. regardingovi, we observe a near unity covering fraction to rho=200kpc for l&gt;0.1l*galaxies and to rho = 300kpc for sub-l* (0.1 l*&lt;l&lt;l*) galaxies. similar to ourlya results, stronger ovi systems (w_ovi &gt; 70ma) arise in the virialized halosof l&gt;0.1l* galaxies. unlike lya, the weaker ovi systems (w_ovi~30ma) arise inthe extended cgm of sub-l* galaxies. the majority of ovi gas observed in thelow-z igm is associated with a diffuse medium surrounding individual galaxieswith l~0.3l*, and rarely originates in the so-called warm-hot igm (whim)predicted by cosmological simulations.

1103.2130	absorption line systems in simulated galaxies fed by cold streams	hydro cosmological simulations reveal that massive galaxies at high redshiftare fed by long narrow streams of merging galaxies and a smoother component ofcold gas. we post-process seven high-resolution simulated galaxies withradiative transfer to study the absorption characteristics of the gas ingalaxies and streams, in comparison with the statistics of observedabsorption-line systems. we find that much of the stream gas is ionized by uvradiation from background and local stellar sources, but still optically thick(n_hi &gt; 10^17 cm^-2) so that the streams appear as lyman-limit systems (llss).at z&gt;3, the fraction of neutral gas in streams becomes non-negligible, givingrise to damped lyman-alpha (dla) absorbers as well. the gas in the central andincoming galaxies remains mostly neutral, responsible for dlas. within one(two) virial radii, the covering factor of optically thick gas is &lt;25% (10%)for llss and &lt;5% (1%) for dlas, slowly declining with time following theuniversal expansion. nevertheless, galaxies and their cold streams in thestudied mass range, m_vir = 10^10 - 10^12 msun, account for &gt;30% of theobserved absorbers in the foreground of quasars, the rest possibly arising fromsmaller galaxies or the intergalactic medium. the mean metallicity in thestreams is ~1% solar, much lower than in the galaxies. the simulated galaxiesreproduce the lyalpha-absorption equivalent widths observed around lyman-breakgalaxies, but they severely underpredict the equivalent widths in metal lines,suggesting that the latter may arise from outflows. we conclude that theobserved metal-poor llss are likely detections of the predicted cold streams.revised analysis of the observed llss kinematics and simulations with moremassive outflows in conjunction with the inflows may enable a clearerdistinction between the signatures of the various gas modes.

1103.4134	shining light on merging galaxies i: the ongoing merger of a quasar with  a `green valley' galaxy	serendipitous observations of a pair z = 0.37 interacting galaxies (onehosting a quasar) show a massive gaseous bridge of material connecting the twoobjects. this bridge is photoionized by the quasar (qso) revealing gas alongthe entire projected 38 kpc sightline connecting the two galaxies. the emissionlines that result give an unprecedented opportunity to study the merger processat this redshift. we determine the kinematics, ionization parameter (log u ~-2.5 +- 0.03), column density (n_h ~ 10^{21} cm^{-2}), metallicity ([m/h] ~-0.20 +- 0.15), and mass (~ 10^8 msun) of the gaseous bridge. we simultaneouslyconstrain properties of the qso-host (m_dm&gt;8.8x 10^{11} msun) and its companiongalaxy (m_dm&gt;2.1 x 10^{11} msun; m_star ~ 2 x 10^{10} msun; stellar burstage=300-800 myr; sfr~6 msun/yr; and metallicity 12+log (o/h)= 8.64 +- 0.2). thegeneral properties of this system match the standard paradigm of agalaxy-galaxy merger caught between first and second passage while one of thegalaxies hosts an active quasar. the companion galaxy lies in the so-called`green valley', with a stellar population consistent with a recent starbursttriggered during the first passage of the merger and has no detectable agnactivity. in addition to providing case-studies of quasars associated withgalaxy mergers, quasar/galaxy pairs with qso-photoionized tidal bridges such asthis one offer unique insights into the galaxy properties while alsodistinguishing an important and inadequately understood phase of galaxyevolution.

1103.4167	spectral polarization of the redshifted 21 cm absorption line toward 3c  286	a re-analysis of the stokes-parameter spectra obtained of the z=0.692 21 cmabsorption line toward 3c 286 shows that our original claimed detection ofzeeman splitting by a line-of-sight magnetic field, b_los = 87 microgauss isincorrect. because of an insidious software error, what we reported as stokes vis actually stokes u: the revised stokes v spectrum indicates a 3-sigma upperlimit of b_los &lt; 17 microgauss. the correct analysis reveals an absorptionfeature in fractional polarization that is offset in velocity from the stokes ispectrum by -1.9 km/s. the polarization position-angle spectrum shows a dipthat is also significantly offset from the stokes i feature, but at a velocitythat differs slightly from the absorption feature in fractional polarization.we model the absorption feature with 3 velocity components against the core-jetstructure of 3c 286. our chisquare minimization fitting results in componentswith differing (1) ratios of h i column density to spin temperature, (2)velocity centroids, and (3) velocity dispersions. the change in polarizationposition angle with frequency implies incomplete coverage of the background jetsource by the absorber. it also implies a spatial variation of the polarizationposition angle across the jet source, which is observed at frequencies higherthan the 839.4 mhz absorption frequency. the multi-component structure of thegas is best understood in terms of components with spatial scales of ~100 pccomprised of hundreds of low-temperature (t &lt; 200 k) clouds with lineardimensions of about 1 pc.

1103.5752	the end of helium reionization at z~2.7 inferred from cosmic variance in  hst/cos heii lyman alpha absorption spectra	we report on the detection of strongly varying intergalactic heii absorptionin hst/cos spectra of two z~3 quasars. from our homogeneous analysis of theheii absorption in these and three archival sightlines, we find a markedincrease in the mean heii effective optical depth from tau~1 at z~2.3 to tau&gt;5at z~3.2, but with a large scatter of 2&lt; tau &lt;5 at 2.7&lt; z &lt;3 on scales of ~10proper mpc. this scatter is primarily due to fluctuations in the heii fractionand the heii-ionizing background, rather than density variations that areprobed by the co-eval hi forest. semianalytic models of heii absorption requirea strong decrease in the heii-ionizing background to explain the strongincrease of the absorption at z&gt;2.7, probably indicating heii reionization wasincomplete at z&gt;2.7. likewise, recent three-dimensional numerical simulationsof heii reionization qualitatively agree with the observed trend only if heiireionization completes at z=2.7 or even below, as suggested by a large tau&gt;3 intwo of our five sightlines at z&lt;2.8. by doubling the sample size at 2.7&lt; z &lt;3,our newly discovered heii sightlines for the first time probe the diversity ofthe second epoch of reionization when helium became fully ionized.

1110.0837	the direct detection of cool, metal-enriched gas accretion onto galaxies  at z ~ 0.5	we report on the discovery of cool gas inflow toward six star-forminggalaxies with redshifts z ~ 0.35 - 1. analysis of mgii and feii resonance-lineabsorption in keck/lris spectroscopy of this sample reveals velocity shifts of80 - 200 km/s and equivalent widths for inflowing gas of &gt;~ 0.6 ang in five ofthe six objects. the host galaxies exhibit a wide range in star formation rates(sfr ~ 1 - 40 m_sun/yr) and have stellar masses similar to that of the milkyway (log m_*/m_sun ~ 9.6 - 10.5). imaging from the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys indicates that five of the six galaxies have highlyinclined (i &gt; 55 deg), disk-like morphologies. these data represent the firstunambiguous detection of inflow into isolated, star-forming galaxies in thedistant universe. we suggest that the inflow is due to the infall of enrichedmaterial from dwarf satellites and/or a galactic fountain within the galaxies.assuming that the material has been enriched to 0.1z_sun and has a physicalextent approximately equal to that of the galaxies, we infer mass inflow ratesof dm_in/dt &gt;~ 0.2 - 3 m_sun/yr for four of these systems. finally, fromcomparison of these absorption lines to the profiles of mgii and feiiabsorption in a larger spectroscopic sample of ~100 objects, we measure acovering fraction of cool inflow of at least 6%, but cannot rule out thepresence of enriched infall onto as many as ~40 of these galaxies.

1112.1698	magicc haloes: confronting simulations with observations of the  circumgalactic medium at z=0	we explore the circumgalactic medium (cgm) of two simulated star-forminggalaxies with luminosities l ~ 0.1 and 1 l* generated using the smooth particlehydrodynamic code gasoline. these simulations are part of the making galaxiesin a cosmological context (magicc) program in which the stellar feedback istuned to match the stellar mass-halo mass relationship. for comparison, eachgalaxy was also simulated using a 'lower feedback' (lf) model which hasstrength comparable to other implementations in the literature. the 'magiccfeedback' (mf) model has a higher incidence of massive stars and anapproximately two times higher energy input per supernova. apart from thelow-mass halo using lf, each galaxy exhibits a metal-enriched cgm that extendsto approximately the virial radius. a significant fraction of this gas has beenheated in supernova explosions in the disc and subsequently ejected into thecgm where it is predicted to give rise to substantial o vi absorption. thesimulations do not yet address the question of what happens to the o vi whenthe galaxies stop forming stars. our models also predict a reservoir of cool hi clouds that show strong ly\alpha absorption to several hundred kpc. comparingthese models to recent surveys with the hubble space telescope, we find thatonly the mf models have sufficient o vi and h i gas in the cgm to reproduce theobserved distributions. in separate analyses, these same mf models also showbetter agreement with other galaxy observables (e.g. rotation curves, surfacebrightness profiles and h i gas distribution). we infer that the cgm is thedominant reservoir of baryons for galaxy haloes.

(2009) andplace constraints on the evolution of lambda_mfp with redshift, including anestimate of the "breakthrough" redshift of z = 1.6. consistent with results athigher z, we find that a significant fraction of the opacity for absorption ofionizing photons comes from systems with n_hi &lt;= 10^{17.5} cm^(-2) with a valuefor the total lyman opacity of tau_lyman = 0.40 +/- 0.15. finally, we determinethat at minimum, a 5-parameter (4 power-law) model is needed to describe thecolumn density distribution function f(n_hi, x) at z \sim 2.4, find thatf(n_hi,x) undergoes no significant change in shape between z \sim 2.4 and z\sim 3.7, and provide our best fit model for f(n_hi,x).

1205.0270	the circumgalactic medium of massive galaxies at z~3: a test for stellar  feedback, galactic outflows, and cold streams	we present new results on the kinematics, thermal and ionization state, andspatial distribution of metal-enriched gas in the circumgalactic medium (cgm)of massive galaxies at redshift 3, using the "eris" suite of cosmological"zoom-in" simulations. the reference run adopts a blastwave scheme forsupernova feedback that produces galactic outflows, a star formation recipebased on a high gas density threshold, metal-dependent radiative cooling, and amodel for the diffusion of metals and thermal energy. synthetic spectra throughthe multiphase cgm produce interstellar absorption line strengths of lya, cii,civ, siii, and siiv as a function of galactocentric impact parameter (scaled tothe virial radius) that are in broad agreement with those observed athigh-redshift by steidel et al. (2010). only about one third of all the gaswithin r_vir is outflowing. the fraction of sightlines within one virial radiusthat intercept optically thick material is 27%, in agreement with recentobservations by rudie et al. (2012). such optically thick absorption is shownto trace inflowing "cold" streams that penetrate deep inside the virial radius.the streams, enriched to metallicities above 0.01 solar, give origin to strong(log n &gt; 13) cii absorption with a covering factor of 22% within r_vir and 10%within 2 r_vir. galactic outflows do not cause any substantial suppression ofthe cold accretion mode. the central galaxy is surrounded by a large ovi halo,with a typical column density log n&gt;14 and a near unity covering factormaintained all the way out to 150 kpc. this matches the trends recentlyobserved in star-forming galaxies at low redshift by tumlinson et al. (2011).our zoom-in simulations of this single system appear to reproducequantitatively the complex baryonic processes that determine the exchange ofmatter, energy, and metals between galaxies and their surroundings.

1205.5047	metallicity evolution of damped lyman-alpha systems out to z~5	we present chemical abundance measurements for 47 damped lyman-alpha systems(dlas), 30 at z&gt;4, observed with the echellette spectrograph and imager and thehigh resolution echelle spectrometer on the keck telescopes. hi columndensities of the dlas are measured with voigt profile fits to the lyman-alphaprofiles, and we find an increased number of false dla identifications withsdss at z&gt;4 due to the increased density of the lyman-alpha forest. ioniccolumn densities are determined using the apparent optical depth method, and wecombine our new metallicity measurements with 195 from previous surveys todetermine the evolution of the cosmic metallicity of neutral gas. we find themetallicity of dlas decreases with increasing redshift, improving thesignificance of the trend and extending it to higher redshifts, with a linearfit of -0.22+-0.03 dex per unit redshift from z=0.09-5.06. the metallicity'floor' of ~1/600 solar continues out to z~5, despite our sensitivity forfinding dlas with much lower metallicities. however, this floor is notstatistically different from a steep tail to the distribution. we also findthat the intrinsic scatter of metallicity among dlas of ~0.5 dex continues outto z~5. in addition, the metallicity distribution and the alpha/fe ratios ofz&gt;2 dlas are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population withthose of halo stars. it is therefore possible that the halo stars in the milkyway formed out of gas that commonly exhibits dla absorption at z&gt;2.

1205.6206	a search of co emission lines in blazars: the low molecular gas content  of bl lac objects compared to quasars	bl lacertae (lac) objects that are detected at very-high energies (vhe) areof fundamental importance to study multiple astrophysical processes, includingthe physics of jets, the properties of the extragalactic background light andthe strength of the intergalactic magnetic field. unfortunately, since mostblazars have featureless optical spectra that preclude a redshiftdetermination, a substantial fraction of these vhe extragalactic sources cannotbe used for cosmological studies. to assess whether molecular lines are aviable way to establish distances, we have undertaken a pilot program at theiram 30m telescope to search for co lines in three bl lac objects with knownredshifts. we report a positive detection of m_h2 ~ 3x10^8 msun toward 1es1959+650, but due to the poor quality of the baseline, this value is affectedby a large systematic uncertainty. for the remaining two sources, w comae andrgb j0710+591, we derive 3sigma upper limits at, respectively, m_h2 &lt; 8.0x10^8msun and m_h2 &lt; 1.6x10^9 msun, assuming a line width of 150 km/s and a standardconversion factor alpha=4 m_sun/(k km/s pc^2). if these low molecular gasmasses are typical for blazars, blind redshift searches in molecular lines arecurrently unfeasible. however, deep observations are still a promising way toobtain precise redshifts for sources whose approximate distances are known viaindirect methods. our observations further reveal a deficiency of molecular gasin bl lac objects compared to quasars, suggesting that the host galaxies ofthese two types of active galactic nuclei (agn) are not drawn from the sameparent population. future observations are needed to assess whether thisdiscrepancy is statistically significant, but our pilot program shows howstudies of the interstellar medium in agn can provide key information toexplore the connection between the active nuclei and the host galaxies.

1208.2584	a refined measurement of the mean transmitted flux in the ly-alpha  forest over 2 &lt; z &lt; 5 using composite quasar spectra	we present new measurements of the mean transmitted flux in the ly-alphaforest over 2 &lt; z &lt; 5 made using 6065 quasar spectra from the sloan digital skysurvey dr7. we exploit the general lack of evolution in the mean quasarcontinuum to avoid the bias introduced by continuum fitting over the ly-alphaforest at high redshifts, which has been the primary systematic uncertainty inprevious measurements of the mean ly-alpha transmission. the individual spectraare first combined into twenty-six composites with mean redshifts spanning 2.25&lt; z_comp &lt; 5.08. the flux ratios of separate composites at the same restwavelength are then used, without continuum fitting, to infer the meantransmitted flux, f(z), as a fraction of its value at z~2. absolute values forf(z) are found by scaling our relative values to measurements made fromhigh-resolution data by faucher-giguere et al. (2008) at z &lt; 2.5, wherecontinuum uncertainties are minimal. we find that f(z) evolves smoothly withredshift, with no evidence of a previously reported feature at z~3.2. thistrend is consistent with a gradual evolution of the ionization and thermalstate of the intergalactic medium over 2 &lt; z &lt; 5. our results generally agreewith the most careful measurements to date made from high-resolution data, butoffer much greater precision and extend to higher redshifts. this work alsoimproves upon previous efforts using sdss spectra by significantly reducing thelevel of systematic error.

1209.5442	not dead yet: cool circumgalactic gas in the halos of early type  galaxies	we report new observations of circumgalactic gas in the halos of early typegalaxies obtained by the cos-halos survey with the cosmic origins spectrographonboard the hubble space telescope. we find that detections of hi surroundingearly type galaxies are typically as common and strong as around star-forminggalaxies, implying that the total mass of circumgalactic material is comparablein the two populations. for early type galaxies, the covering fraction for hiabsorption above 10^16 cm^2 is ~40-50% within ~150 kpc. line widths andkinematics of the detected material show it to be cold (t ~&lt; 10^5 k) incomparison to the virial temperature of the host halos. the implied masses ofcool, photoionized cgm baryons may be up to 10^9 --- 10^11 msun. contrary tosome theoretical expectations, strong halo hi absorbers do not disappear aspart of the quenching of star-formation. even passive galaxies retainsignificant reservoirs of halo baryons which could replenish the interstellargas reservoir and eventually form stars. this halo gas may feed the diffuse andmolecular gas that is frequently observed inside etgs.

1211.6131	a substantial mass of cool, metal-enriched gas surrounding the  progenitors of modern-day ellipticals	the hosts of luminous z~2 quasars evolve into today's massive ellipticalgalaxies. current theories predict that the circum-galactic medium (cgm) ofthese massive, dark-matter halos (m~10^12.5 msun) should be dominated by at~10^7 k virialized plasma. we test this hypothesis with observations of 74close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background qso tocharacterize the cgm of the foreground one. surprisingly, our measurementsreveal a cool (t~10^4 k), massive (m_cgm &gt; 10^10 msun), and metal-enriched (z &gt;~0.1 zsun) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (r_vir = 160kpc). the average equivalent widths of hi lya (&lt;w_lya&gt; = 2.1 pm 0.15ang forimpact parameters r&lt;200 kpc) and cii 1334 (&lt;w_1334&gt; = 0.7 pm 0.1ang) exceed thecorresponding cgm measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populationsstudied previously. furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar cgmhas a 64% covering fraction of optically thick gas (n_hi&gt;10^17.2) within r_vir;this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous lyman break galaxypopulation. this unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected"down-the-barrel" to quasars, and hence it is likely that our backgroundsightlines intercept gas which is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiationby the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of agn unification.because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups andclusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichmenthistory of the intragroup/intracluster medium.

1212.0558	the cos-halos survey: an empirical description of the metal-line  absorption in the low-redshift circumgalactic medium	we present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low andintermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium (cgm) surrounding44 low-z, l ~ l* galaxies drawn from the cos-halos survey. these measurementsare derived from far-uv transitions observed in hst/cos and keck/hires spectraof background quasars within an impact parameter r &lt; 160 kpc to the targetedgalaxies. the data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurance of a cool(t ~ 10^{4 - 5} k), metal-enriched cgm. the detection rates and columndensities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impactparameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profilefor the cgm. a comparison of the relative column densities of adjacentionization states indicates the gas is predominantly ionized. the large surfacedensity in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool cgm(very conservatively, m_ cgmcool &gt; 10^9 msun), which likely traces a distinctdensity and/or temperature regime from the highly-ionized cgm traced by oviabsorption. the large dispersion in absorption strengths (includingnon-detections) suggests the cool cgm traces a wide range of densities or a mixof local ionizing conditions. lastly, the kinematics inferred from themetal-line profiles are consistent with the cool cgm being bound to the darkmatters halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for futurestar-formation. future work will leverage this dataset to provide estimates onthe mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool cgm in low-z, l*galaxies.

1303.2708	quasars probing quasars iv: joint constraints on the circumgalactic  medium from absorption and emission	we have constructed a sample of 29 close projected quasar pairs where thebackground quasar spectrum reveals absorption from optically thick hi gasassociated with the foreground quasar. these unique sightlines allow us tostudy the quasar circumgalactic medium (cgm) in absorption and emissionsimultaneously, because the background quasar pinpoints large concentrations ofgas where ly-a emission, resulting from quasar-powered fluorescence, resonantly-a scattering, and/or cooling radiation, is expected. a sensitiveslit-spectroscopic search (1-sigma limits of sb_lya ~= 3e-18erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2) for diffuse ly-a emission in the environments of theforeground quasars is conducted. we fail to detect large-scale ~ 100 kpc ly-aemission, either at the location of the optically thick absorbers or in theforeground quasar halos, in all cases except a single system. we interpretthese non-detections as evidence that the gas detected in absorption isshadowed from the quasar uv radiation due to obscuration effects, which arefrequently invoked in unified models of agn. small-scale r_perp &lt;~ 50 kpcextended ly-a nebulosities are detected in 34% of our sample, which are likelythe high-redshift analogs of the extended emission-line regions commonlyobserved around low-redshift (z &lt; 0.5) quasars. we also detect a compact highrest-frame equivalent width (w_lya &gt; 50 a) ly-alpha-emitter with luminosityl_lya =2.1+-0.32e41 erg/s at small impact parameter r_perp=134 kpc from oneforeground quasar, and argue that it is more likely to result fromquasar-powered fluorescence, than simply be a star-forming galaxy clusteredaround the quasar. our observations imply that much deeper integrations withupcoming integral-field spectrometers such as muse and kcwi will be able toroutinely detect a diffuse ly-a glow around bright quasars on scales r ~ 100kpc and thus directly image the cgm.

1303.7239	the fundamental plane of damped lyman alpha systems	using a sample of 100 h i - selected damped lyman alpha (dla) systems,observed with the high resolution echelle spectrometer on the keck i telescope,we present evidence that the scatter in the well-studied correlation betweenthe redshift and metallicity of a dla is largely due to the existence of amass-metallicity relationship at each redshift. to describe the fundamentalrelations that exist between redshift, metallicity and mass, we use afundamental plane description, which is described by the following equation:[m/h]=(-1.9+-0.5)+(0.74+-0.21)logdv_90-(0.32+-0.06)z. here, we assert that thevelocity width, dv_90, which is defined as the velocity interval containing 90%of the integrated optical depth, traces the mass of the underlying dark matterhalo. this description provides two significant improvements over theindividual descriptions of the mass-metallicity correlation andmetallicity-redshift correlation. firstly, the fundamental equation reduces thescatter around both relationships by about 20%, providing a more stringentconstraint on numerical simulations modeling dlas. secondly, it confirms thatthe dark matter halos that host dlas satisfy a mass-metallicity relationship ateach redshift between redshifts 2 through 5.

1307.1476	evidence for ubiquitous collimated galactic-scale outflows along the  star-forming sequence at z~0.5	we present an analysis of the mgii 2796, 2803 and feii 2586, 2600 absorptionline profiles in individual spectra of 105 galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.4. the galaxies,drawn from redshift surveys of the goods fields and the extended groth strip,fully sample the range in star formation rates (sfrs) occupied by thestar-forming sequence with stellar masses log m_*/m_sun &gt; 9.5 at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.7.using the doppler shifts of the mgii and feii absorption lines as tracers ofcool gas kinematics, we detect large-scale winds in 66+/-5% of the galaxies.hst/acs imaging and our spectral analysis indicate that the outflow detectionrate depends primarily on galaxy orientation: winds are detected in ~89% ofgalaxies having inclinations (i) &lt;30 degrees (face-on), while the winddetection rate is only ~45% in objects having i&gt;50 degrees (edge-on). combinedwith the comparatively weak dependence of the wind detection rate on intrinsicgalaxy properties, this suggests that biconical outflows are ubiquitous innormal, star-forming galaxies at z~0.5. we find that the wind velocity iscorrelated with host galaxy m_* at 3.4-sigma significance, while the equivalentwidth of the flow is correlated with host galaxy sfr at 3.5-sigma significance,suggesting that hosts with higher sfr may launch more material into outflowsand/or generate a larger velocity spread for the absorbing clouds. assumingthat the gas is launched into dark matter halos with simple, isothermal densityprofiles, the wind velocities measured for the bulk of the cool material(~200-400 km/s) are sufficient to enable escape from the halo potentials onlyfor the lowest-m_* systems in the sample. however, the outflows typically carrysufficient energy to reach distances of &gt;50 kpc, and may therefore be a viablesource of cool material for the massive circumgalactic medium observed aroundbright galaxies at z~0.

1307.6588	metal-poor, cool gas in the circumgalactic medium of a z = 2.4  star-forming galaxy: direct evidence for cold accretion?	in our current galaxy formation paradigm, high-redshift galaxies arepredominantly fuelled by accretion of cool, metal-poor gas from theintergalactic medium. hydrodynamical simulations predict that this materialshould be observable in absorption against background sightlines within agalaxy's virial radius, as optically thick lyman-limit systems (llss) with lowmetallicities. here we report the discovery of exactly such a strong metal-poorabsorber at an impact parameter r_perp = 58 kpc from a star-forming galaxy at z= 2.44. besides strong neutral hydrogen [n(hi) = 10^(19.50 +/- 0.16) cm^-2] wedetect neutral deuterium and oxygen, allowing a precise measurement of themetallicity: log10(z / zsolar) = -2.0 +/- 0.17, or (7-15) x 10^-3 solar.furthermore, the narrow deuterium linewidth requires a cool temperature &lt;20,000 k. given the striking similarities between this system and thepredictions of simulations, we argue that it represents the direct detection ofa high redshift cold-accretion stream. the low-metallicity gas cloud is asingle component of an absorption system exhibiting a complex velocity,ionization, and enrichment structure. two other components have metallicities &gt;0.1 solar, ten times larger than the metal-poor component. we conclude that thephotoionized circumgalactic medium (cgm) of this galaxy is highlyinhomogeneous: the majority of the gas is in a cool, metal-poor andpredominantly neutral phase, but the majority of the metals are in ahighly-ionized phase exhibiting weak neutral hydrogen absorption but strongmetal absorption. if such inhomogeneity is common, then high-resolution spectraand detailed ionization modelling are critical to accurately appraise thedistribution of metals in the high-redshift cgm.

1308.1101	dissecting the properties of optically-thick hydrogen at the peak of  cosmic star formation history	we present results of a blind survey of lyman limit systems (llss) detectedin absorption against 105 quasars at z~3 using the blue sensitive magespectrograph at the magellan clay telescope. by searching for lyman limitabsorption in the wavelength range ~3000-4000a, we measure the number of llssper unit redshift l(z)=1.21+/-0.28 at z~2.8. using a stacking analysis, wefurther estimate the mean free path of ionizing photons in the z~3 universelambda^912 = 100+/-29 mpc/h_70.4. combined with our lls survey, we concludethat systems with log n_hi &gt;= 17.5 cm^-2 contribute only ~40% to the observedmean free path at these redshifts. further, with the aid of photo-ionizationmodeling, we infer that a population of ionized and metal poor systems islikely required to reproduce the metal line strengths observed in a compositespectrum of 20 llss with n_hi = 17.5-19 cm^-2 at z~2.6-3.0. finally, with asimple toy model, we deduce that gas in the halos of galaxies can alone accountfor the totality of llss at z&lt;~3, but a progressively higher contribution fromthe intergalactic medium is required beyond z~3.5. we also show how the weaklyevolving number of llss per unit redshift at z&lt;~3 can be modeled either byrequiring that the spatial extent of the circumgalactic medium is redshiftinvariant in the last ~10 gyr of cosmic evolution or by postulating that llssarise in halos that are rare fluctuations in the density field at eachredshift.

1308.1669	confronting simulations of optically thick gas in massive halos with  observations at z=2-3	cosmological hydrodynamic simulations predict the physical state of baryonsin the circumgalactic medium (cgm), which can be directly tested via quasarabsorption line observations. we use high resolution "zoom-in" simulations of21 galaxies to characterize the distribution of neutral hydrogen around halosin the mass range m_vir~ 2x10^11 - 4x10^12 m_sun at z~2. we find that both themass fraction of cool (t &lt;= 3x10^4 k) gas and the covering fraction ofoptically-thick lyman limit systems (llss) depend only weakly on halo mass,even around the critical value for the formation of stable virial shocks. thecovering fraction of llss interior to the virial radius varies between f_c~0.05- 0.2, with significant scatter among halos. our simulations of massive halos(m_vir &gt;= 10^12 m_sun) underpredict the covering fraction of optically-thickgas observed in the quasar cgm by a large factor. the reason for thisdiscrepancy is unclear, but several possibilities are discussed. in the lowermass halos (m_vir &gt;= 5x10^11 m_sun) hosting star-forming galaxies, thepredicted covering factor agrees with observations, however current samples ofquasar-galaxy pairs are too small for a conclusive comparison. to overcome thislimitation, we propose a new observable: the small-scale auto-correlationfunction of optically-thick absorbers detected in the foreground of closequasar pairs. we show that this new observable can constrain the underlyingdark halos hosting llss at z~2-3, as well as the characteristic size andcovering factor of the cgm.

1308.5971	precious metals in sdss quasar spectra ii: tracking the evolution of  strong, 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.3 mgii absorbers with thousands of systems	we have performed an analysis of over 34,000 mgii doublets at 0.36 &lt; z &lt; 2.29in sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data-release 7 quasar spectra; the catalog,advanced data products, and tools for analysis are publicly available. thecatalog was divided into 14 small redshift bins with roughly 2500 doublets ineach, and from monte-carlo simulations, we estimate 50% completeness at restequivalent width w_r ~ 0.8 angstrom. the equivalent-width frequencydistribution is described well by an exponential model at all redshifts, andthe distribution becomes flatter with increasing redshift, i.e., there are morestrong systems relative to weak ones. direct comparison with previous sdss mgiisurveys reveal that we recover at least 70% of the doublets in these othercatalogs, in addition to detecting thousands of new systems. we discuss howthese surveys come by their different results, which qualitatively agree but,due to the very small uncertainties, differ by a statistically significantamount. the estimated physical cross-section of mgii-absorbing galaxy halosincreased three-fold, approximately, from z = 0.4 --&gt; 2.3, while the w_r &gt;= 1angstrom absorber line density grew, dn_mgii/dx, by roughly 45%. finally, weexplore the different evolution of various absorber populations - dampedlyman-alpha absorbers, lyman-limit systems, strong civ absorbers, and strongand weaker mgii systems - across cosmic time (0 &lt; z &lt; 6).

1308.6222	quasars probing quasars vi. excess hi absorption within one proper mpc  of z~2 quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the hi lya absorptiontransverse to luminous, z~2 quasars at proper separations of 30kpc &lt; r &lt; 1mpc.in contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse toquasars exhibit enhanced hi lya absorption and a larger variance than theambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance towardsmaller scales. analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorptioncharacterized by a lya equivalent width profile w = 2.3a (r/100kpc)^-0.46. wealso observe a high (~60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick hiabsorbers (hi column log nhi &gt; 17.3) at separations r&lt;200kpc, which decreasesto ~20% at r~1mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmicaverage. this excess of optically thick absorption can be described by aquasar-absorber cross-correlation function xi_qa(r) = (r/r_0)^gamma with alarge correlation length r_0 = 12.5+2.7-1.4 mpc/h (comoving) and gamma =1.68+0.14-0.30. the hi absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of anypreviously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massivedark matter halos mhalo~10^12.5 msun at z~2.5. the environments of thesemassive halos are highly biased towards producing optically thick gas, and mayeven dominate the cosmic abundance of lyman limit systems and hence theintergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z~2.5. the anisotropic absorptionaround quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to beilluminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight, which we interpret interms of the same obscuration effects frequently invoked in unified models ofactive galactic nuclei.

1309.5421	the role of stellar feedback in the dynamics of hii regions	stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxyformation models today. this uncertainty stems from a dearth of observationalconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (&lt;1 pc)where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (&gt;1 kpc) that areshaped by this feedback. to bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assessobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of hiiregions. in particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine severalstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 hii regions in the large andsmall magellanic clouds (lmc and smc, respectively). using optical, infrared,radio, and x-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells fromthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionizedgas, and the hot x-ray emitting gas. we find that the warm ionized gasdominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two havecomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. thehot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressuresare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. we discuss the implicationsof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage fromthe hii shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processedradiation to the warm gas. furthermore, we emphasize that similar observationalwork should be done on very young hii regions to test whether direct radiationpressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.

1309.6317	the cos-halos survey: rationale, design, and a census of circumgalactic  neutral hydrogen	we present the design and methods of the cos-halos survey, a systematicinvestigation of the gaseous halos of 44 z = 0.15-0.35 galaxies usingbackground qsos observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph aboard the hubblespace telescope. this survey has yielded 39 spectra of z_em ~ 0.5 qsos with s/n~ 10-15 per resolution element. the qso sightlines pass within 150 physical kpcof the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log m* /msun= 9.5 - 11.5. we find that the cgm exhibits strong hi, averaging 1 ang inlya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100% covering fraction forstar-forming galaxies and 75% covering for passive galaxies. we find goodagreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies oversimilar range of impact parameter. there is weak evidence for a differencebetween early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of hi.kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy,such that &gt;~90% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 kms^-1 of the galaxies. this material generally exists well below the halo virialtemperatures at t&lt;~ 10^5 k. we evaluate a number of possible origin scenariosfor the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which thebulk of the detected hi arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionizeddiffuse medium that is generic to all l* galaxies and may harbor a totalgaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.

1310.2253	a budget and accounting of metals at z~0: results from the cos-halos  survey	we present a budget and accounting of metals in and around star-forminggalaxies at $z\sim 0$. we combine empirically derived star formation historieswith updated supernova and agb yields and rates to estimate the total mass ofmetals produced by galaxies with present-day stellar mass of$10^{9.3}$--$10^{11.6} m_{\odot}$. on the accounting side of the ledger, weshow that a surprisingly constant 20--25% mass fraction of produced metalsremain in galaxies' stars, interstellar gas and interstellar dust, with littledependence of this fraction on the galaxy stellar mass (omitting those metalsimmediately locked up in remnants). thus, the bulk of metals are outside ofgalaxies, produced in the progenitors of today's $l^*$ galaxies. the cos-halossurvey is uniquely able to measure the mass of metals in the circumgalacticmedium (to impact parameters of $&lt; 150$ kpc) of low-redshift $\sim l^*$galaxies. using these data, we map the distribution of cgm metals as traced byboth the highly ionized ovi ion and a suite of low-ionization species; combinedwith constraints on circumgalactic dust and hotter x-ray emitting gas out tosimilar impact parameters, we show that $\sim 40$% of metals produced by$m_{\star}\sim 10^{10}m_{\odot}$ galaxies can be easily accounted for out to150 kpc. with the current data, we cannot rule out a constant mass of metalswithin this fixed physical radius. this census provides a crucial boundarycondition for the eventual fate of metals in galaxy evolution models.

1310.6042	the rapid decline in metallicity of damped ly-alpha systems at z~5	we present evidence that the cosmological mean metallicity of neutral atomichydrogen gas shows a sudden decrease at z&gt;4.7 down to &lt;z&gt;=-2.03(+0.09-0.11),which is 6 sigma deviant from that predicted by a linear fit to the data atlower redshifts. this measurement is made possible by the chemical abundancemeasurements of 8 new damped ly-alpha (dla) systems at z&gt;4.7 observed with theechellette spectrograph and imager on the keck ii telescope, doubling thenumber of measurements at z&gt;4.7 to 16. possible explanations for this suddendecrease in metallicity include a change in the physical processes that enrichthe neutral gas within disks, or an increase of the covering factor of neutralgas outside disks due to a lower ultra-violet radiation field and higherdensity at high redshift. the later possibility would result in a newpopulation of presumably lower metallicity dlas, with an increased contributionto the dla population at higher redshifts resulting in a reduced meanmetallicity. furthermore, we provide evidence of a possible decrease at z&gt;4.7in the comoving metal mass density of dlas, which is flat out to z~4.3. such adecrease is expected, as otherwise most of the metals from star-forminggalaxies would reside in dlas by z~6. while the metallicity is decreasing athigh redshift, the contribution of dlas to the total metal budget of theuniverse increases with redshift, with dlas at z~4.3 accounting for ~20% asmany metals as produced by lyman break galaxies.

1310.6267	the high-ion content and kinematics of low-redshift lyman limit systems	we study the high-ionization phase and kinematics of the circumgalacticmedium around low-redshift galaxies using a sample of 23 lyman limit systems(llss) at 0.08&lt;z&lt;0.93 observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph onboard thehubble space telescope. in lehner et al. (2013), we recently showed that low-zllss have a bimodal metallicity distribution. here we extend that analysis tosearch for differences between the high-ion and kinematic properties of themetal-poor and metal-rich branches. we find that metal-rich llss tend to showhigher o vi columns and broader o vi profiles than metal-poor llss. the total hi line width (dv90 statistic) in llss is not correlated with metallicity,indicating that the h i kinematics alone cannot be used to distinguish inflowfrom outflow and gas recycling. among the 17 llss with o vi detections, all buttwo show evidence of kinematic sub-structure, in the form of o vi-h i centroidoffsets, multiple components, or both. using various scenarios for how themetallicity in the high-ion and low-ion phases of each lls compare, weconstrain the ionized hydrogen column in the o vi phase to lie in the range logn(h ii)~17.6-20. the o vi phase of llss is a substantial baryon reservoir, withm(high-ion)~10^{8.5-10.9}(r/150 kpc)^2 solar masses, similar to the mass in thelow-ion phase. accounting for the o vi phase approximately doubles thecontribution of low-z llss to the cosmic baryon budget.

1311.4559	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: a case with cold-accretion characteristics	studies of qso absorber-galaxy connections are often hindered by inadequateinformation on whether faint/dwarf galaxies are located near the qso sightlines. to investigate the contribution of faint galaxies to qso absorberpopulations, we are conducting a deep galaxy redshift survey near low-z c ivabsorbers. here we report a blindly-detected c iv absorption system (z(abs) =0.00348) in the spectrum of pg1148+549 that appears to be associated eitherwith an edge-on dwarf galaxy with an obvious disk (ugc 6894, z(gal) = 0.00283)at an impact parameter of rho = 190 kpc or with a very faint dwarf irregulargalaxy at rho = 23 kpc, which is closer to the sightline but has a largerredshift difference (z(gal) = 0.00107, i.e., dv = 724 km/s). we considervarious gas/galaxy associations, including infall and outflows. based oncurrent theoretical models, we conclude that the absorber is most likelytracing (1) the remnants of an outflow from a previous epoch, a so-called'ancient outflow', or (2) intergalactic gas accreting onto ugc 6894, 'coldmode' accretion. the latter scenario is supported by h i synthesis imaging datathat shows the rotation curve of the disk being codirectional with the velocityoffset between ugc 6894 and the absorber, which is located almost directlyalong the major axis of the edge-on disk.

1401.1811	galactic and circumgalactic ovi and its impact on the cosmological metal  and baryon budgets at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5	we present the first results from our nasa keck observatory database ofionized absorbers toward quasars (kodiaq) survey which aims to characterize theproperties of the highly ionized gas of high redshift galaxies and theircircumgalactic medium (cgm) at 2&lt;z&lt;4. we select absorbers optically thick atthe lyman limit ({\tau}ll &gt; 1, log n(hi) &gt; 17.3) as probes of these galaxiesand their cgm where both transitions of the o vi doublet have littlecontamination from the ly {\alpha}, {\beta} forests. we found 20 absorbers thatsatisfy these rules: 7 lyman limit systems (llss), 8 super-llss (sllss) and 5damped ly{\alpha} (dlas). the o vi detection rate is 100% for the dlas, 71% forthe llss, and 63% for the sllss. when o vi is detected, log n(ovi)=14.9+/-0.3,an average o vi column density substantially larger and with a smallerdispersion than found in blind o vi surveys at similar redshifts. strong o viabsorption is therefore nearly ubiquitous in the cgm of z~2-3 galaxies. thetotal velocity widths of the o vi profiles are also large (200&lt;dv(ovi)&lt;400km/s). these properties are quite similar to those seen for o vi in low zstar-forming galaxies, and therefore we hypothesize that these strong cgm o viabsorbers (with {\tau}ll &gt; 1) at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 also probe outflows of star-forminggalaxies. the llss and sllss with no o vi absorption have properties consistentwith those seen in cosmological simulations tracing cold streams feedinggalaxies. when the highly ionized (si iv and o vi) gas is taken into account,we determine that the {\tau}ll &gt; 1 absorbers could contain as much as 3-14% ofthe cosmic baryon budget at z~2-3, only second to the ly{\alpha} forest. weconservatively show that 5-20% of the metals ever produced at z~2-3 are in formof highly ionized metals ejected in the cgm of galaxies.

1406.7006	dusting off the diffuse interstellar bands: dibs and dust in  extragalactic sdss spectra	using over a million and a half extragalactic spectra we study the propertiesof the mysterious diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) in the milky way. thesedata provide us with an unprecedented sampling of the skies at highgalactic-latitude and low dust-column-density. we present our method, study thecorrelation of the equivalent width of 8 dibs with dust extinction and with afew atomic species, and the distribution of four dibs - 5780.6a, 5797.1a,6204.3a, and 6613.6a - over nearly 15000 squared degrees. as previously found,dibs strengths correlate with extinction and therefore inevitably with eachother. however, we show that dibs can exist even in dust free areas.furthermore, we find that the dibs correlation with dust varies significantlyover the sky. dib under- or over-densities, relative to the expectation fromdust, are often spread over hundreds of square degrees. these patches aredifferent for the four dibs, showing that they are unlikely to originate fromthe same carrier, as previously suggested.

1407.2944	a deep narrowband imaging search for civ and he ii emission from  ly$\alpha$ blobs	we conduct a deep narrow-band imaging survey of 13 ly$\alpha$ blobs (labs)located in the ssa22 proto-cluster at z~3.1 in the civ and heii emission linesin an effort to constrain the physical process powering the ly$\alpha$ emissionin labs. our observations probe down to unprecedented surface brightness limitsof 2.1 $-$ 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ per 1arcsec$^2$ aperture (5$\sigma$) for the heii$\lambda$1640 and civ$\lambda$1549lines, respectively. we do not detect extended heii and civ emission in any ofthe labs, placing strong upper limits on the heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$line ratios, of 0.11 and 0.16, for the brightest two labs in the field. weconduct detailed photoionization modeling of the expected line ratios and findthat, although our data constitute the deepest ever observations of theselines, they are still not deep enough to rule out a scenario where thely$\alpha$ emission is powered by the ionizing luminosity of an obscured agn.our models can accommodate heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$ ratios as low as$\simeq$0.05 and $\simeq$0.07 respectively, implying that one needs to reachsurface brightness as low as 1 $-$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ (at 5$\sigma$) in order to rule out a photoionizationscenario. these depths will be achievable with the new generation ofimage-slicing integral field units such as vlt/muse or keck/kcwi. we also modelthe expected heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$ in a different scenario, wherely$\alpha$ emission is powered by shocks generated in a large-scale superwind,but find that our observational constraints can only be met for shockvelocities $v_{\rm s} \gtrsim$ 250 km s$^{-1}$, which appear to be in conflictwith recent observations of quiescent kinematics in labs.

1409.2880	directly imaging damped ly-alpha galaxies at z&gt;2. iii: the star  formation rates of neutral gas reservoirs at z~2.7	we present results from a survey designed to probe the star formationproperties of 32 damped ly-alpha systems (dlas) at z~2.7. by using the"double-dla" technique that eliminates the glare of the bright backgroundquasars, we directly measure the rest-frame fuv flux from dlas and theirneighbouring galaxies. at the position of the absorbing gas, we place stringentconstraints on the unobscured star formation rates (sfrs) of dlas to 2-sigmalimits of &lt;0.09-0.27 m/yr, corresponding to sfr surface densities&lt;10^(-2.6)-10^(-1.5) m/yr/kpc^2. the implications of these limits for the starformation law, metal enrichment, and cooling rates of dlas are examined. bystudying the distribution of impact parameters as a function of sfrs for allthe galaxies detected around these dlas, we place new direct constraints on thebright end of the uv luminosity function of dla hosts. we find that &lt;13% of thehosts have sfr&gt;2 m/yr at impact parameters b &lt; (sfr/(m/yr))^(0.8)+6 kpc,differently from current samples of confirmed dla galaxies. our observationsalso disfavor a scenario in which the majority of dlas arise from bright lbgsat distances 20 &lt; b &lt; 100 kpc. these new findings corroborate a picture inwhich dlas do not originate from highly star forming systems that arecoincident with the absorbers, and instead suggest that dlas are associatedwith faint, possibly isolated, star-forming galaxies. potential shortcomings ofthis scenario and future strategies for further investigation are discussed.

1409.5632	lyman-alpha forest tomography from background galaxies: the first  megaparsec-resolution large-scale structure map at z&gt;2	we present the first observations of foreground lyman-$\alpha$ forestabsorption from high-redshift galaxies, targeting 24 star-forming galaxies(sfgs) with $z\sim 2.3-2.8$ within a $5' \times 15'$ region of the cosmosfield. the transverse sightline separation is $\sim 2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$comoving, allowing us to create a tomographic reconstruction of the 3dly$\alpha$ forest absorption field over the redshift range $2.20\leq z\leq2.45$. the resulting map covers $6\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc} \times14\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$ in the transverse plane and $230\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$along the line-of-sight with a spatial resolution of $\approx3.5\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$, and is the first high-fidelity map of large-scalestructure on $\sim\mathrm{mpc}$ scales at $z&gt;2$. our map reveals significantstructures with $\gtrsim 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$ extent, including severalspanning the entire transverse breadth, providing qualitative evidence for thefilamentary structures predicted to exist in the high-redshift cosmic web.simulated reconstructions with the same sightline sampling, spectralresolution, and signal-to-noise ratio recover the salient structures present inthe underlying 3d absorption fields. using data from other surveys, weidentified 18 galaxies with known redshifts coeval with our map volume enablinga direct comparison to our tomographic map. this shows that galaxiespreferentially occupy high-density regions, in qualitative agreement with thesame comparison applied to simulations. our results establishes the feasibilityof the clamato survey, which aims to obtain ly$\alpha$ forest spectra for $\sim1000$ sfgs over $\sim 1 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the cosmos field, in order to mapout igm large-scale structure at $\langle z \rangle \sim 2.3$ over a largevolume $(100\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc})^3$.

1411.5027	probing the physical conditions of atomic gas at high redshift	a new method is used to measure the physical conditions of the gas in dampedlyman-alpha systems (dlas). using high resolution absorption spectra of asample of 80 dlas, we are able to measure the ratio of the upper to lowerfine-structure levels of the ground state of c ii and si ii. these ratios aredetermined solely by the physical conditions of the gas. we explore the allowedphysical parameter space using a monte carlo markov chain method to constrainsimultaneously the temperature, neutral hydrogen density, and electron densityof each dla. the results indicate that at least 5 % of all dlas have the bulkof their gas in a dense, cold phase with typical densities of ~100 cm-3 andtemperatures below 500 k. we further find that the typical pressure of dlas inour sample is log(p/k) = 3.4 [k cm-3], which is comparable to the pressure ofthe local interstellar medium (ism), and that the components containing thebulk of the neutral gas can be quite small with absorption sizes as small as afew parsec. we show that the majority of the systems are consistent with havingdensities significantly higher than expected from a purely canonical wnm,indicating that significant quantities of dense gas (i.e. n_h &gt; 0.1 cm-3) arerequired to match observations. finally, we identify 8 systems with positivedetections of si ii*. these systems have pressures (p/k) in excess of 20000 kcm-3, which suggest that these systems tag a highly turbulent ism in young,star-forming galaxies.

1411.6016	dissecting the gaseous halos of z~2 damped ly$\alpha$ systems with close  quasar pairs	we use spectroscopy of close pairs of quasars to study diffuse gas in thecircumgalactic medium (cgm) surrounding a sample of 40 damped lya systems(dlas). the primary sightline in each quasar pair probes an intervening dla inthe redshift range 1.6 &lt; z_dla &lt; 3.6, such that the second quasar sightlinethen probes lya, cii, siii, and civ absorption in the cgm transverse to the dlato projected distances $r_{\perp} &lt; 300$ kpc. analysis of the lya profiles inthese cgm sightlines constrains the covering fraction (f_c) of optically thickhi (having column density n_hi &gt; 10^17.2 cm^-2) to be greater than ~30% within$r_{\perp} &lt; 200$ kpc of dlas. strong siii 1526 absorption with equivalentwidth w_1526 &gt; 0.2 ang occurs with an incidence f_c (w_1526 &gt; 0.2 ang) =20(+12/-8)% within $r_{\perp}&lt;100$ kpc, indicating that low-ionization metalabsorption associated with dlas probes material at a physical distance r_3d &lt;30 kpc. however, we find that strong civ 1548 absorption is ubiquitous in theseenvironments (f_c (w_1548 &gt; 0.2 ang) = 57(+12/-13)% within $r_{\perp} &lt; 100$kpc), and in addition exhibits a high degree of kinematic coherence on scalesup to ~175 kpc. we infer that this high-ionization material arisespredominantly in large, quiescent structures extending beyond the scale of thedla host dark matter halos rather than in ongoing galactic winds. the lyaequivalent width in the dla-cgm is anticorrelated with $r_{\perp}$ at &gt;98%confidence, suggesting that dlas arise close to the centers of their host halosrather than on their outskirts. finally, the average lya, cii and civequivalent widths are consistent with those measured around z~2 lyman breakgalaxies. assuming that dlas trace a galaxy population with lower masses andluminosities, this finding implies that the absorption strength of coolcircumgalactic material has a weak dependence on dark matter halo mass for m_h&lt; 10^12 m_sun.

1504.03688	deep heii and civ spectroscopy of a giant lyman alpha nebula: dense  compact gas clumps in the circumgalactic medium of a z~2 quasar	the recent discovery by cantalupo et al. (2014) of the largest (~500 kpc) andluminous ly-alpha nebula associated with the quasar um287 (z=2.279) poses agreat challenge to our current understanding of the astrophysics of the haloshosting massive z~2 galaxies. either an enormous reservoir of cool gas isrequired $m\simeq10^{12}$ $m_{\odot}$, exceeding the expected baryonic massavailable, or one must invoke extreme gas clumping factors not present inhigh-resolution cosmological simulations. however, observations of ly-alphaemission alone cannot distinguish between these two scenarios. we have obtainedthe deepest ever spectroscopic integrations in the heii and civ lines with thegoal of detecting extended line emission, but detect neither line to a3$\sigma$ limiting sb $\simeq10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$. we constructmodels of the expected emission spectrum in the highly probable scenario thatthe nebula is powered by photoionization from the central hyper-luminousquasar. the non-detection of heii implies that the nebular emission arises froma mass $m_{\rm c}\lesssim6.4\times10^{10}$ $m_{\odot}$ of cool gas on ~200 kpcscales, distributed in a population of remarkably dense ($n_{\rm h}\gtrsim3$cm$^{-3}$) and compact ($r\lesssim20$ pc) clouds, which would clearly beunresolved by current cosmological simulations. given the large gas motionssuggested by the ly-alpha line ($v\simeq$ 500 km/s), it is unclear how theseclouds survive without being disrupted by hydrodynamic instabilities. our studyserves as a benchmark for future deep integrations with current and plannedwide-field ifu such as muse, kcwi, and kmos. our work suggest that a $\simeq$10 hr exposure would likely detect ~10 rest-frame uv/optical emission lines,opening up the possibility of conducting detailed photoionization modeling toinfer the physical state of gas in the cgm.

1506.01031	towards the statistical detection of the warm-hot intergalactic medium  in inter-cluster filaments of the cosmic web	modern analyses of structure formation predict a universe tangled in a'cosmic web' of dark matter and diffuse baryons. these theories further predictthat at low-z, a significant fraction of the baryons will be shock-heated to $t\sim 10^{5}-10^{7}$k yielding a warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim), but whoseactual existence has eluded a firm observational confirmation. we present anovel experiment to detect the whim, by targeting the putative filamentsconnecting galaxy clusters. we use hst/cos to observe a remarkable qsosightline that passes within $\delta d = 3$ mpc from the 7 inter-cluster axesconnecting 7 independent cluster-pairs at redshifts $0.1 \le z \le 0.5$. wefind tentative excesses of total hi, narrow hi (nla; doppler parameters $b&lt;50$km/s), broad hi (bla; $b \ge 50$ km/s) and ovi absorption lines withinrest-frame velocities of $\delta v \lesssim 1000$ km/s from the cluster-pairsredshifts, corresponding to $\sim 2$, $\sim 1.7$, $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ timestheir field expectations, respectively. although the excess of ovi likely comesfrom gas close to individual galaxies, we conclude that most of the excesses ofnlas and blas are truly intergalactic. we find that the covering fractions,$f_c$, of blas close to cluster-pairs are $\sim 4-7$ times higher than therandom expectation (at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ c.l.), whereas the $f_c$ of nlas andovi are not significantly enhanced. we argue that a larger relative excess ofblas compared to those of nlas close to cluster-pairs may be a signature of thewhim in inter-cluster filaments. by extending the present analysis to tens ofsightlines our experiment offers a promising route to detect the whim.

1510.01329	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: ii. program design, absorption-line measurements, and absorber  statistics	to investigate the evolution of metal-enriched gas over recent cosmic epochsas well as to characterize the diffuse, ionized, metal-enriched circumgalacticmedium (cgm), we have conducted a blind survey for c iv absorption systems in89 qso sightlines observed with the hubble space telescope (hst) cosmic originsspectrograph (cos). we have identified 42 absorbers at z &lt; 0.16, comprising thelargest uniform blind sample size to date in this redshift range. ourmeasurements indicate an increasing c iv absorber number density per comovingpath length (dn/dx = 7.5 +/- 1.1) and modestly increasing mass density relativeto the critical density of the universe (omega(c iv) = 10.0 +/- 1.5 x 10^-8 )from z ~ 1.5 to the present epoch, consistent with predictions fromcosmological hydrodynamical simulations. furthermore, the data support afunctional form for the column density distribution function that deviates froma single power-law, also consistent with independent theoretical predictions.as the data also probe heavy element ions in addition to c iv at the sameredshifts, we identify, measure, and search for correlations between columndensities of these species where components appear aligned in velocity. amongthese ion-ion correlations, we find evidence for tight correlations between cii and si ii, c ii and si iii, and c iv and si iv, suggesting that these pairsof species arise in similar ionization conditions. however, the evidence forcorrelations decreases as the difference in ionization potential increases.finally, when controlling for observational bias, we find only marginalevidence for a correlation (86.8% likelihood) between the doppler line widthb(c iv) and column density n(c iv).

0806.0862	quasars probing quasars iii: new clues to feedback, quenching, and the  physics of massive galaxy formation	galaxies hosting z~2 quasars are the high-$z$ progenitors of today's massive`red-and-dead' galaxies. with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, abackground quasar can be used to study a foreground quasar's halo gas inabsorption, providing a wealth of information about feedback, quenching, andthe physics of massive galaxy formation. we present a keck/hires spectrum ofthe bright background quasar in a projected pair with angular separation 13.3"corresponding to 108kpc at the redshift of the foreground quasar z_fg=2.4360+/- 0.0005, precisely determined from gemini/gnirs near-ir spectroscopy. ourechelle spectrum reveals optically thick gas (nhi~10^19.7), coincident with theforeground quasar redshift. the ionic transitions of associated metal-linesreveal the following properties of the foreground quasar's halo: (1) thekinematics are extreme with absorption extending to +780km/s relative to z_fg;(2) the metallicity is nearly solar; (3) the temperature of the predominantlyionized gas is t&lt;~20,000k; (4) the electron density is n_e~1 cm^-3 indicating acharacteristic size ~10 - 100pc for the absorbing `clouds'; (7) there is anegligible amount of warm gas 10^5k &lt; t &lt; 10^6k; (8) the gas is unlikelyilluminated by the foreground quasar, implying anisotropic or intermittentemission. the mass of cold t~10^4k gas implied by our observations issignificant, amounting to a few percent of the total expected baryonic massdensity of the foreground quasar's dark halo at r~100kpc. the origin of thismaterial is still unclear, and we discuss several possibilities in the contextof current models of feedback and massive galaxy formation.

1511.01898	the physical properties of z&gt;2 lyman limit systems: new constraints for  feedback and accretion models	we study the physical properties of a homogeneous sample of 157optically-thick absorption line systems at redshifts ~1.8-4.4, selected from ahigh-dispersion spectroscopic survey of lyman limit systems (llss). by means ofmultiple ionisation models and bayesian techniques, we derive the posteriorprobability distribution functions for the density, metallicity, temperature,and dust content of the absorbing gas. we find that z&gt;2 llss are highly ionisedwith ionisation parameters between -3&lt;log u&lt;-2, depending on the hi columndensity. llss are characterised by low temperatures (t&lt;5x10^4 k) and reside indust-poor environments. between z~2.5-3.5, ~80% of the llss have physicaldensities between n(h)~10^-3.5-10^-2 cm^-3 for the assumed uv background, butwe caution that a degeneracy between the ionisation parameter and the intensityof the radiation field prevents robust inference on the density and sizes ofllss. conversely, metallicity estimates are less sensitive to the assumptionsbehind ionisation corrections. llss at z&gt;2 are characterised by a broadunimodal distribution over &gt;4 orders of magnitude, with a peak at logz/zsun~-2. llss are metal poor, significantly less enriched than dlas, with~70% of the metallicity pdf below log z/zsun&lt;-1.5. the median metallicity ofsuper llss with log n(hi)&gt;19 rapidly evolves with redshift, with a ten-foldincrease between z~2.1-3.6 (~1.5 gyr). based on this sample, we find that llssat z=2.5-3.5 account for ~15% of all the metals produced by uv-selectedgalaxies. the implications for theories of cold gas accretion and metalejection from galaxies are also discussed.

1512.00853	a deep search for faint galaxies associated with very low-redshift c iv  absorbers: iii. a galaxy sample complete to 0.01 l* and evidence for  environmental effects	we employ a blindly selected sample of low-redshift c iv absorption systemsidentified in spectra from the hubble space telescope (hst) cosmic originsspectrograph (cos), combined with galaxy data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), to study the metal-enriched circumgalactic medium (cgm) with ~100%completeness for galaxy luminosities l &gt; 0.01 l* at z &lt; 0.015. we find thatgalaxies are typically found at the c iv absorber redshifts within impactparameters rho &lt; 200 kpc, with the nearest galaxy having l &lt; 0.1 l* for 78% ofthe absorbers. the ubiquity of faint dwarfs in close proximity to the absorberssuggests that these galaxies affect the enrichment and physical conditions ofmassive-galaxy halos. however, a fraction of our sample (33%) arise welloutside the virial radius of any nearby galaxy brighter than 0.01 l*. thedetection rate for c iv absorption within the virial radius is mass dependentand is considerably higher for l &gt;~0.1 l* galaxies (7/8) than for less luminousgalaxies (1/10). we also find that the occurrence of c iv absorbers dependsstrongly on the broader environment: 67% (8/12) of galaxies with rho &lt; 150 kpcin regions of low galaxy density (regions with fewer than ten 0.1 l* galaxieswithin 1 mpc) have affiliated c iv absorption while none (0/9) of the galaxiesin denser regions show c iv within rho &lt; 150 kpc. the reduced detection rate ofc iv in denser environments persists for massive group dark matter halos. incontrast, h i is pervasive in the cgm without regard to mass or environment,although some of these ly-alpha absorbers could arise in unrelatedintergalactic gas.

1512.06859	mapping the most massive overdensities through hydrogen (mammoth) i:  methodology	modern cosmology predicts that a galaxy overdensity is associated to a largereservoir of the intergalactic gas, which can be traced by the ly$\alpha$forest absorption. we have undertaken a systematic study of the relationbetween coherently strong intergalactic ly$\alpha$ absorption systems (coslas),which have highest optical depth ($\tau$) in $\tau$ distribution, and massoverdensities on the scales of $\sim$ 10 - 20 $h^{-1}$ comoving mpc. on suchlarge scales, our cosmological simulations show a strong correlation betweenthe effective optical depth ($\tau_{\rm{eff}}$) of the coslas and the 3-d massoverdensities. in moderate signal-to-noise spectra, however, the profiles ofcoslas can be confused with high column density absorbers. for $z&gt;2.6$, wherethe corresponding ly$\beta$ is redshifted to the optical, we have developed thetechnique to differentiate between these two alternatives. we have applied thistechnique to sdss-iii quasar survey at $z = 2.6$ - 3.3, and we present a sampleof five cosla candidates with $\tau_{\rm{eff}}$ on 15 $h^{-1}$ mpc greater than$4.5\times$ the mean optical depth. at lower redshifts of $z &lt; 2.6$, where thebackground quasar density is higher, the overdensity can be traced byintergalactic absorption groups using multiple sight lines. our overdensitysearches fully utilize the current and next generation of ly$\alpha$ forestsurveys which cover a survey volume of $&gt; (1\ h^{-1}$ gpc)$^3$. in addition,systems traced by coslas will build a uniform sample of the most massiveoverdensities at $z &gt; 2$ to constrain the models of structure formation, andoffer a unique laboratory to study the interactions between galaxyoverdensities and the intergalactic medium.

0807.2271	a z = 3 lyman alpha blob associated with a damped lyman alpha system  proximate to its background quasar	we report on the discovery of a bright lyman alpha blob associated with thez=3 quasar sdssj124020.91+145535.6 which is also coincident with strong dampedlyman alpha absorption from a foreground galaxy (a so-called proximate dampedlyman alpha system; pdla). the one dimensional spectrum acquired by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) shows a broad lyman alpha emission line with a fwhm ~500 km/s and a luminosity of l_{lya} = 3.9e43 erg/s superposed on the trough ofthe pdla. mechanisms for powering this large lyman alpha luminosity arediscussed. we argue against emission from hii regions in the pdla galaxy sincethis requires an excessive star-formation rate ~ 500 msun/yr and wouldcorrespond to the largest lyman alpha luminosity ever measured from a dampedlyman alpha system or starburst galaxy. we use a monte carlo radiative transfersimulation to investigate the possibility that the line emission is fluorescentrecombination radiation from the pdla galaxy powered by the ionizing flux ofthe quasar, but find that the predicted lyman alpha flux is several orders ofmagnitude lower than observed. we conclude that the lyman alpha emission is notassociated with the pdla galaxy at all, but instead is intrinsic to thequasar's host and similar to the extended lyman alpha 'fuzz' which is detectedaround many agn. pdlas are natural coronagraphs that block their backgroundquasar at lyman alpha, and we discuss how systems similar tosdssj124020.91+145535.6 might be used to image the neutral hydrogen in the pdlagalaxy in silhouette against the screen of extended lyman alpha emission fromthe background quasar.

0811.2003	on the (non)evolution of hi disks over cosmic time	we present new results on the frequency distribution of projected hi columndensities f(n,x), total comoving covering fraction, and integrated massdensities rho_hi of high redshift, hi `disks' from a survey of damped lyasystems (dlas) in the sloan digital sky survey, data release 5. for the fullsample spanning z=2.2 to 5 [738 dlas], f(n,x) is well fitted by a doublepower-law with a break column density n_d = 10^(21.55 +/- 0.04) andlow/high-end exponents alpha = -2.00 +/- 0.05, -6.4^{+1.1}_{-1.6}. the shape off(n,x) is invariant during this redshift interval and also follows theprojected surface density distribution of present-day hi disks as inferred from21cm observations. we conclude that hi gas has been distributed in aself-similar fashion for the past 12gyr. the normalization of f(n,x), incontrast, decreases by a factor of two during the ~2gyr interval from z=4 to2.2 giving corresponding decreases in both the total covering fraction andrho_hi. at z~2, these quantities match the present-day values suggesting noevolution during the past ~10gyr. we argue that the evolution at early times isdriven by `violent' processes that removes gas from nearly half the galaxies atz~3 establishing the antecedants of current early-type galaxies. the perceivedconstancy of rho_hi, meanwhile, implies that hi gas is a necessary butinsufficient pre-condition for star formation and that the globalstar-formation rate is driven by the accretion and condensation of fresh gasfrom the intergalactic medium.
