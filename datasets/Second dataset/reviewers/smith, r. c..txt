0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

0911.1791	outlying hii regions in hi-selected galaxies	we present results from the first systematic search for outlying hii regions,as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as eldots -emission-line dots) derived from the noao survey for ionization in neutral gasgalaxies (singg). our automated eldot-finder searches singg narrow-band andcontinuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the opticalradius of the target galaxy (&gt; 2 x r25 in the r-band). follow-up longslitspectroscopy and deep galex images (exposure time &gt; 1000 s) distinguishoutlying hii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines([oiii], hbeta or [oii]) have been redshifted into the singg bandpass. we findthat these deep galex images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopicfollow-up because outlying hii regions separate cleanly from backgroundgalaxies in color-color space. we identify seven singg systems with outlyingmassive star formation that span a large range in halpha luminositiescorresponding to a few o stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarfsatellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. six of these sevensystems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying hii regions are linked tothe extended-uv disks discovered by galex, representing emission from the mostmassive o stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) starclusters. the overall frequency of outlying hii regions in this sample ofgas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-linegalaxy contamination (~75% of eldots).

0911.2002	pushing the boundaries of conventional core-collapse supernovae: the  extremely energetic supernova sn 2003ma	we report the discovery of a supernova (sn) with the highest apparent energyoutput to date and conclude that it represents an extreme example of the typeiin subclass. the sn, which was discovered behind the large magellanic cloud atz = 0.289 by the supermacho microlensing survey, peaked at m_r = -21.5 mag andonly declined by 2.9 mag over 4.7 years after the peak. over this period, sn2003ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10^51 ergs, more than anyother sn to date. the radiated energy is close to the limit allowed byconventional core-collapse explosions. optical spectra reveal that sn 2003mahas persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature ofinteraction between the sn and a dense circumstellar medium. the light curvesshow further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateauwith a shape very similar to the classic sn iin 1988z -- however, sn 2003ma isten times more luminous at all epochs. the fast velocity measured for theintermediate-width h_alpha component (~6000 km/s) points towards an extremelyenergetic explosion (&gt; 10^52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed tothe post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than isobserved in typical sne iin. mid-infrared observations of sn 2003ma suggest aninfrared light echo is produced by normal interstellar dust at a distance ~0.5pc from the sn.

0709.1267	a survey of local group galaxies currently forming stars: iii. a search  for luminous blue variables and other h-alpha emission-lined stars	we describe a search for h-alpha emission-lined stars in m31, m33, and sevendwarfs in or near the local group (ic 10, ngc 6822, wlm, sextans b, sextans a,pegasus and the phoenix dwarf) using interference filter imaging with the kpnoand ctio 4-m telescope and mosaic cameras. the survey is aimed primarily atidentifying new luminous blue variables (lbvs) from their spectroscopicsimilarity to known lbvs, avoiding the bias towards photometric variability,which may require centuries to manifest itself if lbvs go through longquiescent periods. followup spectroscopy with wiyn confirms that our surveydetected a wealth of stars whose spectra are similar to the known lbvs. we"classify" the spectra of known lbvs, and compare these to the spectra of thenew lbv candidates. we demonstrate spectacular spectral variability for severalof the new lbv candidates, such as am2, previously classified as a wolf-rayetstar, which now shows fei, feii and balmer emission lines but neither the niii4634,42 nor heii 4686 emission that it did in 1982. profound spectral changesare also noted for other suspected and known lbvs. several of the lbvcandidates also show &gt;0.5 mag changes in v over the past 10-20 years. thenumber of known or suspected lbvs is now 24 in m31, 37 in m33, 1 in ngc 6822,and 3 in ic 10. we estimate that the total number of lbvs in m31 and m33 may beseveral hundred, in contrast to the 8 known historically through large-scalephotometric variability. this has significant implications for the time scaleof the lbv phase. we also identify a few new wrs and peculiar emission-linedobjects.

1101.5669	an x-ray investigation of three supernova remnants in the large  magellanic cloud	we have investigated three snrs in the lmc using multi-wavelength data. thesesnrs are generally fainter than the known sample and may represent a previouslymissed population. one of our snrs is the second lmc remnant analyzed which islarger than any galactic remnant for which a definite size has beenestablished. the analysis of such a large remnant contributes to theunderstanding of the population of highly evolved snrs. we have obtained x-rayimages and spectra of three of these recently identified snrs using thexmm-newton observatory. these data, in conjunction with pre-existing opticalemission-line images and spectra, were used to determine the physicalconditions of the optical- and x-ray-emitting gas in the snrs. we have comparedthe morphologies of the snrs in the different wavebands. the physicalproperties of the warm ionized shell were determined from the h-alpha surfacebrightness and the snr expansion velocity. the x-ray spectra were fit with athermal plasma model and the physical conditions of the hot gas were derivedfrom the model fits. finally, we have compared our observations withsimulations of snr evolution.

1103.4612	a multiband study of the galaxy populations of the first four  sunyaev--zeldovich effect selected galaxy clusters	we present first results of an examination of the optical properties of thegalaxy populations in sze selected galaxy clusters. using clusters selected bythe south pole telescope survey and deep multiband optical data from the blancocosmology survey, we measure the radial profile, the luminosity function, theblue fraction and the halo occupation number of the galaxy populations of thesefour clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 1. our goal is to understandwhether there are differences among the galaxy populations of these szeselected clusters and previously studied clusters selected in the optical andthe x-ray. the radial distributions of galaxies in the four systems areconsistent with nfw profiles with a galaxy concentration of 3 to 6. we showthat the characteristic luminosities in $griz$ bands are consistent withpassively evolving populations emerging from a single burst at redshift $z=3$.the faint end power law slope of the luminosity function is found to be onaverage $\alpha \approx -1.2$ in griz. halo occupation numbers (to $m^*+2$) forthese systems appear to be consistent with those based on x-ray selectedclusters. the blue fraction estimated to $0.36l^*$, for the three lowerredshift systems, suggests an increase with redshift, although with the currentsample the uncertainties are still large. overall, this pilot study of thefirst four clusters provides no evidence that the galaxy populations in thesesystems differ significantly from those in previously studied clusterpopulations selected in the x-ray or the optical.

1108.4681	the serendipitous observation of a gravitationally lensed galaxy at z =  0.9057 from the blanco cosmology survey: the elliot arc	we report on the serendipitous discovery in the blanco cosmology survey (bcs)imaging data of a z = 0.9057 galaxy that is being strongly lensed by a massivegalaxy cluster at a redshift of z=0.3838. the lens (bcs j2352-5452) wasdiscovered while examining i- and z-band images being acquired in october 2006during a bcs observing run. follow-up spectroscopic observations with the gmosinstrument on the gemini south 8m telescope confirmed the lensing nature ofthis system. using weak plus strong lensing, velocity dispersion, clusterrichness n_200, and fitting to an nfw cluster mass density profile, we havemade three independent estimates of the mass m_200 which are all veryconsistent with each other. the combination of the results from the threemethods gives m_200 = (5.1 +- 1.3) x 10^14 m_sun, which is fully consistentwith the individual measurements. the final nfw concentration c_200 from thecombined fit is c_200 = 5.4(+1.4 -1.1). we have compared our measurements ofm_200 and c_200 with predictions for (a) clusters from lambda_cdm simulations,(b) lensing selected clusters from simulations, and (c) a real sample ofcluster lenses. we find that we are most compatible with the predictions forlambda_cdm simulations for lensing clusters, and we see no evidence based onthis one system for an increased concentration compared to lambda_cdm. finally,using the flux measured from the [oii]3727 line we have determined the starformation rate (sfr) of the source galaxy and find it to be rather modest giventhe assumed lens magnification.

0710.2338	constraining cosmic evolution of type ia supernovae	we present the first large-scale effort of creating composite spectra ofhigh-redshift type ia supernovae (sne ia) and comparing them to low-redshiftcounterparts. through the essence project, we have obtained 107 spectra of 88high-redshift sne ia with excellent light-curve information. in addition, wehave obtained 397 spectra of low-redshift sne through a multiple-decade effortat lick and keck observatories, and we have used 45 uv spectra obtained byhst/iue. the low-redshift spectra act as a control sample when comparing to theessence spectra. in all instances, the essence and lick composite spectraappear very similar. the addition of galaxy light to the lick composite spectraallows a nearly perfect match of the overall spectral-energy distribution withthe essence composite spectra, indicating that the high-redshift sne are morecontaminated with host-galaxy light than their low-redshift counterparts. thisis caused by observing objects at all redshifts with the same slit width, whichcorresponds to different projected distances. after correcting for thegalaxy-light contamination, subtle differences in the spectra remain. we haveestimated the systematic errors when using current spectral templates fork-corrections to be ~0.02 mag. the variance in the composite spectra give anestimate of the intrinsic variance in low-redshift maximum-light sn spectra of~3% in the optical and growing toward the uv. the difference between themaximum light low and high-redshift spectra constrain sn evolution between oursamples to be &lt; 10% in the rest-frame optical.

1112.2210	light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool eta carinae during its  19th-century great eruption	eta carinae (eta car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the milkyway. it became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century"great eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates ofbrightness). its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in thatit exceeded the eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. because it is only 2.3kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejectedmass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, eta carejected more than 10 m_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of atypical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. here we report thediscovery of light echoes of eta carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858great eruption. spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, whichare blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansionspeeds. the light-echo spectra correlate best with those of g2-g5 supergiantspectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 k. in contrast to the classof extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of eta car's great eruption,the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowedby standard opaque wind models. this indicates that other physical mechanismslike an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.

1202.3334	the optical depth of h ii regions in the magellanic clouds	we exploit ionization-parameter mapping as a powerful tool to measure theoptical depth of star-forming hii regions. our simulations using thephotoionization code cloudy and our new, surfbright surface brightnesssimulator demonstrate that this technique can directly diagnose mostdensity-bounded, optically thin nebulae using spatially resolved emission linedata. we apply this method to the large and small magellanic clouds, using thedata from the magellanic clouds emission line survey. we generate new hiiregion catalogs based on photoionization criteria set by the observedionization structure in the [sii]/[oiii] ratio and ha surface brightness. theluminosity functions from these catalogs generally agree with those fromha-only surveys. we then use ionization-parameter mapping to crudely classifyall the nebulae into optically thick vs optically thin categories, yieldingfundamental new insights into lyman continuum radiation transfer. we find thatin both galaxies, the frequency of optically thin objects correlates with haluminosity, and that the numbers of these objects dominate above log l\geq37.0.the frequencies of optically thin objects are 40% and 33% in the lmc and smc,respectively. similarly, the frequency of optically thick regions correlateswith h i column density, with optically thin objects dominating at the lowestn(hi). the integrated escape luminosity of ionizing radiation is dominated bythe largest regions, and corresponds to luminosity-weighted, ionizing escapefractions from the h ii region population of \geq0.42 and \geq0.40 in the lmcand smc, respectively. these values correspond to global galactic escapefractions of 4% and 11%, respectively. this is sufficient to power theionization rate of the observed diffuse ionized gas in both galaxies. ourresults suggest the possibility of significant galactic escape fractions oflyman continuum radiation.

(2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

1504.03002	wide-field lensing mass maps from des science verification data:  methodology and detailed analysis	weak gravitational lensing allows one to reconstruct the spatial distributionof the projected mass density across the sky. these "mass maps" provide apowerful tool for studying cosmology as they probe both luminous and darkmatter. in this paper, we present a weak lensing mass map reconstructed fromshear measurements in a 139 sq. deg area from the dark energy survey (des)science verification (sv) data. we compare the distribution of mass with thatof the foreground distribution of galaxies and clusters. the overdensities inthe reconstructed map correlate well with the distribution of opticallydetected clusters. we demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids alongthe line of sight can be identified, exploiting the tight scatter of thecluster photometric redshifts. we cross-correlate the mass map with aforeground magnitude-limited galaxy sample from the same data. our measurementgives results consistent with mock catalogs from n-body simulations thatinclude the primary sources of statistical uncertainties in the galaxy,lensing, and photo-z catalogs. the statistical significance of thecross-correlation is at the 6.8-sigma level with 20 arcminute smoothing. amajor goal of this study is to investigate systematic effects arising from avariety of sources, including psf and photo-z uncertainties. we make mapsderived from twenty variables that may characterize systematics and find theprincipal components. we find that the contribution of systematics to thelensing mass maps is generally within measurement uncertainties. in this work,we analyze less than 3% of the final area that will be mapped by the des; thetools and analysis techniques developed in this paper can be applied toforthcoming larger datasets from the survey.

1507.05090	weak lensing by galaxy troughs in des science verification data	we measure the weak lensing shear around galaxy troughs, i.e. the radialalignment of background galaxies relative to underdensities in projections ofthe foreground galaxy field over a wide range of redshift in scienceverification data from the dark energy survey. our detection of the shearsignal is highly significant (10 to 15$\sigma$ for the smallest angular scales)for troughs with the redshift range z in [0.2,0.5] of the projected galaxyfield and angular diameters of 10 arcmin...1{\deg}. these measurements probethe connection between the galaxy, matter density, and convergence fields. byassuming galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density with poissoniannoise, we find agreement of our measurements with predictions in a fiduciallambda cold dark matter model. the prediction for the lensing signal on largetrough scales is virtually independent of the details of the underlying modelfor the connection of galaxies and matter. our comparison of the shear aroundtroughs with that around cylinders with large galaxy counts is consistent witha symmetry between galaxy and matter over- and underdensities. in addition, wemeasure the two-point angular correlation of troughs with galaxies which, incontrast to the lensing signal, is sensitive to galaxy bias on all scales. thelensing signal of troughs and their clustering with galaxies is therefore apromising probe of the statistical properties of matter underdensities andtheir connection to the galaxy field.

1507.05360	galaxy clustering, photometric redshifts and diagnosis of systematics in  the des science verification data	we study the clustering of galaxies detected at $i&lt;22.5$ in the scienceverification observations of the dark energy survey (des). two-pointcorrelation functions are measured using $2.3\times 10^6$ galaxies over acontiguous 116 deg$^2$ region in five bins of photometric redshift width$\delta z = 0.2$ in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2.$ the impact of photometricredshift errors are assessed by comparing results using a template-basedphoto-$z$ algorithm (bpz) to a machine-learning algorithm (tpz). a companionpaper (leistedt et al 2015) presents maps of several observational variables(e.g. seeing, sky brightness) which could modulate the galaxy density. here wecharacterize and mitigate systematic errors on the measured clustering whicharise from these observational variables, in addition to others such asgalactic dust and stellar contamination. after correcting for systematiceffects we measure galaxy bias over a broad range of linear scales relative tomass clustering predicted from the planck $\lambda$cdm model, finding agreementwith cfhtls measurements with $\chi^2$ of 4.0 (8.7) with 5 degrees of freedomfor the tpz (bpz) redshifts. we test a "linear bias" model, in which the galaxyclustering is a fixed multiple of the predicted non-linear dark-matterclustering. the precision of the data allow us to determine that the linearbias model describes the observed galaxy clustering to $2.5\%$ accuracy down toscales at least $4$ to $10$ times smaller than those on which linear theory isexpected to be sufficient.

1507.05647	mapping and simulating systematics due to spatially-varying observing  conditions in des science verification data	spatially-varying depth and characteristics of observing conditions, such asseeing, airmass, or sky background, are major sources of systematicuncertainties in modern galaxy survey analyses, in particular in deepmulti-epoch surveys. we present a framework to extract and project thesesources of systematics onto the sky, and apply it to the dark energy survey(des) to map the observing conditions of the science verification (sv) data.the resulting distributions and maps of sources of systematics are used inseveral analyses of des sv to perform detailed null tests with the data, andalso to incorporate systematics in survey simulations. we illustrate thecomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the sv data with thebcc-ufig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the dessv images. we analyse the bcc-ufig simulation to construct galaxy samplesmimicking those used in sv galaxy clustering studies. we show that thespatially-varying survey depth imprinted in the observed galaxy densities andthe redshift distributions of the sv data are successfully reproduced by thesimulation and well-captured by the maps of observing conditions. the combineduse of the maps, the sv data and the bcc-ufig simulation allows us to quantifythe impact of spatial systematics on $n(z)$, the redshift distributionsinferred using photometric redshifts. we conclude that spatial systematics inthe sv data are mainly due to seeing fluctuations and are under control incurrent clustering and weak lensing analyses. the framework presented here isrelevant to all multi-epoch surveys, and will be essential for exploitingfuture surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst), which willrequire detailed null-tests and realistic end-to-end image simulations tocorrectly interpret the deep, high-cadence observations of the sky.

astro-ph;0104213	large scale diffuse x-ray emission from the large magellanic cloud	x-ray mosaics of the large magellanic cloud (lmc) taken with the rosatposition sensitive proportional counter (pspc) have revealed extensive diffusex-ray emission, indicative of hot &gt;= 10^6 k gas associated with this irregulargalaxy on scales from ~10 pc to &gt;= 1000 pc. we have selected regions oflarge-scale (d &gt;= 600 pc) diffuse x-ray emission, such as supergiant shells,the lmc spur, and the lmc bar, and examined the physical conditions of the hotgas associated with them. we find that for these objects the plasmatemperatures range from kt ~0.15 - 0.60 kev and the derived electron densitiesrange from n_e ~0.005 - 0.03 cm^-3. furthermore, we have examined the fractionof diffuse x-ray emission from the lmc and compared it to the total x-rayemission. we find that discrete sources such as x-ray binaries and supernovaremnants (snrs) account for ~41% and ~21% of the x-ray emission from the lmc,respectively. in contrast, diffuse x-ray emission from the field and fromsupergiant shells account for ~30% and ~6% of the total x-ray emission,respectively.

astro-ph;0105006	the distance to sn 1999em from the expanding photosphere method	we present optical and ir spectroscopy of the first two months of evolutionof the type ii sn 1999em. we combine these data with high-quality optical/irphotometry beginning only three days after shock breakout, in order to studythe performance of the ``expanding photosphere method'' (epm) in thedetermination of distances. with this purpose we develop a technique to measureaccurate photospheric velocities by cross-correlating observed and modelspectra. the application of this technique to sn 1999em shows that we can reachan average uncertainty of 11% in velocity from an individual spectrum. ouranalysis shows that epm is quite robust to the effects of dust. in particular,the distances derived from the vi filters change by only 7% when the adoptedvisual extinction in the host galaxy is varied by 0.45 mag. the superb timesampling of the bvizjhk light-curves of sn 1999em permits us to study theinternal consistency of epm and test the dilution factors computed fromatmosphere models for type ii plateau supernovae. we find that, in the firstweek since explosion, the epm distances are up to 50% lower than the average,possibly due the presence of circumstellar material. over the following 65days, on the other hand, our tests lend strong credence to the atmospheremodels, and confirm previous claims that epm can produce consistent distanceswithout having to craft specific models to each supernova. this is particularlytrue for the vi filters which yield distances with an internal consistency of4%. from the whole set of bvizjhk photometry, we obtain an average distance of7.5+/-0.5 mpc, where the quoted uncertainty (7%) is a conservative estimate ofthe internal precision of the method obtained from the analysis of the first 70days of the supernova evolution.

astro-ph;0308327	evolution of the nuclear accretion disk emission in ngc 1097: getting  closer to the black hole	we study the evolution of the broad, double-peaked halpha emission-lineprofile of the liner/seyfert 1 nucleus of ngc 1097, using 24 spectra obtainedover a time span of 11 yrs - from 1991 nov. through 2002 oct. while in thefirst 5 yrs the main variation was in the relative intensity of the blue andred peaks, in the last years we have also observed an increasing separationbetween the two peaks, at the same time as the integrated flux in the broadline has decreased. we propose a scenario in which the emission originates inan asymmetric accretion disk around a supermassive black hole, whose source ofionization is getting dimmer, causing the region of maximum emission to comecloser to the center (and thus to regions of higher projected velocity). we usethe observations to constrain the evolution of the accretion disk emission andto evaluate two models: the elliptical disk model previously found to reproducethe observations from 1991 to 1996 and a model of a circular disk with a singlespiral arm. we favor the latter, because the whole set of data is consistentwith a monotonic precession of the spiral pattern, which has completed almosttwo revolutions since 1991. the precession period implies a black hole mass ofapproximately 5x10^7 solar masses. finally, we have found tentative evidence ofthe emergence of an accretion disk wind, which we hope to explore further withfuture observations.

astro-ph;0610166	dust destruction in fast shocks of core-collapse supernova remnants in  the large magellanic cloud	we report observations with the mips instrument aboard the {\it spitzer spacetelescope} (sst) of four supernova remnants (snrs) believed to be the result ofcore-collapse sne: n132d (0525-69.6), n49b (0525-66.0), n23 (0506-68.0), and0453-68.5. all four of these snrs were detected in whole at 24 $\mu$m and inpart at 70 $\mu$m. comparisons with {\it chandra} broadband x-ray images showan association of infrared (ir) emission with the blast wave. we attribute theobserved ir emission to dust that has been collisionally heated by electronsand ions in the hot, x-ray emitting plasma, with grain size distributionsappropriate for the lmc and the destruction of small grains via sputtering byions. as with our earlier analysis of type ia snrs, models can reproduceobserved 70/24 $\mu$m ratios only if effects from sputtering are included,destroying small grains. we calculate the mass of dust swept up by the blastwave in these remnants, and we derive a dust-to-gas mass ratio of several timesless than the often assumed value of 0.25% for the lmc. we believe that oneexplanation for this discrepancy could be porous (fluffy) dust grains.

astro-ph;0701041	observational constraints on the nature of the dark energy: first  cosmological results from the essence supernova survey	we present constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter,w=p/(rho c^2), using 60 type ia supernovae (sne ia) from the essence supernovasurvey. we derive a set of constraints on the nature of the dark energyassuming a flat universe. by including constraints on (omega_m, w) from baryonacoustic oscillations, we obtain a value for a static equation-of-stateparameter w=-1.05^{+0.13}_{-0.12} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.11 (sys) andomega_m=0.274^{+0.033}_{-0.020} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fit chi^2/dof of0.96. these results are consistent with those reported by the supernova legacysurvey in a similar program measuring supernova distances and redshifts. weevaluate sources of systematic error that afflict supernova observations andpresent monte carlo simulations that explore these effects. currently, thelargest systematic currently with the potential to affect our measurements isthe treatment of extinction due to dust in the supernova host galaxies.combining our set of essence sne ia with the supernova legacy survey sne ia, weobtain a joint constraint of w=-1.07^{+0.09}_{-0.09} (stat; 1 sigma) +- 0.12(sys), omega_m=0.267^{+0.028}_{-0.018} (stat; 1 sigma) with a best-fitchi^2/dof of 0.91. the current sn ia data are fully consistent with acosmological constant.

astro-ph;0701043	the essence supernova survey: survey optimization, observations, and  supernova photometry	we describe the implementation and optimization of the essence supernovasurvey, which we have undertaken to measure the equation of state parameter ofthe dark energy. we present a method for optimizing the survey exposure timesand cadence to maximize our sensitivity to the dark energy equation of stateparameter w=p/rho c^2 for a given fixed amount of telescope time. for oursurvey on the ctio 4m telescope, measuring the luminosity distances andredshifts for supernovae at modest redshifts (z~0.5 +- 0.2) is optimal fordetermining w. we describe the data analysis pipeline based on using reliableand robust image subtraction to find supernovae automatically and in nearreal-time. since making cosmological inferences with supernovae reliescrucially on accurate measurement of their brightnesses, we describe ourefforts to establish a thorough calibration of the ctio 4m natural photometricsystem. in its first four years, essence has discovered and spectroscopicallyconfirmed 102 type ia sne, at redshifts from 0.10 to 0.78, identified throughan impartial, effective methodology for spectroscopic classification andredshift determination. we present the resulting light curves for the all typeia supernovae found by essence and used in our measurement of w, presented inwood-vasey et al, 2007.

astro-ph;9707260	time dilation from spectral feature age measurements of type ia  supernovae	we have developed a quantitative, empirical method for estimating the age oftype ia supernovae (sne ia) from a single spectral epoch. the techniqueexamines the goodness of fit of spectral features as a function of the temporalevolution of a large database of sne ia spectral features. when a sn iaspectrum with good signal-to-noise ratio over the rest frame range 3800 to 6800a is available, the precision of a spectral feature age (sfa) is (1-sigma) ~1.4 days. sfa estimates are made for two spectral epochs of sn 1996bj (z=0.574)to measure the rate of aging at high redshift. in the 10.05 days which elapsedbetween spectral observations, sn 1996bj aged 3.35 $\pm$ 3.2 days, consistentwith the 6.38 days of aging expected in an expanding universe and inconsistentwith no time dilation at the 96.4 % confidence level. the precision to whichindividual features constrain the supernova age has implications for the sourceof inhomogeneities among sne ia.

astro-ph;9710123	constraints on cosmological models from hubble space telescope  observations of high-z supernovae	we have coordinated hubble space telescope photometry with ground-baseddiscovery for three supernovae: two sn ia near z~0.5 (sn 1997ce, sn 1997cj) anda third event at z=0.97 (sn 1997ck). the superb spatial resolution of hstseparates each supernova from its host galaxy and leads to good precision inthe light curves. the hst data combined with ground-based photometry providegood temporal coverage. we use these light curves and relations betweenluminosity, light curve shape, and color calibrated from low-z samples toderive relative luminosity distances which are accurate to 10% at z~0.5 and 20%at z=1. the redshift-distance relation is used to place constraints on theglobal mean matter density, omega_matter, and the normalized cosmologicalconstant, omega_lambda. when the hst sample is combined with the distance to sn1995k (z=0.48), analyzed by the same precepts, it suggests that matter alone isinsufficient to produce a flat universe. specifically, foromega_matter+omega_lambda=1, omega_matter is less than 1 with &gt;95% confidence,and our best estimate of omega_matter is -0.1 +/- 0.5 if omega_lambda=0.although the present result is based on a very small sample whose systematicsremain to be explored, it demonstrates the power of hst measurements for highredshift supernovae.

astro-ph;9806396	supernova limits on the cosmic equation of state	we use type ia supernovae studied by the high-z supernova search team toconstrain the properties of an energy component which may have contributed toaccelerating the cosmic expansion. we find that for a flat geometry theequation of state parameter for the unknown component, alpha_x=p_x/rho_x, mustbe less than -0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of omega_m and is furtherlimited to alpha_x&lt;-0.60 (95%) if omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0.1 .these values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topologicaldefects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. the supernova data areconsistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x=-1) or a scalar field whichhas had, on average, an equation of state parameter similar to the cosmologicalconstant value of -1 over the redshift range of z=1 to the present. supernovaand cosmic microwave background observations give complementary constraints onthe densities of matter and the unknown component. if only matter and vacuumenergy are considered, then the current combined data sets provide directevidence for a spatially flat universe with omega_tot=omega_m+omega_lambda =0.94 +/- 0.26 (1-sigma).

astro-ph;9912229	a mystery solved: the mass ratio of the dwarf nova em cygni	we have discovered that the spectrum of the well-known dwarf nova em cyg iscontaminated by light from a k2-5v star (in addition to the k-type mass donorstar). the k2-5v star contributes approximately 16 per cent of the light fromthe system and if not taken into account has a considerable effect upon radialvelocity measurements of the mass donor star. we obtain a new radial velocityamplitude for the mass donor star of k2 = 202 +/- 3 km/s, which compares withthe value of k2 = 135 +/- 3 km/s obtained in stover, robinson &amp; nather'sclassic 1981 study of em cyg. the revised value of the amplitude combined witha measurement of rotational broadening of the mass donor vsini = 140 +/- 6km/s, leads to a new mass ratio of q = m2/m1 = 0.88 +/- 0.05. this solves along standing problem with em cyg because stover et al.'s measurementsindicated a mass ratio q &gt; 1, a value which should have led to dynamicallyunstable mass transfer for the secondary mass deduced by stover et al. therevised value of the mass ratio combined with the orbital inclination i = 67+/- 2 degrees leads to masses of 0.99 +/- 0.12 msun and 1.12 +/- 0.08 msun forthe mass donor and white dwarf respectively. the mass donor is evolved, sinceit has a later spectral type (k3) than its mass would imply. we discuss whetherthe k star could be physically associated with em cyg or not, and present theresults of the spectroscopic study.

astro-ph;9912363	calibration of nebular emission-line diagnostics: i. stellar effective  temperatures	we present a detailed comparison of optical h ii region spectra tophotoionization models based on modern stellar atmosphere models. we examineboth spatially resolved and integrated emission-line spectra of the hii regionsdem l323, dem l243, dem l199, and dem l301 in the large magellanic cloud. thepublished spectral classifications of the dominant stars range from o7 to wn3,and morphologies range from stromgren sphere to shell structure. two of theobjects include snr contamination. the overall agreement with the predictionsis generally within 0.2 dex for major diagnostic line ratios. an apparentpattern in the remaining discrepancies is that the predicted t_e is ~1000 khotter than observed. (abridged)  our analysis of the complex dem l199 allows a nebular emission-line test ofunprecedented detail for wr atmospheres. surprisingly, we find no nebular he ii4686 emission, despite the fact that both of the dominant wn3 stars should behot enough to fully ionize he i in their atmospheres.  we confirm that the \eta-prime emission-line parameter is not as useful ashoped for determining the ionizing stellar effective temperature, t*. bothempirically and theoretically, we find that it is insensitive for t* &gt;40 kk,and that it also varies spatially. the shock-contaminated objects show that\eta-prime will also yield a spuriously high t* in the presence of shocks. itis furthermore sensitive to shell morphology. we suggest [ne iii]/hb as anadditional probe of t*. although it is abundance-dependent, [ne iii]/hb hashigher sensitivity to t*, is independent of morphology, and is insensitive toshocks in our objects. we attempt a first empirical calibration of thesenebular diagnostics of t*.

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
