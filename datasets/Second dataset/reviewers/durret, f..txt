0906.4443	very deep spectroscopy of the coma cluster line of sight: exploring new  territories	environmental effects have an important influence on cluster galaxies, butstudies at very faint magnitudes (r&gt;21) are almost exclusively based onimaging. we present here a very deep spectroscopic survey of galaxies on theline of sight to coma, based on redshifts obtained with vlt/vimos for 715galaxies in the unprecedented magnitude range 21&lt;r&lt;23 (absolute magnitude -14to -12). we confirm the substructures previously identified in coma by adami etal. (2005a), and identify three new ones. we detect many groups behind coma: alarge structure at z~0.5, the sdss great wall, and a large and very youngstructure at z~0.054. these structures account for the mass maps derived from arecent weak lensing analysis by gavazzi et al. (2009). the orbits of dwarfgalaxies are probably anisotropic and radial, and could originate from fieldgalaxies radially falling into the cluster. spectral characteristics of comadwarf galaxies show that red or absorption line galaxies have larger stellarmasses and are older than blue or emission line galaxies. r&lt;22 galaxies showless prominent absorption lines than r&gt;22 galaxies. this trend is less clearfor field galaxies, suggesting that part of the faint coma galaxies could havebeen recently injected from the field following the ngc 4911 group infall. wepresent a list of five ultra compact dwarf galaxy candidates. we also globallyconfirm spectroscopically our previous results on the galaxy luminosityfunctions and find that dwarf galaxies follow a red sequence similar to thatdrawn by bright galaxies. dwarf galaxies are very abundant in coma, and arepartly field galaxies that have fallen onto the cluster along filaments.

0907.0643	cluster and cluster galaxy evolution history from ir to x-ray  observations of the young cluster rx j1257.2+4738 at z=0.866	the cosmic time around the z~1 redshift range appears crucial in the clusterand galaxy evolution, since it is probably the epoch of the first mature galaxyclusters. our knowledge of the properties of the galaxy populations in theseclusters is limited because only a handful of z~1 clusters are presently known.in this framework, we report the discovery of a z~0.87 cluster and study itsproperties at various wavelengths. we gathered x-ray and optical data (imagingand spectroscopy), and near and far infrared data (imaging) in order to confirmthe cluster nature of our candidate, to determine its dynamical state, and togive insight on its galaxy population evolution. our candidate structureappears to be a massive z~0.87 dynamically young cluster with an atypicallyhigh x-ray temperature as compared to its x-ray luminosity. it exhibits asignificant percentage ~90% of galaxies that are also detected in the 24micronband. the cluster rxj1257.2+4738 appears to be still in the process ofcollapsing. its relatively high temperature is probably the consequence ofsignificant energy input into the intracluster medium besides the regulargravitational infall contribution. a significant part of its galaxies are redobjects that are probably dusty with on-going star formation.

0707.0566	coma cluster object populations down to m_r~-9.5	this study follows a recent analysis of the galaxy luminosity functions andcolour-magnitude red sequences in the coma cluster (adami et al. 2007). weanalyze here the distribution of very faint galaxies and globular clusters inan east-west strip of $\sim 42 \times 7$ arcmin$^2$ crossing the coma clustercenter (hereafter the cs strip) down to the unprecedented faint absolutemagnitude of m$_r \sim -9.5$. this work is based on deep images obtained at thecfht with the cfh12k camera in the b, r, and i bands. the analysis shows thatthe observed properties strongly depend on the environment, and thus on thecluster history. when the cs is divided into four regions, the westernmostregion appears poorly populated, while the regions around the brightestgalaxies ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 (ngc 4874 and ngc 4889 being masked) aredominated by faint blue galaxies. they show a faint luminosity function slopeof -2, very significantly different from the field estimates. results arediscussed in the framework of galaxy destruction (which can explain part of thevery faint galaxy population) and of structures infalling on to coma.

0907.5306	the cluster abell 780: an optical view	the abell 780 cluster, better known as the hydra a cluster, has beenthouroughly analyzed in x-rays. however, little is known on its opticalproperties. we derive the galaxy luminosity function (glf) in this apparentlyrelaxed cluster, and search for possible environmental effects by comparing theglfs in various regions, and by looking at the galaxy distribution at largescale around abell 780. our study is based on optical images obtained with theeso 2.2m telescope and wfi camera in the b and r bands, covering a total regionof 67.22x32.94 arcmin^2, or 4.235x2.075 mpc^2 for a cluster redshift of 0.0539.in a region of 500 kpc radius around the cluster centre, the glf in the r bandshows a double structure, with a broad and flat bright part and a flat faintend that can be fit by a power law with an index alpha=-0.85+-0.12 in the20.25&lt;r&lt;21.75 interval. if we divide this 500 kpc radius region in north+southor east+west halves, we find no clear difference between the glfs in thesesmaller regions. no obvious large scale structure is apparent within 5 mpc fromthe cluster, based on galaxy redshifts and magnitudes collected from the neddatabase in a much larger region than that covered by our data, suggesting thatthere is no major infall of material in any preferential direction. however,the serna-gerbal method reveals the presence of a gravitationally boundstructure of 27 galaxies, which includes the cd, and of a more stronglygravitationally bound structure of 14 galaxies. these optical results agreewith the overall relaxed structure of abell 780 previously derived from x-rayanalyses.

0910.3827	galaxy cluster searches by photometric redshifts in the cfhtls	in order to enlarge publicly available optical cluster catalogs, inparticular at high redshift, we have performed a systematic search for clustersof galaxies in the cfhtls. we used the le phare photometric redshifts for thegalaxies detected with magnitude limits of i'=25 and 23 for the deep and widefields respectively. we then constructed galaxy density maps in photometricredshift bins of 0.1 based on an adaptive kernel technique and detectedstructures with sextractor. in order to assess the validity of our clusterdetection rates, we applied a similar procedure to galaxies in millenniumsimulations. we measured the correlation function of our cluster candidates. weanalyzed large scale properties and substructures by applying a minimalspanning tree algorithm both to our data and to the millennium simulations. wehave detected 1200 candidate clusters with various masses (minimal massesbetween 1.0 10$^{13}$ and 5.5 10$^{13}$ and mean masses between 1.3 10$^{14}$and 12.6 10$^{14}$ m$_\odot$), thus notably increasing the number of known highredshift cluster candidates. we found a correlation function for these objectscomparable to that obtained for high redshift cluster surveys. we also showthat the cfhtls deep survey is able to trace the large scale structure of theuniverse up to z$\geq$1. our detections are fully consistent with those made invarious cfhtls analyses with other methods. we now need accurate massdeterminations of these structures to constrain cosmological parameters.

1005.3295	the clusters abell~222 and abell~223: a multi-wavelength view	(abstract abridged) the abell 222 and 223 clusters are located at an averageredshift z ~ 0.21 and are separated by 0.26 deg. signatures of mergers havebeen previously found in these clusters, both in x-rays and atopticalwavelengths, thus motivating our study. in x-rays, they are relativelybright, and abell 223 shows a double structure. a filament has also beendetected between the clusters both at optical and x-ray wavelengths. we analysethe optical properties of these two clusters based on deep imaging in twobands, derive their galaxy minosity functions (glfs) and correlate theseproperties with x-ray characteristics derived from xmm-newton data. the glfs ofabell 222 in the g' and r' bands are well fit by a schechter function; the glfis steeper in r' than in g'. for abell 223, the glfs in both bands require asecond component at bright magnitudes, added to a schechter function; they aresimilar in both bands. the serna &amp; gerbal method allows to separate well thetwo clusters. no obvious filamentary structures are detected at very largescales around the clusters, but a third cluster at the same redshift, abell209, is located at a projected distance of 19.2 mpc. x-ray temperature andmetallicity maps reveal that the temperature and metallicity of the x-ray gasare quite homogeneous in abell 222, while they are very perturbed in abell 223.the abell 222/abell 223 system is complex. the two clusters that form thisstructure present very different dynamical states. signs of recent interactionsare also detected in the optical data where this cluster shows a ``perturbed''glf. in summary, the multiwavelength analyses of abell 222 and abell 223 areused to investigate the connection between the icm and the cluster galaxyproperties in an interacting system.

1008.5318	the daft/fada survey. i.photometric redshifts along lines of sight to  clusters in the z=[0.4,0.9] interval	as a contribution to the understanding of the dark energy concept, the darkenergy american french team (daft, in french fada) has started a large projectto characterize statistically high redshift galaxy clusters, infer cosmologicalconstraints from weak lensing tomography, and understand biases relevant forconstraining dark energy and cluster physics in future cluster and cosmologicalexperiments. the purpose of this paper is to establish the basis of referencefor the photo-z determination used in all our subsequent papers, including weaklensing tomography studies. this project is based on a sample of 91 highredshift (z&gt;0.4), massive clusters with existing hst imaging, for which we arepresently performing complementary multi-wavelength imaging. this allows us inparticular to estimate spectral types and determine accurate photometricredshifts for galaxies along the lines of sight to the first ten clusters forwhich all the required data are available down to a limit of i_ab=24/24.5 withthe lephare software. the accuracy in redshift is of the order of 0.05 for therange 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.5. we verified that the technique applied to obtain photometricredshifts works well by comparing our results to with previous works. inclusters, photoz accuracy is degraded for bright absolute magnitudes and forthe latest and earliest type galaxies. the photoz accuracy also only slightlyvaries as a function of the spectral type for field galaxies. as a consequence,we find evidence for an environmental dependence of the photoz accuracy,interpreted as the standard used spectral energy distributions being not verywell suited to cluster galaxies. finally, we modeled the lcdcs 0504 mass withthe strong arcs detected along this line of sight.

1010.0981	morphological properties of superclusters of galaxies	we studied superclusters of galaxies in a volume-limited sample extractedfrom the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 (sdss/dr7) and from mockcatalogues based on a semi-analytical model of galaxy evolution in themillenium simulation. a density field method was applied to a sample ofgalaxies brighter than $m_r= -21+5 \log h_{100}$ to identify superclusters,taking into account selection and boundary effects. in order to evaluate theinfluence of threshold density, we have chosen two thresholds: the firstmaximizes the number of objects (d1), and the second constrains the maximumsupercluster size to $\sim$120~h$^{-1}$mpc (d2). we have performed amorphological analysis, using minkowski functionals, based on a parameter whichincreases monotonically from filaments to pancakes. an anti-correlation wasfound between supercluster richness (and total luminosity or size) and themorphological parameter, indicating that filamentary structures tend to bericher, larger and more luminous than pancakes in both observed and mockcatalogues. we have also used the mock samples to compare superclustermorphologies identified in position and velocity spaces, concluding that ourmorphological classification is not biased by the peculiar velocities. montecarlo simulations designed to investigate the reliability of our results withrespect to random fluctuations show that these results are robust. our analysisindicates that filaments and pancakes present different luminosity and sizedistributions.

1102.2175	the merging cluster abell 1758 revisited: multi-wavelength observations  and numerical simulations	[abriged] we discuss here the properties of the double cluster abell 1758, ata redshift z~0.279, which shows strong evidence for merging. we analyse theoptical properties of the north and south clusters of abell 1758 based on deepimaging obtained with the cfht archive megaprime/megacam camera in the g' andr' bands, covering a total region of about 1.05 x 1.16 deg^2. our x-rayanalysis is based on archive xmm-newton images. numerical simulations wereperformed using an n-body algorithm to treat the dark matter component, asemi-analytical galaxy formation model for the evolution of the galaxies and agrid-based hydrodynamic code with a ppm scheme for the dynamics of theintra-cluster medium. we have computed galaxy luminosity functions (glfs) and2d temperature and metallicity maps of the x-ray gas, which we then compared tothe results of our numerical simulations. the glfs of abell 1758 north are wellfit by schechter functions in the g' and r' bands, but a small excess of brightgalaxies, particularly in the r' band. on the contrary, the glfs of abell 1758south are not well fit by schechter functions: excesses of bright galaxies areseen in both bands. comparing observational results to those derived fromnumerical simulations, we could mimic the most prominent features present inthe metallicity map and propose an explanation for the dynamical history of thecluster. particilarly, we found in particular that in the metal rich elongatedregions of the north cluster, winds had been more efficient in transportingmetal enriched gas to the outskirts than ram pressure stripping. we confirm themerging structure of each of the north and south clusters, both at optical andx-ray wavelengths.

1106.1657	spitzer observations of abell 1763. iii. the infrared luminosity  function in different supercluster environments	we determine the galaxy infrared (ir) luminosity function (lf) as a functionof the environment in a supercluster at z=0.23, using optical, near-ir, andmid- to far-ir photometry, as well as redshifts from optical spectroscopy. weidentify 467 supercluster members in a sample of 24-micron-selected galaxies,on the basis of their spectroscopic (153) and photometric (314) redshifts. irluminosities, stellar masses and star formation rates (sfrs) are determined forsupercluster members via spectral energy distribution fitting and the kennicuttrelation. galaxies with active galactic nuclei are excluded from the sample. wedetermine the ir lf of the whole supercluster as well as the ir lfs of threedifferent regions in the supercluster: the cluster core, a large-scalefilament, and the cluster outskirts (excluding the filament). the ir lf showsan environmental dependence which is not simply related to the local galaxydensity. the filament, an intermediate-density region in the a1763supercluster, contains the highest fraction of ir-emitting galaxies at alllevels of ir luminosities. as expected, the core contains the lowest fractionof ir-emitting galaxies and almost no luminous ir galaxies (lirgs). therelation between galaxy specific sfrs and stellar masses does not depend on theenvironment, and it indicates that most supercluster lirgs (in particular thosein the filament) are rather massive galaxies with relatively low specific sfrs.a comparison with previous ir lf determinations from the literature confirmsthat the mass-normalized total sfr in clusters increases with redshift, butmore rapidly than previously suggested for redshifts &lt;0.4. we interpret ourfindings within a possible scenario for the evolution of galaxies in and aroundclusters [abridged].

1109.0850	galaxy cluster searches based on photometric redshifts in the four  cfhtls wide fields	we have developed a method for detecting clusters in large imaging surveys,based on the detection of structures in galaxy density maps made in slices ofphotometric redshifts. this method was first applied to the canada francehawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) deep 1 field by mazure et al. (2007),then to all the deep and wide cfhtls fields available in the t0004 data releaseby adami et al. (2010). the validity of the cluster detection rate wasestimated by applying the same procedure to galaxies from the millenniumsimulation. here we analyse with the same method the full cfhtls wide survey,based on the t0006 data release. in a total area of 154 deg2, we have detected4061 candidate clusters at 3sigma or above (6802 at 2sigma and above), in theredshift range 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=1.15, with estimated mean masses between 1.3 10^14 and12.6 10^14 m_solar. this catalogue of candidate clusters will be availableonline via vizier. we compare our detections with those made in various cfhtlsanalyses with other methods. by stacking a subsample of clusters, we show thatthis subsample has typical cluster characteristics (colour-magnitude relation,galaxy luminosity function). we also confirm that the cluster-clustercorrelation function is comparable to that obtained for other cluster surveysand analyze large scale filamentary galaxy distributions. we have increased thenumber of known optical high redshift cluster candidates by a large factor, animportant step towards obtaining reliable cluster counts to measurecosmological parameters. the clusters that we detect behave as expected for asample of clusters fed by filaments at the intersection of which they arelocated.

1109.3967	intracluster light in clusters of galaxies at redshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8	the study of intracluster light can help us to understand the mechanismstaking place in galaxy clusters, and to place constraints on the clusterformation history and physical properties. however, owing to the intrinsicfaintness of icl emission, most searches and detailed studies of icl have beenlimited to redshifts z&lt;0.4.we search for icl in a subsample of ten clustersdetected by the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs), at redshifts 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8,that are also part of our daft/fada survey. we analyze the icl by applying theov wav package, a wavelet-based technique, to deep hst acs images in the f814wfilter and to v-band vlt/fors2 images of three clusters. detection levels areassessed as a function of the diffuse light source surface brightness usingsimulations. in the f814w filter images, we detect diffuse light sources in allthe clusters, with typical sizes of a few tens of kpc (assuming that they areat the cluster redshifts). the icl detected by stacking the ten f814w imagesshows an 8sigma detection in the source center extending over a ~50x50kpc2area, with a total absolute magnitude of -21.6 in the f814w filter, equivalentto about two l* galaxies per cluster. we find a weak correlation between thetotal f814w absolute magnitude of the icl and the cluster velocity dispersionand mass. there is no apparent correlation between the cluster mass-to-lightratio (m/l) and the amount of icl, and no evidence for any preferentialorientation in the icl source distribution. we find no strong variation in theamount of icl between z=0 and z=0.8. in addition, we find wavelet-detectedcompact objects (wdcos) in the three clusters for which data in two bands areavailable; these objects are probably very faint compact galaxies that in somecases are members of the respective clusters. we have shown that icl isimportant in clusters at least up to z=0.8.

1202.2022	comparison of the properties of two fossil groups of galaxies with the  normal group ngc 6034 based on multiband imaging and optical spectroscopy	we collected multiband imaging and spectroscopy for two fossil groups (rxj1119.7+2126 and 1rxs j235814.4+150524) and one normal group (ngc 6034). wecomputed photometric redshifts in the central zones of each group, combiningprevious data with the sdss five-band data. for each group we investigated thered sequence (rs) of the color-magnitude relation and computed the luminosityfunctions, stellar population ages and distributions of the group members.spectroscopy allowed us to investigate the large-scale surroundings of thesegroups and the substructure levels in 1rxs j235814.4+150524 and ngc 6034. thelarge-scale environment of 1rxs j235814.4+150524 is poor, though its galaxydensity map shows a clear signature of the surrounding cosmic web. rxj1119.7+2126 appears to be very isolated, while the cosmic environment of ngc6034 is very rich. at the group scale, 1rxs j235814.4+150524 shows nosubstructure. galaxies with recent stellar populations seem preferentiallylocated in the group outskirts. a rs is discernable for all three groups in acolor-magnitude diagram. the luminosity functions based on photometric redshiftselection and on statistical background subtraction have comparable shapes, andagree with the few points obtained from spectroscopic redshifts. theseluminosity functions show the expected dip between first and second brightestgalaxies for the fossil groups only. their shape is also regular and relativelyflat at faint magnitudes down to the completeness level for rx j1119.7+2126 andngc 6034, while there is a clear lack of faint galaxies for 1rxsj235814.4+150524. rx j1119.7+2126 is definitely classified as a fossil group;1rxs j235814.4+150524 also has properties very close to those of a fossilgroup, while we confirm that ngc 6034 is a normal group.

0711.4951	the galaxy luminosity function of the abell 496 cluster and its spatial  variations	we investigate the lf in the very relaxed cluster abell 496. our analysis isbased on deep images obtained at cfht with megaprime/megacam in four bands(ugri) covering a 1x1 deg2 region, which is centered on the cluster abell 496and extends to near its virial radius. the lfs are estimated by statisticallysubtracting a reference field taken as the mean of the 4 deep fields of thecfhtls survey. background contamination is minimized by cutting out galaxiesredder than the observed red sequence in the g-i versus i colour-magnitudediagram. in abell 496, the global lfs show a faint-end slope alpha=-1.55+/-0.06and vary little with observing band. without colour cuts, the lfs are muchnoisier but not significantly steeper. the faint-end slopes show astatistically significant steepening from alpha=-1.4+/-0.1 in the centralregion (extending to half a virial radius) to -1.8+/-0.1 in the southernenvelope of the cluster. cosmic variance and uncertain star-galaxy separationare our main limiting factors in measuring the faint-end of the lfs. thelarge-scale environment of abell 496, probed with the fairly complete 6dfgscatalogue, shows a statistically significant 36 mpc long filament at pa=137deg, but we do not find an enhanced lf along this axis. our lfs do not displaythe large number of dwarf galaxies (alpha ~ -2) inferred by several authors,whose analyses may suffer from field contamination caused by inexistent orinadequate colour cuts. alternatively, different clusters may have differentfaint-end slopes, but this is hard to reconcile with the wide range of slopesfound for given clusters and for wide sets of clusters.

1212.6158	diffuse light in the young cluster of galaxies cl j1449+0856 at z=2.07	cluster properties do not seem to be changing significantly during theirmature evolution phase, for example they do not seem to show strong dynamicalevolution at least up to z~0.5, their galaxy red sequence is already in placeat least up to z$\sim$1.2, and their diffuse light content remains stable up toz~0.8. the question is now to know if cluster properties can evolve moresignificantly at redshifts notably higher than 1. we propose here to see howthe properties of the intracluster light (icl) evolve with redshift bydetecting and analysing the icl in the x-ray cluster cl j1449+0856 at z=2.07(discovered by gobat et al. 2011), based on deep hst nicmos h band exposures.weused the same wavelet-based method as that applied to 10 clusters between z=0.4and 0.8 by guennou et al. (2012). we detect three diffuse light sources withrespective total magnitudes of h=24.8, 25.5, and 25.9, plus a more compactobject with a magnitude h=25.3. we discuss the significance of our detectionsand show that they are robust. the three sources of diffuse light indicate anelongation along a north-east south-west axis, similar to that of thedistribution of the central galaxies and to the x-ray elongation. this stronglysuggests a history of merging events along this direction. while guennou et al.(2012) found a roughly constant amount of diffuse light for clusters betweenz~0 and 0.8, we put in evidence at least a 1.5 magnitude increase between z~0.8and 2. if we assume that the amount of diffuse light is directly linked to theinfall activity on the cluster, this implies that cl j1449+0856 is stillundergoing strong merging events.

1304.6061	a comprehensive picture of baryons in groups and clusters of galaxies	(abridged) based on xmm-newton, chandra and sdss data, we investigate thebaryon distribution in groups and clusters and its use as a cosmologicalconstraint. for this, we considered a sample of 123 systems, with total massesin the mass range m500 = ~ 10^13 - 4 x 10^15 h_70^-1 msun.  the gas masses and total masses are derived from x-ray data under theassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry. the stellarmasses are based on sdss-dr8 data. for the 37 systems out of 123 that had bothoptical and x-ray data available, we investigated the gas, stellar and totalbaryon mass fractions inside r2500 and r500, and the differential gas massfraction within the spherical annulus between r2500 and r500, as a function oftotal mass. for the other objects, we investigated the gas mass fraction only.we find that the gas mass fraction inside r2500 and r500 depends on the totalmass.  however, the differential gas mass fraction does not show any dependence ontotal mass for systems with m500 &gt; 10^14 msun. we find that the total baryoniccontent increases with cluster mass. this led us to investigate thecontribution of the icl to the total baryon budget for lower mass systems, butwe find that it cannot account for the difference observed. the gas massfraction dependence on total mass observed for groups and clusters could be dueto the difficulty of low-mass systems to retain gas inside the inner region.due to their shallower potential well, non-thermal processes are more effectivein expelling the gas from their central regions outwards. since thedifferential gas mass fraction is nearly constant it provides betterconstraints for cosmology.  using our total f_b estimates, our results imply 0.17 &lt; omega_m &lt; 0.55.

1403.3614	the mass profile and dynamical status of the z~0.8 galaxy cluster lcdcs  0504	constraints on the mass distribution in high-redshift clusters of galaxiesare not currently very strong. we aim to constrain the mass profile, m(r), anddynamical status of the $z \sim 0.8$ lcdcs 0504 cluster of galaxiescharacterized by prominent giant gravitational arcs near its center. ouranalysis is based on deep x-ray, optical, and infrared imaging, as well asoptical spectroscopy. we model the mass distribution of the cluster with threedifferent mass density profiles, whose parameters are constrained by the stronglensing features of the inner cluster region, by the x-ray emission from theintra-cluster medium, and by the kinematics of 71 cluster members. we obtainconsistent m(r) determinations from three methods (dispersion-kurtosis,caustics and mamposst), out to the cluster virial radius and beyond. the massprofile inferred by the strong lensing analysis in the central cluster regionis slightly above, but still consistent with, the kinematics estimate. on theother hand, the x-ray based m(r) is significantly below both the kinematics andstrong lensing estimates. theoretical predictions from $\lambda$cdm cosmologyfor the concentration--mass relation are in agreement with our observationalresults, when taking into account the uncertainties in both the observationaland theoretical estimates. there appears to be a central deficit in theintra-cluster gas mass fraction compared to nearby clusters. despite therelaxed appearance of this cluster, the determinations of its mass profile bydifferent probes show substantial discrepancies, the origin of which remains tobe determined. the extension of a similar dynamical analysis to other clustersof the daft/fada survey will allow to shed light on the possible systematicsthat affect the determination of mass profiles of high-z clusters, possiblyrelated to our incomplete understanding of intracluster baryon physics.

1412.5023	two spectroscopically confirmed galaxy structures at z=0.61 and 0.74 in  the cfhtls deep~3 field	adami et al. (2010) have detected several cluster candidates at z&gt;0.5 as partof a systematic search for clusters in the canada france hawaii telescopelegacy survey, based on photometric redshifts. we focus here on two of them,located in the d3 field: d3-6 and d3-43. we have obtained spectroscopy withgemini/gmos and measured redshifts for 23 and 14 galaxies in the twostructures. these redshifts were combined with those available in theliterature. a dynamical and a weak lensing analysis were also performed,together with the study of x-ray chandra archive data. cluster d3-6 is found tobe a single structure of 8 spectroscopically confirmed members at an averageredshift z=0.607, with a velocity dispersion of 423 km/s. it appears to be arelatively low mass cluster. d3-43-s3 has 46 spectroscopically confirmedmembers at an average redshift z=0.739. it can be decomposed into two mainsubstructures, having a velocity dispersion of about 600 and 350 km/s. anexplanation to the fact that d3-43-s3 is detected through weak lensing (onlymarginally, at the ~3sigma level) but not in x-rays could be that the twosubstructures are just beginning to merge more or less along the line of sight.we also show that d3-6 and d3-43-s3 have similar global galaxy luminosityfunctions, stellar mass functions, and star formation rate (sfr) distributions.the only differences are that d3-6 exhibits a lack of faint early typegalaxies, a deficit of extremely high stellar mass galaxies compared tod3-43-s3, and an excess of very high sfr galaxies. this study shows the powerof techniques based on photometric redshifts to detect low to moderatelymassive structures, even at z~0.75.

1502.00522	the extended heii4686-emitting region in izw18 unveiled: clues for  peculiar ionizing sources	new integral field spectroscopy has been obtained for izw18, the nearbylowest-metallicity galaxy considered our best local analog of systems formingat high-z. here we report the spatially resolved spectral map of the nebularheii4686 emission in izw18, from which we derived for the first time its totalheii-ionizing flux. nebular heii emission implies the existence of a hardradiation field. heii-emitters are observed to be more frequent among high-zgalaxies than for local objects. so investigating the heii-ionizing source(s)in izw18 may reveal the ionization processes at high-z. heii emission instar-forming galaxies, has been suggested to be mainly associated withwolf-rayet stars (wrs), but wrs cannot satisfactorily explain theheii-ionization at all times, in particular at lowest metallicities. shocksfrom supernova remnants, or x-ray binaries, have been proposed as additionalpotential sources of heii-ionizing photons. our data indicate that conventionalheii-ionizing sources (wrs, shocks, x-ray binaries) are not sufficient toexplain the observed nebular heii4686 emission in izw18. we find that theheii-ionizing radiation expected from models for either low-metallicitysuper-massive o stars or rotating metal-free stars could account for theheii-ionization budget measured, while only the latter models could explain thehighest values of heii4686/hbeta observed. the presence of such peculiar starsin izw18 is suggestive and further investigation in this regard is needed. thisletter highlights that some of the clues of the early universe can be foundhere in our cosmic backyard.

0806.4262	an optical view of the filament region of abell 85	we compare the distribution of optically and halpha (ha) selected galaxies inthe southern half of the nearby abell 85 (a85) cluster with the recentlydiscovered x-ray filament (xrf). we search for galaxies where star formation(sf) may have been triggered by interactions with intracluster gas or tidalpressure due to the cluster potential when entering the cluster. our analysisis based on images obtained with cfht megaprime/megacam (1x1 deg2 field) infour bands (ugri) and eso 2.2mwfi (38'x36' field) in a narrow band filtercorresponding to the redshifted halpha (ha) line and in a broad r-band filter.the lfs are estimated by statistically subtracting a reference field.background contamination is minimized by cutting out galaxies redder than theobserved red sequence in the g-i vs. i colour-magnitude diagram. the galaxydistribution shows a significantly flattened cluster, whose principal axis isslightly offset from the xrf. the analysis of the broad band lfs shows that thefilament region is well populated. the filament is also independently detectedas a gravitationally bound structure by the serna &amp; gerbal hierarchical method.101 galaxies are detected in ha, among which 23 have spectroscopic redshifts inthe cluster, 2 have spectroscopic redshifts higher than the cluster and 58 havephotometric redshifts that tend to indicate that they are backgroundobjects.the 23 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the cluster are mostlyconcentrated in the south part of the cluster and along the filament. we find anumber of galaxies showing evidence for sf in the xrf, and all our results areconsistent with the previous hypothesis that the xrf in a85 is agravitationally bound structure made of groups falling on to the main cluster.

astro-ph;0006247	near-infrared photometry of isolated spirals with and without an agn.  ii: photometric properties of the host galaxies	we present the analysis of morphological and photometric properties of asample of isolated spirals with (18) and without (11) an active nucleus, basedon near-infrared imaging in the j and k' bands. the aim of this analysis is tofind the differential properties that could be directly connected with thephenomenon of nuclear activity. we stress the importance of using isolatedobjects for that purpose. our study shows that both sets of galaxies aresimilar in their global properties: they define the same kormendy relation,their disk components share the same properties, the bulge and disk scalelengths are correlated in a similar way, bar strengths and lengths are similarfor primary bars. hosts of isolated seyfert galaxies have bulge and diskproperties comparable to those of isolated non active spirals. central colors(the innermost 200 pc) of active galaxies are redder than the centers of nonactive spirals, most probably due to agn light being re-emitted by the hot dustand/or due to circumnuclear star formation, through the contribution ofgiants/supergiants. only one of the seyfert galaxies in our sample does notpresent a primary bar,but both primary and secondary bars are equally presentin active and control objects. secondary central elongations (associated withsecondary bars, lenses, rings or disks) may be somewhat different. numericalmodels indicate that such secondary bars are not strictly necessary to feed thecentral engine when a primary bar is present. our results show that down toscales of 100-300 pc, there are no obvious differences between active and nonactive spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0009474	energy, entropy and mass scaling relations for elliptical galaxies.  towards a physical understanding of their photometric properties	in the present paper, we show that elliptical galaxies (es) obey a scalingrelation between potential energy and mass. since they are relaxed systems in apost violent-relaxation stage, they are quasi-equilibrium gravitational systemsand therefore they also have a quasi-constant specific entropy.  assuming that light traces mass, these two laws imply that in the spacedefined by the three s\'ersic law parameters (intensity sigma_0, scale a andshape nu), elliptical galaxies are distributed on two intersecting 2-manifolds:the entropic surface and the energy-mass surface.  using a sample of 132 galaxies belonging to three nearby clusters, we haveverified that ellipticals indeed follow these laws. this also implies that theyare distributed along the intersection line (the energy-entropy line), thusthey constitute a one-parameter family.  these two physical laws (separately or combined), allow to find thetheoretical origin of several observed photometrical relations, such as thecorrelation between absolute magnitude and effective surface brightness, andthe fact that ellipticals are located on a surface in the [log r_eff, -2.5 logsigma_0, log nu] space. the fact that elliptical galaxies are a one-parameterfamily has important implications for cosmology and galaxy formation andevolution models. moreover, the energy-entropy line could be used as a distanceindicator.

astro-ph;0306081	a study of dark matter halos and gas properties in clusters of galaxies  from rosat data	self-gravitating systems such as elliptical galaxies appear to have aconstant integrated specific entropy and obey a scaling law relating theirpotential energy to their mass. these properties can be interpreted as due tothe physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of thesestructures. dark matter halos obtained through numerical simulations have alsobeen found to obey a scaling law relating their potential energy to their masswith the same slope as for ellipticals, and very close to the expected valuepredicted by theory. since the x-ray gas in clusters is weakly dissipative, wetest here the hypothesis that it verifies similar properties. comparableproperties for the dark matter component are also investigated. with this aim,we have analyzed rosat-pspc images of 24 clusters, and fit a s\'ersic law totheir x-ray surface brightness profiles. we found that: 1) the s\'ersic lawparameters (intensity, shape and scale) describing the x-ray gas emission arecorrelated two by two, with a strong correlation between the shape and scaleparameters; 2) the hot gas in all these clusters roughly has the sameintegrated specific entropy, although a second order correlation between thisintegrated specific entropy and both the gas mass and the dynamical mass isobserved; 3) a scaling law links the cluster potential energy to its totalmass, with the same slope as that derived for elliptical galaxies and for darkmatter halo simulations. comparable relations are obtained for the dark mattercomponent. all these correlations are probably the consequence of the formationand evolution processes undergone by clusters of galaxies.

astro-ph;0306497	the detection of stellar velocity dispersion drops in the central  regions of five isolated seyfert spirals	we analyze the kinematics of the central regions of five isolated seyfertspiral galaxies from the degas sample (four with new data presented in thispaper, ic184, ugc3223, ngc2639, ngc6814, and ngc6951 from our previous data),by using long slit spectroscopy in the caii triplet range (at ~ 8600 a)obtained with a 4m-class telescope. a drop of the velocity dispersions in theinnermost 1-3 arcsec is observed in four of them, and hinted in the remaininggalaxy (ngc6814). the available hst images for our sample together with anothernine galaxies with reported velocity dispersion drops, are also used toinvestigate the presence of morphological inner structures at the scales of thekinematical drops. evidence for disk-like shapes is found in 12 out of the 14cases. the only exceptions are ngc6814 and ngc6951. existing n-body simulationsincluding stars, gas and star formation predict that such a drop is mostprobably due to a young stellar population born from dynamically cold gasaccreted in a circumnuclear disk formed during an episode of central gasaccretion driven by a bar. the equivalent widths of the calcium triplet linesfor our 5 galaxies have been measured. even if the profiles could be formallyconsistent with constant ew(cat) values, they seem to indicate the presence ofa local maximum in the regions corresponding spatially to the drops; ifconfirmed, this would imply the presence of a different stellar population,whose properties could help constraining the models.

astro-ph;0609391	spatial variations of the optical galaxy luminosity functions and red  sequences in the coma cluster: clues to its assembly history	clusters of galaxies are believed to be at the intersections of cosmologicalfilaments and to grow by accreting matter from these filaments. such continuousinfall has major consequences not only on clusters but also on the physics ofcluster galaxies. faint galaxies are particularly interesting as they are verysensitive to environmental effects, and may have a different behaviour fromthat of bright galaxies. the aim of this paper is to sample the coma clusterbuilding history, based on the analysis of galaxy luminosity functions and redsequences in the color magnitude relation down to faint magnitudes, which areprivileged tools for this purpose. the present analysis is based on deep(r~24), wide (~0.5 deg2) multiband (bvri vega system) images of the comacluster obtained with the cfh12k camera at the cfht. we have derived lfs andcmrs in twenty 10x10 arcmin2 regions and in larger regions. in all photometricbands, we found steeply rising lfs in the north-northeast half of the cluster(due to early type galaxies at bright magnitudes and due to late type galaxiesat the faint end), and much flatter lfs in the south-southwest region. althoughthe fine behaviour of the cmr rs is different in these two regions, a goodagreement is found in general between the rs computed for faint and for brightgalaxies. all these results can be interpreted consistently in the framework ofthe building up process previously proposed. the northern coma area is arelatively quiescent region while the southern area experiences severalinfalls.

0809.2027	photometric redshifts as a tool to study the coma cluster galaxy  populations	we investigate the coma cluster galaxy luminosity function (glf) at faintmagnitudes, in particular in the u* band by applying photometric redshifttechniques applied to deep u*, b, v, r, i images covering a region of ~1deg2 (r24). global and local glfs in the b, v, r and i bands obtained with photometricredshift selection are consistent with our previous results based on astatistical background subtraction.  in the area covered only by the u* image, the glf was also derived afterapplying a statistical background subtraction. the glf in the u* band shows anincrease of the faint end slope towards the outer regions of the cluster (fromalpha~1 in the cluster center to alpha~2 in the cluster periphery). this couldbe explained assuming a short burst of star formation in these galaxies whenentering the cluster.  the analysis of the multicolor type spatial distribution reveals that latetype galaxies are distributed in clumps in the cluster outskirts, where x-raysubstructures are also detected and where the glf in the u* band is steeper.

astro-ph;0703320	the isolated fossil group rxj1119.7+2126	fossil groups are galaxy structures that probably underwent a nearly completefusion of all intermediate magnitude galaxies into a single large centraldominant galaxy. however, the formation and evolution processes of thesestructures are still not well understood. in order to test this scenario andits implications we studied the fossil group rxj1119.7+2126, based on availablespectroscopy of the galaxies in the low density large scale region around thefossil group and deep b and r band imaging of its close vicinity and threecomparison fields. we used spectroscopic data to investigate the degree ofisolation of rxj1119.7+2126 in terms of bright neighbour galaxies. the imagingdata were used to derive the color magnitude relation and select faint galaxiesstatistically belonging to this structure. the structure appears as a veryisolated group exhibiting a red sequence in the color magnitude relation withcharacteristics close to the red sequences already observed for other fossilgroups. all these results can be interpreted consistently in the framework ofthe building up process generally proposed for fossil groups.

astro-ph;9411025	on the galaxy luminosity function in the central regions of the coma  cluster	we have obtained new redshifts for 265 objects in the central48~$\times$~25~arcmin$^2$ region of the coma cluster. when supplemented withliterature data, our redshift sample is 95~\% complete up to a magnitudeb$_{26.5}$=18.0 (the magnitudes are taken from the photometric sample of godwinet al. 1983). using redshift-confirmed membership for 205 galaxies, and thelocation in the colour-magnitude diagram for another 91 galaxies, we have builta sample of cluster members which is complete up to b$_{26.5}$=20.0. we showthat the coma cluster luminosity function cannot be adequately fitted by asingle schechter (1976) function, because of a dip in the magnitudedistribution at b$_{26.5}$$\sim$17. the superposition of an erlang (or a gauss)and a schechter function provides a significantly better fit. we compare theluminosity function of coma to those of other clusters, and of the field.luminosity functions for rich clusters look similar, with a maximum at $m_{b}\simeq -19.5 + 5 \times \log h_{50}$, while the virgo and the field luminosityfunctions show a nearly monotonic behaviour. these differences may be producedby physical processes related to the environment which affect the luminositiesof a certain class of cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9512111	unveiling hidden structures in the coma cluster	we have assembled a large data-set of 613 galaxy redshifts in the comacluster, the largest presently available for a cluster of galaxies. we havedefined a sample of cluster members complete to b$_{26.5}=20.0$, using amembership criterion based on the galaxy velocity, when available, or on thegalaxy magnitude and colour, otherwise. such a data set allows us to definenearly complete samples within a region of 1~\mpc\ radius, with a sufficientnumber of galaxies per sample to make statistical analyses possible. using thissample and the {\em rosat} pspc x--ray image of the cluster, we havere-analyzed the structure and kinematics of coma, by applying the wavelet andadaptive kernel techniques. a striking coincidence of features is found in thedistributions of galaxies and hot intracluster gas. the two central dominantgalaxies, ngc4874 and ngc4889, are surrounded by two galaxy groups, mostlypopulated with galaxies brighter than b$_{26.5}=17$ and well separated invelocity space. on the contrary, the fainter galaxies tend to form a singlesmooth structure with a central peak coinciding in position with a secondarypeak detected in x--rays, and located between the two dominant galaxies; wesuggest to identify this structure with the main body of the coma cluster. acontinuous velocity gradient is found in the central distribution of thesefaint galaxies, a probable signature of tidal interactions rather thanrotation. there is evidence for a bound population of bright galaxies aroundother brightest cluster members. altogether, the coma cluster structure seemsto be better traced by the faint galaxy population, the bright galaxies beinglocated in subclusters. we discuss this evidence in terms of an ongoingaccretion of groups onto the cluster.

astro-ph;9610169	the rich cluster of galaxies abcg 85.i. x-ray analysis	we present an x-ray analysis of the rich cluster abcg 85 based on rosat pspcdata. by applying an improved wavelet analysis, we show that our view of thiscluster is notably changed from what was previously believed (a main region anda south blob). the main emission comes from the central part of the main bodyof the cluster on which is superimposed that of a foreground group of galaxies.the foreground group and the main cluster are separated (if redshifts arecosmological) by 46 1/h_50 mpc. the southern blob is clearly not a group: it isresolved into x-ray emitting galaxies (in particular the second more luminousgalaxy of the main cluster). several x-ray features are identified with brightgalaxies. we performed a spectral analysis and derived the temperature (t),metallicity (z) and hydrogen column density nh. the global quantities are:t=4kev (in agreement with the velocity dispersion of 760km/s) and$z=0.2z_\odot$. we cannot derive accurate gradients for these quantities withour data, but there is strong evidence that the temperature is lower ($\sim 2.8kev$) and the metallicity much higher (z $\sim 0.8 z_\odot$) in the very centre(within about 50 1/h_50 kpc). we present a pixel by pixel method to model thephysical properties of the x-ray gas and derive its density distribution. weapply classical methods to estimate the dynamical, gas and stellar masses, aswell as the cooling time and cooling flow characteristics. at the limitingradius of the image (1.4 1/h_50 mpc), we find $m_{\rm dyn}\sim (2.1-2.9)10^{14}1/h_50 m$_{\odot}$, $m_{gas}/m_{dyn}\sim 0.18 h_{50}^{-1.5}$. the stellar massis $6.7\ 10^{12}m_{\odot}$, giving a mass to light ratio of $m/l_{v}\sim 300$.the cooling time is estimated for different models, leading to a cooling radiusof 30-80 kpc depending on the

astro-ph;9707020	the rich cluster of galaxies abcg 85. ii. x-ray analysis using the rosat  hri	we present a new x-ray analysis mainly based on rosat hri data. the hrispatial resolution combined with an improved wavelet analysis method and withcomplementary radio and optical data provides new results compared to aprevious paper based on rosat pspc data (pislar et al. 1997). we use alsoredshift data in order to identify galaxies dynamically belonging to the mainbody of the cluster and/or to superimposed substructures. various kinds ofemission are superimposed on a mean thermal x-ray emission due to theintra-cluster gas: a) an x-ray flux excess in the centre; b) a south blob,partially generated by individual galaxies. the mean velocity and velocitydispersion of the galaxies located in this region are the same as those of thecluster as a whole: it therefore does not seem to be a bound subgroup; c) westemission due to a foreground group with self-emission from a seyfert galaxylocated at the north-west; d) emission in the south-west due to inverse comptonemission associated to a very steep radio source (the remnant of an activegalactic nucleus). we have examined the possibility for the central peak to bean "unusual" galaxy, as assumed for the central galaxy of j2310-43 (tananbaumet al. 1997). we conclude on the existence of a cooling flow region, in whichthe presence of at least three small features certainly related to cooler blobsis revealed by the wavelet analysis. we have performed a pixel-to-pixelmodelling of the double x-ray emission. the large scale emission component iscomparable to those derived from by the pspc data and the small scale one isinterpreted as a cooling-flow. a multiphase gas model analysis leads to a massdeposit of 50-150 m_\odot/yr.

astro-ph;9710103	a photometric catalogue of galaxies in the cluster abell 85	we present two catalogues of galaxies in the direction of the rich cluster\a85. the first one includes 4,232 galaxies located in a region $\pm 1^\circ$from the cluster centre. it has been obtained from a list of more than 25,000galaxy candidates detected by scanning a schmidt photographic plate taken inthe \bj band. positions are very accurate in this catalogue but magnitudes arenot. this led us to perform ccd imaging observations in the v and r bands tocalibrate these photographic magnitudes. a second catalogue (805 galaxies)gives a list of galaxies with ccd magnitudes in the v and r bands for a muchsmaller region in the centre of the cluster. these two catalogues will becombined with a redshift catalogue of 509 galaxies (durret et al. 1997;astro-ph/9709298) to investigate the cluster properties at optical wavelengths(durret et al. in preparation), as a complement to our previous x-ray studies(pislar et al. 1997, lima-neto et al. 1997).

astro-ph;9910217	a turn-over in the galaxy luminosity function of the coma cluster core?	our previous study of the faint end (r$\leq$21.5) of the galaxy luminosityfunction (glf) was based on spectroscopic data in a small region near the comacluster center. in this previous study adami et al. (1998) suggested, withmoderate statistical significance, that the number of galaxies actuallybelonging to the cluster was much smaller than expected. this led us toincrease our spectroscopic sample. here, we have improved the statisticalsignificance of the results of the coma glf faint end study (r$\leq$22.5) byusing a sample of 85 redshifts. this includes both new spectroscopic data and aliterature compilation. the relatively small number of faint galaxies belongingto coma that was suggested by adami et al. (1998) and secker et al. (1998) hasbeen confirmed with these new observations. we also confirm that thecolor-magnitude relation is not well suited for finding the galaxies inside thecoma cluster core, close to the center at magnitudes fainter than r$\sim$19. weshow that there is an enhancement in the coma line of sight of field galaxiescompared to classical field counts. this can be explained by the contributionof groups and of a distant $z\sim 0.5$ cluster along the line of sight. theresult is that the coma glf appears to turn-over or at least to become flat forthe faint galaxies. we suggest that this is due to environmental effects.

astro-ph;9911464	gravo-thermal properties and formation of elliptical galaxies	we have analyzed a sample of galaxies belonging to three clusters: coma,abell 85, and abell 496 (real galaxies) and a sample of simulated ellipticalgalaxies formed in a hierarchical merging scheme (virtual galaxies). we use thesersic law to describe their light profile. the specific entropy(boltzmann-gibbs definition) is then calculated supposing that the galaxiesbehave as spherical, isotropic, one-component systems. we find that, to a goodapproximation (about 10%), both real and virtual galaxies have an almost uniquespecific entropy. within this approximation the galaxies are distributed in athin plane in the space defined by the three sersic law parameters, which wecall the entropic plane. a further analysis shows that both real and virtualgalaxies are in fact located on a thin line, therefore indicating the existenceof another - and yet unknown - physical property, besides the uniqueness of thespecific entropy. a more careful examination of the virtual galaxies sampleindicates a very small increase of their specific entropy with merginggeneration. in a hierarchical scenario, this implies a correlation between thespecific entropy and the total mass, which is indeed seen in our data. thescatter and tilt of the entropic line, defined by lima neto et al. (1999a), arereduced when this correlation is taken into account. although one cannotdistinguish between various generations for real galaxies, the distribution oftheir specific entropy is similar to that in the virtual sample, suggestingthat hierarchical merging processes could be an important mechanism in thebuilding of elliptical galaxies.
