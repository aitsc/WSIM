0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

1002.3170	the redshift one ldss-3 emission line survey (roles) ii: survey method  and z~1 mass-dependent star-formation rate density	motivated by suggestions of 'cosmic downsizing', in which the dominantcontribution to the cosmic star formation rate density (sfrd) proceeds fromhigher to lower mass galaxies with increasing cosmic time, we describe thedesign and implementation of the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey(roles). roles is a k-selected (22.5 &lt; k_ab &lt; 24.0) survey for dwarf galaxies[8.5&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt; 9.5] at 0.89 &lt; z &lt; 1.15 drawn from two extremely deep fields(goods-s and ms1054-fires). using the [oii]3727 emission line, we obtainredshifts and star-formation rates (sfrs) for star-forming galaxies down to alimit of ~0.3 msun/yr. we present the [oii] luminosity function measured inroles and find a faint end slope of alpha_faint ~ -1.5, similar to thatmeasured at z~0.1 in the sdss. by combining roles with higher mass surveys, wemeasure the sfrd as a function of stellar mass using [oii] (with and withoutvarious empirical corrections), and using sed-fitting to obtain the sfr fromthe rest-frame uv luminosity for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. ourbest estimate of the corrected [oii]-sfrd and uv sfrd both independently showthat the sfrd evolves equally for galaxies of all masses between z~1 and z~0.1.the exact evolution in normalisation depends on the indicator used, with the[oii]-based estimate showing a change of a factor of ~2.6 and the uv-based afactor of ~6. we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalisationbetween the indicators, but note that the magnitude of this uncertainty iscomparable to the discrepancy between indicators seen in other z~1 works. ourresult that the shape of the sfrd as a function of stellar mass (and hence themass range of galaxies dominating the sfrd) does not evolve between z~1 andz~0.1 is robust to the choice of indicator.

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1101.3780	a spectroscopic measurement of galaxy formation timescales with roles	we present measurements of the specific star-formation rate (ssfr)-stellarmass relation for star-forming galaxies. our deep spectroscopic samples arebased on the redshift one ldss3 emission line survey, roles, and europeansouthern observatory, eso, public spectroscopy at z=1, and on the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) at z=0.1. these datasets cover an equally deep mass range of8.5&lt;~log(m*/msun)&lt;~11 at both epochs. we find that the ssfr--mass relationevolves in a way which is remarkably independent of stellar mass, as wepreviously found for the star-formation rate density (sfrd)--mass relation. athigher masses, such as those probed by previous surveys, the evolution inssfr--mass is almost independent of stellar mass. at higher masses(log(m*/msun)&gt;10) the shapes of the cumulative cosmic sfrds are very similar atboth z=0.1 and z=1.0, both showing 70% of the total sfrd above a mass oflog(m*/msun)&gt;10. mass functions are constructed for star-forming galaxies andfound to evolve by only &lt;35% between z=1 and z=0.1 over the whole mass range.the evolution is such that the mass function decreases with increasing cosmictime, confirming that galaxies are leaving the star-forming sequence/bluecloud. the observational results are extended to z~2 by adding two recent lymanbreak galaxy samples, and data at these three epochs (z=0.1, 1, 2) are comparedwith the galform semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. galform predicts anoverall sfr density (sfrd) as a function of stellar mass in reasonableagreement with the observations. the star formation timescales inferred from1/ssfr also give reasonable overall agreement, with the agreement becomingworse at the lowest and highest masses.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

0709.3794	the environmental dependence of the chemical properties of star-forming  galaxies	we use a 0.040 &lt; z &lt; 0.085 sample of 37866 star-forming galaxies from thefourth data release of the sloan digital sky survey to investigate thedependence of gas-phase chemical properties on stellar mass and environment.the local density, determined from the projected distances to the fourth andfifth nearest neighbours, is used as an environment indicator. consideringenvironments ranging from voids, i.e., log sigma &lt; -0.8, to the periphery ofgalaxy clusters, i.e., log sigma =~ 0.8, we find no dependence of therelationship between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase oxygen abundance, alongwith its associated scatter, on local galaxy density. however, the star-forminggas in galaxies shows a marginal increase in the chemical enrichment level at afixed stellar mass in denser environments. compared with galaxies of similarstellar mass in low density environments, they are enhanced by a few per centfor massive galaxies to about 20 per cent for galaxies with stellar masses &lt;10^{9.5} solar masses. these results imply that the evolution of star-forminggalaxies is driven primarily by their intrinsic properties and is largelyindependent of their environment over a large range of local galaxy density.

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

0710.1497	are galaxies with agn a transition population?	we present the results of an analysis of a well-selected sample of galaxieswith active and inactive galactic nuclei from the sloan digital sky survey, inthe range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.16. the sdss galaxy catalogue was split into two classesof active galaxies, type~2 agn and composites, and one set of inactive,star-forming/passive galaxies. for each active galaxy, two inactive controlgalaxies were selected by matching redshift, absolute magnitude, inclination,and radius. the sample of inactive galaxies naturally divides into a red and ablue sequence, while the vast majority of agn hosts occur along the redsequence. in terms of h-alpha equivalent width, the population of compositegalaxies peaks in the valley between the two modes, suggesting a transitionpopulation. however, this effect is not observed in other properties such ascolour-magnitude space, or colour-concentration plane. active galaxies are seento be generally bulge-dominated systems, but with enhanced h-alpha emissioncompared to inactive red-sequence galaxies. agn and composites also occur inless dense environments than inactive red-sequence galaxies, implying that thefuelling of agn is more restricted in high-density environments. these resultsare therefore inconsistent with theories in which agn host galaxies are a`transition' population. we also introduce a systematic 3d spectroscopicimaging survey, to quantify and compare the gaseous and stellar kinematics of awell-selected, distance-limited sample of up to 20 nearby seyfert galaxies, and20 inactive control galaxies with well-matched optical properties. the surveyaims to search for dynamical triggers of nuclear activity and addressoutstanding controversies in optical/ir imaging surveys.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1212.3332	megamorph - multi-wavelength measurement of galaxy structure: complete  s\'ersic profile information from modern surveys	in this paper, we demonstrate a new method for fitting galaxy profiles whichmakes use of the full multi-wavelength data provided by modern largeoptical-near-infrared imaging surveys. we present a new version of galapagos,which utilises a recently-developed multi-wavelength version of galfit, andenables the automated measurement of wavelength dependent s\'ersic profileparameters for very large samples of galaxies. our new technique is extensivelytested to assess the reliability of both pieces of software, galfit andgalapagos on both real ugrizy jhk imaging data from the gama survey andsimulated data made to the same specifications. we find that fitting galaxylight profiles with multi-wavelength data increases the stability and accuracyof the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningfulmulti-wavelength photometry than has been available previously. the improvementis particularly significant for magnitudes in low s/n bands and for structuralparameters like half-light radius re and s\'ersic index n for which a prior isused by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function ofwavelength. this allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxiesfor which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. the techniqueutilises a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creatingmore physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allowsaccurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-framevalues.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1301.7129	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the life and times of l* galaxies	in this work we investigate in detail the effects local environment (groupsand pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the milky-way (l*galaxies). a volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determineemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. this sampleallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass andgroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.  we observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role inshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is ingathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. dominant pairgalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratiois close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in anunpaired system. the minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by itscompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressedrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower stillwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.  we find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as afunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. we find evidence of alocal peak of interactions for milky-way stellar mass galaxies in milky-wayhalo mass groups. low mass halos, and in particular local group mass halos, arean important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of aunit of stellar mass.  we find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission classconformity is dominant in pairs. this suggests that group scale conformity isthe result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilstpair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1305.5308	galaxy and mass assembly: evolution of the halpha luminosity function  and star formation rate density up to z&lt;0.35	measurements of the low-z halpha luminosity function have a large dispersionin the local number density of sources, and correspondingly in the sfr density.the possible causes for these discrepancies include limited volume sampling,biases arising from survey sample selection, different methods of correctingfor dust obscuration and agn contamination. the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and sloan digital sky survey (sdss) provide deep spectroscopicobservations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample ofstar-forming galaxies spanning 0.001&lt;sfr(halpha)&lt;100 with which to robustlymeasure the evolution of the sfr density in the low-z universe. the largenumber of high sfr galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurementof the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease innumber density of sources at bright luminosities is best described by asaunders functional form rather than the traditional schechter function. thisresult is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the fir andradio. for gama and sdss we find the r-band apparent magnitude limit, combinedwith the subsequent requirement for halpha detection leads to an incompletenessdue to missing bright halpha sources with faint r-band magnitudes.

1306.5752	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): witnessing the assembly of the cluster  abell 1882	we present a combined optical and x-ray analysis of the rich cluster abell1882 with the aim of identifying merging substructure and understanding therecent assembly history of this system. our optical data consist of spectradrawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey, which lends itself tothis kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopiccompleteness. we use 283 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detectand characterize substructure. we complement the optical data with x-ray datataken with both chandra and xmm. our analysis reveals that a1882 harbors twomain components, a1882a and a1882b, which have a projected separation of 2mpcand a line of sight velocity difference of v_{los}=-428km/s. the primarysystem, a1882a, has velocity dispersion sigma_v=500km/s and chandra (xmm)temperature kt=3.57kev (3.31kev) while the secondary, a1882b, hassigma_v=457km/s and chandra (xmm) temperature kt=2.39kev (2.12kev). the opticaland x-ray estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within theuncertainties and indicate that there is twice as much mass in a1882a(m_{500}=1.5-1.9x10^{14}msolar) when compared with a1882b(m_{500}=0.8-1.0x10^{14}msolar). we interpret the a1882a/a1882b system as beingobserved prior to a core passage. supporting this interpretation is the largeprojected separation of a1882a and a1882b and the dearth of evidence for arecent (&lt;2gyr) major interaction in the x-ray data. two-body analyses indicatethat a1882a and a1882b form a bound system with bound incoming solutionsstrongly favored. we compute blue fractions of f_b=0.28 and 0.18 for thespectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within r_{500} of the centers ofa1882a and a1882b, respectively. these blue fractions do not differsignificantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusterswith similar mass and redshift.

1308.2985	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): resolving the role of environment in  galaxy evolution	we present observations of 18 galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey made with the spiral optical integral field unit (ifu) on theanglo-australian telescope. the galaxies are selected to have a narrow range instellar mass (6x10^9msolar &lt; m* &lt;2x10^10 msolar) in order to focus on theeffects of environment. local galaxy environments are measured quantitativelyusing 5th nearest neighbour surface densities. we find that the total starformation rates (sfr) measured from the ifu data are consistent with total sfrsmeasured from aperture correcting either gama or sloan digital sky surveysingle-fibre observations. the mean differences are sfr_gama/sfr_ifu =1.26+/-0.23, sigma=0.90 and for the sloan digital sky survey we similarly findsfr_brinchmann/sfr_ifu = 1.34+/-0.17, sigma=0.67. examining the relationshipswith environment, we find off-centre and clumpy halpha emission is notsignificantly dependent on environment, being present in 2/7 (29^+20_-11 percent) galaxies in high-density environments (&gt;0.77 mpc^-2), and 5/11(45^+15_-13 per cent) galaxies in low-density environments (&lt;0.77 mpc^-2). wefind a weak but not significant relationship of the total star formation ratesof star-forming galaxies with environment. due to the size of our sample andthe scatter observed we do not draw a definitive conclusion about a possiblesfr dependence on environment. examining the spatial distribution of the halphaemission, we find no evidence for a change in shape or amplitude of the radialprofile of star-forming galaxies with environment. if these observations areborne out in larger samples this would infer that any environment-drivenstar-formation suppression must either act very rapidly (the`infall-and-quench' model) or that galaxies must evolve in a density-dependentmanner (an `in-situ evolution' model).

1404.2626	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): autoz spectral redshift measurements,  confidence and errors	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has obtained spectra of over230000 targets using the anglo-australian telescope. to homogenise the redshiftmeasurements and improve the reliability, a fully automatic redshift code wasdeveloped (autoz). the measurements were made using a cross-correlation methodfor both absorption-line and emission-line spectra. large deviations in thehigh-pass filtered spectra are partially clipped in order to be robust againstuncorrected artefacts and to reduce the weight given to single-line matches. asingle figure of merit (fom) was developed that puts all template matches ontoa similar confidence scale. the redshift confidence as a function of the fomwas fitted with a tanh function using a maximum likelihood method applied torepeat observations of targets. the method could be adapted to provide robustautomatic redshifts for other large galaxy redshift surveys. for the gamasurvey, there was a substantial improvement in the reliability of assignedredshifts and in the lowering of redshift uncertainties with a median velocityuncertainty of 33 km/s.

0802.4421	the h alpha galaxy survey. iv. star formation in the local universe	we present an analysis of the star formation properties of field galaxieswithin the local volume out to a recession velocity limit of 3000 km/s. aparent sample of 863 star-forming galaxies is used to calculate a b-bandluminosity function. this is then populated with star formation informationfrom a subsample of 327 galaxies, for which we have h alpha imaging, firstly bycalibrating a relationship between galaxy b-band luminosity and star formationrate, and secondly by a monte carlo simulation of a representative sample ofgalaxies, in which star formation information is randomly sampled from theobserved subset. the total star formation rate density of the local universe isfound to be between 0.016 and 0.023 msun/yr/cubic mpc, with the uncertaintiesbeing dominated by the internal extinction correction used in convertingmeasured h alpha fluxes to star formation rates. if our internally derivedb-band luminosity function is replaced by one from the sloan digital sky surveyblue sequence, the star formation rate densities are approx. 60% of the abovevalues. we also calculate the contribution to the total star formation ratedensity from galaxies of different luminosities and hubble t-types. the largestcontribution comes from bright galaxies with b absolute mag of approx. -20 mag,and the total contribution from galaxies fainter than -15.5 mag is less than10%. almost 60% of the star formation rate density comes from galaxies of typessb, sbc or sc; 9% from galaxies earlier than sb and 33% from galaxies laterthan sc. finally, 75 - 80% of the total star formation in the local universe isshown to be occurring in disk regions, defined as being &gt;1 kpc from the centresof galaxies.

1408.1476	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy close-pairs, mergers, and the  future fate of stellar mass	we use a highly complete subset of the gama-ii redshift sample to fullydescribe the stellar mass dependence of close-pairs and mergers between 10^8msun and 10^12 msun. using the analytic form of this fit we investigate thetotal stellar mass accreting onto more massive galaxies across all mass ratios.depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, thefraction of mass merging onto more massive companions is 2.0%-5.6%. using thegama-ii data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close-pairfraction between redshift $z = 0.05-0.2$. however, we find a systematicallyhigher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to publishedresults over a similar redshift baseline. using a compendium of data and thefunction $\gamma_m =a(1+z)m$ to predict the major close-pair fraction, we findfitting parameters of $a = 0.021 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 1.53 \pm 0.08$, whichrepresents a higher low-redshift normalisation and shallower power-law slopethan recent literature values. we find that the relative importance of in-situstar-formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, withstar-formation dominating the addition of stellar material below mstar andmerger accretion events dominating beyond mstar. we find mergers have ameasurable impact on the whole extent of the gsmf, manifest as a deepening ofthe dip in the gsmf over the next gyr and an increase in mstar by as much as0.01-0.05 dex.

0804.2167	the h alpha galaxy survey v. the star formation history of late-type  galaxies	this study of 117 low-redshift im and sm galaxies investigates the starformation rates of late-type galaxies, to determine whether they arequasi-continuous or dominated by bursts with quiescent interludes. we analysethe distribution of star formation timescales (stellar masses/star formationrates) for the entire sample, and of gas depletion timescales for thosegalaxies with gas mass measurements. we find that, on average, the late-typegalaxies studied could have produced their total stellar masses by anextrapolation of their current star formation activity over a period of justunder a hubble time. this is not the case for a comparison sample ofearlier-type galaxies, even those with disk-dominated morphologies and similartotal stellar masses to the late-type galaxies. the earlier-type galaxies areon average forming their stars more slowly at present than the average rateover their past histories. no totally quiescent im or sm galaxies are found,and although some evidence of intrinsic variation in the star formation ratewith time is found, this is typically less than a factor of 2 increase ordecrease relative to the mean level. the im and sm galaxies have extensive gasreservoirs and can maintain star formation at the current rate for more thananother hubble time. the average spatial distribution of star formation in theim galaxies, and to a lesser extent the sm galaxies, is very similar to that ofthe older stellar population traced by the red light.

0804.2892	on the galaxy stellar mass function, the mass-metallicity relation, and  the implied baryonic mass function	a comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (gsmfs)shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4--8 per cent of thebaryon density (assuming omega_b = 0.045). there remain significant sources ofuncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratioeven assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. wedetermine the z &lt; 0.05 gsmf using the new york university - value-added galaxycatalog sample of 49968 galaxies derived from the sloan digital sky survey andvarious estimates of stellar mass. the gsmf shows clear evidence for a low-massupturn and is fitted with a double schechter function that has alpha_2 =~ -1.6.at masses below ~ 10^8.5 msun, the gsmf may be significantly incomplete becauseof missing low surface-brightness galaxies. one interpretation of the stellarmass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction ofavailable baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. using thisprincipal, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellarmass and present an `implied baryonic mass function'. this function has afaint-end slope, alpha_2 =~ -1.9. thus, we find evidence that the slope of thelow-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as thehalo mass function. we illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic massfunction --&gt; galaxy baryonic mass function --&gt; gsmf. this demonstrates therequirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ~ 10^11msun corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. the baryonic-infallefficiency may have levelled off at lower masses.

1507.04447	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the effect of close interactions on  star formation in galaxies	the modification of star formation (sf) in galaxy interactions is a complexprocess, with sf observed to be both enhanced in major mergers and suppressedin minor pair interactions. such changes likely to arise on short timescalesand be directly related to the galaxy-galaxy interaction time. here weinvestigate the link between dynamical phase and direct measures of sf ondifferent timescales for pair galaxies, targeting numerous star-formation rate(sfr) indicators and comparing to pair separation, individual galaxy mass andpair mass ratio. we split our sample into the higher (primary) and lower(secondary) mass galaxies in each pair and find that sf is indeed enhanced inall primary galaxies but suppressed in secondaries of minor mergers. we findthat changes in sf of primaries is consistent in both major and minor mergers,suggesting that sf in the more massive galaxy is agnostic to pair mass ratio.we also find that sf is enhanced/suppressed more strongly for short-timeduration sfr indicators (e.g. h-alpha), highlighting recent changes to sf inthese galaxies, which are likely to be induced by the interaction. we propose ascenario where the lower mass galaxy has its sf suppressed by gas heating orstripping, while the higher mass galaxy has its sf enhanced, potentially bytidal gas turbulence and shocks. this is consistent with the seeminglycontradictory observations for both sf suppression and enhancement in closepairs.

1511.02245	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): growing up in a bad neighbourhood - how  do low-mass galaxies become passive?	both theoretical predictions and observations of the very nearby universesuggest that low-mass galaxies (log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;9.5) are likelyto remain star-forming unless they are affected by their local environment. totest this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of bothpassive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. we find that passive fractions are higher inboth interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,and that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. we also findthat essentially all passive log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;8.5 galaxies arefound in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with amore massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. we find that theeffects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in formingpassive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that thisis potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient timefor the galaxy to become passive via starvation. we then present a simplisticmodel to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, itis consistent with our observed results.

1601.00003	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 325 mhz radio luminosity function  of agn and star forming galaxies	measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (agn) andstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution overcosmic time. radio continuum observations can provide key information on thesetwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jetsin agn, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formationrates. in this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 mhz for asample of agn and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio surveyconducted with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), with optical imagingand redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we find that theradio luminosity function at 325 mhz for star-forming galaxies closely followsthat measured at 1.4 ghz. by fitting the agn radio luminosity function out to$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\phi}\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pureluminosity evolution. we find that the low excitation radio galaxies are thedominant population in space density at lower luminosities. comparing our 325mhz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 ghz, we determine separateradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum agn, and show that thebeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted innumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population ofsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification ofagn.

astro-ph;0004390	time-series spectroscopy of the rapidly oscillating ap star hr 3831	we present time-series spectroscopy of the rapidly oscillating ap star hr3831. this star has a dominant pulsation period of 11.7 minutes and a rotationperiod of 2.85 days. we have analysed 1400 intermediate-resolution spectra ofthe wavelength region 6100--7100 aa obtained over one week, using techniquessimilar to those we applied to another roap star, alpha cir.  we confirm that the h-alpha velocity amplitude of hr 3831 is modulated withrotation phase. such a modulation was predicted by the oblique pulsator model,and rules out the spotted pulsator model. however, further analysis of h-alphaand other lines reveal rotational modulations that cannot easily be explainedusing the oblique pulsator model. in particular, the phase of the pulsation asmeasured by the width of the h-alpha line varies with height in the line.  the variation of the h-alpha bisector shows a very similar pattern to thatobserved in alpha cir, which we have previously attributed to a radial node inthe stellar atmosphere. however, the striking similarities between the twostars despite the much shorter period of alpha cir (6.8 min) argues againstthis interpretation unless the structure of the atmosphere is somewhatdifferent between the two stars. alternatively, the bisector variation is asignature of the degree l of the mode and not the overtone value n.  high-resolution studies of the metal lines in roap stars are needed tounderstand fully the form of the pulsation in the atmosphere.

astro-ph;0107197	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy luminosity functions per spectral  type	we calculate the optical bj luminosity function of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties.these spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, eta, whichis a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a principalcomponent analysis. this parameter eta identifies the average emission andabsorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is auseful indicator of the present star formation. we use a total of 75,000galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noiseratio, low redshift galaxies observed before january 2001. we find that thereis a systematic steepening of the faint end slope (alpha) as one moves frompassive (alpha = -0.54) to active (alpha = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, andthat there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristicmagnitude m* - 5\log_10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). we also show that theschechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (type 1) lf for veryfaint galaxies (m - 5log_10(h) fainter than -16.0), perhaps suggesting thepresence of a significant dwarf population. the luminosity functions presentedhere give a precise confirmation of the trends seen previously in a muchsmaller preliminary 2dfgrs sample, and in other surveys. we also present a newprocedure for determining self-consistent k-corrections and investigatepossible fibre-aperture biases.

astro-ph;0108155	a tunable lyot filter at prime focus: a method for tracing supercluster  scales at z ~ 1	tunable narrow-band, emission-line surveys have begun to show the ease withwhich star forming galaxies can be identified in restricted redshift intervalsto z ~ 5 with a 4m class telescope. these surveys have been carried out withimaging systems at the cassegrain or nasmyth focus and are therefore restrictedto fields smaller than 10 arcmin. we now show that tunable narrowband imagingis possible over a 30 arcmin field with a high-performance lyot filter placeddirectly in front of a ccd mosaic at the prime focus. our design is intendedfor the f/3.3 prime focus of the aat 3.9m, although similar devices can beenvisaged for the subaru 8m (f/2), palomar 5m (f/3.4), vista 4m (f/6), mayall4m (f/2.6) or cfht 3.6m (f/4). a modified wynne doublet ensures sub-arcsecondperformance over the field. in combination with the new wide-field imaging 8k x8k mosaic (wfi) at the aat, the overall throughput (35%) of the system tounpolarised light is expected to be comparable to the taurus tunable filter(ttf). unlike the ttf, the field is fully monochromatic and the instrumentalprofile has much better wing suppression. for targetted surveys ofemission-line sources at z ~ 1, a low-resolution (r ~ 150 at 550nm) lyot filteron a 4m telescope is expected to be comparable or superior to currentinstruments on 8-10m class telescopes. we demonstrate that the 30 arcmin fieldis well matched to superclusters at these redshifts such that large-scalestructure should be directly observable.

astro-ph;0110676	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: constraints on cosmic star-formation  history from the cosmic spectrum	we present the first results on the history of star formation in the universebased on the `cosmic spectrum', in particular, the volume-averaged,luminosity-weighted, stellar absorption line spectrum of present day galaxiesfrom the 2dfgrs. this method is novel in that unlike previous studies it is notan estimator based on total luminosity density. the cosmic spectrum is fittedwith models of population synthesis, tracing the history of star formationprior to the epoch of the observed galaxies, using a method we have developedwhich decouples continuum and spectral-line variations and is robust againstspectrophotometric uncertainties. the cosmic spectrum can only be fitted withmodels incorporating chemical evolution and indicates there was a peak ofstar-formation rate in the past of at least three times the current value andthat the increase back to z=1, assuming it scales as (1+z)^beta, has a strongupper limit of beta&lt;5. we find in the general case there is some modeldegeneracy between star formation at low and high redshift. however, if weincorporate previous work on star formation at z&lt;1 we can put strong upperlimits on the sfr at z&gt;1: e.g., if beta&gt;2 then the sfr for 1&lt;z&lt;5 scales as(1+z)^alpha with alpha&lt;2. this is equivalent to stating that no more than 80%of stars in the universe formed at z&gt;1. our results are consistent with thebest-fit results from compilations of cosmic sfr estimates based on uvluminosity density, which give 1.8&lt;beta&lt;2.9 and -1.0&lt;alpha&lt;0.7, and are alsoconsistent with estimates of omega_stars based on the k-band luminositydensity.

astro-ph;0301243	the mass of the neutron star in vela x-1 and tidally induced non-radial  oscillations in gp vel	we report new radial velocity observations of gp vel/hd77581, the opticalcompanion to the eclipsing x-ray pulsar vela x-1. using data spanning more thantwo complete orbits of the system, we detect evidence for tidally inducednon-radial oscillations on the surface of gp vel, apparent as peaks in thepower spectrum of the residuals to the radial velocity curve fit. by removingthe effect of these oscillations (to first order) and binning the radialvelocities, we have determined the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curveof gp vel to be k_o=22.6+/-1.5 km/s. given the accurately measuredsemi-amplitude of the pulsar's orbit, the mass ratio of the system is0.081+/-0.005. we are able to set upper and lower limits on the masses of thecomponent stars as follows. assuming gp vel fills its roche lobe then theinclination angle of the system, i=70.1+/-2.6 deg. in this case we obtain themasses of the two stars as m_x=2.27 +/-0.17 m_sun for the neutron star andm_o=27.9+/-1.3 m_sun for gp vel. conversely, assuming the inclination angle isi=90 deg, the ratio of the radius of gp vel to the radius of its roche lobe isbeta=0.89+/-0.03 and the masses of the two stars are m_x=1.88+/-0.13 m_sun andm_o=23.1+/-0.2 m_sun. a range of solutions between these two sets of limits isalso possible, corresponding to other combinations of i and beta. in addition,we note that if the zero phase of the radial velocity curve is allowed as afree parameter, rather than constrained by the x-ray ephemeris, a significantlyimproved fit is obtained with an amplitude of 21.2+/-0.7 km/s and a phase shiftof 0.033+/-0.007 in true anomaly. the apparent shift in the zero phase of theradial velocity curve may indicate the presence of an additional radialvelocity component at the orbital period.

astro-ph;0303668	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy clustering per spectral type	we have calculated the two-point correlation functions in redshift space,xi(sigma,pi), for galaxies of different spectral types in the 2df galaxyredshift survey. using these correlation functions we are able to estimatevalues of the linear redshift-space distortion parameter, beta = omega_m^0.6/b,the pairwise velocity dispersion, a, and the real-space correlation function,xi(r), for galaxies with both relatively low star-formation rates (for whichthe present rate of star formation is less than 10% of its past averaged value)and galaxies with higher current star-formation activity. at small separations,the real-space clustering of passive galaxies is very much stronger than thatof the more actively star-forming galaxies; the correlation-function slopes arerespectively 1.93 and 1.50, and the relative bias between the two classes is adeclining function of radius. on scales larger than 10 h^-1 mpc there isevidence that the relative bias tends to a constant, b(passive)/b(active) ~ 1.this result is consistent with the similar degrees of redshift-spacedistortions seen in the correlation functions of the two classes -- thecontours of xi(sigma,pi) require beta(active)=0.49+/-0.13, andbeta(passive)=0.48+/-0.14. the pairwise velocity dispersion is highlycorrelated with beta. however, despite this a significant difference is seenbetween the two classes. over the range 8-20 h^-1 mpc, the pairwise velocitydispersion has mean values 416+/-76 km/s and 612+/-92 km/s for the active andpassive galaxy samples respectively. this is consistent with the expectationfrom morphological segregation, in which passively evolving galaxiespreferentially inhabit the cores of high-mass virialised regions.

astro-ph;0304423	constraints on a universal imf from uv to near-ir galaxy luminosity  densities	we obtain constraints on the slope of a universal stellar initial massfunction (imf) over a range of cosmic star-formation histories (sfh) usingz=0.1 luminosity densities in the range from 0.2 to 2.2 microns. the age-imfdegeneracy of integrated spectra of stellar populations can be broken for theuniverse as a whole by using direct measurements of (relative) cosmic sfh fromhigh-redshift observations. these have only marginal dependence onuncertainties in the imf, whereas, fitting to local luminosity densitiesdepends strongly on both cosmic sfh and the imf. we fit to these measurementsusing population synthesis and find the best-fit imf power-law slope to begamma=1.15+-0.2 (0.5 &lt; m/m_solar &lt; 120). this slope is in good agreement withthe salpeter imf slope (gamma=1.35). a strong upper limit of gamma&lt;1.7 isobtained which effectively rules out the scalo imf due to its too low fractionof high-mass stars. this upper limit is at the 99.7% confidence level if weassume a closed-box chemical evolution scenario and 95% if we assume constantsolar metallicity. fitting to the h-alpha line luminosity density, we obtain abest-fit imf slope in good agreement with that derived from broadbandmeasurements. marginalizing over cosmic sfh and imf slope, we obtain (95% conf.ranges, h=1): omega_stars = 1.1-2.0 e-3 for the stellar mass density; rho_sfr =0.7-4.1 e-2 m_solar/yr/mpc^3 for the star-formation rate density, and; rho_l =1.2-1.7 e+35 w/mpc^3 for the bolometric, attenuated, stellar, luminositydensity (0.09-5 microns). comparing this total stellar emission with anestimate of the total dust emission implies a relatively modest averageattenuation in the uv (&lt;=1 magnitude at 0.2 microns).

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0410603	color bimodality: implications for galaxy evolution	we use a sample of 69726 galaxies from the sdss to study the variation of thebimodal color-magnitude (cm) distribution with environment. dividing the galaxypopulation by environment (sigma_5) and luminosity (-23&lt;m_r&lt;-17), the u-r colorfunctions are modeled using double-gaussian functions. this enables adeconvolution of the cm distributions into two populations: red and bluesequences. the changes with increasing environmental density can be separatedinto two effects: a large increase in the fraction of galaxies in the reddistribution, and a small color shift in the cm relations of each distribution.the average color shifts are 0.05+-0.01 and 0.11+-0.02 for the red and bluedistributions, respectively, over a factor of 100 in projected neighbordensity. the red fraction varies between about 0% and 70% for low-luminositygalaxies and between about 50% and 90% for high-luminosity galaxies. thisdifference is also shown by the variation of the luminosity functions withenvironment. we demonstrate that the effects of environment and luminosity canbe unified. a combined quantity, sigma_mod = sigma_5/mpc^{-2} + l_r/l_{-20.2},predicts the fraction of red galaxies, which may be related to the probabilityof transformation events. our results are consistent with major interactions(mergers and/or harassment) causing galaxies to transform from the blue to thered distribution. we discuss this and other implications for galaxy evolutionfrom earlier results and model the effect of slow transformations on the colorfunctions.

(2006) models that incorporate agn feedback. both models predicta strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that isqualitatively similar to the observations. however, a quantitative comparisonshows that the bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appearsto be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.
