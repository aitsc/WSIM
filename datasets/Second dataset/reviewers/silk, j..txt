0903.0397	agn jet-induced feedback in galaxies. ii. galaxy colours from a  multicloud simulation	we study the feedback from an agn on stellar formation within its hostgalaxy, mainly using one high resolution numerical simulation of the jetpropagation within the interstellar medium of an early-type galaxy. inparticular, we show that in a realistic simulation where the jet propagatesinto a two-phase ism, star formation can initially be slightly enhanced andthen, on timescales of few million years, rapidly quenched, as a consequenceboth of the high temperatures attained and of the reduction of cloud mass(mainly due to kelvin-helmholtz instabilities). we then introduce a model of(prevalently) {\em negative} agn feedback, where an exponentially decliningstar formation is quenched, on a very short time scale, at a time t_agn, due toagn feedback. using the bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) population synthesis model andour star formation history, we predict galaxy colours from this model and matchthem to a sample of nearby early-type galaxies showing signs of recent episodesof star formation (kaviraj et al. 2007). we find that the quantity t_gal -t_agn, where t_gal is the galaxy age, is an excellent indicator of the presenceof feedback processes, and peaks significantly around t_gal - t_agn \approx0.85 gyr for our sample, consistent with feedback from recent energy injectionby agns in relatively bright (m_{b} \lsim -19) and massive nearby early-typegalaxies. galaxies that have experienced this recent feedback show anenhancement of 3 magnitudes in nuv(galex)-g, with respect to the unperturbed,no-feedback evolution. hence they can be easily identified in large combinednear uv-optical surveys.

0903.4937	galaxy zoo: the fraction of merging galaxies in the sdss and their  morphologies	we present the largest, most homogeneous catalogue of merging galaxies in thenearby universe obtained through the galaxy zoo project - an interface on theworld-wide web enabling large-scale morphological classification of galaxiesthrough visual inspection of images from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).the method converts a set of visually-inspected classifications for each galaxyinto a single parameter (the `weighted-merger-vote fraction,' $f_m$) whichdescribes our confidence that the system is part of an ongoing merger. wedescribe how $f_m$ is used to create a catalogue of 3003 visually-selectedpairs of merging galaxies from the sdss in the redshift range $0.005 &lt; z &lt;0.1$.we use our merger sample and values of $f_m$ applied to the sdss main galaxyspectral sample (mgs) to estimate that the fraction of volume-limited ($m_r &lt;-20.55$) major mergers ($1/3 &lt; {m}^*_1/{m}^*_2 &lt; 3$) in the nearby universe is$1 - 3 \times c%$ where $c \sim 1.5$ is a correction factor for spectroscopicincompleteness. having visually classified the morphologies of the constituentgalaxies in our mergers, we find that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio ofgalaxies in mergers is higher by a factor $\sim 2$ relative to the globalpopulation. in a companion paper, we examine the internal properties of thesemerging galaxies and conclude that this high spiral-to-elliptical ratio inmergers is due to a longer time-scale over which mergers with spirals aredetectable compared to mergers with ellipticals.

0903.5057	galaxy zoo: the properties of merging galaxies in the nearby universe -  local environments, colours, masses, star-formation rates and agn activity	following the study of darg et al. (2009; hereafter d09a) we explore theenvironments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and agn activityin a sample of 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the sdss using visualclassifications from the galaxy zoo project. while d09a found that thespiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of theglobal galaxy population, no significant differences are found between theenvironmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample.this makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be anenvironmental effect and must, therefore, arise from differing time-scales ofdetectability for spirals and ellipticals. we find that merging galaxies have awider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significantblue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. galaxiesclassed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have averagestar-formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though starformation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. we concludethat the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scalesover which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoreticalstudies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers. we alsosuggest that the transition mass $3\times10^{10}{m}_{\astrosun}$, noted by\citet{kauffmann1}, below which ellipticals are rare could be linked to discsurvival/destruction in mergers.

0905.3345	influence of agn jets on the magnetized icm	galaxy clusters are the largest structures for which there is observationalevidence of a magnetised medium. central cores seem to host strong magneticfields ranging from a few 0.1 microg up to several 10 microg in cooling flowclusters. numerous clusters harbor central powerful agn which are thought toprevent cooling flows in some clusters. the influence of such feedback on themagnetic field remains unclear: does the agn-induced turbulence compensate theloss of magnetic amplification within a cool core? and how is this turbulencesustained over several gyr? using high resolution magneto-hydrodynamicalsimulations of the self-regulation of a radiative cooling cluster, we study forthe first time the evolution of the magnetic field within the central core inthe presence of a powerful agn jet. it appears that the jet-induced turbulencestrongly amplifies the magnetic amplitude in the core beyond the degree towhich it would be amplified by pure compression in the gravitational field ofthe cluster. the agn produces a non-cooling core and increases the magneticfield amplitude in good agreement with microg field observations.

0906.1788	the search for decaying dark matter	we propose an x-ray mission called xenia to search for decaying superweaklyinteracting dark matter particles (super-wimp) with a mass in the kev range.the mission and its observation plan are capable of providing a major breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of dark matter (dm). it willconfirm, or reject, predictions of a number of particle physics models byincreasing the sensitivity of the search for decaying dm by about two orders ofmagnitude through a wide-field imaging x-ray spectrometer in combination with adedicated observation program.  the proposed mission will provide unique limits on the mixing angle and massof neutral leptons, right handed partners of neutrinos, which are importantdark matter candidates. the existence of these particles is strongly motivatedby observed neutrino flavor oscillations and the problem of baryon asymmetry ofthe universe.  in super-wimp models, the details of the formation of the cosmic web aredifferent from those of lambdacdm. the proposed mission will, in addition tothe search for decaying dark matter, provide crucial insight into the nature ofdm by studying the structure of the "cosmic web". this will be done bysearching for missing baryons in emission, and by using gamma-ray bursts asbacklight to observe the warm-hot intergalactic media in absorption.

0707.2790	the evolving faint-end of the luminosity function	we investigate the evolution of the faint-end slope of the luminosityfunction, $\alpha$, using semi-analytical modeling of galaxy formation. inagreement with observations, we find that the slope can be fitted well by$\alpha (z) =a+b z$, with a=-1.13 and b=-0.1. the main driver for the evolutionin $\alpha$ is the evolution in the underlying dark matter mass function.sub-l_* galaxies reside in dark matter halos that occupy a different part ofthe mass function. at high redshifts, this part of the mass function is steeperthan at low redshifts and hence $\alpha$ is steeper. supernova feedback ingeneral causes the same relative flattening with respect to the dark mattermass function. the faint-end slope at low redshifts is dominated by fieldgalaxies and at high redshifts by cluster galaxies. the evolution of$\alpha(z)$ in each of these environments is different, with field galaxieshaving a slope b=-0.14 and cluster galaxies b=-0.05. the transition fromcluster-dominated to field-dominated faint-end slope occurs roughly at aredshift $z_* \sim 2$, and suggests that a single linear fit to the overallevolution of $\alpha(z)$ might not be appropriate. furthermore, this resultindicates that tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies in clusters cannot play asignificant role in explaining the evolution of $\alpha(z)$ at z&lt; z_*. inaddition we find that different star formation efficiencies a_* in theschmidt-kennicutt-law and supernovae-feedback efficiencies $\epsilon$ generallydo not strongly influence the evolution of $\alpha(z)$.

0912.2629	composite star formation histories of early-type galaxies from minor  mergers: prospects for wfc3	the star formation history of nearby early-type galaxies is investigated vianumerical modelling. idealized hydrodynamical n-body simulations with a starformation prescription are used to study the minor merger process between agiant galaxy (host) and a less massive spiral galaxy (satellite) withreasonable assumptions for the ages and metallicities of the mergerprogenitors. we find that the evolution of the star formation rate is extendedover several dynamical times and shows peaks which correspond to pericentrepassages of the satellite. the newly formed stars are mainly located in thecentral part of the satellite remnant while the older stars of the initial diskare deposited at larger radii in shell-like structures. after the final plungeof the satellite, star formation in the central part of the remnant cancontinue for several gyrs depending on the star formation efficiency. althoughthe mass fraction in new stars is small, we find that the half-mass radiusdiffers from the half-light radius in the v and h bands. moreover synthetic 2dimages in j, h, nuv, hb and v bands, using the characteristic filters of thewide field camera 3 (wfc3) on the hubble space telescope (hst), reveal thatresidual star formation induced by gas-rich minor mergers can be clearlyobserved during and after the final plunge, especially in the nuv band, forinteracting systems at (z&lt;0.023) over moderate numbers of orbits (~2 orbitscorrespond to typical exposure times of ~3600 sec). this suggests that wfc3 hasthe potential to resolve these substructures, characterize plausible pastmerger episodes, and give clues to the formation of early-type galaxies.

0707.3483	observational biases in lagrangian reconstructions of cosmic velocity  fields	lagrangian reconstruction of large-scale peculiar velocity fields can bestrongly affected by observational biases. we develop a thorough analysis ofthese systematic effects by relying on specially selected mock catalogues. forthe purpose of this paper, we use the mak reconstruction method, although anyother lagrangian reconstruction method should be sensitive to the sameproblems. we extensively study the uncertainty in the mass-to-light assignmentdue to luminosity incompleteness, and the poorly-determined relation betweenmass and luminosity. the impact of redshift distortion corrections is analyzedin the context of mak and we check the importance of edge and finite-volumeeffects on the reconstructed velocities. using three mock catalogues withdifferent average densities, we also study the effect of cosmic variance. inparticular, one of them presents the same global features as found inobservational catalogues that extend to 80 mpc/h scales. we give recipes,checked using the aforementioned mock catalogues, to handle these particularobservational effects, after having introduced them into the mock catalogues soas to quantitatively mimic the most densely sampled currently available galaxycatalogue of the nearby universe. once biases have been taken care of, thetypical resulting error in reconstructed velocities is typically about aquarter of the overall velocity dispersion, and without significant bias. wefinally model our reconstruction errors to propose an improved bayesianapproach to measure omega_m in an unbiased way by comparing the reconstructedvelocities to the measured ones in distance space, even though they may beplagued by large errors. we show that, in the context of observational data, anearly unbiased estimator of omega_m may be built using mak reconstruction.

0707.3570	the uv properties of e+a galaxies: constraints on feedback-driven  quenching of star formation	we present the first large-scale study of e+a (post-starburst) galaxies thatincorporates photometry in the ultraviolet (uv) wavelengths. we find that thestarburst that creates the e+a galaxy typically takes place within the last gyrand creates a high fraction (20-60 percent) of the stellar mass in the remnantover a short timescale (&lt; 0.1 gyrs). we find a tight correlation between theluminosity of our e+a galaxies and the implied star formation rate (sfr) duringthe starburst. while low-luminosity e+as (m(z) &gt; -20) exhibit implied sfrs ofless than 50 solar masses per year, their luminous counterparts (m(z) &lt; -22)shows sfrs greater than 300 and as high as 2000 solar masses per year,suggesting that luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in thelow-redshift universe could be the progenitors of massive nearby e+a galaxies.we perform a comprehensive study of the characteristics of the quenching thattruncates the starburst in e+a systems.we find that, for galaxies less massivethan 10^10 msun, the quenching efficiency decreases as the galaxy massincreases. however, for galaxies more massive than 10^10 msun, this trend isreversed and the quenching efficiency increases with galaxy mass. noting thatthe mass threshold at which this reversal occurs is in excellent agreement withthe mass above which agn become significantly more abundant in nearby galaxies,we use simple energetic arguments to show that the bimodal behaviour of thequenching efficiency is consistent with agn and supernovae (sn) being theprincipal sources of negative feedback above and below m ~ 10^10 msunrespectively.

1002.4413	agn activity: self-regulation from backflow	we study the internal circulation within the cocoon carved out by therelativistic jet emanating from an agn within the ism of its host galaxy.firstly, we develop a model for the origin of the internal flow, noticing thata significant increase of large scale velocity circulation within the cocoonarises as significant gradients in the density and entropy are created near thehot spot (a consequence of crocco's vorticity generation theorem). we findsimple and accurate approximate solutions for the large scale flow,showing thata backflow towards the few inner parsec region develops. we solve theappropriate fluid dynamic equations, and we use these solutions to predict themass inflow rates towards the central regions. we then perform a series of 2dsimulations of the propagation of jets using flash 2.5, in order to validatethe predictions of our model. the backflows which arise supply the central agnregion with very low angular momentum gas, at average rates of the order of$0.1-0.8 \rm{m}_{\odot} \rm{yr.}^{-1}$, the exact value seen to be stronglydependent on the central ism density (for fixed input jet power). the timescales of these inflows are apparently weakly dependent on the jet/ismparameters, and are of the order of $3-5\times 10^{7} \rm{yrs}$. we then arguethat these backflows could (at least partially) feed the agn, and provide aself-regulatory mechanism of agn activity, that is not directly controlled by,but instead controls, the star formation rate within the central circumnucleardisk.

1006.2564	comptonization of the cosmic microwave background by high energy  particles residing in agn cocoons	x-ray cavities and extended radio sources (`cocoons') surrounding activegalactic nuclei (agn) have been detected by the chandra x-ray mission and radiointerferometers. a joint analysis of x-ray and radio maps suggests thatpressure values of non-thermal radio-emitting particles derived from the radiomaps are not sufficient to inflate the x-ray cavities. we propose using thesunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect, whose intensity strongly depends on thepressure, to find the hitherto undetected, dynamically-dominant component inthe radio cocoons.  we demonstrate that the spectral function at a frequency of 217 ghz has anabsolute maximum at a temperature higher than $10^9$ k, therefore themeasurement of the sz effect at this frequency is a powerful tool forpotentially revealing the dynamically-dominant component inside agn jet-drivenradio cocoons. a new method is proposed for excluding the contribution from thelow energy, non-relativistic electrons to the sz effect by means ofobservations at two frequencies. we show how one may correct for a possiblecontribution from the kinematic sz effect. the intensity maps of the sz effectare calculated for the self-similar sedov solution, and application of apredicted ring-like structure on the sz map at a frequency of 217 ghz isproposed to determine the energy released during the active jet stage. the szintensity map for an agn cocoon in a distant elliptical is calculated using a2-d numerical simulation and including relativistic corrections to the szeffect. we show the intensity spectrum of the sz effect is flat at highfrequencies if gas temperature is as high as $k_\mathrm{b} t_{\mathrm{e}}=500$kev.

1102.5707	extreme value statistics of smooth random gaussian fields	we consider the gumbel or extreme value statistics describing thedistribution function p_g(x_max) of the maximum values of a random field xwithin patches of fixed size. we present, for smooth gaussian random fields intwo and three dimensions, an analytical estimate of p_g which is expected tohold in a regime where local maxima of the field are moderately high and weaklyclustered. when the patch size becomes sufficiently large, the negative of thelogarithm of the cumulative extreme value distribution is simply equal to theaverage of the euler characteristic of the field in the excursion x &gt; x_maxinside the patches. the gumbel statistics therefore represents an interestingalternative probe of the genus as a test of non gaussianity, e.g. in cosmicmicrowave background temperature maps or in three-dimensional galaxy catalogs.it can be approximated, except in the remote positive tail, by a negativeweibull type form, converging slowly to the expected gumbel type form forinfinitely large patch size. convergence is facilitated when large scalecorrelations are weaker. we compare the analytic predictions to numericalexperiments for the case of a scale-free gaussian field in two dimensions,achieving impressive agreement between approximate theory and measurements. wealso discuss the generalization of our formalism to non-gaussian fields.

1103.1901	locally cold flows from large-scale structure	we show that the "cold" hubble flow observed for galaxies around the milkyway does not represent a problem in cosmology but is due to the particulargeometry and dynamics of our local wall. the behavior of the perturbed hubbleflow around the milky way is the result of two main factors: at small scales (r&lt; 1 mpc) the inflow is dominated by the gravitational influence of the milkyway. at large scales (r &gt; 1 mpc) the out flow reflects the expansion of ourlocal wall which "cools down" the peculiar velocities. this is an intrinsicproperty of walls and is independent of cosmology. we find the dispersion ofthe local hubble flow (1 &lt; r &lt; 3 mpc) around simulated "milky way" haloeslocated at the centre of low-density cosmological walls to be {\sigma}_h ~ 30km/s, in excellent agreement with observations. the expansion of our local wallis also reflected in the value of the measured local hubble constant. for"milky way" haloes inside walls, we find super-hubble flows with h_local \simeq0.77 - 1.13. the radius of equilibrium (r_0) depends not only on the mass ofthe central halo and the hubble expansion but also on the dynamics given by thelocal lss geometry. the super-hubble flow inside our local wall has the effectof reducing the radius at which the local expansion balances the gravitationalinfluence of the milky way. by ignoring the dynamical effect of the local wall,the mass of the milky way estimated from r_0 can be underestimated by as muchas ~ 30%.

1210.4160	the insignificance of major mergers in driving star formation at z~2	we study the significance of major-merger-driven star formation in the earlyuniverse, by quantifying the contribution of this process to the total starformation budget in 80 massive (m* &gt; 10^10 msun) galaxies at z~2. employingvisually-classified morphologies from rest-frame v-band hst imaging, we findthat 55+/-14% of the star formation budget is hosted by non-interactinglate-types, with 27+/-8% in major mergers and 18+/-6% in spheroids. given thata system undergoing a major merger continues to experience star formationdriven by other processes at this epoch (e.g. cold accretion, minor mergers),~27% is an upper limit to the major-merger contribution to star formationactivity at this epoch. the ratio of the average specific star formation ratein major mergers to that in the non-interacting late-types is ~2.2:1,suggesting that the enhancement of star formation due to major merging istypically modest, and that just under half the star formation in systemsexperiencing major mergers is unrelated to the merger itself. taking this intoaccount, we estimate that the actual major-merger contribution to the starformation budget may be as low as ~15%. while our study does not preclude amajor-merger-dominated era in the very early universe, if the major-mergercontribution to star formation does not evolve strongly into larger look-backtimes, then this process has a relatively insignificant role in driving stellarmass assembly over cosmic time.

1311.5562	3d simulations of the early stages of agn jets: geometry, thermodynamics  and backflow	we investigate the interplay between jets from active galactic nuclei (agns)and the surrounding interstellar medium (ism) through full 3d, high resolution,adaptive mesh refinement simulations performed with the flash code. we followthe jet- ism system for several myr in its transition from an early, compactsource to an extended one including a large cocoon. during the jet evolution,we identify three major evolutionary stages and we find that, contrary to theprediction of popular theoretical models, none of the simulations shows aself-similar behavior. we also follow the evolution of the energy budget, andfind that the fraction of input power deposited into the ism (the agn couplingconstant) is of order of a few percent during the first few myr. this is inbroad agreement with galaxy formation models employing agn feedback. however,we find that in these early stages, this energy is deposited only in a smallfraction (&lt; 1%) of the total ism volume. finally we demonstrate the relevanceof backflows arising within the extended cocoon generated by a relativistic agnjet within the ism of its host galaxy, previously proposed as a mechanism forself-regulating the gas accretion onto the central object. these backflows tendlater to be destabilized by the 3d dynamics, rather than by hydrodynamic(kelvin- helmholtz) instabilities. yet, in the first few hundred thousandyears, backflows may create a central accretion region of significant extent,and convey there as much as a few millions of solar masses.

1407.8185	the role of major mergers in the size growth of intermediate-mass  spheroids	we study of the role of major mergers (mass ratios &gt;1:4) in driving sizegrowth in high-redshift (1&lt;z&lt;2) spheroidal galaxies (sgs) with stellar massesbetween 10^9.5 msun and 10^10.7 msun. this is a largely unexplored mass rangeat this epoch, containing the progenitors of more massive sgs on which the bulkof the size-evolution literature is based. we visually split our sgs intosystems that are relaxed and those that exhibit tidal features indicative of arecent merger. numerical simulations indicate that, given the depth of ourimages, only tidal features due to major mergers will be detectable at theseepochs (features from minor mergers being too faint), making the disturbed sgsa useful route for estimating major-merger-driven size growth. the disturbedsgs are offset in size from their relaxed counterparts, lying close to theupper envelope of the local size -- mass relation. the mean size ratio of thedisturbed sgs to their relaxed counterparts is ~2. combining this observed sizegrowth with empirical major-merger histories from the literature suggests thatthe size evolution of a significant fraction (around two-thirds) of sgs in thismass range could be driven by major mergers. if, as is likely, our galaxies areprogenitors of more massive m &gt; 10^10.7 msun sgs at z&lt;1, then major mergers arealso likely to play an important role in the size growth of at least somemassive sgs in this mass range.

1409.2462	the impact of star formation and gamma-ray burst rates at high redshift  on cosmic chemical evolution and reionization	recent observations in the total luminosity density have led to significantprogress in establishing the star formation rate (sfr) at high redshift.concurrently observed gamma-ray burst rates have also been used to extract thesfr at high redshift. the sfr in turn can be used to make a host of predictionsconcerning the ionization history of the universe, the chemical abundances, andsupernova rates. we compare the predictions made using a hierarchical model ofcosmic chemical evolution based on three recently proposed sfrs: two based onextracting the sfr from the observed gamma-ray burst rate at high redshift, andone based on the observed galaxy luminosity function at high redshift. usingthe wmap/planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we findthat only the sfr inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift sufficesto allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation whichextends from z = 0 to redshifts &gt; 10. for the case of the more conservative sfrbased on the observed galaxy luminosity function, the reionization history ofthe universe requires a bimodal imf which includes at least a coeval high (orintermediate) mass mode of star formation at high redshift (z&gt; 10). therefore,we also consider here a more general bimodal case which includes anearly-forming high mass mode as a fourth model to test the chemical history ofthe universe. we compute the abundances of several trace elements, as well asthe expected supernova rates, the stellar mass density and the specific sfr,ssfr, as a function of redshift  for each of the four models considered. we conclude that observationalconstraints on the global metallicity and optical depth at high redshift favorunseen faint but active star forming galaxies as pointed out in many recentstudies.

0806.4570	agn jet-induced feedback in galaxies. i. suppression of star formation	(abridged) we study the interaction of relativistic jets from agns with theism in their host galaxy, using a series of adaptive mesh refinementsimulations of the evolution of the interaction between the cocoon produced bythe jet with a dense cloud, placed very near the cocoon's path. we vary onlythe jet's input power between p_{jet} = 10^{41}-10^{47} {\rm erg/sec}. thedensity probability distribution function (pdf) within the cocoon can bedescribed in terms of two distinct components, which are also spatiallydistinct: a low- and a high-density component. the pdf of the post-shockedregion is well approximated by a modified lognormal distribution, for allvalues of $p_{jet}$. during the active phase, when the jet is fed by the agn,the cloud is subject both to compression and stripping, which tend to increaseits density and diminish its total mass. when the jet is switched off (i.e.during the passive phase) the shocked cloud cools further and tends to becomemore filamentary, under the action of a back-flow which develops within thecocoon. we study the evolution of the star formation rate within the cloud,assuming that is determined by a schmidt-kennicutt law, and we analyze thedifferent physical factors which have an impact on the star formation rate. weshow that, although the star formation rate can occasionally increase, on timescales of the order of $10^{5}-10^{6}$ yrs, star formation will be inhibitedand the cloud fragments. the cooling time of the environment within which thecloud is embedded is however very long: thus, star formation from thefragmented cloud remains strongly inhibited.

0807.2760	evidence for recent star formation in bcgs: a correspondence between  blue cores and uv excess	we present a joint analysis of near-ultraviolet (nuv) data from the galexmission and (optical) colour profiles for a sample of 7 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) in the canadian cluster comparison project. we find that everybcg which has a blue rest-frame uv colour also shows a blue-core in its opticalcolour profile. conversely, bcgs that lack blue cores and show monotonic colourgradients typical of old elliptical galaxies, are red in the uv. we interpretthis as evidence that the nuv enhancement in the blue bcgs is driven by recentstar formation and not from old evolved stellar populations such as horizontalbranch stars. the recent star formation in the blue bcgs typically has an ageless than 200 myrs and contributes mass fractions of less than a percent.although the sample studied here is small, we demonstrate, for the first time,a one-to-one correspondence between blue cores in elliptical galaxies (inparticular bcgs) and a nuv-enhancement observed using galex. the combination ofthis one-to-one correspondence and the consistently young age of recent starformation, coupled with additional correlations with the host cluster's x-rayproperties, strongly suggests that the star formation is fueled by gas coolingout of the intracluster medium. in turn, this implies that any agn heating ofthe intracluster medium in massive clusters only acts to reduce the magnitudeof the cooling flow and that once this flow starts, it is nearly always active.(abridged)

astro-ph;0001207	the redshift evolution of bias and baryonic matter distribution	we study the distribution of baryonic and luminous matter within theframework of a hierarchical scenario. using an analytical model for structureformation which has already been checked against observations for galaxies,lyman-$\alpha$ clouds, clusters and reionization processes, we present itspredictions for the bias of these objects. we describe its dependence on theluminosity (for galaxies or quasars) or the column density (for lyman-$\alpha$absorbers) of the considered objects. we also study its redshift evolution,which can exhibit an intricate behaviour. these astrophysical objects do nottrace the dark matter density field, the lyman-$\alpha$ forest clouds beingundercorrelated and the bright galaxies overcorrelated, while the intermediateclass of lyman-limit systems is seen to sample the matter field quite well.  we also present the distribution of baryonic matter over these variousobjects. we show that light does not trace baryonic mass, since bright galaxieswhich contain most of the stars only form a small fraction of the massassociated with virialized and cooled halos. we consider two cosmologies: acritical density universe and an open universe. in both cases, our resultsagree with observations and show that hierarchical scenarios provide a goodmodel for structure formation and can describe a wide range of objects whichspans at least the seven orders of magnitude in mass for which data exist. moredetailed observations, in particular of the clustering evolution of galaxies,will constrain the astrophysical models involved.

astro-ph;0003199	dark matter problem in disk galaxies	in the generic cdm cosmogony, dark-matter halos emerge too lumpy andcentrally concentrated to host observed galactic disks. moreover, disks arepredicted to be smaller than those observed. we argue that the resolution ofthese problems may lie with a combination of the effects of protogalacticdisks, which would have had a mass comparable to that of the inner dark haloand be plausibly non-axisymmetric, and of massive galactic winds, which atearly times may have carried off as many baryons as a galaxy now contains. ahost of observational phenomena, from quasar absorption lines and intraclustergas through the g-dwarf problem point to the existence of such winds. dynamicalinteractions will homogenize and smooth the inner halo, and the observed diskwill be the relic of a massive outflow. the inner halo expanded after absorbingenergy and angular momentum from the ejected material. observed disks formed atthe very end of the galaxy formation process, after the halo had been reducedto a minor contributor to the central mass budget and strong radial streamingof the gas had died down.

astro-ph;0003419	on breaking the age-metallicity degeneracy in early-type galaxies:  outflows versus star formation efficiency	a simple model of chemical enrichment in cluster early-type galaxies ispresented where the main parameters driving the formation of the stellarcomponent are reduced to four: infall timescale (tf), formation epoch (zf),star formation efficiency (ceff) and fraction of gas ejected in outflows(bout). we find that only variations in bout or ceff can account for thecolour-magnitude relation, so that the most luminous galaxies had low values ofejected gas and high efficiencies. the combination of chemical enrichmenttracks with population synthesis models is used to explore the correlationbetween mass-to-light ratios and masses. a significant slope mismatch is foundbetween stellar and total m/l ratios, which cannot be explained by an agespread and implies a non-linear correlation between total and stellar mass. thesequences driven by star formation efficiency and outflows are shown to predictdifferent trends at high redshift. measurement of the dependence of the tilt ofthe fundamental plane on redshift will break the degeneracy between outflowsand star formation efficiency, which will enable us to determine whether thecolour-magnitude relation is controlled by age or metallicity.

0808.0881	signatures of clumpy dark matter in the global 21 cm background signal	we examine the extent to which the self-annihilation of supersymmetricneutralino dark matter, as well as light dark matter, influences the rate ofheating, ionisation and lyman-alpha pumping of interstellar hydrogen and heliumand the extent to which this is manifested in the 21cm global backgroundsignal. we fully consider the enhancements to the annihilation rate from dmhalos and substructures within them. we find that the influence of suchstructures can result in significant changes in the differential brightnesstemperature. the changes at redsfhits z&lt;25 are likely to be undetectable due tothe presence of the astrophysical signal; however, in the most favourablecases, deviations in the differential brightness temperature, relative to itsvalue in the absence of self-annihilating dm, of up to ~20 mk at z=30 canoccur. thus we conclude that, in order to exclude these models, experimentsmeasuring the global 21cm signal, such as edges and core, will need to reducethe systematics at 50 mhz to below 20 mk.

astro-ph;0008493	how young are early-type cluster galaxies ? quantifying the young  stellar component in a rich cluster at z=0.41	we present a new method of quantifying the mass fraction of young stars ingalaxies by analyzing near-ultraviolet (nuv)-optical colors. we focus ourattention on early-type cluster galaxies, whose star formation history is atpresent undetermined. rest-frame nuv (f300w) and optical (f702w) images ofcluster abell 851 (z=0.41) using hst/wfpc2 allow us to determine a nuv-opticalcolor-magnitude relation, whose slope is incompatible with a monolithicscenario for star formation at high redshift. a degeneracy between a youngstellar component and its fractional mass contribution to the galaxy is found,and a photometric analysis comparing the data with the predictions for a simpletwo-stage star formation history is presented. the analysis shows that some ofthe early-type galaxies may have fractions higher than 10% of the total masscontent in stars formed at z~0.5. an increased scatter is found in thecolor-magnitude relation at the faint end, resulting in a significant fractionof faint blue early-type systems. this would imply that less massive galaxiesundergo more recent episodes of star formation, and this can be explained interms of a positive correlation between star formation efficiency andluminosity.

astro-ph;0009040	secondary cmb anisotropies from the kinetic sz effect	we present an analytic model, based on previous works which tackled thereionization history of the universe, which allows us to describe thegeneration of the secondary cmb anisotropies due to the kinetic sz effect. wetake into account the "patchy pattern" of reionization (hii bubbles), thecross-correlations of these ionized regions, the small-scale fluctuations ofthe matter density field and the contribution from collapsed objects. for anopen universe, we find that the power-spectrum $l(l+1)c_l/(2\pi)$ exhibits aplateau of height $10^{-13}$ in the range $10^3 &lt; l &lt; 10^6$. we find that forlarge wavenumbers $l &gt; 10^4$ the signal is dominated by the contribution fromcollapsed halos while for $l &lt; 10^4$ it is governed by the large-scalecorrelations of hii bubbles. this implies that one cannot discriminatereionization by stars from a quasar-driven scenario since the size of ionizedregions never dominates the behaviour of the anisotropies. moreover, thesecondary cmb anisotropies arise from a broad range of redshifts (7.5&lt;z&lt;10 forthe igm and 0&lt;z&lt;7 for galactic halos). the signal expected in our model mightbias the cosmological parameter estimation from cmb experiments such as planckand could be detected by future mm-wavelength interferometers (e.g., alma).

astro-ph;0009042	constraining our universe with x-ray &amp; optical cluster data	we have used recent x-ray and optical data in order to impose someconstraints on the cosmology and cluster scaling relations. generically twokind of hypotheses define our model. first we consider that the clusterpopulation is well described by the standard press-schechter (ps) formalism,and second, these clusters are supposed to follow scaling relations with mass:temperature-mass (t-m) and x-ray luminosity-mass (l_x - m). as a differencewith many other authors we do not assume specific scaling relations to modelcluster properties such as the usual $t-m$ virial relation or one observationaldetermination of the $l_x-t$ relation. instead we consider general freeparameter scaling relations. with the previous model (ps plus scalings) we fitour free parameters to several x-ray and optical data with the advantage overmany other works that we consider all the data sets at the same time. thisprevents us from being inconsistent with some of the available observations.among other interesting conclusions, we find that only low-density universesare compatible with all the data considered and that the degeneracy between$\omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ is broken. also we obtain interesting limits on theparameters characterizing the scaling relations.

astro-ph;0105384	how old is the universe ? setting new constraints on the age of the  universe	there are three independent techniques for determining the age of theuniverse: via cosmochronology of long-lived radioactive nuclei, via stellarmodelling and population synthesis of the oldest stellar populations, and viathe precision cosmology that has become feasible with the mapping of theacoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background. we demonstrate that allthree methods give completely consistent results, and enable us to set rigorousbounds on the maximum and minimum ages that are allowed for the universe. wepresent new constraints on the age of the universe by performing a multibandcolour analysis of bright cluster ellipticals over a large redshift range(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9), which allows us to infer the ages of their stellar populationsover a wide range of possible formation redshifts and metallicities. applying aconservative prior to hubble's constant of h0=70+-15 km/s/mpc, we find the ageof the universe to be 13.2(+3.6 -2.0) gyr (1-sigma), in agreement both with theestimates from type ia supernovae, as well as with the latest uranium decayestimates. without the assumption of any priors, universes older than 18 gyrare ruled out by the data at the 90 % confidence level.

astro-ph;0106058	forming stars on a viscous timescale: the key to exponential stellar  profiles in disk galaxies?	we argue for implementing star formation on a viscous timescale inhydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxy formation and evolution. modellingtwo-dimensional isolated disk galaxies with the bhatnagar-gross-krook (bgk)hydrocode, we verify the analytic claim of various authors that if thecharacteristic timescale for star formation is equal to the viscous timescalein disks, the resulting stellar profile is exponential on several scale lengthswhatever the initial gas and dark matter profile. this casts new light on bothnumerical and semi-analytical disk formation simulations which either (a)commence star formation in an already exponential gaseous disk, (b) begin adisk simulation with conditions known to lead to an exponential, i.e. thecollapse of a spherically symmetric nearly uniform sphere of gas in solid bodyrotation under the assumption of specific angular momentum conservation, or (c)in simulations performed in a hierarchical context, tune their feedbackprocesses to delay disk formation until the dark matter halos are slowlyevolving and without much substructure so that the gas has the chance tocollapse under conditions known to give exponentials. in such models, starformation follows a schmidt-like law, which for lack of a suitable timescale,resorts to an efficiency parameter. with star formation prescribed on a viscoustimescale however, we find gas and star fractions after $\sim$ 12 gyr that areconsistent with observations without having to invoke any ``fudge factor'' forstar formation. our results strongly suggest that despite our gap inunderstanding the exact link between star formation and viscosity, the viscoustimescale is indeed the natural timescale for star formation.

astro-ph;0110636	the impact of an extra background of relativistic particles on the  cosmological parameters derived from microwave background anisotropies	recent estimates of cosmological parameters derived from cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies are based on the assumption that we know theprecise amount of energy density in relativistic particles in the universe,$\omega_{rel}$, at all times. there are, however, many possible mechanisms thatcan undermine this assumption. in this paper we investigate the effect thatremoving this assumption has on the determination of the various cosmologicalparameters. we obtain fairly general bounds on the redshift of equality,$z_{eq}= \omega_{m}/\omega_{rel}=3100_{-400}^{+600}$. we show that$\omega_{rel}$ is nearly degenerate with the amount of energy in matter,$\omega_m$, and that its inclusion in cmb parameter estimation also affects thepresent constraints on other parameters such as the curvature or the scalarspectral index of primordial fluctuations. this degeneracy has the effect oflimiting the precision of parameter estimation from the map satellite, but itcan be broken by measurements on smaller scales such as those provided by theplanck satellite mission.

astro-ph;0111409	on the possibility of observing the double emission line feature of  h$_2$ and hd from primordial molecular cloud cores	we study the prospects for observing h$_2$ and hd emission during theassembly of primordial molecular cloud cores. the primordial molecular cloudcores, which resemble those at the present epoch, can emerge around $1+z \sim20$ according to recent numerical simulations. a core typically contracts toform the first generation of stars and the contracting core emits h$_2$ and hdline radiation. these lines show a double peak feature. the higher peak is theh$_2$ line of the $j=2-0$ (v=0) rotational transition, and the lower peak isthe hd line of the $j=4-3$ (v=0) rotational transition. the ratio of the peaksis about 20, this value characterising the emission from primordial galaxies.the expected emission flux at the redshift of $1+z \sim 20$ (e.g. $\omega_m =0.3$ and $\omega_\lambda =0.7$), in the $j=2-0$ (v=0) line of h$_2$ occurs at arate $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}$ jy, and in the $j=4-3$ (v=0) line of hd at a rate$\sim 4 \times 10^{-9}$ jy. the former has a frequency of 5.33179$\times10^{11}$ hz and the latter is at 5.33388 $\times 10^{11}$hz, respectively.since the frequency resolution of alma is about 40 khz, the double peak isresolvable. while an individual object is not observable even by alma, theexpected assembly of primordial star clusters on subgalactic scales can resultin fluxes at the 2000-50 $\mu$jy level. these are marginally observable. thefirst peak of h$_2$ is produced when the core gas cools due to hd cooling,while the second peak of hd occurs because the medium maintains thermal balanceby h$_2$ cooling which must be enhanced by three-body reactions to form h$_2$itself.

astro-ph;0212449	the phase-diagram of the igm and the entropy floor of groups and  clusters: are clusters born warm?	we point out that two problems of observational cosmology, the facts i) that&gt; 60% of the baryonic content of the universe is not observed at z=0 and ii)that the properties of small clusters do not agree with simple expectations,could be closely related. as shown by recent studies, the shock-heatingassociated with the formation of large-scale structures heats the intergalacticmedium (igm) and leads to a ``warm igm'' component for the gas. in the samespirit, we suggest the intracluster medium (icm) to be a mixture ofgalaxy-recycled, metal enriched gas and intergalactic gas, shock-heated by thecollapsing much larger scales. this could be obtained through two processes: 1)the late infalling gas from the external warm igm is efficiently mixed withinthe halo and brings some additional entropy, or 2) the shocks generated bylarger non-linear scales are also present within clusters and can heat the icm.we show that if assumption (1) holds, the entropy brought by the warm igm issufficient to explain the observed properties of clusters, in particular theentropy floor and the lx-t relation. on the other hand, we briefly note thatthe scenario (2) would require a stronger shock-heating because of the largerdensity of the icm as compared with filaments. our scenario of clusters being"born warm" can be checked through the predicted redshift evolution of theentropy floor.

astro-ph;0302067	cosmological constraints from the cluster contribution to the power  spectrum of the soft x-ray background. new evidence for a low sigma_8	we use the x-ray power spectrum of the rosat all-sky survey in the r6 band(approximately 0.9-1.3 kev) to set an upper limit on the galaxy cluster powerspectrum. the cluster power spectrum is modelled with a minimum number ofrobust assumptions regarding the structure of the clusters. the power spectrumof rosat sets an upper limit on the omega_m-sigma_8 plane which excludes allthe models with sigma_8 above sigma_8 = 0.5/(omega_m^0.38) in a flat lcdmuniverse. we discuss the possible sources of systematic errors in ourconclusions, mainly dominated by the assumed l_x-t relation. alternatively,this relation could be constrained by using the x-ray power spectrum, if thecosmological model is known. our conclusions suggest that only models with alow value of sigma_8 (sigma_8 &lt; 0.8 for omega_m = 0.3) may be compatible withour upper limit. we also find that models predicting lower luminosities ingalaxy clusters are favoured. reconciling our cosmological constraints withthese arising by other methods might require either a high entropy floor orwide-spread presence of cooling flows in the low-redshift clusters.

astro-ph;0302094	cmb power spectrum estimation and map reconstruction with the  expectation - maximization algorithm	we apply the iterative expectation-maximization algorithm (em) to estimatethe power spectrum of the cmb from multifrequency microwave maps. in addition,we are also able to provide a reconstruction of the cmb map. by assuming thatthe combined emission of the foregrounds plus the instrumental noise isgaussian distributed in fourier space, we have simplified the em procedurefinding an analytical expression for the maximization step. by using thesimplified expression the cpu time can be greatly reduced. we test thestability of our power spectrum estimator with realistic simulations of planckdata, including point sources and allowing for spatial variation of thefrequency dependence of the galactic emissions. without prior information aboutany of the components, our new estimator can recover the cmb power spectrum upto scales l~1500 with less than 10% error. this result is significantlyimproved if the brightest point sources are removed before applying ourestimator. in this way, the cmb power spectrum can be recovered up to l~1700with 10% error and up to l~2100 with 50% error. this result is very close tothe one that would be obtained in the ideal case of only cmb plus white noise,for which all our assumptions are satisfied. moreover, the em algorithm alsoprovides an straightforward mechanism to reconstruct the cmb map. the recoveredcosmological signal shows a high degree of correlation (r = 0.98) with theinput map and low residuals.

astro-ph;0302268	the sz effect contribution to wmap. a cross-correlation between wmap and  rosat	we cross-correlate wmap and rosat diffuse x-ray background maps and look forcommon features in both data sets. we use the power spectrum of the productmaps and the cross-power spectrum to highlight a possible correlation. thepower spectrum of the product maps does not detect any correlation and thecross-power spectrum does not show any significant deviation from 0. we exploredifferent explanations for this lack of correlation. a universe with a lowvalue of sigma_8 could naturally explain the lack of correlation. we alsodiscuss the systematic effects which can affect this result, in particular thesubtraction of some cluster signal from the rosat diffuse maps which couldsignificantly suppress the correlation signal. these systematic effects reduceconsiderably the significance of our constraints on the cosmological model.when we include the systematic effects we find a weaker constrain on sigma_8allowing models with values as large as sigma_8=1 (for omega_m = 0.3) to beconsistent with the lack of correlation. to illustrate the capabilities of themethod with future high-quality data, we show how from the correlation signalit should be possible to predict the level of contamination of the sz effect onthe power spectrum of the cmb. within the systematic errors we find evidencethat this contribution is negligible for wmap and is expected to be small inexperiments like acbar or cbi, but can be important for future high resolutionexperiments.

astro-ph;0307293	sz polarisation as a probe of the intracluster medium	we present high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the degree anddirection of polarisation imprinted on the cmb by the sunyaev-zel'dovich effectin the the line of sight to massive galaxy clusters. we focus on twocontributions which contribute most of the induced cmb polarisation in additionto the intrinsic cmb quadrupole: the radiation quadrupole seen by electrons dueto their own velocity in the plane normal to the line of sight, and theradiation quadrupole due to the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect, which isgenerated by a previous scattering elsewhere in the cores of the local andnearby clusters. we show that inside the virial radius of a massive cluster,this latter effect, although being second order in the optical depth, can reachthe level of the former effect. these two effects can, respectively, constrainthe projected tangential velocity and inner density profile of the gas, if theycan be separated with multi-frequency observations. as the information on thetangential velocity of the icm gas is combined with the kineticsunyaev-zel'dovich temperature effect probing the projected radial velocity itwill be possible to constrain the dynamics of the icm. in particular, futurepolarisation observations may be able to trace out the filamentary structure ofthe cooler and less dense ionized gas that has not yet been incorporated intomassive clusters. we also discuss how the collapse of a cluster should producea peculiar ring-like polarisation pattern which would open a new window todetect proto-clusters at high redshift.

astro-ph;0308165	the formation history of the galactic bulge	the distributions of the stellar metallicities of k giant stars in severalfields of the galactic bulge, taken from the literature are compared with asimple model of star formation and chemical evolution. our model assumes aschmidt law of star formation and is described by only a few parameters thatcontrol the infall and outflow of gas and the star formation efficiency. wefind that very short infall timescales are needed, with durations of infall andstar formation greater than 1 gyr being ruled out at the 90% confidence level.the metallicity distributions are compatible with an important amount of gasand metals being ejected in outflows, although a detailed quantification of theejected gas fraction is strongly dependent on a precise determination of theabsolute stellar metallities. the recent bulge data from zoccali et al. arealso analyzed, and the subsample with subsolar metallicities still rules outinfall timescales around 1 gyr at the 90% confidence level. hence, the shorttimescales we derive based on the observed distribution of metallicities arerobust and should be taken as stringent constraints on bulge formation models.

astro-ph;0309181	kinetic sz effect and cmb polarization from subsonic bulk motions of  dense gas clouds in galaxy cluster cores	recent chandra observations have revealed the presence of cold fronts in manyclusters of galaxies. the cold fronts are believed to be produced by the bulkmotions of massive, dense, cold gas clouds with respect to the hotter, morerarefied ambient gas at velocities that can be as high as the speed of sound.this phenomenon may produce a significant contamination of both the kinetic szeffect and the cmb polarization pattern observed in the direction of a cluster.we estimate the contributions to the kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect andto the cmb polarization toward galaxy clusters produced by the bulk motions ofthe gas in the inner parts of galaxy clusters. the observed cold fronts probethe absolute velocities of the gas motion while the induced polarization andthe kinetic sz effect probe the transverse and the radial components,respectively. we show that these signals may be easily detected with sensitivefuture experiments, opening an exciting new window for studies of galaxycluster internal dynamics, and eventually facilitating reconstruction of theintrinsic cluster polarization of the cmb and the associated measure of thelocal cmb quadrupole.

astro-ph;0309652	wimp matter power spectra and small scale power generation	dark matter (dm) is generally assumed to be massive, cold and collisionlessfrom the structure formation point of view. a more correct statement however isthat dm indeed experiences collisional damping, but on a scale which issupposed to be too small to be relevant for structure formation. the aim ofthis paper is to present a cold (although ``collisional'') dark matter particlewhose matter power spectrum is damped and see whether it is distinguishablefrom standard candidates. to achieve this purpose, we calculate the collisionaldamping and free-streaming scales of neutralinos and non conventionalcandidates (say light particles heavier than ~1 mev but lighter than o(10)gev). the latter can be considered as cold dark matter (cdm) particles in thesense that they become non relativistic before their thermal decoupling epoch.unlike neutralinos, however, their linear matter power spectrum can be dampedon scales of ~ 10^3 msol due to their interactions. since these scales are ofcosmological interest for structure formation, we perform a series of numericalsimulations to obtain the corresponding non linear matter power spectrap(k)_{nl} at the present epoch. we show that because of small scaleregeneration, they all resemble each other at low redshifts, i.e. become verysimilar to a typical cdm matter power spectrum on all but the smallest scales.therefore, even if lensing measurements at redshift below unity were to yield ap(k)_{nl} consistent with cdm models, this would not constitute a sufficientlyrobust evidence in favour of the neutralino to rule out alternative dmcandidates.

astro-ph;0312015	on the formation of cold fronts in massive mergers	using adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations, we follow the evolution of twosymmetric cold fronts developing in the remnant of a violent z=0.3 massivecluster merger. the structure and location of the simulated cold fronts arevery similar to those recently found in x-ray cluster observations, supportingthe merger hypothesis for the origin of at least some of the cold fronts. thecold fronts are preceded by an almost spherical bow shock which originates atthe core and disappears after 1.6 gyr. the cold fronts last longer and surviveuntil z=0. we trace back the gas mass constituting the fronts and find itinitially associated with the two dense cores of the merging clusters.conversely, we follow how the energy of the gas of the initial merging coresevolves until z=0 from the merging and show that a fraction of this gas canescape from the local potential well of the sub-clumps. this release occurs asthe sub-clumps reach their apocentre in an eccentric orbit and is due todecoupling between the dark matter and part of the gas in the sub-clump becauseof, first, heating of the gas at first close core passage and of, second, theeffect of the global cluster pressure which peaks as the centrifugalacceleration of the sub-clump is maximal. the fraction of the gas of thesub-clump liberated in the outbound direction then cools as it expandsadiabatically and constitutes the cold fronts.

astro-ph;0403536	the star formation history of intermediate redshift late-type galaxies	we combine the latest observations of disk galaxy photometry and rotationcurves at moderate redshift from the fors deep field (fdf) with simple modelsof chemical enrichment. our method describes the buildup of the stellarcomponent through infall of gas and allows for gas and metal outflows. in thisframework, we keep a minimum number of constraints and we search a large volumeof parameter space, looking for the models which best reproduce the photometricobservations in the observed redshift range (0.5&lt;z&lt;1). we find the starformation efficiency to correlate well with vmax so that massive disks are moreefficient in the formation of stars and have a smaller spread in stellar ages.this trend presents a break at around vmax 140km/s. galaxies on either side ofthis threshold have significantly different age distributions. this break hasbeen already suggested by several authors in connection with the contributionfrom either gravitational instabilities or supernova-driven turbulence to starformation. no clear trend is seen between galaxy mass and infall timescale orgas outflows. the model presented in this paper suggests massive disks haveformation histories resembling those of early-type galaxies, with highlyefficient and short-lived bursts, in contrast with low-mass disks, which have amore extended star formation history. one option to explain the observedshallow slope of the tully-fisher relation at intermediate redshift could besmall episodes of star formation in low-mass disks.

astro-ph;0403561	on the excess of power in high resolution cmb experiments	we revisit the possibility that an excess in the cmb power spectrum at smallangular scales (cbi, acbar) can be due to galaxy clusters (or compact sourcesin general). we perform a gaussian analysis of acbar-like simulated data basedon wavelets. we show how models with a significant excess should show a clearnon-gaussian signal in the wavelet space. in particular, a value of thenormalization sigma_8 = 1 would imply a highly significant skewness andkurtosis in the wavelet coefficients at scales around 3 arcmin. models with amore moderate excess also show a non-gaussian signal in the simulated data. weconclude that current data (acbar) should show this signature if the excess isto be due to the sz effect. otherwise, the reason for that excess should beexplained by some systematic effect. the significance of the non-gaussiansignal depends on the cluster model but it grows with the surveyed area.non-gaussianity test performed on incoming data sets should reveal the presenceof a cluster population even for models with moderate-low sigma_8's.

astro-ph;0412419	do the unidentified egret sources trace annihilating dark matter in the  local group?	in a cold dark matter (cdm) framework of structure formation, the dark matterhaloes around galaxies assemble through successive mergers with smaller haloes.this merging process is not completely efficient, and hundreds of survivinghalo cores, or {\it subhaloes}, are expected to remain in orbit within the haloof a galaxy like the milky way. while the dozen visible satellites of the milkyway may trace some of these subhaloes, the majority are currently undetected. alarge number of high-velocity clouds (hvcs) of neutral hydrogen {\it are}observed around the milky way, and it is plausible that some of the hvcs maytrace subhaloes undetected in the optical. confirming the existence ofconcentrations of dark matter associated with even a few of the hvcs wouldrepresent a dramatic step forward in our attempts to understand the nature ofdark matter. supersymmetric (susy) extensions of the standard model of particlephysics currently suggest neutralinos as a natural well-motivated candidate forthe non-baryonic dark matter of the universe. if this is indeed the case, thenit may be possible to detect dark matter indirectly as it annihilates intoneutrinos, photons or positrons. in particular, the centres of subhaloes mightshow up as point sources in gamma-ray observations. in this work we considerthe possibility that some of the unidentified egret $\gamma$-ray sources traceannihilating neutralino dark matter in the dark substructure of the localgroup. we compare the observed positions and fluxes of both the unidentifiedegret sources and the hvcs with the positions and fluxes predicted by a modelof halo substructure, to determine to what extent any of these threepopulations could be associated.

astro-ph;0509375	on the origin of stars in bulges and elliptical galaxies	we investigate the stellar composition of bulges and elliptical galaxies aspredicted by the cdm paradigm using semi-analytical modelling. we argue thatspheroid stars are built up of two main components, {\it merger} and {\itquiescent}, according to the origin of the stars. the merger component isformed during major mergers by gas driven to the centre, while the quiescentcomponent is formed in gaseous discs and added later to the spheroid duringmajor mergers. galaxies more massive than $m_c=3 \times 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$have on average only a 15% merger component in their spheroids, while smallergalaxies can have up to 30%. the merger component increases with redshift dueto mergers involving more gas. however we do not find mergers with gas fractionabove $ \sim 40 %$ of the remnants mass. generally the gas fraction is adecreasing function of the redshift at which the merger occurs and the mass ofthe remnant, with more massive remnants having smaller gas fraction and hencesmaller merger components. this trend is independent of the environment of thegalaxy with the only impact of the environment being that galaxies less massivethan $m_c$ have slightly larger merger components in dense environments.  the fraction of stars in bulges for galaxies more massive than $m_c$ islarger than 50%. we find that the majority of stars in galaxies more massivethan $m_c$ reside within bulges and ellipticals independent of redshift andthat the fraction increases with redshift. the most massive galaxies at eachredshift are elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0601685	massive and red objects predicted by a semianalytical model of galaxy  formation	we study whether hierarchical galaxy formation in a concordance $\lambda$cdmuniverse can produce enough massive and red galaxies compared to theobservations. we implement a semi-analytical model in which the central blackholes gain their mass during major mergers of galaxies and the energy feedbackfrom active galaxy nuclei (agn) suppresses the gas cooling in their host halos.the energy feedback from agn acts effectively only in massive galaxies whensupermassive black holes have been formed in the central bulges. compared withprevious models without black hole formation, our model predicts more massiveand luminous galaxies at high redshift, agreeing with the observations of k20up to $z\sim 3$. also the predicted stellar mass density from massive galaxiesagrees with the observations of gdds. because of the energy feedback from agn,the formation of new stars is stopped in massive galaxies with the terminationof gas cooling and these galaxies soon become red with color $r-k&gt;$5 (vegamagnitude), comparable to the extremely red objects (eros) observed at redshift$z\sim$1-2. still the predicted number density of very eros is lower thanobserved at $z\sim 2$, and it may be related to inadequate descriptions of dustextinction, star formation history and agn feedback in those luminous galaxies.

astro-ph;0602347	the progenitor set of present-day early-type galaxies	we present a comprehensive theoretical study, within a fully realisticsemi-analytical framework, of the photometric properties of early-typeprogenitors in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1, as a function of the luminosity andlocal environment of the early-type remnant at present-day. we find that,averaging across all environments at z~1, less than 50 percent of the stellarmass which ends up in early-types today is actually in early-type progenitorsat this redshift. the corresponding value is ~65 percent in clusters due tofaster morphological transformations in the such dense environments. we developprobabilistic prescriptions which provide a means of including spiral (i.e. nonearly-type) progenitors at intermediate and high redshifts, based on theirluminosity and optical (bvk) colours. for example, at intermediate redshifts(z~0.5), large (m_b&lt;-21.5), red (b-v&gt;0.7) spirals have ~75-95 percent chance ofbeing a progenitor, while the corresponding probability for large blue spirals(m_b&lt;-21.5, b-v&lt;0.7) is ~50-75 percent. finally, we explore the correspondencebetween the true progenitor set of present-day early-types and the commonlyused `red-sequence', defined as the set of galaxies within the part of thecolour-magnitude space which is dominated by early-type objects. while largemembers (m_v&lt;-22) of the `red sequence' trace the progenitor set accurately interms of numbers and mass, the relationship breaks down severely at fainterluminosities (m_v&gt;-21). hence the red sequence is generally not a good proxyfor the progenitor set of early-type galaxies.

0809.1734	dry mergers: a crucial test for galaxy formation	we investigate the role that dry mergers play in the build-up of massivegalaxies within the cold dark matter paradigm. implementing an empiricalshut-off mass scale for star formation, we find a nearly constant dry mergerrate of $ \sim 6 \times 10^{-5}$ mpc$^{-3}$ gyr$^{-1}$ at $z \leq 1$ and asteep decline at larger z. less than half of these mergers are between twogalaxies that are morphologically classified as early-types, and the other halfis mostly between an early-type and late-type galaxy. latter are primecandidates for the origin of tidal features around red elliptical galaxies. theintroduction of a transition mass scale for star formation has a strong impacton the evolution of galaxies, allowing them to grow above a characteristic massscale of $m_{*,c} \sim 6.3 \times 10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ by mergers only. as aconsequence of this transition, we find that around $m_{*,c}$, the fraction of1:1 mergers is enhanced with respect to unequal mass major mergers. thissuggest that it is possible to detect the existence of a transition mass scaleby measuring the relative contribution of equal mass mergers to unequal massmergers as a function of galaxy mass. the evolution of the high-mass end of theluminosity function is mainly driven by dry mergers at low z. we however findthat only $10% -20%$ of galaxies more massive than $m_{*,c}$ experience drymajor mergers within their last gyr at any given redshift $z \le 1$.

astro-ph;9402063	evolution of galaxies in clusters	we use new models of stellar population synthesis to estimate the fraction ofstars formed during the last major bursts of star formation in e/s0 galaxies inlow-redshift clusters ($z\simlt0.4$) from the spectral signatures ofintermediate-age stars. we find that the mass fraction of stars formed in latebursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased smoothly withredshift, from about 8\% at $z\approx1$ to less than 1\% at $z\approx0$. thisresult, which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers, isnearly independent of the assumed ages and morphological types of theprogenitor galaxies prior to the last major bursts of star formation. we thencompute the implied color and 4000 {\aa} break evolution for progenitors ofe/s0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts $0\simlt z\simlt1$. we investigate aconservative model in which all present-day e/s0 galaxies are assumed toinitially be elliptical galaxies and to then undergo bursts of star formationat the rate estimated from the signatures of intermediate-age stars at lowredshifts. this model reproduces well the observed spread of colors and 4000{\aa} breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters, but underestimates thefraction of galaxies in the blue tail of the distribution. such a discrepancymay be interpreted as an increasing fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters athigh redshift, as suggested independently by recent {\it hst} observations ofintermediate-redshift clusters. the current data do not seem to requiremorphological evolution of cluster galaxies out to $z\sim0.4$, but suggest thateither morphological or strong luminosity evolution might have played a majorrole at $z\simgt0.7$.

astro-ph;9408094	baryonic dark matter and the diffuse gamma ray background	we show that the baryonic gas content of the halo of our galaxy can be probedby performing a multipole expansion on the distribution of diffuse backgroundgamma-ray emission. while the monopole moment (isotropic background) can beused to constrain the baryonic fraction of the halo gas, the quadrupole tomonopole ratio is a sensitive probe of the distribution of gas in the halo,{\it i.e.} the degree of flattening of the gas distribution. the predicteddiffuse gamma ray flux is found to be very sensitive to the adopted cosmic raydensity distribution throughout the halo. if the cosmic rays are uniform, thenthe upper bound on the gas fraction is $16.6\%$ regardless of the flattening ofthe halo gas distribution. however, this bound can be weakened by taking intoaccount the removal of flux in and close to the galactic plane, especially fora oblate ($e &lt;1$) gas distribution. on the other hand, in the more realisticsituation that the cosmic rays linearly trace the smoothed halo mass (and halogas) distribution, then a stringent bound on the baryonic gas fraction in thehalo $\eta$, $\eta \ltwid 3\%$, can be placed with existing data, regardless ofhalo flattening.

astro-ph;9610132	from local velocities to microwave background	the mass density field as extracted from peculiar velocities in ourcosmological neighborhood is mapped back in time to the cmb in two ways. first,the density power spectrum ($p_k$) is translated into a temperature angularpower spectrum of sub-degree resolution ($c_l$) and compared to observations.second, the local density field is translated into a temperature map in a patchon the last-scattering surface of a distant observer. a likelihood analysis ofthe mark iii peculiar velocity data have constrained the range of parametersfor $p_k$ within the family of cobe-normalized cdm models (zaroubi et al 1996),favoring a slight tilt in the initial spectrum, $n&lt;1$. the corresponding rangeof $c_l$'s is plotted against current observations, indicating that the cmbdata can tighten the constraints further: only models with ``small'' tilt($n\sim 0.9$) and ``high'' baryonic content ($\omega_b \sim 0.1$) could survivethe two data sets simultaneously. the local mass density field that has beenrecovered from the velocities via a wiener method is convolved with a boltzmanncalculation to recover $10'$ resolution temperature maps as viewed fromdifferent directions. the extent of the cmb patch and the amplitude offluctuations depend on the choice of cosmological parameters, e.g., the local$100\hmpc$ sphere corresponds to $90'$ to $30'$ at the cmb for $\omega$ between1 and 0 respectively. the phases of the temperature map are correlated withthose of the density field, contrary to the contribution of the sachs-wolfeeffect alone. this correlation suggests the possibility of an inversereconstruction of the underlying density field from cmb data with interestingtheoretical implications.

astro-ph;9707343	dark baryons and rotation curves	the best measured rotation curve for any galaxy is that of the dwarfspiralxxxx ddo 154, which extends out to about 20 disk scale lengths. itprovides an ideal laboratory for testing the universal density profileprediction from high resolution numerical simulations of hierarchicalclustering in cold dark matter dominated cosmological models. we find that theobserved rotation curve cannot be fit either at small radii, as previouslynoted, or at large radii. we advocate a resolution of this dilemma bypostulating the existence of a dark spheroid of baryons amounting to severaltimes the mass of the observed disk component and comparable to that of thecold dark matter halo component. such an additional mass component provides anexcellent fit to the rotation curve provided that the outer halo is still colddark matter-dominated with a density profile and mass-radius scaling relationas predicted by standard cdm-dominated models. the universal existence of suchdark baryonic spheroidal components provides a natural explanation of theuniversal rotation curves observed in spiral galaxies, may have a similarorigin and composition to the local counterpart that has been detected asmachos in our own galactic halo via gravitational microlensing, and isconsistent with, and even motivated by, primordial nucleosynthesis estimates ofthe baryon fraction.

astro-ph;9711036	collision induced galaxy formation	we present a semi-analytical model in which galaxy collisions and strongtidal interactions, both in the field and during the collapse phase of groupsand clusters help determine galaxy morphology. from a semi-analytical analysisbased on simulation results of tidal collisions (aguilar &amp; white 1985), wepropose simple rules for energy exchanges during collisions that allow todiscriminate between different hubble types: efficient collisions result in thedisruption of disks and substantial star formation, leading to the formation ofelliptical galaxies; inefficient collisions allow a large gas reservoir tosurvive and form disks. assuming that galaxy formation proceeds in a omega_0=1cold dark matter universe, the model both reproduces a number of observationsand makes predictions, among which are the redshifts of formation of thedifferent hubble types in the field. when the model is normalized to thepresent day abundance of x-ray clusters, the amount of energy exchange neededto produce elliptical galaxies in the field implies that they formed at z&gt;2.5while spiral galaxies formed at z&lt;1.5. the model also offers a naturalexplanation for biasing between the various morphological types. we find thatthe present day morphology-density relation in the field is well reproducedunder the collision hypothesis. finally, predictions of the evolution of thevarious galaxy populations with redshift are made, in the field as well as inclusters.

astro-ph;9712065	cosmic star formation and type ia/ii supernova rates at high z	we study how type ia/ii supernova rates at various redshifts can be used toconstrain the cosmic star formation rate (csfr) history. we use aspectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution which provides a self-consistentdescription of global properties of local galaxies. we have chosen two csfrhistories, with and without dust extinction, both normalized in order toreproduce the observed comoving luminosity densities at different wavelengths.we show that as expected, the snii rates provide a direct measurement of theinstantaneous csfr, whereas the snia rate depends on the csfr history duringthe past few gyrs. therefore the snia rate detected up to $z {\sim}$ 1 is ableto provide new insight on the csfr at higher redshift. the comparison with thedata are in good agreement with both local and high-$z$ measurement andprovides an additional evidence of the validity of the csfr up to $z$ = 1, butsuggests values at $z &gt;$ 1 higher than those of madau et al. (1996) andconsistent with the presence of extinction. we also show that type ia supernovaobservations at $z{\sim}$ 1 can already put constraints on the still puzzlingnature of type ia progenitors.

astro-ph;9803235	the age and metallicity range of early-type galaxies in clusters	we present an unbiased method for evaluating the ranges of ages andmetallicities which are allowed by the photometric properties of the stellarpopulations that dominate the light of early-type galaxies in clusters. themethod is based on the analysis of morphologically-classified early-typegalaxies in 17 clusters at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9 and in the nearby coma clusterusing recent stellar population synthesis models that span a wide range ofmetallicities. we confirm that metallicity effects must play a role in theorigin of the slope of the color-magnitude relation for cluster early-typegalaxies. we show, however, that the small scatter of the color-magnituderelation out to redshifts z=1 does not formally imply a common epoch of majorstar formation for all early-type galaxies. instead, it requires that galaxiesassembling more recently be on average more metal-rich than older galaxies ofsimilar luminosity. regardless of the true ages and metallicities of early-typegalaxies within the allowed range, their photometric properties and the impliedstrengths of several commonly used spectral indices are found to be consistentwith apparently passive evolution of the stellar populations. also, the implieddependence of the mass-to-light ratio on galaxy luminosity is consistent withthe observed trend. the results of our unbiased analysis define the boundariesin age and metallicity that must be satisfied by theoretical studies aimed atexplaining the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies in clusters.

astro-ph;9804284	deprojection of rich cluster images	we consider a general method of deprojecting 2d images to reconstruct the 3dstructure of the projected object, assuming axial symmetry. the method consistsof the application of the fourier slice theorem to the general case where theaxis of symmetry is not necessarily perpendicular to the line of sight, and isbased on an extrapolation of the image fourier transform into the so-calledcone of ignorance. the method is specifically designed for the deprojection ofx-ray, sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and gravitational lensing maps of rich clustersof galaxies. for known values of the hubble constant, h0, and inclinationangle, the quality of the projection depends on how exact is the extrapolationin the cone of ignorance. in the case where the axis of symmetry isperpendicular to the line of sight and the image is noise-free, thedeprojection is exact. given an assumed value of h0, the inclination angle canbe found by matching the deprojected structure out of two different images of agiven cluster, e.g., sz and x-ray maps. however, this solution is degeneratewith respect to its dependence on the assumed h0, and a third independent imageof the given cluster is needed to determine h0 as well. the application of thedeprojection algorithm to upcoming sz, x-ray and weak lensing projected massimages of clusters will serve to determine the structure of rich clusters, thevalue of h0, and place constraints on the physics of the intra-cluster gas andits relation to the total mass distribution.

astro-ph;9903388	the redshift evolution of lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers	we present a model for the lyman-alpha absorbers that treats all objects(from the low-density forest clouds to the dense damped systems) in a unifieddescription. this approach is consistent with an earlier model of galaxies(luminosity function, metallicity) but also with the known description of thedensity field in the small-scale non-linear regime. we consider twocosmological models: a critical universe $\omega=1$ with a cdm power-spectrum,and an open cdm universe with $\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda=0$. we reproduce theavailable data on column density distribution as a function of redshift, thevalue of the main new parameter, the background ionizing uv flux, beingconsistent with the observed limits. this allows a quantitatively trustableanalytical description of the opacity, mass, size, velocity dispersion andmetallicity of these absorbers, over a range of column densities spanning 10orders of magnitude. moreover, together with an earlier model of galaxyformation this draws a unified picture of the redshift evolution of structuresin the universe, from underdense clouds to massive high density galaxies, fromweak to very deep potential wells.

astro-ph;9903411	the reheating and reionization history of the universe	we incorporate quasars into an analytic model to describe the reheating andreionization of the universe. in combination with a previous study of galaxiesand lyman-$\alpha$ clouds, we are able to provide a unified description ofstructure formation, verified against a large variety of observations. we alsotake into account the clumping of the baryonic gas in addition to the presenceof collapsed objects. we consider two cosmologies: a critical universe with acdm power-spectrum and an open universe with $\omega_0=0.3$, $\lambda=0$. thederived quasar luminosity function agrees reasonably well with observations at$z&lt;4.5$ and with constraints over larger redshifts from the hdf. the radiationproduced by these objects at $z \sim 16$ slowly reheats the universe which getssuddenly reionized at $z_{ri}=6.8$ for the open universe ($z_{ri}=5.6$ for thecritical density universe). the uv background radiation simultaneouslyincreases sharply to reach a maximum of $j_{21} = 0.18$ at $z=2.6$, but showsstrong ionization edges until $z \leq 1$. the metallicity of the gas increasesquickly at high $z$ and is already larger than $0.01 z_{\odot}$ at $z=10$. theqso number counts and the helium opacity constrain the reionization redshift tobe $z_{ri} \sim 6$. we confirm that a population of faint quasars is needed inorder to satisfy the observations. due to the low reionization redshift, thedamping of cmb fluctuations is quite small, but future observations (e.g. withthe ngst) of the multiplicity functions of radiation sources and of the hi andheii opacities will strongly constrain scenarios in which reionization is dueto qsos.

astro-ph;9907068	the entropy history of the universe	using a unified analytic model for quasars, galaxies, lyman-alpha absorbersand the igm, we obtain the redshift evolution of the temperature and theentropy of the gas and the corresponding cluster temperature - x-ray luminosityrelation. we show that although quasars can easily reheat the igm and raise itsentropy up to the level required by current cluster observations the energyprovided by supernovae is unlikely to be sufficient. indeed, the efficiencyfactor needed for the supernova scenario is of order unity while for quasars weget a value ~ 0.008. thus the igm is more likely to have been reheated byquasars. moreover, we find that if both scenarios are normalized to presentobservations the reheating due to quasars occurs somewhat earlier (z ~ 2) thanfor supernovae (z ~ 0.4) because of the sharp drop at low z of the quasarluminosity function. we also show that the compton parameter y induced by theigm is well below the observed upper limit in all cases. finally, we note thatsuch a reheating process may partly account for the decline at low redshift ofthe comoving star formation rate and of the quasar luminosity function. inparticular, we show that the contradictory requirements arising from clustersand galaxies lead to a reheating temperature $t \sim 5 10^5$ k. on the otherhand, the reionization process of the universe is almost not modified by theseentropy sources.

astro-ph;9910385	probing the evolution of early-type cluster galaxies through chemical  enrichment	a simple chemical enrichment model for cluster early-type galaxies isdescribed in which the mechanisms considered in the evolutionary model areinfall of primordial gas, outflows and a possible variation in the starformation efficiency. we find that - within the framework of our models - onlyoutflows can generate a suitable range of metallicities. the chemicalenrichment tracks can be combined with the latest population synthesis modelsto simulate clusters over a wide redshift range, for a set of toy models. thecolor-magnitude relation of local clusters is used as a constraint, fixing thecorrelation between absolute luminosity and ejected fraction of gas fromoutflows. it is found that the correlations between color or mass-to-lightratios and absolute luminosity are degenerate with respect to most of the inputparameters. however, a significant change between monolithic and hierarchicalmodels is predicted for redshifts $z\simgt 1$. the comparison between predictedand observed mass-to-light ratios yield an approximate linear bias betweentotal and stellar masses: $m_{\rm tot}\propto m_{\rm st}^{1.15\pm 0.08}$ inearly-type galaxies. if we assume that outflows constitute the drivingmechanism for the colors observed in cluster early type galaxies, themetallicity of the intracluster medium (icm) can be linked to outflows. thecolor-magnitude constraint requires faint $m_v\sim -16$ galaxies to eject 85%of their gas, which means that most of the metals in the icm may haveoriginated in these dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;9912471	isotropic wavelets: a powerful tool to extract point sources from cmb  maps	it is the aim of this paper to introduce the use of isotropic wavelets todetect and determine the flux of point sources appearing in cmb maps. the mostsuited wavelet to detect point sources filtered with a gaussian beam is themexican hat. an analytical expression of the wavelet coefficient obtained inthe presence of a point source is provided and used in the detection and fluxestimation methods presented. for illustration the method is applied to twosimulations (assuming planck mission characteristics) dominated by cmb (100ghz) and dust (857 ghz) as these will be the two signals dominating at low andhigh frequency respectively in the planck channels. we are able to detectbright sources above 1.58 jy at 857 ghz (82% of all sources) and above 0.36 jyat 100 ghz (100% of all) with errors in the flux estimation below 25%. the mainadvantage of this method is that nothing has to be assumed about the underlyingfield, i.e. about the nature and properties of the signal plus noise present inthe maps. this is not the case in the detection method presented by tegmark andoliveira-costa 1998. both methods are compared producing similar results.

0810.5753	galics ii: the [alpha/fe]-mass relation in elliptical galaxies	we aim at reproducing the mass- and sigma-[alpha/fe] relations in the stellarpopulations of early-type galaxies by means of a cosmologically motivatedassembly history for the spheroids. we implement a detailed treatment for thechemical evolution of h, he, o and fe in galics, a semi-analytical model forgalaxy formation which successfully reproduces basic low- and high-redshiftgalaxy properties. the contribution of supernovae (both type ia and ii) as wellas low- and intermediate-mass stars to chemical feedback are taken intoaccount. we find that this chemically improved galics does not produce theobserved mass- and sigma-[alpha/fe] relations. the slope is too shallow andscatter too large, in particular in the low and intermediate mass range. themodel shows significant improvement at the highest masses and velocitydispersions, where the predicted [alpha/fe] ratios are now marginallyconsistent with observed values. we show that this result comes from theimplementation of agn (plus halo) quenching of the star formation in massivehaloes. a thorough exploration of the parameter space shows that the failure ofreproducing the mass- and sigma-[alpha/fe] relations can partly be attributedto the way in which star formation and feedback are currently modelled. themerger process is responsible for a part of the scatter. we suggest that thenext generation of semi-analytical model should feature feedback (eitherstellar of from agn) mechanisms linked to single galaxies and not only to thehalo, especially in the low and intermediate mass range. the integral starformation history of a single galaxy determines its final stellar [alpha/fe] asit might be expected from the results of closed box chemical evolution models.(abridged)

0812.1183	modeling the star forming universe at z=2: impact of cold accretion  flows	we present results of a semi-analytic model (sam) that includes coldaccretion and a porosity-based prescription for star formation. we can recoverthe puzzling observational results of low $v/\sigma$ seen in various massivedisk or disk-like galaxies, if we allow 18 % of the accretion energy from coldflows to drive turbulence in gaseous disks at $z=2$. the increase of gas massthrough cold flows is by itself not sufficient to increase the star formationrate sufficiently to recover the number density of $\dot{m}_*&gt;120$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ galaxies in our model. in addition, it is necessary to increase thestar formation efficiency. this can be achieved naturally in the porositymodel, where star formation efficiency scales $\propto \sigma$, which scales ascloud velocity dispersion. as cold accretion is the main driver for gasvelocity dispersion in our model, star formation efficiency parallels coldaccretion rates, and allows fast conversion into stars. at $z\sim 2$, we find aspace density $~10^{-4}$ mpc$^{-3}$ in star-forming galaxies with$\dot{m}_*&gt;120$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, in better agreement than earlierestimates form sams. however, the fundamental relation between $\dot{m}_*$ and$m_*$ is still offset from the observed relation, indicating the need forpossibly more efficient star formation at high z perhaps associated with a rolefor agn triggering.

hep-ph;0408045	observables sensitive to absolute neutrino masses: constraints and  correlations from world neutrino data	in the context of three-flavor neutrino mixing, we present a thorough studyof the phenomenological constraints applicable to three observables sensitiveto absolute neutrino masses: the effective neutrino mass in tritium beta decay(m_beta); the effective majorana neutrino mass in neutrinoless double betadecay (m_2beta); and the sum of neutrino masses in cosmology (sigma). wediscuss the correlations among these variables which arise from the combinationof all the available neutrino oscillation data, in both normal and inverseneutrino mass hierarchy. we set upper limits on m_beta by combining updatedresults from the mainz and troitsk experiments. we also consider the latestresults on m_2beta from the heidelberg-moscow experiment, both with and withoutthe lower bound claimed by such experiment. we derive upper limits on sigmafrom an updated combination of data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) satellite and the 2 degrees fields (2df) galaxy redshifts survey,with and without lyman-alpha forest data from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss), in models with a non-zero running of the spectral index of primordialinflationary perturbations. the results are discussed in terms oftwo-dimensional projections of the globally allowed region in the(m_beta,m_2beta,sigma) parameter space, which neatly show the relative impactof each data set. in particular, the (in)compatibility between sigma andm_2beta constraints is highlighted for various combinations of data. we alsobriefly discuss how future neutrino data (both oscillatory and non-oscillatory)can further probe the currently allowed regions.
