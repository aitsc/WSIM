1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2396	hermes: the submillimeter spectral energy distributions of  herschel/spire-detected galaxies	we present colours of sources detected with the herschel/spire instrument indeep extragalactic surveys of the lockman hole, spitzer-fls, and goods-n fieldsin three photometric bands at 250, 350 and 500 micrometers. we compare thesewith expectations from the literature and discuss associated uncertainties andbiases in the spire data. we identify a 500 micrometer flux limited selectionof sources from the hermes point source catalogue that appears free fromneighbouring/blended sources in all three spire bands. we compare the colourswith redshift tracks of various contemporary models. based on these spectraltemplates we show that regions corresponding to specific population types andredshifts can be identified better in colour-flux space. the redshift tracks aswell as the colour-flux plots imply a majority of detected objects withredshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;3.5, somewhat depending on the group of model seds used. wealso find that a population of s_250/s_350&lt;0.8 at fluxes above 50 mjy asobserved by spire is not well represented by contemporary models and couldconsist of a mix of cold and lensed galaxies.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3018	a search for debris disks in the herschel atlas	aims: we aim to demonstrate that the herschel atlas (h-atlas) is suitable fora blind and unbiased survey for debris disks by identifying candidate debrisdisks associated with main sequence stars in the initial science demonstrationfield of the survey. we show that h-atlas reveals a population offar-infrared/sub-mm sources that are associated with stars or star-like objectson the sdss main-sequence locus. we validate our approach by comparing theproperties of the most likely candidate disks to those of the known population.methods: we use a photometric selection technique to identify main sequencestars in the sdss dr7 catalogue and a bayesian likelihood ratio method toidentify h-atlas catalogue sources associated with these main sequence stars.following this photometric selection we apply distance cuts to identify themost likely candidate debris disks and rule out the presence of contaminatinggalaxies using ukidss las k-band images. results: we identify 78 h-atlassources associated with sdss point sources on the main-sequence locus, of whichtwo are the most likely debris disk candidates: h-atlas j090315.8 and h-atlasj090240.2. we show that they are plausible candidates by comparing theirproperties to the known population of debris disks. our initial resultsindicate that bright debris disks are rare, with only 2 candidates identifiedin a search sample of 851 stars. we also show that h-atlas can derive usefulupper limits for debris disks associated with hipparcos stars in the field andoutline the future prospects for our debris disk search programme.

1005.5073	in-flight calibration of the herschel-spire instrument	spire, the spectral and photometric imaging receiver, is the herschel spaceobservatory's submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m, and an imaging fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) covering 194-671 {\mu}m (447-1550 ghz). in thispaper we describe the initial approach taken to the absolute calibration of thespire instrument using a combination of the emission from the herscheltelescope itself and the modelled continuum emission from solar system objectsand other astronomical targets. we present the photometric, spectroscopic andspatial accuracy that is obtainable in data processed through the "standard"pipelines. the overall photometric accuracy at this stage of the mission isestimated as 15% for the photometer and between 15 and 50% for thespectrometer. however, there remain issues with the photometric accuracy of thespectra of low flux sources in the longest wavelength part of the spirespectrometer band. the spectrometer wavelength accuracy is determined to bebetter than 1/10th of the line fwhm. the astrometric accuracy in spire maps isfound to be 2 arcsec when the latest calibration data are used. the photometriccalibration of the spire instrument is currently determined by a combination ofuncertainties in the model spectra of the astronomical standards and the dataprocessing methods employed for map and spectrum calibration. improvements inprocessing techniques and a better understanding of the instrument performancewill lead to the final calibration accuracy of spire being determined only byuncertainties in the models of astronomical standards.

1005.5123	the herschel-spire instrument and its in-flight performance	the spectral and photometric imaging receiver (spire), is the herschel spaceobservatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. it contains a three-bandimaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imagingfourier transform spectrometer (fts) which covers simultaneously its wholeoperating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 ghz). the spire detectors arearrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 k. the photometer has afield of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands.its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scannedacross the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas ifdesired. the spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with adiameter of 2.6'. the spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25ghz by changing the stroke length of the fts scan mirror. its main operatingmode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the fts mirrorto acquire spectral data. for extended source measurements, multiple positionoffsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achievethe desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to mapareas larger than the field of view. the spire instrument consists of a coldfocal plane unit located inside the herschel cryostat and warm electronicsunits, located on the spacecraft service module, for instrument control anddata handling. science data are transmitted to earth with no on-board datacompression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated scienceproducts. the in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceedspredictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometersensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, andthe spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.5390	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared--radio correlation at z&lt;0.5	we use data from the herschel-atlas to investigate the evolution of thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5. using thetotal far-infrared luminosity of all &gt;5sigma sources in the herschel-atlasscience demonstration field and cross-matching these data with radio data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty-centimetres (first) survey and thenrao vla northern sky survey (nvss), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to theherschel sources. with these data we find no evidence for evolution in thefar-infrared--radio correlation over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.5, where themedian value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, $q_{\rmir}$, over this range is $q_{\rm ir} = 2.40\pm 0.12$ (and a mean of $q_{\rmir}=2.52 \pm 0.03$ accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both thelocal value determined from {\em iras} and values derived from surveystargeting the high-redshift universe. by comparing the radio fluxes of oursample measured from both first and nvss we show that previous resultssuggesting an increase in the value of $q_{\rm ir}$ from high to low redshiftmay be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshiftsources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although agncontamination could still play a significant role.  we also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength, cooler dust isheated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star-formationrate as closely as the shorter wavelength $\ltsim 250~\mu$m emission or theradio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individualgalaxies.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1009.5983	measurements of co redshifts with z-spec for lensed submillimeter  galaxies discovered in the h-atlas survey	we present new observations from z-spec, a broadband 185-305 ghzspectrometer, of five sub-millimeter bright lensed sources selected from theherschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) sciencedemonstration phase (sdp) catalog. we construct a redshift finding algorithmusing combinations of the signal-to-noise of all the lines falling in thez-spec bandpass to determine redshifts with high confidence, even in caseswhere the signal-to-noise in individual lines is low. we measure the dustcontinuum in all sources and secure co redshifts for four out of five(z~1.5-3). in one source, sdp.17, we tentatively identify two independentredshifts and a water line, confirmed at z=2.308. our sources have propertiescharacteristic of dusty starburst galaxies, with magnification-corrected starformation rates of 10^(2-3) m_sun/yr. lower limits for the dust masses (~a few10^8 m_sun) and spatial extents (~1 kpc equivalent radius) are derived from thecontinuum spectral energy distributions, corresponding to dust temperaturesbetween 54 and 69k. in the lte approximation, we derive relatively low coexcitation temperatures (&lt; 100 k) and optical depths (tau&lt;1). performing anon-lte excitation analysis using radex, we find that the co lines measured byz-spec (from j=4-&gt;3 to 10-&gt;9, depending on the galaxy) localize the bestsolutions to either a high-temperature / low-density region, or alow-temperature / high-density region near the lte solution, with the opticaldepth varying accordingly. observations of additional co lines, co(1-0) inparticular, are needed to constrain the non-lte models.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1010.5782	the first release of data from the herschel atlas: the spire images	we have reduced the data taken with the spectral and photometric imagingreceiver (spire) photometer on board the herschel space observatory in thescience demonstration phase (sdp) of the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas). we describe the data reduction, which poses specificchallenges, both because of the sheer size of the data, and because only twoscans are made for each region. we implement effective solutions to process thebolometric timelines into maps, and show that correlations among detectors arenegligible, and that the photometer is stable on time scales up to 250 s. thisis longer than the time the telescope takes to cross the observed sky region,and it allows us to use naive binning methods for an optimal reconstruction ofthe sky emission. the maps have equal contribution of confusion and whiteinstrumental noise, and the latter is estimated to 5.3, 6.4, and 6.7 mjy/beam(1-{\sigma}), at 250, 350, and 500 \mu{m}, respectively. this pipeline is usedto reduce other h-atlas observations, as they became available, and we discusshow it can be used with the optimal map maker implemented in the herschelinteractive processing environment (hipe), to improve computational efficiencyand stability. the sdp dataset is available from http://www.h-atlas.org/.

1010.5787	herschel-atlas: first data release of the science demonstration phase  source catalogues	the herschel-atlas is a survey of 550 square degrees with the herschel spaceobservatory in five far--infrared and submillimetre bands. the first data forthe survey, observations of a field 4x4 sq. degrees in size, were taken duringthe science demonstration phase, and reach a 5 sigma noise level of 33 mjy/beamat 250 microns. this paper describes the source extraction methods used tocreate the corresponding science demonstration phase catalogue, which contains6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees. spire sourcesare extracted using a new method specifically developed for herschel data; pacscounterparts of these sources are identified using circular apertures placed atthe spire positions. aperture flux densities are measured for sourcesidentified as extended after matching to optical wavelengths. the reliabilityof this catalogue is also discussed, using full simulated maps at the threespire bands. these show that a significant number of sources at 350 and 500microns have undergone flux density enhancements of up to a factor of ~2, duemainly to source confusion. correction factors are determined for theseeffects. the sdp dataset and corresponding catalogue will be available fromhttp://www.h-atlas.org/.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1112.3653	spitzer irac identification of herschel-atlas spire sources	we use spitzer-irac data to identify near-infrared counterparts tosubmillimeter galaxies detected with herschel-spire at 250um in the herschelastrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas). using a likelihood ratioanalysis we identify 146 reliable irac counterparts to 123 spire sources out ofthe 159. we find that, compared to the field population, the spire counterpartsoccupy a distinct region of 3.6 and 4.5um color-magnitude space, and we usethis property to identify a further 23 counterparts to 13 spire sources. theirac identification rate of 86% is significantly higher than those that havebeen demonstrated with wide-field ground-based optical and near-ir imaging ofherschel fields. we estimate a false identification rate of 3.6%, correspondingto 4 to 5 sources. among the 73 counterparts that are undetected in sdss, 57have both 3.6 and 4.5um coverage. of these 43 have [3.6] - [4.5]&gt; 0 indicatingthat they are likely to be at z &gt; 1.4. thus, ~ 40% of identified spire galaxiesare likely to be high redshift (z &gt; 1.4) sources. we discuss the statisticalproperties of the irac-identified spire galaxy sample including far-irluminosities, dust temperatures, star-formation rates, and stellar masses. themajority of our detected galaxies have 10^10 to 10^11 l_sun total irluminosities and are not intense starbursting galaxies as those found at z ~ 2,but they have a factor of 2 to 3 above average specific star-formation ratescompared to near-ir selected galaxy samples.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1201.2178	the dust &amp; gas properties of m83	we examine the dust and gas properties of the nearby, barred galaxy m83,which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey. using images from the pacs andspire instruments of herschel, we examine the dust temperature and dust masssurface density distribution. we find that the nuclear, bar and spiral armregions exhibit higher dust temperatures and masses compared to interarmregions. however, the distribution of dust temperature and mass are notspatially coincident. assuming a trailing spiral structure, the dusttemperature peaks in the spiral arms lie ahead of the dust surface densitypeaks. the dust mass surface density correlates well with the distribution ofmolecular gas as traced by co (j=3-2) images (jcmt) and the star formation rateas traced by h?2 with a correction for obscured star formation using 24 micronemission. using hi images from things to trace the atomic gas component, wemake total gas mass surface density maps and calculate the gas-to-dust ratio.we find a mean gas-to-dust ratio of 84 \pm 4 with higher values in the innerregion assuming a constant co-to-h2 conversion factor. we also examine thegas-to-dust ratio using co-to-h2 conversion factor that varies withmetallicity.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1201.2762	the dust scaling relations of the herschel reference survey	we combine new herschel/spire sub-millimeter observations with existingmultiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the herschelreference survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxiesin different environments. we show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratioanti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and nuv-rcolour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. moreover,the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-to early-type galaxies. these scaling relations are similar to those observedfor the hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightlycoupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. we alsofind a weak increase of the dust-to-hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colourbut no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. by comparing galaxiesin different environments we show that, although these scaling relations arefollowed by both cluster and field galaxies, hi-deficient systems have, atfixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological typesystematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-hi mass ratiosthan hi-normal/field galaxies. this provides clear evidence that dust isremoved from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of theenvironment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the hi disk.such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the hi andfollows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if thedust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from thegalactic center.

1202.0402	herschel-atlas: towards a sample of ~1000 strongly-lensed galaxies	while the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux densitys_500&gt;100 mjy has proven to be rather straightforward (negrello et al. 2010),for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the onesobtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. moreover, only byprobing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing toinvestigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. we describehalos (the herschel-atlas lensed objects selection), a method for efficientlyselecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surfacedensity of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the100 mjy flux limit. halos will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidatestrongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu&gt;2) over the full h-atlassurvey area. applying halos to the h-atlas science demonstration phase field(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidatelenses are identified in the viking near-infrared catalog. using the availableinformation on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a~72% purity of the sample. the redshift distribution of the candidate lensedsources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensedgalaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higherredshifts than found in the other surveys. the counts of candidate stronglylensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (lapi et al.2011). even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infraredviking photometry, we show that h-atlas data alone allow the selection of asimilarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiencyclose to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reachedwith a ~70% efficiency.

1202.3891	herschel-atlas: vista viking near-ir counterparts in the phase 1 gama 9h  data	we identify near-infrared ks band counterparts to herschel-atlas sub-mmsources, using a preliminary object catalogue from the vista viking survey. thesub-mm sources are selected from the h-atlas phase 1 catalogue of the gama 9hfield, which includes all objects detected at 250, 350 or 500 um with the spireinstrument. we apply and discuss a likelihood ratio (lr) method for vikingcandidates within a search radius of 10" of the 22,000 spire sources with a 5sigma detection at 250 um. we find that 11,294(51%) of the spire sources have abest viking counterpart with a reliability $r\ge 0.8$, and the falseidentification rate of these is estimated to be 4.2%. we expect to miss ~5% oftrue viking counterparts. there is evidence from z-j and j-ks colours that thereliable counterparts to spire galaxies are marginally redder than the fieldpopulation. we obtain photometric redshifts for ~68% of all (non-stellar)viking candidates with a median redshift of 0.405. comparing to the results ofthe optical identifications supplied with the phase i catalogue, we find thatthe use of medium-deep near-infrared data improves the identification rate ofreliable counterparts from 36% to 51%.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

astro-ph;0008478	box- and peanut-shaped bulges: ii. nir observations	we have observed 60 edge-on galaxies in the nir in order to study the stellardistribution in galaxies with box/peanut-shaped bulges. the much smaller amountof dust extinction at these wavelengths allows us to identify in almost alltarget galaxies with box/peanut-shaped bulges an additional thin, centralcomponent in cuts parallel to the major axis. this structure can be identifiedwith a bar. the length of this structure scaled by the length of the bulgecorrelates with the morphologically classified shape of the bulge. this newlyestablished correlation is therefore mainly interpreted as the projection ofthe bar at different aspect angles. galaxies with peanut bulges have a bar seennearly edge-on and the ratio of bar length to thickness, 14 +/- 4, can bedirectly measured for the first time. in addition, the correlation of theboxiness of bulges with the bar strength indicates that the bar characteristiccould partly explain differences in the bulge shape. furthermore, a new sizerelation between the box/peanut structure and the central bulge is found. ourobservations are discussed in comparison to a n-body simulation for barredgalaxies (pfenniger &amp; friedli 1991). we conclude that the inner region ofbarred disk galaxies are build up by three distinct components: the spheroidalbulge, a thin bar, and a b/p structure most likely representing the thick partof the bar.

astro-ph;0404164	thick disks of lenticular galaxies	thick disks are faint and extended stellar components found around severaldisk galaxies including our milky way. the milky way thick disk, the only onestudied in detail, contains mostly old disk stars (~10 gyr), so that thickdisks are likely to trace the early stages of disk evolution. previousdetections of thick disk stellar light in external galaxies have beenoriginally made for early-type, edge-on galaxies but detailed 2d thick/thindisk decompositions have been reported for only a scant handful of mostlylate-type disk galaxies. we present in this paper for the first time explicit3d thick/thin disk decompositions characterising the presence and properties(eg scalelength and scaleheight) for a sample of eight lenticular galaxies byfitting 3d disk models to the data. for six out of the eight galaxies we wereable to derive a consistent thin/thick disk model. the mean scaleheight of thethick disk is 3.6 times larger than that of the thin disk. the scalelength ofthe thick disk is about twice, and its central luminosity density between 3-10%of, the thin disk value. both thin and thick disk are truncated at similarradii. this implies that thick disks extend over fewer scalelengths than thindisks, and turning a thin disk into a thick one requires therefore vertical butlittle radial heating. all these structural parameters are similar to thickdisk parameters for later hubble-type galaxies previously studied. we discussour data in respect to present models for the origin of thick disks, either aspre- or post-thin-disk structures, providing new observational constraints.

astro-ph;0405541	stellar disk truncations: where do we stand ?	in the light of several recent developments we revisit the phenomenon ofgalactic stellar disk truncations. even 25 years since the first paper on outerbreaks in the radial light profiles of spiral galaxies, their origin is stillunclear. the two most promising explanations are that these 'outer edges'either trace the maximum angular momentum during the galaxy formation epoch, orare associated with global star formation thresholds. depending on their truephysical nature, these outer edges may represent an improved sizecharacteristic (e.g., as compared to d_25) and might contain fossil evidenceimprinted by the galaxy formation and evolutionary history. we will addressseveral observational aspects of disk truncations: their existence, not only innormal hsb galaxies, but also in lsb and even dwarf galaxies; their detailedshape, not sharp cut-offs as thought before, but in fact demarcating the startof a region with a steeper exponential distribution of starlight; theirpossible association with bars; as well as problems related to theline-of-sight integration for edge-on galaxies (the main targets for truncationsearches so far). taken together, these observations currently favour thestar-formation threshold model, but more work is necessary to implement thetruncations as adequate parameters characterising galactic disks.

astro-ph;0603682	the structure of galactic disks: studying late-type spiral galaxies  using sdss	using imaging data from the sdss survey, we present the g' and r' radialstellar light distribution of a complete sample of ~90 face-on to intermediateinclined, nearby, late-type (sb-sdm) spiral galaxies. the surface brightnessprofiles are reliable (1sigma uncertainty less than 0.2 mag) down tomu=~27magsqarcsec. only ~10% of all galaxies have a normal/standard purelyexponential disk down to our noise limit.  the surface brightness distribution of the rest of the galaxies is betterdescribed as a broken exponential. about 60% of the galaxies have a break inthe exponential profile between ~1.5-4.5 times the scalelength followed by adownbending, steeper outer region. another ~30% shows also a clear breakbetween ~4.0-6.0 times the scalelength but followed by an upbending, shallowerouter region. a few galaxies have even a more complex surface brightnessdistribution.  the shape of the profiles correlates with hubble type. downbending breaks aremore frequent in later hubble types while the fraction of upbending breaksrises towards earlier types. no clear relation is found between theenvironment, as characterised by the number of neighbours, and the shape of theprofiles of the galaxies.

astro-ph;0701797	low surface brightness galaxies around the hdf-s: i. object extraction  and photometric results	this study reports on photometric results of a search for lsb galaxies in a0.76deg^2 field centered on the hdf-s. we present results from photometricanalysis of the derived sample galaxies and compare number densities to resultsof former surveys. we used public data from the noao deep wide-field survey andthe multi-wavelength goddard space flight center survey. the former reaches alimiting surface brightness of mu_bw~29 magarcsec^-2 and is therefore one ofthe most sensitive ground based data sets systematically analyzed for lsbgalaxies. to reduce the contamination by high surface brightness (hsb) galaxiesat higher redshift, mimicking lsbs due to the ''tolman dimming'' effect, weplaced a lower diameter limit of 10.8 arcsec and compared the colors of ourcandidate galaxies with the redshift tracks of 5 ''standard'' hsb galaxy types.we report the detection of 37 galaxies with low apparent central surfacebrightness (mu_bw&gt;=22 magarcsec^-2). using color-color diagrams we were able toderive a subsample of 9 lsb galaxy candidates with intrinsic central surfacebrightnesses below mu_(0,bw)=22.5 magarcsec^-2 and diameters larger than thepreselected size limit of 10.8 arcsec. we selected three additional lsbcandidates due to there extreme low blue central surface brightness (mu_bw&gt;=25magarcsec^-2). these galaxies were only found in the larger and more sensitivenoao data. so finally we derived a sample of 12 lsb galaxy candidates andtherfore this survey results in a four times higher surface density than otherccd based surveys for field galaxies before.

astro-ph;0703768	on the 3 dimensional structure of edge-on disk galaxies	a simple algorithm is employed to deproject the two dimensional images of apilot sample of 12 high-quality images of edge-on disk galaxies and to studytheir intrinsic 3 dimensional stellar distribution. we examine the radialprofiles of the stars as a function of height above the plane and report ageneral trend within our sample of an increasing radial scalelength with heightoutside of the dustlane. this could be explained by the widespread presence ofa thick disk component in these galaxies. in addition, the 3 dimensional viewallows the study of the vertical distribution of the outer disk, beyond thebreak region, where we detect a significant increase in scalelength withvertical distance from the major axis for the truncated disks. this could beregarded as a weakening of the "truncation" with increasing distance from theplane. furthermore, we conclude that the recently revised classification of theradial surface brightness profiles found for face-on galaxies is indeedindependent of geometry. in particular, we find at least one example of each ofthe three main profile classes as defined in complete samples of intermediateto face-on galaxies: not-truncated, truncated and antitruncated. the positionand surface brightness that mark the break location in the radial lightdistribution are found to be consistent with those of face-on galaxies.

0812.3219	a pilot survey of stellar tidal streams in nearby spiral galaxies	within the hierarchical framework for galaxy formation, merging and tidalinteractions are expected to shape large galaxies to this day. while majormergers are quite rare at present, minor mergers and satellite disruptions -which result in stellar streams - should be common, and are indeed seen in boththe milky way and the andromeda galaxy. as a pilot study, we have carried outultra-deep, wide-field imaging of some spiral galaxies in the local volume,which has revealed external views of such stellar tidal streams atunprecedented detail, with data taken at small robotic telescopes(0.1-0.5-meter) that provide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity. the goalof this project is to undertake the first systematic and comprehensive imagingsurvey of stellar tidal streams, from a sample of ~50 nearby milky-way-likespiral galaxies within 15 mpc, that features a surface brightness sensitivityof ~ 30 mag/arcsec^2 the survey will result in estimates of the incidence,size/geometry and stellar luminosity/mass distribution of such streams. thiswill not only put our milky way and m31 in context but, for the first time,also provide an extensive statistical basis for comparison withstate-of-the-art, self-consistent cosmological simulations of this phenomenon.
