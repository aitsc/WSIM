0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0906.1807	the zcosmos survey. the dependence of clustering on luminosity and  stellar mass at z=0.2-1	we study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar massat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zcosmos 10k sample.  we measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and itsprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass andredshift ranges. we quantify in detail the observational selection biases andwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles ofsemi-analytic mock catalogues. we finally compare our measurements to thecosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.  at odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxyclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. a mild dependence onstellar mass is instead observed. at z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power onlarge scales. we interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominatingthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular tothe line-of-sight. we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of theamplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.  the clustering measured in the zcosmos data at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 for galaxies withlog(m/m_\odot)&gt;=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mocksurveys. on scales larger than ~2 h^-1 mpc, the observed clustering amplitudeis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. thus, if the power spectrum of matteris lcdm with standard normalization and the bias has no unnaturalscale-dependence, this result indicates that cosmos has picked up aparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1mpc^3. these findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z~1 universeto appropriately characterize the level of structure at this epoch.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0907.5416	zcosmos - 10k-bright spectroscopic sample. the bimodality in the galaxy  stellar mass function: exploring its evolution with redshift	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) up to z~1 from thezcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. we investigate the total mf and thecontribution of etgs and ltgs, defined by different criteria (sed, morphologyor star formation). we unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global mf, betterrepresented by 2 schechter functions dominated by etgs and ltgs, respectively.for the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number densityincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. we find that the mfevolution at intermediate-low values of mstar (logm&lt;10.6) is mostly explainedby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formationactivities. the low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger pergalaxy per gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). we find that etgs increasein number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing mstar, with a median"building redshift" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.for ltgs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remainsalmost constant from z~1. instead, the most extreme population of active starforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. we suggest atransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into bluequiescent and successively (1-2 gyr after) into red passive types. the completemorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scalesor follows after 1-2 gyr. a continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expectedby low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. we estimate that on average~25% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per gyr for logm&lt;11. we concludethat the build-up of galaxies and etgs follows the same downsizing trend withmass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted bycurrent sams. we expect a negligible evolution of the global galaxy baryonicmf.

0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0909.1968	k+a galaxies in the zcosmos survey: physical properties of systems in  their post-starburst phase	the identities of the main processes triggering and quenching star-formationin galaxies remain unclear. a key stage in evolution, however, appears to berepresented by post-starburst galaxies. to investigate their impact on galaxyevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectralfeatures in the cosmos field. we examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxiesat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zcosmos sample. k+a galaxies occupy thebrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. they are as massive as quiescentgalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (orstellar mass) distribution. a small percentage (&lt;8%) of these galaxies haveradio and/or x-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the sfr of~8msun/yr). over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxiesis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence ofbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. this distribution does not vary with thestrength of the hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a wayreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. although k+a galaxiesare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in asimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of~2-8mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratiosimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. with the current data set, we do notfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/massdensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the localvalues, or the spectral properties. those galaxies, which are affected by asudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellarmass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0910.5824	the optical spectra of spitzer 24 micron galaxies in the cosmos field:  ii. faint infrared sources in the zcosmos-bright 10k catalogue	we have used the zcosmos-bright 10k sample to identify 3244 spitzer/mips24-micron-selected galaxies with 0.06&lt; s(24um)&lt; 0.50 mjy and i(ab)&lt;22.5, over1.5 deg^2 of the cosmos field, and studied different spectral properties,depending on redshift. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3, we found that different reddening laws ofcommon use in the literature explain the dust extinction properties of around80% of our infrared (ir) sources, within the error bars. for up to 16% ofobjects, instead, the halpha/hbeta ratios are too high for their ir/uvattenuations, which is probably a consequence of inhomogenous dustdistributions. in only a few of our galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3 the ir emission couldbe mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. besides, theline ratios of ~22% of our galaxies suggest that they might bestar-formation/nuclear-activity composite systems. at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.7, we estimatedgalaxy metallicities for 301 galaxies: at least 12% of them are securely belowthe upper-branch mass-metallicity trend, which is consistent with the localrelation. finally, we performed a combined analysis of the hdeltaequivalent-width versus dn(4000) diagram for 1722 faint and bright 24umgalaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0, spanning two decades in mid-ir luminosity. we foundthat, while secondary bursts of star formation are necessary to explain theposition of the most luminous ir galaxies in that diagram, quiescent,exponentially-declining star formation histories can well reproduce thespectral properties of ~40% of the less luminous sources. our results suggest atransition in the possible modes of star formation at total ir luminositiesl(tir)=(3 +/-2)x10^11 lsun.

0911.0523	properties and environment of radio emitting galaxies in the vla-zcosmos  survey	we investigate the properties and the environment of radio sources withoptical counterpart from the combined vla-cosmos and zcosmos samples. theadvantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopicinformation, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.  by comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectralenergy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide theradio sources in three families, passive agn, non-passive agn and star forminggalaxies. these families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infraredcolor--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the correspondingcontrol samples.  only the passive agn have a significantly different environment distributionfrom their control sample. the fraction of radio-loud passive agn increasesfrom ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than10. this trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hostingthe radio sources. passive agn in overdensities tend to have higher radioluminosities than those in lower density environments. since the black holemass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for lowradio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fueldisponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determinedby the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

0911.2252	the zcosmos-bright survey: the clustering of early and late galaxy  morphological types since z~1	we measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of theirmorphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey withfull morphological information. this is obtained by combining high-resolutionhst imaging and vlt spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to i_ab=22.5 withaccurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos-bright redshift survey. atthis epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly strongerclustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. a comparison to thesdss at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early andlate morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at smallseparations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution sincez~0.8. this suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed inintermediate and dense environments at this epoch. our results are consistentwith a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphologicaltypes between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in themorphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-drivenevolution.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1106.3194	the evolution of quiescent galaxies at high redshift (z &gt; 1.4)	we have studied the evolution of high redshift quiescent galaxies over aneffective area of ~1.7 deg^2 in the cosmos field. galaxies have been dividedaccording to their star-formation activity and the evolution of the differentpopulations has been investigated in detail. we have studied an irac (mag_3.6 &lt;22.0) selected sample of ~18000 galaxies at z &gt; 1.4 with multi-wavelengthcoverage. we have derived accurate photometric redshifts (sigma=0.06) and otherimportant physical parameters through a sed-fitting procedure. we have dividedour sample into actively star-forming, intermediate and quiescent galaxiesdepending on their specific star formation rate. we have computed the galaxystellar mass function of the total sample and the different populations atz=1.4-3.0. we have studied the properties of high redshift quiescent galaxiesfinding that they are old (1-4 gyr), massive (log(m/m_sun)~10.65), weakly starforming stellar populations with low dust extinction (e(b-v) &lt; 0.15) and smalle-folding time scales (tau ~ 0.1-0.3 gyr). we observe a significant evolutionof the quiescent stellar mass function from 2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 to 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.6,increasing by ~ 1 dex in this redshift interval. we find that z ~ 1.5 is anepoch of transition of the gsmf. the fraction of star-forming galaxiesdecreases from 60% to 20% from z ~ 2.5-3.0 to z ~ 1.4-1.6 for log(m/m_sun) &gt;11, while the quiescent population increases from 10% to 50% at the sameredshift and mass intervals. we compare the fraction of quiescent galaxiesderived with that predicted by theoretical models and find that the kitzbichler&amp; white (2007) model is the one that better reproduces the data. finally, wecalculate the stellar mass density of the star-forming and quiescentpopulations finding that there is already a significant number of quiescentgalaxies at z &gt; 2.5 (rho~6.0 msunmpc^-3).

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1111.1729	the galaxy stellar mass function of x-ray detected groups: environmental  dependence of galaxy evolution in the cosmos survey	we study the stellar mass distribution for galaxies in 160 x-ray detectedgroups of 10^13&lt;log(m_200/m_sun)&lt;2x10^14 and compare it with that of galaxiesin the field, to investigate the action of environment on the build up of thestellar mass. we highlight differences in the build up of the passivepopulation in the field, which imprint features in the distribution of stellarmass of passive galaxies at log(m/m_sun)&lt; 10.5. the gradual diminishing of theeffect when moving to groups of increasing total masses indicates that thegrowing influence of the environment in bound structures is responsible for thebuild up of a quenched component at log(m/m_sun)&lt; 10.5. differently, thestellar mass distribution of star forming galaxies is similar in shape in allthe environments, and can be described by a single schechter function both ingroups and in the field. little evolution is seen up to redshift 1.nevertheless at z=0.2-0.4 groups with m_200&lt;6x10^13 msun (low mass groups) tendto have a characteristic mass for star forming galaxies which is 50% higherthan in higher mass groups; we interpret it as a reduced action ofenvironmental processes in such systems. furthermore we analyse thedistribution of ssfr--log(m) in groups and in the field, and find that groupsshow on average a lower ssfr (by ~0.2 dex) at z&lt;0.8. accordingly, we find thatthe fraction of star forming galaxies is increasing with redshift in allenvironments, but at a faster pace in the denser ones. finally our analysishighlights that low mass groups have a higher fraction (by 50%) of the stellarmass locked in star forming galaxies than higher mass systems (i.e. 2/3 oftheir stellar mass).

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.1673	a journey from the outskirts to the cores of groups i: color- and  mass-segregation in 20k-zcosmos groups	using the group catalog obtained from zcosmos spectroscopic data and thecomplementary photometric data from the cosmos survey, we explore segregationeffects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. webuilt two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.45) and high (0.45 &lt;z &lt;= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxiesinto three samples according to their distance from the group center. weexplored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins ofstellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the groupcenter. we found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (log(m_gal/m_sun)&gt;= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions ofred/blue objects. for galaxies of lower masses (9.8 &lt;= log(m_gal/m_sun) &lt;=10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and bluegalaxies. this dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groupsdo not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. interestingly, masssegregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as afunction of radius. we suggest a simple scenario where color- andmass-segregation originate from different physical processes. while dynamicalfriction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, bothstarvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench starformation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. in poorer groups theenvironmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxyevolution. their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when movingfrom the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting therecent accretion history of these groups.

1205.1064	the cosmos density field: a reconstruction using both weak lensing and  galaxy distributions	the cosmos field has been the subject of a wide range of observations, with anumber of studies focusing on reconstructing the 3d dark matter density field.typically, these studies have focused on one given method or tracer. in thispaper, we reconstruct the distribution of mass in the cosmos field out to aredshift z=1 by combining hubble space telescope weak lensing measurements withzcosmos spectroscopic measurements of galaxy clustering. the distribution ofgalaxies traces the distribution of mass with high resolution (particularly inredshift, which is not possible with lensing), and the lensing data empiricallycalibrates the mass normalisation (bypassing the need for theoretical models).two steps are needed to convert a galaxy survey into a density field. the firststep is to create a smooth field from the galaxy positions, which is a pointfield. we investigate four possible methods for this: (i) gaussian smoothing,(ii) convolution with truncated isothermal sphere, (iii) fifth nearestneighbour smoothing and (iv) a muliti-scale entropy method. the second step isto rescale this density field using a bias prescription. we calculate theoptimal bias scaling for each method by comparing predictions from the smootheddensity field with the measured weak lensing data, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.in general, we find scale-independent bias for all the smoothing schemes, to aprecision of 10%. for the nearest neighbour smoothing case, we find the bias tobe 2.51\pm 0.25. we also find evidence for a strongly evolving bias, increasingby a factor of ~3.5 between redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;0.8. we believe this strong evolutioncan be explained by the fact that we use a flux limited sample to build thedensity field.

1206.6496	the zurich environmental study of galaxies in groups along the cosmic  web. iii. galaxy photometric measurements and the spatially-resolved color  properties of early- and late-type satellites in diverse environments	we present photometric measurements for the galaxies - and when possibletheir bulges and disks - in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585 groups of the zurichenvironmental study (zens); these measurements include (b-i) colors, colorgradients and maps, color dispersions, as well as stellar masses andstar-formation rates. the zens galaxies are classified into quenched,moderately star-forming, and strongly star-forming using a combination ofspectral features and fuv-to-optical colors; this approach optimallydistinguishes quenched systems from dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. thelatter contribute up to 50% to the (b-i) "red sequence" at ~10^10msun. at fixedmorphological or spectral type, we find that galaxy stellar masses are largelyindependent of environment, and especially of halo mass. as a first utilizationof our photometric database, we study, at fixed stellar mass and hubble type,how (b-i) colors, color gradients and color dispersion of disk satellitesdepend on group mass (m_group), group-centric distance (r/r_200) andlarge-scale structure overdensity. the strongest environmental trend is foundfor disk-dominated satellites with m_group and r/r_200. at m&lt;10^10 msun,disk-dominated satellites are redder in the inner regions of the groups than inthe outer parts. at m&gt;10^10 msun, these satellites have shallower colorgradients in higher mass groups and in the cores of groups compared with lowermass groups and the outskirts of groups. stellar population analyses andsemi-analytic models suggest that disk-dominated satellites undergo quenchingof star formation in their outer disks, on timescales ~2 gyr, as theyprogressively move inside the group potential.

1207.0002	the zcosmos 20k group catalog	we present an optical group catalog between 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1 based on 16,500high-quality spectroscopic redshifts in the completed zcosmos-bright survey.the catalog published herein contains 1498 groups in total and 192 groups withmore than five observed members. the catalog includes both group properties andthe identification of the member galaxies. based on mock catalogs, thecompleteness and purity of groups with three and more members should be bothabout 83% with respect to all groups that should have been detectable withinthe survey, and more than 75% of the groups should exhibit a one-to-onecorrespondence to the "real" groups. particularly at high redshift, there areapparently more galaxies in groups in the cosmos field than expected from mockcatalogs. we detect clear evidence for the growth of cosmic structure over thelast seven billion years in the sense that the fraction of galaxies that arefound in groups (in volume-limited samples) increases significantly with cosmictime. in the second part of the paper, we develop a method for associatinggalaxies that only have photo-z to our spectroscopically identified groups. weshow that this leads to improved definition of group centers, improvedidentification of the most massive galaxies in the groups, and improvedidentification of central and satellite galaxies, where we define the former tobe galaxies at the minimum of the gravitational potential wells. subsamples ofcentrals and satellites in the groups can be defined with purities up to 80%,while a straight binary classification of all group and non-group galaxies intocentrals and satellites achieves purities of 85% and 75%, respectively, for thespectroscopic sample.

1207.0005	a group-galaxy cross-correlation function analysis in zcosmos	we present a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis using a group catalogproduced from the 16,500 spectra from the optical zcosmos galaxy survey. ouraim is to perform a consistency test in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8between the clustering strength of the groups and mass estimates that are basedon the richness of the groups. we measure the linear bias of the groups bymeans of a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis and convert it into massusing the bias-mass relation for a given cosmology, checking the systematicerrors using realistic group and galaxy mock catalogs. the measured bias forthe zcosmos groups increases with group richness as expected by the theory ofcosmic structure formation and yields masses that are reasonably consistentwith the masses estimated from the richness directly, considering the scatterthat is obtained from the 24 mock catalogs. an exception are the richest groupsat high redshift (estimated to be more massive than 10^13.5 m_sun), for whichthe measured bias is significantly larger than for any of the 24 mock catalogs(corresponding to a 3-sigma effect), which is attributed to the extremely largestructure that is present in the cosmos field at z ~ 0.7. our results are ingeneral agreement with previous studies that reported unusually strongclustering in the cosmos field.

1210.0334	the cosmic evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances in star-forming  galaxies over the past 10 gyrs	the chemical evolution of galaxies on a cosmological timescale is still amatter of debate despite the increasing number of available data provided byspectroscopic surveys of star-forming galaxies at different redshifts. thefundamental relations involving metallicity, such as the mass-metallicityrelation (mzr) or the fundamental-metallicity relation, give controversialresults about the reality of evolution of the chemical content of galaxies at agiven stellar mass. in this work we shed some light on this issue using thecompleteness reached by the 20k bright sample of the zcosmos survey and usingfor the first time the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (n/o) as a tracer of the gasphase chemical evolution of galaxies that is independent of the star formationrate. emission-line galaxies both in the sdss and 20k zcosmos bright surveywere used to study the evolution from the local universe of the $mzr up to aredshift of 1.32 and the relation between stellar mass and nitrogen-to-oxygenratio (mnor) up to a redshift of 0.42 using the n2s2 parameter. all thephysical properties derived from stellar continuum and gas emission-lines,including stellar mass, star formation rates, metallicity and n/o, werecalculated in a self-consistent way over the full redshift range. we confirmthe trend to find lower metallicities in galaxies of a given stellar mass in ayounger universe. this trend is even observed when taking possible selectioneffects into account that are due to the observed larger median star formationrates for galaxies at higher redshifts. we also find a significant evolution ofthe mnor up to z = 0.4. taking the slope of the o/h vs. n/o relation intoaccount for the secondary-nitrogen production regime, the observed evolution ofthe mnor is consistent with the trends found for both the mzr and itsequivalent relation using new expressions to reduce its dependence on sfr.

1210.2723	proto-groups at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3 in the zcosmos-deep sample	we identify 42 candidate groups lying between 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.0 from a sample of 3502galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the zcosmos-deep redshift surveywithin the same redshift interval. these systems contain three to fivespectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (inphysical space) and within 700km/s in velocity. based on extensive analysis ofmock catalogues that have been generated from the millennium simulation, weexamine the likely nature of these systems at the time of observation, and whatthey will evolve into down to the present epoch. although few of the "member"galaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, andalmost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the samehalo by the present epoch. most of the candidate groups can therefore bedescribed as "proto-groups". an estimate of the overdensities is alsoconsistent with the idea that these systems are being seen at the start of theassembly process. we also examine present-day haloes and ask whether theirprogenitors would have been seen amongst our candidate groups. for present-dayhaloes between 10^14-10^15msun/h, 35% should have appeared amongst ourcandidate groups, and this would have risen to 70% if our survey had beenfully-sampled, so we can conclude that our sample can be taken asrepresentative of a large fraction of such systems. there is a clear excess ofmassive galaxies above 10^10msun around the locations of the candidate groupsin a large independent cosmos photo-z sample, but we see no evidence in thislatter data for any colour differentiation with respect to the field. this ishowever consistent with the idea that such differentiation arises in satellitegalaxies, as indicated at z&lt;1, if the candidate groups are indeed only startingto be assembled.

1211.5607	the colors of central and satellite galaxies in zcosmos out to z ~ 0.8  and implications for quenching	we examine the red fraction of central and satellite galaxies in the largezcosmos group catalog out to z ~ 0.8 correcting for both the incompleteness instellar mass and for the less than perfect purities of the central andsatellite samples. we show that, at all masses and at all redshifts, thefraction of satellite galaxies that have been quenched, i.e., are red, issystematically higher than that of centrals, as seen locally in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the satellite quenching efficiency, which is theprobability that a satellite is quenched because it is a satellite rather thana central, is, as locally, independent of stellar mass. furthermore, theaverage value is about 0.5, which is also very similar to that seen in thesdss. we also construct the mass functions of blue and red centrals andsatellites and show that these broadly follow the predictions of the peng etal. analysis of the sdss groups. together, these results indicate that theeffect of the group environment in quenching satellite galaxies was verysimilar when the universe was about a half its present age, as it is today.

1304.2776	investigating the relationship between agn activity and stellar mass in  zcosmos galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1 using emission line diagnostic diagrams	we investigate the link between agn activity, star-formation and stellar massof the host galaxy at 0&lt;z&lt;1, looking for spectroscopic traces of agn and agingof the host. this work provides an extension of the existing studies at z&lt;0.1and contributes to shed light on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshifts. weused the zcosmos 20k data to create a sample of galaxies at z&lt;1. we divided thesample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with animproved s/n. we exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate agnfrom star-forming galaxies. we found indication of a role for the total galaxystellar mass in leading galaxy classification. stacked spectra show agnsignatures above the log m_*/m_sun&gt;10.2 threshold. moreover, the stellarpopulations of agn hosts are found to be older with respect to star-forming andcomposites galaxies. this could be due to the the tendency of agn to reside inmassive hosts. the dependence of the agn classification on the stellar mass isin agreement with what has been already found in previous studies. it isconsistent with, together with the evidence of older stellar populationsinhabiting the agn-like galaxies, the downsizing scenario. in particular, ourevidence points to an evolutionary scenario where the agn-feedback is capableof quenching the star formation in the most massive galaxies. therefore, theagn-feedback is the best candidate for initiating the passive evolutionaryphase of galaxies.

1305.1308	spot the difference. impact of different selection criteria on observed  properties of passive galaxies in zcosmos 20-k sample	we present the analysis of photometric, spectroscopic, and morphologicalproperties for differently selected samples of passive galaxies up to z=1extracted from the zcosmos-20k spectroscopic survey. this analysis intends toexplore the dependence of galaxy properties on the selection criterion adopted,study the degree of contamination due to star-forming outliers, and provide acomparison between different commonly used selection criteria. we extractedfrom the zcosmos-20k catalog six different samples of passive galaxies, basedon morphology, optical colors, specific star-formation rate, a best fit to theobserved spectral energy distribution, and a criterion that combinesmorphological, spectroscopic, and photometric information. the morphologicalsample has the higher percentage of contamination in colors, specific starformation rate and presence of emission lines, while the red &amp; passive etgssample is the purest, with properties mostly compatible with no star formationactivity; however, it is also the less economic criterion in terms ofinformation used. the best performing among the other criteria are the red sedand the quiescent ones, providing a percentage of contamination only slightlyhigher than the red &amp; passive etgs criterion (on average of a factor of ~2) butwith absolute values of the properties of contaminants still compatible with ared, passively evolving population. we also provided two revised definitions ofearly type galaxies based on restframe color-color and color-mass criteria,that better reproduce the observed bimodalities. the analysis of the numberdensities shows evidences of mass-assembly downsizing, with galaxies at10.25&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.75 increasing their number by a factor ~2-4 from z=0.6 toz=0.2, by a factor ~2-3 from z=1 to z=0.2 at 10.75&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11, and by only~10-50% from z=1 to z=0.2 at 11&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5.

1305.6167	obscured agn at z~1 from the zcosmos-bright survey i. selection and  optical properties of a [ne v]-selected sample	a sample of 94 narrow line agn with 0.65&lt;z&lt;1.20 has been selected from the20k-bright zcosmos galaxy sample by detection of the high-ionization [nev]3426line. taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the cosmosfield, the properties of the [nev]-selected type-2 agn have been investigated,focusing on their host galaxies, x-ray emission, and optical line flux ratios.finally, the diagnostic developed by gilli et al. (2010), based on the x-ray to[nev] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavilyobscured agn. we found that [ne v]-selected narrow line agn have seyfert 2-likeoptical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-formingcomponent. the acs morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectraindicate a preference for our type-2 agn to be hosted in early-spirals withstellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)msun, on average higher than those ofthe galaxy parent sample. the fraction of galaxies hosting [nev]-selectedobscured agn increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at2x10^11 msun. a comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows thatthe detection of the [ne v] line is an effective method to select agn in theoptical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provideby itself a complete census of agn2. finally, the high fraction of[nev]-selected type-2 agn not detected in medium-deep chandra observations(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of compton-thick sources in our sample.the presence of a population of heavily obscured agn is corroborated by thex-ray to [nev] ratio; we estimated, by mean of x-ray stacking technique andsimulations, that the compton-thick fraction in our sample of type-2 agn is43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the xrb synthesismodels.

1307.4402	zcosmos 20k: satellite galaxies are the main drivers of environmental  effects in the galaxy population at least to z~0.7	we explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over0.1&lt;z&lt;0.7 using the final zcosmos-bright data set. using the red fraction ofgalaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction ofred galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity and with the stellarmass, consistent with previous works. as at lower redshift, the red fractionappears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of twoprocesses: mass and environmental quenching. the parameters describing theseappear to be essentially the same at z~0.7 as locally. we explore the relationbetween red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellitegalaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in thecentral-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samplesmatched in stellar mass. there is little evidence for a dependence of the redfraction of centrals on overdensity. satellites are consistently redder at alloverdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency increases withoverdensity at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.4. this is less marked at higher redshift, but both arenevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. at a givenstellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites also increases withthe overdensity. at a given overdensity and mass, the obtained relation betweenthe environmental quenching and the satellite fraction agrees well with thesatellite quenching efficiency, demonstrating that the environmental quenchingin the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced throughthe satellite quenching process at least up to z=0.7. however, despite theunprecedented size of our high redshift samples, the associated statisticaluncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood asapproximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.

1307.6553	the dependence of galactic outflows on the properties and orientation of  zcosmos galaxies at z ~ 1	we present an analysis of cool outflowing gas around galaxies, traced by mgiiabsorption lines in the co-added spectra of a sample of 486 zcosmos galaxies at1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. these galaxies span a range of stellar masses (9.45&lt;log[m*/msun]&lt;10.7) and star formation rates (0.14 &lt; log [sfr/msun/yr] &lt; 2.35).we identify the cool outflowing component in the mgii absorption and find thatthe equivalent width of the outflowing component increases with stellar mass.the outflow equivalent width also increases steadily with the increasing starformation rate of the galaxies. at similar stellar masses the blue galaxiesexhibit a significantly higher outflow equivalent width as compared to redgalaxies. the outflow equivalent width shows strong effect with star formationsurface density ({\sigma}sfr) of the sample. for the disk galaxies, the outflowequivalent width is higher for the face-on systems as compared to the edge-onones, indicating that for the disk galaxies, the outflowing gas is primarilybipolar in geometry. galaxies typically exhibit outflow velocities ranging from-200 km/s to -300 km/s and on average the face-on galaxies exhibit higheroutflow velocity as compared to the edge-on ones. galaxies with irregularmorphologies exhibit outflow equivalent width as well as outflow velocitiescomparable to face on disk galaxies. these galaxies exhibit minimum massoutflow rates &gt; 5-7 msun/yr and a mass loading factor ({\eta} = dmout/dt /sfr)comparable to the star formation rates of the galaxies.

1310.3838	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching	as part of the sins/zc-sinf surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of h-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. from these data we infer theradial distribution of the toomre q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (sfgs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). in more than half of our sfgs, the h-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. at the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. the resulting q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the sfgs. the occurrence of h-alpha rings and of large nuclearq-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive sfgs.while our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

1311.2596	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for powerful  agn-driven nuclear outflows in massive star-forming galaxies	we report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (&gt;10^11 msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which are plausibly driven by anactive galactic nucleus (agn). the sample consists of the eight most massivesfgs from our sins/zc-sinf survey of galaxy kinematics with the imagingspectrometer sinfoni, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptiveoptics (ao) assisted observations. all of the objects are disks hosting asignificant stellar bulge. the spectra in their central regions exhibit a broadcomponent in halpha and forbidden [nii] and [sii] line emission, with typicalvelocity fwhm ~ 1500 km/s, [nii]/halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2- 3 kpc. these properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflowsassociated with type 2 agn, the presence of which is confirmed via independentdiagnostics in half the galaxies. the data imply a median ionized gas massoutflow rate of ~ 60 msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. at larger radii, a weakerbroad component is detected but with lower fwhm ~ 485 km/s and [nii]/halpha ~0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in thelower-mass sins/zc-sinf galaxies. the high inferred mass outflow rates andfrequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out ofthe centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute tothe process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. larger samples athigh masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of thenuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to agn activity and bulgegrowth.

1403.2968	many-body green's function theory for electron-phonon interactions:  ground state properties of the holstein dimer	we study ground-state properties of a two-site, two-electron holstein modeldescribing two molecules coupled indirectly via electron-phonon interaction byusing both exact diagonalization and self-consistent diagrammatic many-bodyperturbation theory. the hartree and self-consistent born approximations usedin the present work are studied at different levels of self-consistency. thegoverning equations are shown to exhibit multiple solutions when theelectron-phonon interaction is sufficiently strong whereas at smallerinteractions only a single solution is found. the additional solutions atlarger electron-phonon couplings correspond to symmetry-broken states withinhomogeneous electron densities. a comparison to exact results indicates thatthis symmetry breaking is strongly correlated with the formation of a bipolaronstate in which the two electrons prefer to reside on the same molecule. theresults further show that the hartree and partially self-consistent bornsolutions obtained by enforcing symmetry do not compare well with exactenergetics, while the fully self-consistent born approximation improves thequalitative and quantitative agreement with exact results in the same symmetriccase. this together with a presented natural occupation number analysissupports the conclusion that the fully self-consistent approximation describespartially the bipolaron crossover. these results contribute to betterunderstanding how these approximations cope with the strong localizing effectof the electron-phonon interaction.

1406.6069	the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations at z&gt;2 using  vlt and subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of zcosmos galaxies	in the local universe, there is good evidence that, at a given stellar massm, the gas-phase metallicity z is anti-correlated with the star formation rate(sfr) of the galaxies. it has also been claimed that the resulting z(m,sfr)relation is invariant with redshift - the so-called fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr). given a number of difficulties in determining metallicities,especially at higher redshifts, the form of the z(m,sfr) relation and whetherit is really independent of redshift is still very controversial. to explorethis issue at z&gt;2, we used vlt-sinfoni and subaru-moircs near-infraredspectroscopy of 20 zcosmos-deep galaxies at 2.1&lt;z&lt;2.5 to measure the strengthsof up to five emission lines: [oii], hbeta, [oiii], halpha, and [nii]. thisnear-infrared spectroscopy enables us to derive o/h metallicities, and alsosfrs from extinction corrected halpha measurements. we find that themass-metallicity relation (mzr) of these star-forming galaxies at z~2.3 islower than the local sdss mzr by a factor of three to five, a larger changethan found by erb et al. (2006) using [nii]/halpha-based metallicities fromstacked spectra. we discuss how the different selections of the samples andmetallicity calibrations used may be responsible for this discrepancy. thegalaxies show direct evidence that the sfr is still a second parameter in themass-metallicity relation at these redshifts. however, determining whether thez(m,sfr) relation is invariant with epoch depends on the choice ofextrapolation used from local samples, because z&gt;2 galaxies of a given masshave much higher sfrs than the local sdss galaxies. we find that the zcosmosgalaxies are consistent with a non-evolving fmr if we use thephysically-motivated formulation of the z(m,sfr) relation from lilly et al.(2003), but not if we use the empirical formulation of mannucci et al.

1409.4764	allsmog: an apex low-redshift legacy survey for molecular gas. i -  molecular gas scaling relations, and the effect of the co/h2 conversion  factor	we present allsmog, the apex low-redshift legacy survey for molecular gas.allsmog is a survey designed to observe the co(2-1) emission line with the apextelescope, in a sample of local galaxies (0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.03), with stellar massesin the range 8.5 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 10. this paper is a data release and initialanalysis of the first two semesters of observations, consisting of 42 galaxiesobserved in co(2-1). by combining these new co(2-1) emission line data witharchival hi data and sdss optical spectroscopy, we compile a sample of low-massgalaxies with well defined molecular gas masses, atomic gas masses, andgas-phase metallicities. we explore scaling relations of gas fraction and gasconsumption timescale, and test the extent to which our findings are dependenton a varying co/h2 conversion factor. we find an increase in the h2/hi massratio with stellar mass which closely matches semi-analytic predictions. wefind a mean molecular gas fraction for allsmog galaxies of mh2/m* = (0.09 -0.13), which decreases with stellar mass. we measure a mean molecular gasconsumption timescale for allsmog galaxies of 0.4 - 0.7 gyr. we also confirmthe non-universality of the molecular gas consumption timescale, which varies(with stellar mass) from ~100 myr to ~2 gyr. importantly, we find that thetrends in the h2/hi mass ratio, gas fraction, and the non-universal moleculargas consumption timescale are all robust to a range of recentmetallicity-dependent co/h2 conversion factors.

1507.01004	molecular gas as the driver of fundamental galactic relations	there has been much recent work dedicated to exploring secondary correlationsin the mass-metallicity relation, with significant dependence on both the starformation rate and hi content being demonstrated. previously, a paucity ofmolecular gas data (combined with sample selection bias) hampered theinvestigation of any such relation with molecular gas content. in this work, weassemble a sample of 221 galaxies from a variety of surveys in the redshiftrange 0 &lt; z &lt; 2, to explore the connection between molecular gas content andmetallicity. we explore the effect of gas mass on the mass-metallicityrelation, finding that the offset from the relation is negatively correlatedagainst both molecular and total gas mass. we then employ a principle componentanalysis technique to explore secondary dependences in the mass-metallicityrelation, finding that the secondary dependence with gas mass is significantlystronger than with star formation rate, and as such the underlying `fundamentalmetallicity relation' is between stellar mass, metallicity, and gas mass. inparticular, the metallicity dependence on sfr is simply a byproduct of thedependence on the molecular gas content, via the schmidt-kennicutt relation.finally, we note that our principle component analysis finds essentially noconnection between gas-phase metallicity and the efficiency of star formation.

1507.04726	many-body green's function theory for electron-phonon interactions: the  kadanoff-baym approach to spectral properties of the holstein dimer	we present a kadanoff-baym formalism to study time-dependent phenomena forsystems of interacting electrons and phonons in the framework of many-bodyperturbation theory. the formalism takes correctly into account effects of theinitial preparation of an equilibrium state, and allows for an explicittime-dependence of both the electronic and phononic degrees of freedom. themethod is applied to investigate the charge neutral and non-neutral excitationspectra of a homogeneous, two-site, two-electron holstein model. this is anextension of a previous study of the ground state properties in the hartree(h), partially self-consistent born (gd) and fully self-consistent born (gd)approximations published in ref. [arxiv:1403.2968]. we show that choosing ahomogeneous ground state solution leads to unstable dynamics for a sufficientlystrong interaction, and that allowing a symmetry-broken state prevents this.the instability is caused by the bifurcation of the ground state and understoodphysically to be connected with the bipolaronic crossover of the exact system.this mean-field instability persists in the partially self-consistent bornapproximation but is not found for the fully self-consistent bornapproximation. by understanding the stability properties, we are able to studythe linear response regime by calculating the density-density response functionby time-propagation. this functions amounts to a solution of the bethe-salpeterequation with a sophisticated kernel. the results indicate that none of theapproximations is able to describe the response function during or beyond thebipolaronic crossover for the parameters investigated. overall, we provide anextensive discussion on when the approximations are valid, and how they fail todescribe the studied exact properties of the chosen model system.

0808.3407	the close environment of 24 micron galaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 in the cosmos  field	we investigate the close environment of 203 spitzer 24 micron-selectedsources at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0 using zcosmos-bright redshifts and spectra of i&lt;22.5 abmag galaxies, over 1.5 sq. deg. of the cosmos field. we quantify the degree ofpassivity of the lirg and ulirg environments by analysing the fraction of closeneighbours with dn(4000)&gt;1.4. we find that lirgs at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8 live in morepassive environments than those of other optical galaxies that have the samestellar mass distribution. instead, ulirgs inhabit more active regions (e.g.lirgs and ulirgs at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.8 have, respectively, (42.0 +/- 4.9)% and (24.5 +/-5.9)% of neighbours with dn (4000)&gt;1.4 within 1 mpc and +/- 500 km/s). thecontrast between the activities of the close environments of lirgs and ulirgsappears especially enhanced in the cosmos field density peak at z~0.67, becauselirgs on this peak have a larger fraction of passive neighbours, while ulirgshave as active close environments as those outside the large-scale structure.the differential environmental activity is related to the differences in thedistributions of stellar mass ratios between lirgs/ulirgs and their closeneighbours, as well as in the general local density fields. at 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.0,instead, we find no differences in the environment densities of ulirgs andother similarly massive galaxies, in spite of the differential activities. wediscuss a possible scenario to explain these findings.

0809.2101	cosmos photometric redshifts with 30-bands for 2-deg2	we present accurate photometric redshifts in the 2-deg2 cosmos field. theredshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrow bands coveringthe uv (galex), visible-nir (subaru, cfht, ukirt and noao) and mid-ir(spitzer/irac). a chi2 template-fitting method (le phare) was used andcalibrated with large spectroscopic samples from vlt-vimos and keck-deimos. wedevelop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions fromemission lines (oii, hbeta, halpha and ly) to the spectral energy distributions(seds). the treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by afactor of 2.5. comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopicredshifts (i.e. delta z = zs - zp) indicates a dispersion of sigma_{deltaz/(1+zs)}=0.007 at i&lt;22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlierphoto-z in the cosmos, cfhtls and combo-17 survey fields. at fainter magnitudesi&lt;24 and z&lt;1.25, the accuracy is sigma_{delta z/(1+zs)}=0.012. the deep nir andirac coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z~2 albeit with a loweraccuracy (sigma_{delta z/(1+zs)}=0.06 at i~24). the redshift distribution oflarge magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found torange from z=0.66 at 22&lt;i&lt;22.5 to z=1.06 at 24.5&lt;i&lt;25. at i&lt;26.0, themulti-wavelength cosmos catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects. thecosmos-30 photo-z enable the full exploitation of this survey for studies ofgalaxy and large scale structure evolution at high redshift.

0810.2245	the zcosmos redshift survey: the three-dimensional classification cube  and bimodality in galaxy physical properties	aims. we investigate the relationships between three main optical galaxyobservables (spectral properties, colours, and morphology), exploiting the dataset provided by the cosmos/zcosmos survey. the purpose of this paper is todefine a simple galaxy classification cube, using a carefully selected sampleof around 1000 galaxies. methods. using medium resolution spectra of the first1k zcosmos-bright sample, optical photometry from the subaru/cosmosobservations, and morphological measurements derived from acs imaging, weanalyze the properties of the galaxy population out to z~1. applying threestraightforward classification schemes (spectral, photometric, andmorphological), we identify two main galaxy types, which appear to be linked tothe bimodality of galaxy population. the three parametric classificationsconstitute the axes of a "classification cube". results. a very good agreementexists between the classification from spectral data (quiescent/star-forminggalaxies) and that based on colours (red/blue galaxies). the third parameter(morphology) is less well correlated with the first two: in fact a goodcorrelation between the spectral classification and that based on morphologicalanalysis (early-/late-type galaxies) is achieved only after partiallycomplementing the morphological classification with additional colourinformation. finally, analyzing the 3d-distribution of all galaxies in thesample, we find that about 85% of the galaxies show a fully concordantclassification, being either quiescent, red, bulge-dominated galaxies (~20%) orstar-forming, blue, disk-dominated galaxies (~65%). these results imply thatthe galaxy bimodality is a consistent behaviour both in morphology, colour anddominant stellar population, at least out to z~1.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0810.4769	the spatial clustering of x-ray selected agn in the xmm-cosmos field	we study the spatial clustering of 538 x-ray selected agn in the 2 deg^2xmm-cosmos field that are spectroscopically identified to i_{ab}&lt;23 and spanthe redshift range z=0.2-3.0. the median redshift and luminosity of the sampleare z = 0.98 and l_{0.5-10}=6.3 x 10^{43} erg/s, respectively. a strongclustering signal is detected at ~18sigma level, which is the most significantmeasurement obtained to date for clustering of x-ray selected agn. by fittingthe projected correlation function w(r_p) with a power law on scales ofr_p=0.3-40 mpc/h, we derive a best fit comoving correlation length of r_0 = 8.6+- 0.5 mpc/h and slope of gamma=1.88 +- 0.07 (poissonian errors; bootstraperrors are about a factor of 2 larger). an excess signal is observed in therange r_p~5-15 mpc/h, which is due to a large scale structure at z ~ 0.36containing about 40 agn. when removing the z ~ 0.36 structure, or computingw(r_p) in a narrower range around the peak of the redshift distribution (e.g.z=0.4-1.6), the correlation length decreases to r_0 ~ 5-6 mpc/h, which isconsistent with that observed for bright optical qsos at the same redshift.  we investigate the clustering properties of obscured and unobscured agnseparately. within the statistical uncertainties, we do not find evidence thatagn with broad optical lines (blagn) cluster differently from agn without broadoptical lines (non-blagn).  the correlation length measured for xmm-cosmos agn at z~1 is similar to thatof massive galaxies (stellar mass m_*&gt; 3 x 10^{10} m_sun) at the same redshift.this suggests that agn at z~1 are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies, asobserved both in the local and in the distant (z~2) universe.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
