1301.7307	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) mission	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) mission, launched on 13june 2012, is the first focusing high-energy x-ray telescope in orbit. nustaroperates in the band from 3 -- 79 kev, extending the sensitivity of focusingfar beyond the ~10 kev high-energy cutoff achieved by all previous x-raysatellites. the inherently low-background associated with concentrating thex-ray light enables nustar to probe the hard x-ray sky with a more thanone-hundred-fold improvement in sensitivity over the collimated or coded-maskinstruments that have operated in this bandpass. using its unprecedentedcombination of sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution, nustar will pursuefive primary scientific objectives, and will also undertake a broad program oftargeted observations. the observatory consists of two co-alignedgrazing-incidence x-ray telescopes pointed at celestial targets by a three-axisstabilized spacecraft. deployed into a 600 km, near-circular, 6degreeinclination orbit, the observatory has now completed commissioning, and isperforming consistent with pre-launch expectations. nustar is now executing itsprimary science mission, and with an expected orbit lifetime of ten years, weanticipate proposing a guest investigator program, to begin in fall 2014.

1305.1945	nustar discovery of a 3.76-second transient magnetar near sagittarius a*	we report the discovery of 3.76-s pulsations from a new burst source near sgra* observed by the nustar observatory. the strong signal from sgr j1745-29presents a complex pulse profile modulated with pulsed fraction 27+/-3 % in the3-10 kev band. two observations spaced 9 days apart yield a spin-down rate ofpdot = (6.5+/-1.4)x10^{-12}. this implies a magnetic field b = 1.6x10^14 g,spin-down power edot = 5x10^33 erg/s, and characteristic age p/2pdot = 9x10^3yr, for the rotating dipole model. however, the current pdot may be erratic,especially during outburst. the flux and modulation remained steady during theobservations and the 3-79 kev spectrum is well fitted by a combined blackbodyplus power-law model with temperature kt_bb = 0.96+/-0.02 kev and photon index= 1.5+/-0.4, respectively. the neutral hydrogen column density (nh ~ 1.4x10^23cm^{-2}) measured by nustar and swift suggests that sgr j1745-29 is located ator near the galactic center. the lack of an x-ray counterpart in the publishedchandra survey catalog sets a quiescent 2-8 kev luminosity limit of lx ~&lt; 10^32erg/s. the bursting, timing, and spectral properties indicate a transientmagnetar undergoing an outburst with 2-79 kev luminosity up to 3.5x10^35 erg/sfor a distance of 8 kpc. sgr j1745-29 joins a growing subclass of transientmagnetars, indicating that many magnetars in quiescence remain undetected inthe x-ray band or have been detected as high-b radio pulsars. the peculiarlocation of sgr j1745-29 has important implications for the formation anddynamics of neutron stars in the galactic center region.

1307.6967	nustar detection of hard x-ray phase lags from the accreting pulsar gs  0834-430	the nustar hard x-ray telescope observed the transient be/x-ray binary gs0834-430 during its 2012 outburst - the first active state of this systemobserved in the past 19 years. we performed timing and spectral analysis, andmeasured the x-ray spectrum between 3-79kev with high statistical significance.we find the phase-averaged spectrum to be consistent with that observed in manyother magnetized accreting pulsars. we fail to detect cyclotron resonancescattering features that would allow us to constrain the pulsar's magneticfield in either phase-averaged or phase-resolved spectra. timing analysis showsa clearly detected pulse period of ~12.29s in all energy bands. the pulseprofiles show a strong, energy-dependent hard phase lag of up to 0.3 cycles inphase, or about 4s. such dramatic energy-dependent lags in the pulse profilehave never before been reported in high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb) pulsars.previously reported lags have been significantly smaller in phase andrestricted to low-energies (e&lt;10kev). we investigate the possible mechanismsthat might produce this energy-dependent pulse phase shift. we find the mostlikely explanation for this effect to be a complex beam geometry.

1309.5361	the smooth cyclotron line in her x-1 as seen with nustar	her x-1, one of the brightest and best studied x-ray binaries, shows acyclotron resonant scattering feature (crsf) near 37 kev. this makes it anideal target for detailed study with the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array(nustar), taking advantage of its excellent hard x-ray spectral resolution. weobserved her x-1 three times, coordinated with suzaku, during one of the highflux intervals of its 35d super-orbital period. this paper focuses on the shapeand evolution of the hard x-ray spectrum. the broad-band spectra can be fittedwith a powerlaw with a high-energy cutoff, an iron line, and a crsf. we findthat the crsf has a very smooth and symmetric shape, in all observations and atall pulse-phases. we compare the residuals of a line with a gaussian opticaldepth profile to a lorentzian optical depth profile and find no significantdifferences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. eventhough the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that itssmooth shape does not. additionally, our data show that the continuum is onlychanging marginally between the three observations. these changes can beexplained with varying amounts of thomson scattering in the hot corona of theaccretion disk. the average, luminosity-corrected crsf energy is lower than inpast observations and follows a secular decline. the excellent data quality ofnustar provides the best constraint on the crsf energy to date.

1310.0745	the ultraluminous x-ray sources ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2: a broadband study  with nustar and xmm-newton	we present the results of nustar and xmm-newton observations of the twoultraluminous x-ray sources (ulx) ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2. the combined spectralbandpass of the two satellites enables us to produce the first spectrum of x-1between 0.3 and 30 kev, while x-2 is not significantly detected by nustar above10 kev. the nustar data demonstrate that x-1 has a clear cutoff above 10 kev,whose presence was only marginally detectable with previous x-ray observations.this cutoff rules out the interpretation of x-1 as a black hole in a standardlow/hard state, and it is deeper than predicted for the downturn of a broadenediron line in a reflection-dominated regime. the cutoff differs from theprediction of a single-temperature comptonization model. further, a colddisk-like black body component at ~0.3 kev is required by the data, confirmingprevious measurements by xmm-newton only. we observe a spectral transition inx-2, from a state with high luminosity and strong variability to alower-luminosity state with no detectable variability, and we link thisbehavior to a transition from a super-eddington to a sub-eddington regime.

1310.3830	the reflection component from cygnus x-1 in the soft state measured by  nustar and suzaku	the black hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed in late-2012 with the nuclearspectroscopic telescope array (nustar) and suzaku, providing spectral coverageover the ~1-300 kev range. the source was in the soft state with amulti-temperature blackbody, power-law, and reflection components along withabsorption from highly ionized material in the system. the high throughput ofnustar allows for a very high quality measurement of the complex iron lineregion as well as the rest of the reflection component. the iron line isclearly broadened and is well-described by a relativistic blurring model,providing an opportunity to constrain the black hole spin. although the spinconstraint depends somewhat on which continuum model is used, we obtain a*&gt;0.83for all models that provide a good description of the spectrum. however, noneof our spectral fits give a disk inclination that is consistent with the mostrecently reported binary values for cyg x-1. this may indicate that there is a&gt;13 degree misalignment between the orbital plane and the inner accretion disk(i.e., a warped accretion disk) or that there is missing physics in thespectral models.

1310.6221	nustar observations of magnetar 1e 1841-045	we report new spectral and temporal observations of the magnetar 1e 1841-045in the kes 73 supernova remnant obtained with the nuclear spectroscopictelescope array (nustar). combined with new swift and archival xmm-newton andchandra observations, the phase-averaged spectrum is well characterized by ablackbody plus double power-law model, in agreement with previous,multi-mission x-ray results. however, we are unable to reproduce the spectralresults reported using suzaku observations. the pulsed fraction of the sourceis found to increase with photon energy. the measured rms pulsed fraction is~12% and ~17% at ~20 kev and ~50 kev, respectively. we detect a new feature inthe 24--35 kev band pulse profile that is uniquely double-peaked. this featuremay be associated with a possible absorption or emission feature in thephase-resolved spectrum. we fit the x-ray data using the recently developedelectron-positron outflow model of beloborodov (2013) for the hard x-rayemission from magnetars. this produces a satisfactory fit allowing a constrainton the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the neutron star of ~20degrees and on the angle between the rotation axis and line-of-sight of ~50degrees. in this model, the soft x-ray component is inconsistent with a singleblackbody; adding a second blackbody or a power-law component fits the data.the two-blackbody interpretation suggests a hot spot of temperature kt~0.9 kevoccupying ~1% of the stellar surface.

1311.5514	nustar discovery of a luminosity dependent cyclotron line energy in vela  x-1	we present nustar observations of vela x-1, a persistent, yet highlyvariable, neutron star high-mass x-ray binary (hmxb). two observations weretaken at similar orbital phases but separated by nearly a year. they show verydifferent 3-79 kev flux levels as well as strong variability during eachobservation, covering almost one order of magnitude in flux. these observationsallow, for the first time ever, investigations on kilo-second time-scales ofhow the centroid energies of cyclotron resonant scattering features (crsfs)depend on flux for a persistent hmxb. we find that the line energy of theharmonic crsf is correlated with flux, as expected in the sub-criticalaccretion regime. we argue that vela x-1 has a very narrow accretion columnwith a radius of around 0.4 km that sustains a coulomb interaction dominatedshock at the observed luminosities of lx ~ 3x10^36 erg/s. besides the prominentharmonic line at 55 kev the fundamental line around 25 kev is clearly detected.we find that the strengths of the two crsfs are anti-correlated, which weexplain by photon spawning. this anti-correlation is a possible explanation forthe debate about the existence of the fundamental line. the ratio of the lineenergies is variable with time and deviates significantly from 2.0, also apossible consequence of photon spawning, which changes the shape of the line.during the second observation, vela x-1 showed a short off-state in which thepower-law softened and a cut-off was no longer measurable. it is likely thatthe source switched to a different accretion regime at these low mass accretionrates, explaining the drastic change in spectral shape.

1312.2635	first hard x-ray detection of the non-thermal emission around the arches  cluster: morphology and spectral studies with nustar	the arches cluster is a young, densely packed massive star cluster in ourgalaxy that shows a high level of star formation activity. the nature of theextended non-thermal x-ray emission around the cluster remains unclear. theobserved bright fe k_alpha line emission at 6.4 kev from material that isneutral or in a low ionization state can be produced either by x-rayphotoionization or by cosmic-ray particle bombardment or both. in this paper wereport on the first detection of the extended emission around the archescluster above 10 kev with the nustar mission, and present results on itsmorphology and spectrum. the spatial distribution of the hard x-ray emission isfound to be consistent with the broad region around the cluster where the 6.4kev line is observed. the interpretation of the hard x-ray emission within thecontext of the x-ray reflection model puts a strong constraint on theluminosity of the possible illuminating hard x-ray source. the properties ofthe observed emission are also in broad agreement with the low-energycosmic-ray proton excitation scenario.

1401.3646	the disk wind in the rapidly spinning stellar-mass black hole 4u  1630-472 observed with nustar	we present an analysis of a short nustar observation of the stellar-massblack hole and low-mass x-ray binary 4u 1630$-$472. reflection from the inneraccretion disk is clearly detected for the first time in this source, owing tothe sensitivity of nustar. with fits to the reflection spectrum, we findevidence for a rapidly spinning black hole, $a_{*}=0.985^{+0.005}_{-0.014}$($1\sigma$ statistical errors). however, archival data show that the source hasrelatively low radio luminosity. recently claimed relationships between jetpower and black hole spin would predict either a lower spin or a higher peakradio luminosity. we also report the clear detection of an absorption featureat $7.03\pm0.03$ kev, likely signaling a disk wind. if this line arises indense, moderately ionized gas ($\log\xi=3.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) and is dominated byhe-like fe xxv, the wind has a velocity of $v/c=0.043^{+0.002}_{-0.007}$(12900$^{+600}_{-2100}$ km s$^{-1}$). if the line is instead associated with amore highly ionized gas ($\log\xi=6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$), and is dominated by fexxvi, evidence of a blue-shift is only marginal, after taking systematic errorsinto account. our analysis suggests the ionized wind may be launched within200$-$1100 rg, and may be magnetically driven.

1401.4637	the broadband xmm-newton and nustar x-ray spectra of two ultraluminous  x-ray sources in the galaxy ic 342	we present results for two ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs), ic 342 x-1 andic 342 x-2, using two epochs of xmm-newton and nustar observations separated by$\sim$7 days. we observe little spectral or flux variability above 1 kevbetween epochs, with unabsorbed 0.3--30 kev luminosities being$1.04^{+0.08}_{-0.06} \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for ic 342 x-1 and$7.40\pm0.20 \times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for ic 342 x-2, so that both wereobserved in a similar, luminous state. both sources have a high absorbingcolumn in excess of the galactic value. neither source has a spectrumconsistent with a black hole binary in low/hard state, and both ulxs exhibitstrong curvature in their broadband x-ray spectra. this curvature rules outmodels that invoke a simple reflection-dominated spectrum with a broadened ironline and no cutoff in the illuminating power-law continuum. x-ray spectrum ofic 342 x-1 can be characterized by a soft disk-like black body component at lowenergies and a cool, optically thick comptonization continuum at high energies,but unique physical interpretation of the spectral components remainschallenging. the broadband spectrum of ic 342 x-2 can be fit by either a hot(3.8 kev) accretion disk, or a comptonized continuum with no indication of aseed photon population. although the seed photon component may be masked bysoft excess emission unlikely to be associated with the binary system, combinedwith the high absorption column, it is more plausible that the broadband x-rayemission arises from a simple thin blackbody disk component. secureidentification of the origin of the spectral components in these sources willlikely require broadband spectral variability studies.

1402.1079	nustar results and future plans for magnetar and rotation-powered pulsar  observations	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) is the first focusing hardx-ray mission in orbit and operates in the 3-79 kev range. nustar's sensitivityis roughly two orders of magnitude better than previous missions in this energyband thanks to its superb angular resolution. since its launch in 2012 june,nustar has performed excellently and observed many interesting sourcesincluding four magnetars, two rotation-powered pulsars and the cataclysmicvariable ae aquarii. nustar also discovered 3.76-s pulsations from thetransient source sgr j1745-29 recently found by swift very close to thegalactic center, clearly identifying the source as a transient magnetar. formagnetar 1e 1841-045, we show that the spectrum is well fit by an absorbedblackbody plus broken power-law model with a hard power-law photon index of~1.3. this is consistent with previous results by integral and rxte. we alsofind an interesting double-peaked pulse profile in the 25-35 kev band. for aeaquarii, we show that the spectrum can be described by a multi-temperaturethermal model or a thermal plus non-thermal model; a multi-temperature thermalmodel without a non-thermal component cannot be ruled out. furthermore, we donot see a spiky pulse profile in the hard x-ray band, as previously reportedbased on suzaku observations. for other magnetars and rotation-powered pulsarsobserved with nustar, data analysis results will be soon available.

1403.0900	nustar detection of high-energy x-ray emission and rapid variability  from sagittarius a* flares	sagittarius a* harbors the supermassive black hole that lies at the dynamicalcenter of our galaxy. sagittarius a* spends most of its time in a lowluminosity emission state but flares frequently in the infrared and x-ray,increasing up to a few hundred fold in brightness for up to a few hours at atime. the physical processes giving rise to the x-ray flares are uncertain.here we report the detection with the nustar observatory in summer and fall2012 of four low to medium amplitude x-ray flares to energies up to 79 kev. forthe first time, we clearly see that the power-law spectrum of sagittarius a*x-ray flares extends to high energy, with no evidence for a cut off. althoughthe photon index of the absorbed power-law fits are in agreement with pastobservations, we find a difference between the photon index of two of theflares (significant at the 95% confidence level). the spectra of the twobrightest flares (~55 times quiescence in the 2-10 kev band) are compared tosimple physical models in an attempt to identify the main x-ray emissionmechanism, but the data do not allow us to significantly discriminate betweenthem. however, we confirm the previous finding that the parameters obtainedwith synchrotron models are, for the x-ray emission, physically more reasonablethan those obtained with inverse-compton models. one flare exhibits large andrapid (&lt; 100 s) variability, which, considering the total energy radiated,constrains the location of the flaring region to be within ~10 schwarzschildradii of the black hole.

1403.2722	nustar observations of the bullet cluster: constraints on inverse  compton emission	the search for diffuse non-thermal inverse compton (ic) emission from galaxyclusters at hard x-ray energies has been undertaken with many instruments, withmost detections being either of low significance or controversial. backgroundand contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusingobservatories result in lower sensitivity to ic emission and a greater chanceof false detection. we present 266ks nustar observations of the bullet cluster,detected from 3-30 kev. nustar's unprecedented hard x-ray focusing capabilitylargely eliminates confusion between diffuse ic and point sources; however, atthe highest energies the background still dominates and must be wellunderstood. to this end, we have developed a complete background modelconstructed of physically inspired components constrained by extragalacticsurvey field observations, the specific parameters of which are derived locallyfrom data in non-source regions of target observations. applying the backgroundmodel to the bullet cluster data, we find that the spectrum is well - but notperfectly - described as an isothermal plasma with kt=14.2+/-0.2 kev. toslightly improve the fit, a second temperature component is added, whichappears to account for lower temperature emission from the cool core, pushingthe primary component to kt~15.3 kev. we see no convincing need to invoke an iccomponent to describe the spectrum of the bullet cluster, and instead arguethat it is dominated at all energies by emission from purely thermal gas. theconservatively derived 90% upper limit on the ic flux of 1.1e-12 erg/s/cm^2(50-100 kev), implying a lower limit on b&gt;0.2{\mu}g, is barely consistent withdetected fluxes previously reported. in addition to discussing the possibleorigin of this discrepancy, we remark on the potential implications of thisanalysis for the prospects for detecting ic in galaxy clusters in the future.

1407.3974	the variable hard x-ray emission of ngc4945 as observed by nustar	we present a broadband (~0.5-79 kev) spectral and temporal analysis ofmultiple nustar observations combined with archival suzaku and chandra data ofngc4945, the brightest extragalactic source at 100 kev. we observe hard x-ray(&gt; 10 kev) flux and spectral variability, with flux variations of a factor 2 ontimescales of 20 ksec. a variable primary continuum dominates the high energyspectrum (&gt;10 kev) in all the states, while the reflected/scattered flux whichdominates at e&lt; 10 kev stays approximately constant. from modelling the complexreflection/transmission spectrum we derive a compton depth along the line ofsight of tau_thomson ~ 2.9, and a global covering factor for the circumnucleargas of ~ 0.15. this agrees with the constraints derived from the high energyvariability, which implies that most of the high energy flux is transmitted,rather that compton-scattered. this demonstrates the effectiveness of spectralanalysis in constraining the geometric properties of the circumnuclear gas, andvalidates similar methods used for analyzing the spectra of other bright,compton-thick agn. the lower limits on the e-folding energy are between 200-300kev, consistent with previous bepposax, suzaku and swift bat observations. theaccretion rate, estimated from the x-ray luminosity and assuming a bolometriccorrection typical of type 2 agn, is in the range ~0.1-0.3 lambda_edd dependingon the flux state. the substantial observed x-ray luminosity variability ofngc4945 implies that large errors can arise from using single-epoch x-ray datato derive l/l_edd values for obscured agns.

1408.0174	high-energy x-ray imaging of the pulsar wind nebula msh~15-52:  constraints on particle acceleration and transport	we present the first images of the pulsar wind nebula (pwn) msh 15-52 in thehard x-ray band (&gt;8 kev), as measured with the nuclear spectroscopic telescopearray (nustar). overall, the morphology of the pwn as measured by nustar in the3-7 kev band is similar to that seen in chandra high-resolution imaging.however, the spatial extent decreases with energy, which we attribute tosynchrotron energy losses as the particles move away from the shock. thehard-band maps show a relative deficit of counts in the northern region towardsthe rcw 89 thermal remnant, with significant asymmetry. we find that theintegrated pwn spectra measured with nustar and chandra suggest that there is aspectral break at 6 kev which may be explained by a break in thesynchrotron-emitting electron distribution at ~200 tev and/or imperfect crosscalibration. we also measure spatially resolved spectra, showing that thespectrum of the pwn softens away from the central pulsar b1509-58, and thatthere exists a roughly sinusoidal variation of spectral hardness in theazimuthal direction. we discuss the results using particle flow models. we findnon-monotonic structure in the variation with distance of spectral hardnesswithin 50" of the pulsar moving in the jet direction, which may imply particleand magnetic-field compression by magnetic hoop stress as previously suggestedfor this source. we also present 2-d maps of spectral parameters and find aninteresting shell-like structure in the nh map. we discuss possible origins ofthe shell-like structure and their implications.

1408.1644	a broadband x-ray study of the geminga pulsar with nustar and xmm-newton	we report on the first hard x-ray detection of the geminga pulsar above 10kev using a 150 ks observation with the nustar observatory. the double-peakedpulse profile of non-thermal emission seen in the soft x-ray band persists athigher energies. broadband phase-integrated spectra over the 0.2-20 kev bandwith nustar and archival xmm-newton data do not fit to a conventionaltwo-component model of a blackbody plus power-law, but instead exhibit spectralhardening above ~5 kev. we find two spectral models fit the data well: (1) ablackbody (kt1 ~ 42 ev) with a broken power-law (gamma1 ~ 2.0, gamma2 ~ 1.4 andebreak ~ 3.4 kev), and (2) two blackbody components (kt1 ~ 44 ev and kt2 ~ 195ev) with a power-law component (gamma ~ 1.7). in both cases, the extrapolationof the rayleigh-jeans tail of the thermal component is consistent with the uvdata, while the non-thermal component overpredicts the near-infrared data,requiring a spectral flattening at e ~ 0.01 - 1 kev. while strong phasevariation of the power-law index is present below ~5 kev, our phase-resolvedspectroscopy with nustar indicates that another hard non-thermal component withgamma ~ 1.3 emerges above ~5 kev. the spectral hardening in non-thermal x-rayemission as well as spectral flattening between the optical and x-ray bandsargue against the conjecture that a single power-law may account formulti-wavelength non-thermal spectra of middle-aged pulsars.

1409.3248	no time for dead time: timing analysis of bright black hole binaries  with nustar	timing of high-count rate sources with the nustar small explorer missionrequires specialized analysis techniques. nustar was primarily designed forspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates ratherthan for timing analysis of bright objects. the instrumental dead time perevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percentevent-to-event. the most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noiselevel in the power density spectrum (pds) that cannot be modeled easily withthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. in thispaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completelyindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain agood proxy of the white noise-subtracted pds. thereafter, one can use a montecarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely afrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent dropof the sensitivity to variability. in this way, most of the standard timinganalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relativeto what would be achieved using more standard techniques. we apply thistechnique to nustar observations of the black hole binaries gx 339-4, cyg x-1and grs 1915+105.

1411.0670	nustar spectroscopy of multi-component x-ray reflection from ngc 1068	we report on observations of ngc1068 with nustar, which provide the bestconstraints to date on its $&gt;10$~kev spectral shape. we find no strongvariability over the past two decades, consistent with its compton-thick agnclassification. the combined nustar, chandra, xmm-newton, and swift-batspectral dataset offers new insights into the complex reflected emission. thecritical combination of the high signal-to-noise nustar data and a spatialdecomposition with chandra allow us to break several model degeneracies andgreatly aid physical interpretation. when modeled as a monolithic (i.e., asingle n_h) reflector, none of the common compton-reflection models are able tomatch the neutral fluorescence lines and broad spectral shape of the comptonreflection. a multi-component reflector with three distinct column densities(e.g., n_h~1.5e23, 5e24, and 1e25 cm^{-2}) provides a more reasonable fit tothe spectral lines and compton hump, with near-solar fe abundances. in thismodel, the higher n_h components provide the bulk of the compton hump fluxwhile the lower n_h component produces much of the line emission, effectivelydecoupling two key features of compton reflection. we note that ~30% of theneutral fe kalpha line flux arises from &gt;2" (~140 pc), implying that asignificant fraction of the &lt;10 kev reflected component arises from regionswell outside of a parsec-scale torus. these results likely have ramificationsfor the interpretation of poorer signal-to-noise observations and/or moredistant objects [abridged].

1411.4745	nustar observation of a type i x-ray burst from grs 1741.9-2853	we report on two nustar observations of grs 1741.9-2853, a faint neutron starlow mass x-ray binary burster located 10' away from the galactic center. nustardetected the source serendipitously as it was emerging from quiescence: itsluminosity was $6\times 10^{34}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ on 2013 july 31, and $5\times10^{35}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ in a second observation on 2013 august 3. a bright, 800-slong, h-triggered mixed h/he thermonuclear type i burst with mild photosphericradius expansion (pre) was present during the second observation. assuming thatthe luminosity during the pre was at the eddington level, a h mass fraction$x=0.7$ in the atmosphere, and a neutron star mass $m=1.4 m_{\odot}$, wedetermine a new lower limit on the distance for this source of $6.3 \pm 0.5$kpc. combining with previous upper limits, this places grs 1741.9-2853 at adistance of 7 kpc. energy independent (achromatic) variability is observedduring the cooling of the neutron star, which could result from the disturbanceof the inner accretion disk by the burst. the large dynamic range of this burstreveals a long power-law decay tail. we also detect, at a 95.6\% confidencelevel (1.7 $\sigma$), a narrow absorption line at $5.46\pm0.10$ kev during thepre phase of the burst, reminiscent of the detection by waki et al. (1984). wepropose that the line, if real, is formed in the wind above the photosphere ofthe neutron star by a resonant k$\alpha$ transition from h-like crgravitationally redshifted by a factor $1+z=1.09$, corresponding to a radiusrange of 29.0 -- 41.4 km for a mass range of 1.4 -- 2.0 $m_{\odot}$.

1411.6752	the hard x-ray view of the young supernova remnant g1.9+0.3	nustar observed g1.9+0.3, the youngest known supernova remnant in the milkyway, for 350 ks and detected emission up to $\sim$30 kev. the remnant's x-raymorphology does not change significantly across the energy range from 3 to 20kev. a combined fit between nustar and chandra shows that the spectrum steepenswith energy. the spectral shape can be well fitted with synchrotron emissionfrom a power-law electron energy distribution with an exponential cutoff withno additional features. it can also be described by a purely phenomenologicalmodel such as a broken power-law or a power-law with an exponential cutoff,though these descriptions lack physical motivation. using a fixed radio flux at1 ghz of 1.17 jy for the synchrotron model, we get a column density of n$_{\rmh}$ = $(7.23\pm0.07) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a spectral index of$\alpha=0.633\pm0.003$, and a roll-off frequency of $\nu_{\rmrolloff}=(3.07\pm0.18) \times 10^{17}$ hz. this can be explained by particleacceleration, to a maximum energy set by the finite remnant age, in a magneticfield of about 10 $\mu$g, for which our roll-off implies a maximum energy ofabout 100 tev for both electrons and ions. much higher magnetic-field strengthswould produce an electron spectrum that was cut off by radiative losses, givinga much higher roll-off frequency that is independent of magnetic-fieldstrength. in this case, ions could be accelerated to much higher energies. asearch for $^{44}$ti emission in the 67.9 kev line results in an upper limit of$1.5 \times 10^{-5}$ $\,\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$assuming a line width of 4.0 kev (1 sigma).

1502.07765	broadband x-ray imaging and spectroscopy of the crab nebula and pulsar  with nustar	we present broadband (3 -- 78 kev) nustar x-ray imaging and spectroscopy ofthe crab nebula and pulsar. we show that while the phase-averaged and spatiallyintegrated nebula + pulsar spectrum is a power-law in this energy band,spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nebula finds a break at $\sim$9 kev inthe spectral photon index of the torus structure with a steepeningcharacterized by $\delta\gamma\sim0.25$. we also confirm a previously reportedsteepening in the pulsed spectrum, and quantify it with a broken power-law withbreak energy at $\sim$12 kev and $\delta\gamma\sim0.27$. we present spectralmaps of the inner 100\as\ of the remnant and measure the size of the nebula asa function of energy in seven bands. these results find that the rate ofshrinkage with energy of the torus size can be fitted by a power-law with anindex of $\gamma = 0.094\pm 0.018$, consistent with the predictions of kenneland coroniti (1984). the change in size is more rapid in the nw direction,coinciding with the counter-jet where we find the index to be a factor of twolarger. nustar observed the crab during the latter part of a $\gamma$-rayflare, but found no increase in flux in the 3 - 78 kev energy band.

1504.07238	a spatially resolved study of the synchrotron emission and titanium in  tycho's supernova remnant with nustar	we report results from deep observations (~750 ks) of tycho's supernovaremnant (snr) with nustar. using these data, we produce narrow-band images overseveral energy bands to identify the regions producing the hardest x-rays andto search for radioactive decay line emission from 44ti. we find that thehardest (&gt;10 kev) x-rays are concentrated in the southwest of tycho, whererecent chandra observations have revealed high emissivity "stripes" associatedwith particles accelerated to the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum. we do notfind evidence of 44ti, and we set limits on its presence and distributionwithin the snr. these limits correspond to a upper-limit 44ti mass of m44 &lt;2.4x10^-4 m_sun for a distance of 2.3 kpc. we perform spatially resolvedspectroscopic analysis of sixty-six regions across tycho. we map the best-fitrolloff frequency of the hard x-ray spectra, and we compare these results tomeasurements of the shock expansion and ambient density. we find that thehighest energy electrons are accelerated at the lowest densities and in thefastest shocks, with a steep dependence of the roll-off frequency with shockvelocity. such a dependence is predicted by models where the maximum energy ofaccelerated electrons is limited by the age of the snr rather than bysynchrotron losses, but this scenario requires far lower magnetic fieldstrengths than those derived from observations in tycho. one way to reconcilethese discrepant findings is through shock obliquity effects, and futureobservational work is necessary to explore the role of obliquity in theparticle acceleration process.

1507.08740	hard x-ray morphological and spectral studies of the galactic center  molecular cloud sgr b2: constraining past sgr a* flaring activity	galactic center (gc) molecular cloud sgr b2 is the best manifestation of anx-ray reflection nebula (xrn) reprocessing a past giant outburst from thesupermassive black hole sgr a*. alternatively, sgr b2 could be illuminated bylow-energy cosmic ray electrons (lecre) or protons (lecrp). in 2013, nustar forthe first time resolved sgr b2 hard x-ray emission on sub-arcminute scales. twoprominent features are detected above 10 kev - a newly emerging cloudg0.66-0.13 and the central 90" radius region containing two compact cores sgrb2(m) and sgr b2(n) surrounded by diffuse emission. it is inconclusive whetherthe remaining level of sgr b2 emission is still decreasing or has reached aconstant background level. a decreasing fe k$\alpha$ emission can be bestexplained by xrn while a constant background emission can be best explained bylecrp. in the xrn scenario, the 3-79 kev sgr b2 spectrum can well constrain thepast sgr a* outburst, resulting in an outburst spectrum with a peak luminosityof $l_{3-79\rm~kev} \sim 5\times10^{38} \rm~erg~s^{-1}$ derived from themaximum compton-scattered continuum and the fe k$\alpha$ emission consistently.the xrn scenario is preferred by the fast variability of g0.66-0.13, whichcould be a molecular clump located in the sgr b2 envelope reflecting the samesgr a* outburst. in the lecrp scenario, we derived the required cr ion power$dw/dt=(1-4)\times10^{39}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and the cr ionization rate$\zeta_{h}=(6-10)\times 10^{-15}\rm~h^{-1}~s^{-1}$. the sgr b2 background levelx-ray emission will be a powerful tool to constrain gc cr population.

1510.04453	a nustar survey of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present a nustar, chandra, and xmm--newton survey of nine of the nearestultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). the unprecedented sensitivity ofnustar at energies above 10 kev enables spectral modeling with far betterprecision than was previously possible. six of the nine sources observed weredetected sufficiently well by nustar to model in detail their broadband x-rayspectra, and recover the levels of obscuration and intrinsic x-rayluminosities. only one source (iras 13120--5453) has a spectrum consistent witha compton--thick agn, but we cannot rule out that a second source (arp 220)harbors an extremely highly obscured agn as well. variability in column density(reduction by a factor of a few compared to older observations) is seen in iras05189--2524 and mrk 273, altering the classification of these border-linesources from compton-thick to compton-thin. the ulirgs in our sample havesurprisingly low observed fluxes in high energy (&gt;10 kev) x-rays, especiallycompared to their bolometric luminosities. they have lower ratios of unabsorbed2--10 kev to bolometric luminosity, and unabsorbed 2--10 kev to mid-ir [o iv]line luminosity than do seyfert 1 galaxies. we identify iras 08572+3915 asanother candidate intrinsically x-ray weak source, similar to mrk 231. wespeculate that the x-ray weakness of iras 08572+3915 is related to its powerfuloutflow observed at other wavelengths.

1510.04631	nustar hard x-ray survey of the galactic center region i: hard x-ray  morphology and spectroscopy of the diffuse emission	we present the first sub-arcminute images of the galactic center above 10kev, obtained with nustar. nustar resolves the hard x-ray source igrj17456-2901 into non-thermal x-ray filaments, molecular clouds, point sourcesand a previously unknown central component of hard x-ray emission (chxe).nustar detects four non-thermal x-ray filaments, extending the detection oftheir power-law spectra with $\gamma\sim1.3$-$2.3$ up to ~50 kev. amorphological and spectral study of the filaments suggests that their originmay be heterogeneous, where previous studies suggested a common origin in youngpulsar wind nebulae (pwne). nustar detects non-thermal x-ray continuum emissionspatially correlated with the 6.4 kev fe k$\alpha$ fluorescence line emissionassociated with two sgr a molecular clouds: mc1 and the bridge. broad-bandx-ray spectral analysis with a monte-carlo based x-ray reflection modelself-consistently determined their intrinsic column density ($\sim10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), primary x-ray spectra (power-laws with $\gamma\sim2$) and set alower limit of the x-ray luminosity of sgr a* flare illuminating the sgr aclouds to $l_x \stackrel{&gt;}{\sim} 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. above ~20 kev, hardx-ray emission in the central 10 pc region around sgr a* consists of thecandidate pwn g359.95-0.04 and the chxe, possibly resulting from an unresolvedpopulation of massive cvs with white dwarf masses $m_{\rm wd} \sim 0.9m_{\odot}$. spectral energy distribution analysis suggests that g359.95-0.04 islikely the hard x-ray counterpart of the ultra-high gamma-ray source hessj1745-290, strongly favoring a leptonic origin of the gc tev emission.

astro-ph;0109214	atomic calculation for the atmospheres of strongly-magnetized neutron  stars	complete modeling of radiative transfer in neutron star atmospheres is inprogress, taking into account the anisotropy induced by magnetic fields,non-ideal effects and general relativity. as part of our modeling, we present anovel atomic calculation method producing an extensive atomic data setincluding energy values and oscillator strengths in the so-called landau regime($b &gt; 4.7\times10^9z^2$ g). conventional atmosphere models for b=0 are notapplicable to typical field strengths of cooling neutron stars ($b\sim10^{12}-10^{13}$ g), since an atom no longer keeps its spherical shape. theelemental composition and the configuration of the magnetic field in theatmosphere are presently unknown, so that atomic data must be produced forground and excited states of several ions as a function of magnetic field. toaccomplish this efficiently, we minimized the iterations in the hartreeequation and treated exchange terms and higher landau states by perturbationmethods. this method has the effect of reducing the computation timesignificantly. inclusion of higher landau states gives us much more accuratedata for inner orbitals unlike other methods based on the adiabaticapproximation. while existing atomic data in the landau regime are availableonly for low $z$ atoms, our method can be used in elements up to fe withsufficient accuracy to be of use for spectroscopic missions such as {\itchandra}, {\it xmm-newton} and next-generation x-ray telescopes.

astro-ph;0109463	a novel antimatter detector based on x-ray deexcitation of exotic atoms	we propose a novel antiparticle detector. the gaseous antiparticlespectrometer (gaps) effects particle identification through the characteristicx-rays emitted by antiparticles when they form exotic atoms in gases. gapsobtains particularly high grasp (effective area--solid angle product) at lowerparticle energies, where conventional schemes are most limited in theirutility. the concept is simple and lightweight, so it can be readily employedon balloon and space-based missions. an extremely powerful potentialapplication of gaps is a space-based search for the neutralino through thedetection of a neutralino annihilation by-product -- the antideuteron.paradoxically, this space-based search for the neutralino is capable ofachieving comparable sensitivity to as yet unrealized third generation,underground dark matter experiments. and gaps can obtain this performance in avery modest satellite experiment. gaps can also provide superior performance insearches for primary antiprotons produced via neutralino annihilation, blackhole evaporation and in probing subdominant contributions to the antiprotonflux at low energies. in a deep space mission gaps will obtain highersensitivity for a given weight and power than bgo calorimeters.

astro-ph;0207590	evidence for a mid-atomic-number atmosphere in the neutron star  1e1207.4-5209	recently sanwal et al. (2002) reported the first clear detection ofabsorption features in an isolated neutron star, 1e1207.4-5209. remarkablytheir spectral modeling demonstrates that the atmosphere cannot be hydrogen.they speculated that the neutron star atmosphere is indicative of ionizedhelium in an ultra-strong (~1.5x10^{14} g) magnetic field. we have applied ourrecently developed atomic model (mori &amp; hailey 2002) for strongly-magnetizedneutron star atmospheres to this problem. we find that this model, along withsome simp le atomic physics arguments, severely constrains the possiblecomposition of the atmosphere. in particular we find that the absorptionfeatures are naturally associated with he-like oxygen or neon in a magneticfield of ~10^{12} g, comparable to the magnetic field derived from the spinparameters of the neutron star. this interpretation is consistent with therelative line strengths and widths and is robust. our model predicts possiblesubstructure in the spectral features, which has now been reported byxmm-newton (mereghetti et al. 2002). however we show the mereghetti et al.claim that the atmosphere is iron or some comparable high-z element at ~10^{12} g is easily ruled out by the chandra and xmm-newton data.

astro-ph;0301161	detailed atmosphere modelling for the neutron star 1e1207.4-5209:  evidence of oxygen/neon atmosphere	we present a comprehensive investigation of the two broad absorption featuresobserved in the x-ray spectrum of the neutron star 1e1207.4-5209 based on arecent analysis of the 260 ksec xmm-newton data by mori et al. 2005. expandingon our earlier work (hailey &amp; mori 2002) we have examined all previouslyproposed atmospheric models for 1e1207.4-5209. using our atomic code, whichrapidly solves schrodinger's equation for arbitrary ion in strong magneticfield (mori &amp; hailey 2002), we have systematically constructed atmosphericmodels by calculating polarization-dependent lte opacities and addressed allthe physics relevant to strongly-magnetized plasmas. we have been able to ruleout virtually all atmospheric models because they either do not sustain anionization balance consistent with the claimed atmosphere composition orbecause they predict line strengths and line widths which are inconsistent withthe data. only oxygen or neon atmospheres at b~10^{12} g provideself-consistent atmospheric solutions of appropriate ionization balance andwith line widths, strengths and energies consistent with the observations. theobserved features are likely composed of several bound-bound transition linesfrom highly-ionized oxygen/neon and they are broadened primarily by motionalstark effects and magnetic field variation over the line-emitting region.further considerations of plausible mechanisms for the formation of a mid-zatmosphere likely rule out neon atmospheres, and have important implicationsfor the fallback mechanism in supernova ejecta. future high resolutionspectroscopy missions such as constellation-x will be able to resolve predictedsubstructure in the absorption features and will measure magnetic fieldstrength and gravitational redshift independently to better than 10% accuracy.

astro-ph;0401498	xmm-newton epic &amp; om observations of her x-1 over the 35 day beat period	we present the results of a series of xmm-newton epic and om observations ofher x-1, spread over a wide range of the 35 day precession period. we confirmthat the spin modulation of the neutron star is weak or absent in the low state- in marked contrast to the main or short-on states. during the states ofhigher intensity, we observe a substructure in the broad soft x-ray modulationbelow ~1kev, revealing the presence of separate peaks which reflect thestructure seen at higher energies. the strong fluorescence emission line at~6.4kev is detected in all observations (apart from one taken in the middle ofeclipse), with higher line energy, width and normalisation during the main-onstate. in addition, we report the detection of a second line near 7kev in 10 ofthe 15 observations taken during the low-intensity states of the system. thisfeature is rather weak and not significantly detected during the main-on state,when the strong continuum emission dominates the x-ray spectrum. spin resolvedspectroscopy just after the rise to the main-on state shows that the variationof the fe kalpha line at 6.4 kev is correlated with the soft x-ray emission.this confirms our past finding based on the xmm-newton observations madefurther into the main-on state, and indicates the common origin for the thermalcomponent and the fe kalpha line detected at these phases. we also find thatthe normalisation of the 6.4kev line during the low state is correlated withthe binary orbital phase, having a broad maximum centered near phi_(orbit) ~0.5. we discuss these observations in the context of previous observations,investigate the origin of the soft and hard x-rays and consider the emissionsite of the 6.4kev and 7kev emission lines.

astro-ph;0407369	detailed spectral analysis of the 260 ksec xmm-newton data of  1e1207.4-5209 and significance of a 2.1 kev absorption feature	we have reanalyzed the 260 ksec xmm-newton observation of 1e1207.4-5209.there are several significant improvements over previous work. firstly, a muchbroader range of physically plausible spectral models was used. secondly, wehave utilized a more rigorous statistical analysis. the standard f-distributionwas not employed, but rather the exact finite statistics f-distribution wasdetermined by monte-carlo simulations. this approach was motivated by therecent work of protassov et al. (2002) and freeman et al. (1999). theydemonstrated that the standard f-distribution is not even asymptoticallycorrect when applied to assess the signficance of additional absorptionfeatures in a spectrum. with our improved analysis we do not find a third andfourth spectral feature (bignami et al. (2003), de luca et al. (2004)) in1e1207.4-5209, but only the two broad absorption features previously reported(sanwal et al. (2002), hailey and mori (2002)). two additional statisticaltests, one line model dependent and the other line model independent confirmedour modified f-test analysis. for all physically plausible continuum modelswhere the weak residuals are strong enough to fit, the residuals occur at theinstrument au-m edge. as a sanity check we confirmed that the residuals areconsistent in strength and position with the instrument au-m residuals observedin 3c273.
