0905.2408	impact of scale dependent bias and nonlinear structure growth on the isw  effect: angular power spectra	we investigate the impact of nonlinear evolution of the gravitationalpotentials in the lcdm model on the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) contributionto the cmb temperature power spectrum, and on the cross-power spectrum of thecmb and a set of biased tracers of the mass. we use an ensemble of n-bodysimulations to directly follow the potentials and compare results toperturbation theory (pt). the predictions from pt match the results to highprecision for k&lt;0.2 h/mpc. we compute the nonlinear corrections to the angularpower spectrum and find them to be &lt;10% of linear theory for l&lt;100. thesecorrections are swamped by cosmic variance. on scales l&gt;100 the departures aremore significant, however the cmb signal is more than a factor 10^3 larger atthis scale. nonlinear isw effects therefore play no role in shaping the cmbpower spectrum for l&lt;1500. we analyze the cmb--density tracer cross-spectrumusing simulations and renormalized bias pt, and find good agreement. the usualassumption is that nonlinear evolution enhances the growth of structure andcounteracts linear isw on small scales, leading to a change in sign of thecmb-lss cross-spectrum at small scales. however, pt analysis suggests that thistrend reverses at late times when the logarithmic growth ratef(a)=dlnd/dlna&lt;0.5 or om_m(a)&lt;0.3. numerical results confirm these expectationsand we find no sign change in isw-lss cross-power for low redshifts.corrections due to nonlinearity and scale dependence of the bias are found tobe &lt;10% for l&lt;100, therefore below the s/n of the current and futuremeasurements. finally, we estimate the cmb--halo cross-correlation coefficientand show that it can be made to match that for cmb--dark matter to within 5%for thin redshift shells, mitigating the need to model bias evolution.

0911.4972	precision cluster mass determination from weak lensing	weak gravitational lensing has been used extensively in the past decade toconstrain the masses of galaxy clusters, and is the most promisingobservational technique for providing the mass calibration necessary forprecision cosmology with clusters. there are several challenges in estimatingcluster masses, particularly (a) the sensitivity to astrophysical effects andobservational systematics that modify the signal relative to the theoreticalexpectations, and (b) biases that can arise due to assumptions in the massestimation method, such as the assumed radial profile of the cluster. all ofthese challenges are more problematic in the inner regions of the cluster,suggesting that their influence would ideally be suppressed for the purpose ofmass estimation. however, at any given radius the differential surface densitymeasured by lensing is sensitive to all mass within that radius, and thecorrupted signal from the inner parts is spread out to all scales. we develop anew statistic that is ideal for estimation of cluster masses because itcompletely eliminates mass contributions below a chosen scale (which we suggestshould be about 20 per cent of the virial radius), and thus reduces sensitivityto systematic and astrophysical effects. we use simulated and analyticalprofiles to quantify systematic biases on the estimated masses for severalstandard methods of mass estimation, finding that these can lead to significantmass biases that range from ten to over fifty per cent. the mass uncertaintieswhen using our new statistic are reduced by up to a factor of ten relative tothe standard methods, while only moderately increasing the statistical errors.this new method of mass estimation will enable a higher level of precision infuture science work with weak lensing mass estimates for galaxy clusters.

0911.4973	an algorithm for the direct reconstruction of the dark matter  correlation function from weak lensing and galaxy clustering	the clustering of matter on cosmological scales is an essential probe forstudying the physical origin and composition of our universe. to date, most ofthe direct studies have focused on shear-shear weak lensing correlations, butit is also possible to extract the dark matter clustering by combininggalaxy-clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements. in this study wedevelop a method that can constrain the dark matter correlation function fromgalaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy-lensing measurements, by focusing on thecorrelation coefficient between the galaxy and matter overdensity fields. togenerate a mock galaxy catalogue for testing purposes, we use the halooccupation distribution approach applied to a large ensemble of n-bodysimulations to model pre-existing sdss luminous red galaxy sample observations.using this mock catalogue, we show that a direct comparison between the excesssurface mass density measured by lensing and its corresponding galaxyclustering quantity is not optimal. we develop a new statistic that suppressesthe small-scale contributions to these observations and show that this newstatistic leads to a cross-correlation coefficient that is within a few percentof unity down to 5 mpc/h. furthermore, the residual incoherence between thegalaxy and matter fields can be explained using a theoretical model forscale-dependent bias, giving us a final estimator that is unbiased to within1%. we also perform a comprehensive study of other physical effects that canaffect the analysis, such as redshift space distortions and differences inradial windows between galaxy clustering and weak lensing observations. weapply the method to a range of cosmological models and show the viability ofour new statistic to distinguish between cosmological models.

1003.2185	confirmation of general relativity on large scales from weak lensing and  galaxy velocities	although general relativity underlies modern cosmology, its applicability oncosmological length scales has yet to be stringently tested. such a test hasrecently been proposed, using a quantity, eg, that combines measures oflarge-scale gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering and structure growth rate.the combination is insensitive to 'galaxy bias' (the difference between theclustering of visible galaxies and invisible dark matter) and is thus robust tothe uncertainty in this parameter. modified theories of gravity generallypredict values of eg different from the general relativistic predictionbecause, in these theories, the 'gravitational slip' (the difference betweenthe two potentials that describe perturbations in the gravitational metric) isnon-zero, which leads to changes in the growth of structure and the strength ofthe gravitational lensing effect3. here we report that eg = 0.39 +/- 0.06 onlength scales of tens of megaparsecs, in agreement with the generalrelativistic prediction of eg $\approx$ 0.4. the measured value excludes amodel within the tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory, which modifies bothnewtonian and einstein gravity. however, the relatively large uncertainty stillpermits models within f(r) theory, which is an extension of general relativity.a fivefold decrease in uncertainty is needed to rule out these models.

1004.5377	minimizing the stochasticity of halos in large-scale structure surveys	in recent work (seljak, hamaus and desjacques 2009) it was found thatweighting central halo galaxies by halo mass can significantly suppress theirstochasticity relative to the dark matter, well below the poisson modelexpectation. in this paper we extend this study with the goal of finding theoptimal mass-dependent halo weighting and use $n$-body simulations to perform ageneral analysis of halo stochasticity and its dependence on halo mass. weinvestigate the stochasticity matrix, defined as $c_{ij}\equiv&lt;(\delta_i-b_i\delta_m)(\delta_j-b_j\delta_m)&gt;$, where $\delta_m$ is the dark matteroverdensity in fourier space, $\delta_i$ the halo overdensity of the $i$-thhalo mass bin and $b_i$ the halo bias. in contrast to the poisson modelpredictions we detect nonvanishing correlations between different mass bins. wealso find the diagonal terms to be sub-poissonian for the highest-mass halos.the diagonalization of this matrix results in one large and one low eigenvalue,with the remaining eigenvalues close to the poisson prediction $1/\bar{n}$,where $\bar{n}$ is the mean halo number density. the eigenmode with the lowesteigenvalue contains most of the information and the corresponding eigenvectorprovides an optimal weighting function to minimize the stochasticity betweenhalos and dark matter. we find this optimal weighting function to match linearmass weighting at high masses, while at the low-mass end the weights approach aconstant whose value depends on the low-mass cut in the halo mass function.finally, we employ the halo model to derive the stochasticity matrix and thescale-dependent bias from an analytical perspective. it is remarkablysuccessful in reproducing our numerical results and predicts that thestochasticity between halos and the dark matter can be reduced further whengoing to halo masses lower than we can resolve in current simulations.

1009.4704	large-scale bao signatures of the smallest galaxies	recent work has shown that at high redshift, the relative velocity betweendark matter and baryonic gas is typically supersonic. this relative velocitysuppresses the formation of the earliest baryonic structures like minihalos,and the suppression is modulated on large scales. this effect imprints acharacteristic shape in the clustering power spectrum of the earlieststructures, with significant power on 100 mpc scales featuring highlypronounced baryon acoustic oscillations. the amplitude of these oscillations isorders of magnitude larger at z=20 than previously expected. thischaracteristic signature can allow us to distinguish the effects of minihaloson intergalactic gas at times preceding and during reionization. we illustratethis effect with the example of 21 cm emission and absorption from redshiftsduring and before reionization. this effect can potentially allow us to probephysics on kpc scales using observations on 100 mpc scales.  we present sensitivity forecasts for fast and arecibo. depending onparameters, this enhanced structure may be detectable by arecibo at redshiftsnear z=15-20, and with appropriate instrumentation fast could measure the baopower spectrum with high precision. in principle, this effect could also pose aserious challenge for efforts to constrain dark energy using observations ofthe bao feature at low redshift.

1101.4017	testing the tidal alignment model of galaxy intrinsic alignment	weak gravitational lensing has become a powerful probe of large-scalestructure and cosmological parameters. precision weak lensing measurementsrequire an understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities,which can in turn inform models of galaxy formation. it is hypothesized thatelliptical galaxies align with the background tidal field and that thisalignment mechanism dominates the correlation between ellipticities oncosmological scales (in the absence of lensing). we use recent large-scalestructure measurements from the sloan digital sky survey to test this picturewith several statistics: (1) the correlation between ellipticity and galaxyoverdensity, w_{g+}; (2) the intrinsic alignment auto-correlation functions;(3) the correlation functions of curl-free, e, and divergence-free, b, modes(the latter of which is zero in the linear tidal alignment theory); (4) thealignment correlation function, w_g(r_p,theta), a recently developed statisticthat generalizes the galaxy correlation function to account for the anglebetween the galaxy separation vector and the principle axis of ellipticity. weshow that recent measurements are largely consistent with the tidal alignmentmodel and discuss dependence on galaxy luminosity. in addition, we show that atlinear order the tidal alignment model predicts that the angular dependence ofw_g(r_p,theta) is simply w_{g+}*cos(2*theta) and that this dependence isconsistent with recent measurements. we also study how stochastic nonlinearcontributions to galaxy ellipticity impact these statistics. we find that asignificant fraction of the observed lrg ellipticity can be explained byalignment with the tidal field on scales &gt;~10 h^-1 mpc. these considerationsare relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.

1104.2321	optimal constraints on local primordial non-gaussianity from the  two-point statistics of large-scale structure	one of the main signatures of primordial non-gaussianity of the local type isa scale-dependent correction to the bias of large-scale structure tracers suchas galaxies or clusters, whose amplitude depends on the bias of the tracersitself. the dominant source of noise in the power spectrum of the tracers iscaused by sampling variance on large scales (where the non-gaussian signal isstrongest) and shot noise arising from their discrete nature. recent work hasargued that one can avoid sampling variance by comparing multiple tracers ofdifferent bias, and suppress shot noise by optimally weighting halos ofdifferent mass. here we combine these ideas and investigate how well thesignatures of non-gaussian fluctuations in the primordial potential can beextracted from the two-point correlations of halos and dark matter. on thebasis of large $n$-body simulations with local non-gaussian initial conditionsand their halo catalogs we perform a fisher matrix analysis of the two-pointstatistics. compared to the standard analysis, optimal weighting- andmultiple-tracer techniques applied to halos can yield up to one order ofmagnitude improvements in $\fnl$-constraints, even if the underlying darkmatter density field is not known. we compare our numerical results to the halomodel and find satisfactory agreement. forecasting the optimal$\fnl$-constraints that can be achieved with our methods when applied toexisting and future survey data, we find that a survey of$50h^{-1}\mathrm{gpc}^3$ volume resolving all halos down to $10^{11}\hmsun$ at$z=1$ will be able to obtain $\sigma_{\fnl}\sim1$ (68% cl), a factor of$\sim20$ improvement over the current limits. decreasing the minimum mass ofresolved halos, increasing the survey volume or obtaining the dark matter mapscan further improve these limits, potentially reaching the level of$\sigma_{\fnl}\sim0.1$.

1106.5507	galaxy bias and non-linear structure formation in general relativity	length scales probed by large scale structure surveys are becoming closer tothe horizon scale. further, it has been recently understood thatnon-gaussianity in the initial conditions could show up in a scale dependenceof the bias of galaxies at the largest distances. it is therefore important toinclude general relativistic effects. here we provide a general relativisticgeneralization of the bias, valid both for gaussian and non-gaussian initialconditions. the collapse of objects happens on very small scales, whilelong-wavelength modes are always in the quasi linear regime. around everycollapsing region, it is therefore possible to find a reference frame that isvalid for all times and where the space time is almost flat: the fermi frame.here the newtonian approximation is applicable and the equations of motion arethe ones of the n-body codes. the effects of long-wavelength modes are encodedin the mapping from the cosmological frame to the local frame. for the linearbias, the effect of the long-wavelength modes on the dynamics is encoded in thelocal curvature of the universe, which allows us to define a generalrelativistic generalization of the bias in the standard newtonian setting. weshow that the bias due to this effect goes to zero as the squared ratio of thephysical wavenumber with the hubble scale for modes longer than the horizon, asmodes longer than the horizon have no dynamical effects. however, the bias dueto non-gaussianities does not need to vanish for modes longer than the hubblescale, and for non-gaussianities of the local kind it goes to a constant. as afurther application, we show that it is not necessary to perform large n-bodysimulations to extract information on long-wavelength modes: n-body simulationscan be done on small scales and long-wavelength modes are encoded simply byadding curvature to the simulation and rescaling the coordinates.

1109.0998	testing general relativity on horizon scales and the primordial  non-gaussianity	the proper general relativistic description of the observed galaxy powerspectrum is substantially different from the standard newtonian description onlarge scales, providing a unique opportunity to test general relativity onhorizon scales. using the einstein equations, the general relativistic effectscan be classified as two new terms that represent the velocity and thegravitational potential, coupling to the time evolution of galaxy numberdensity and hubble parameter. compared to the dominant density and velocityredshift-space distortion terms, the former scales as h/k and correlates thereal and imaginary parts of the fourier modes, while the latter scales as(h/k)^2, where k is the comoving wave number and h is the conformal hubbleparameter. we use the recently developed methods to reduce the samplingvariance and shot noise to show that in an all sky galaxy redshift survey atlow redshift the velocity term can be measured at 10-sigma confidence level, ifone can utilize halos of mass m&gt;10^{10} msun, while the gravitational potentialterm itself can only be marginally detected. we also demonstrate that thegeneral relativistic effect is not degenerate with the primordial non-gaussiansignature in galaxy bias, and the ability to detect the primordialnon-gaussianity is little compromised.

1109.1888	distribution function approach to redshift space distortions	we develop a phase space distribution function approach to redshift spacedistortions (rsd), in which the redshift space density can be written as a sumover velocity moments of the distribution function. these moments are densityweighted and their lowest orders are density, momentum density, and stressenergy density. the series expansion is convergent on large scales. we performan expansion of these velocity moments into helicity modes, which areeigenmodes under rotation around the axis of fourier mode direction,generalizing the scalar, vector, tensor decomposition of perturbations to anarbitrary order. we show that only equal helicity moments correlate and derivethe angular dependence of the individual contributions to the redshift spacepower spectrum in terms of angle mu between wave vector and line of sight. weshow that the dominant term of mu^2 dependence on large scales is thecross-correlation between the density and scalar part of momentum density,which can be related to the time derivative of the matter power spectrum.additional terms contributing and dominating on small scales are the vectorpart of momentum density-momentum density correlations, the energydensity-density correlations, and the scalar part of anisotropic stressdensity-density correlations. similarly, we identify 7 terms contributing tomu^4 dependence. some of the advantages of the distribution function approachare that the series expansion converges on large scales and remains valid inmulti-stream situations. we finish with a brief discussion of implications forrsd in galaxies relative to dark matter, highlighting the issue of scaledependent bias of velocity moments correlators.

1201.4827	evidence for quadratic tidal tensor bias from the halo bispectrum	the relation between the clustering properties of luminous matter in the formof galaxies and the underlying dark matter distribution is of fundamentalimportance for the interpretation of ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys. theso called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matterdensity, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrumor correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. however,gravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thusnon-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initialconditions (lagrangian space). because the term is quadratic, it contributes asa loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picturestill applies on large scales, however, it contributes at leading order to thebispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. such a term could also bepresent in lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidalfield. we measure the corresponding coupling strengths from thematter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a non-vanishingcoefficient for the tidal tensor term. we find no scale dependence of the biasparameters up to k=0.1 h/mpc and that the tidal effect is increasing with halomass. while the lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our resultsthan the eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidaltensor bias already in the initial conditions. we also find that thecoefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from thetheoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universalmass function. both quadratic density and tidal tensor bias terms must beincluded in the modeling of galaxy clustering of current and future surveys ifone wants to achieve the high precision cosmology promise of these datasets.

1204.2264	separating intrinsic alignment and galaxy-galaxy lensing	the coherent physical alignment of galaxies is an important systematic forgravitational lensing studies as well as a probe of the physical mechanismsinvolved in galaxy formation and evolution. we develop a formalism for treatingthis intrinsic alignment (ia) in the context of galaxy-galaxy lensing andpresent an improved method for measuring ia contamination, which can arise whensources physically associated with the lens are placed behind the lens due tophotometric redshift scatter. we apply the technique to recent sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) measurements of luminous red galaxy lenses and typical (l*)source galaxies with photometric redshifts selected from the sdss imaging data.compared to previous measurements, this method has the advantage of being fullyself-consistent in its treatment of the ia and lensing signals, solving for thetwo simultaneously. we find an ia signal consistent with zero, placing tightconstraints on both the magnitude of the ia effect and its potentialcontamination to the lensing signal. while these constraints depend on sourceselection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurementthat uses photometric redshifts. we obtain a model-independent upper-limit ofroughly 10% ia contamination for projected separations of approximately 0.1-100mpc/h. with more stringent photo-z cuts and reasonable assumptions about thephysics of intrinsic alignments, this upper limit is reduced to 1-2%. theselimits are well below the statistical error of the current lensingmeasurements. our results suggest that ia will not present intractablechallenges to the next generation of galaxy-galaxy lensing experiments, and themethods presented here should continue to aid in our understanding of alignmentprocesses and in the removal of ia from the lensing signal.

1206.4070	distribution function approach to redshift space distortions, part iii:  halos and galaxies	it was recently shown that the power spectrum in redshift space can bewritten as a sum of cross-power spectra between number weighted velocitymoments. we investigate the properties of these power spectra for simulatedgalaxies and dark matter halos and compare them to the dark matter powerspectra, generalizing the concept of the bias. because all of the quantitiesare number weighted this approach is well defined even for sparse systems suchas massive halos, in contrasts to the previous approaches to rsd where velocitycorrelations have been explored. we find that the number density weightingleads to a strong scale dependence of the bias terms for momentum densityauto-correlation and cross-correlation with density. this trend becomes moresignificant for the more biased halos and leads to an enhancement of rsd powerrelative to the linear theory. fingers-of-god effects, which in this formalismcome from the correlations of the higher order moments beyond the momentumdensity, lead to smoothing of the power spectrum and can reduce thisenhancement of power, but are relatively small for halos with no small-scalevelocity dispersion. in comparison, for a more realistic galaxy sample withsatellites the velocity dispersion generated by satellite motions inside thehalos leads to a larger power suppression on small scales, but this depends onthe satellite fraction. we investigate several statistics such as thetwo-dimensional power spectrum, its multipole moments, its powers of mu^2, andconfiguration space statistics. overall we find that the nonlinear effects inrealistic galaxy samples such as luminous red galaxies affect the redshiftspace clustering on very large scales: for example, the quadrupole moment isaffected by 10% for k&lt;0.1h/mpc, which means that these effects need to beunderstood if we want to extract cosmological information from the redshiftspace distortions.

1206.5809	going beyond the kaiser redshift-space distortion formula: a full  general relativistic account of the effects and their detectability in galaxy  clustering	kaiser redshift-space distortion formula describes well the clustering ofgalaxies in redshift surveys on small scales, but there are numerous additionalterms that arise on large scales. some of these terms can be described usingnewtonian dynamics and have been discussed in the literature, while the othersrequire proper general relativistic description that was only recentlydeveloped. accounting for these terms in galaxy clustering is the first steptoward tests of general relativity on horizon scales. the effects can beclassified as two terms that represent the velocity and the gravitationalpotential contributions. their amplitude is determined by effects such as thevolume and luminosity distance fluctuation effects and the time evolution ofgalaxy number density and hubble parameter. we compare the newtonianapproximation often used in the redshift-space distortion literature to thefully general relativistic equation, and show that newtonian approximationaccounts for most of the terms contributing to velocity effect. we perform afisher matrix analysis of detectability of these terms and show that in asingle tracer survey they are completely undetectable. to detect these termsone must resort to the recently developed methods to reduce sampling varianceand shot noise. we show that in an all-sky galaxy redshift survey at lowredshift the velocity term can be measured at a few sigma if one can utilizehalos of mass m&gt;10^12 msun (this can increase to 10-sigma or more in some moreoptimistic scenarios), while the gravitational potential term itself can onlybe marginally detected. we also demonstrate that the general relativisticeffect is not degenerate with the primordial non-gaussian signature in galaxybias, and the ability to detect primordial non-gaussianity is littlecompromised.

1207.1120	cosmological parameter constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy  clustering with the sdss dr7	recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient betweengalaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virialradii of galaxy halos, independent of the details of how galaxies populate darkmatter halos. this finding makes it possible to determine the dark matterclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxyclustering. we present new cosmological parameter constraints based onlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7). we generalise the approach of baldaufet al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 mpc/h forlensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlationcoefficient differs from unity. we derive constraints for three galaxy samplescovering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with meanredshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. we clearly detect scale-dependent galaxybias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent withtheoretical expectations. when we vary both \sigma_8 and \omega_m (andmarginalise over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat lcdm model, thebest-constrained quantity is \sigma_8 (\omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05(1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors havecomparable contributions, and we fixed n_s=0.96 and h=0.7. these strongconstraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitivewith cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in someways less serious systematics. we therefore expect that this method will play aprominent role in future weak lensing surveys. when we combine these data withwmap7 cmb data, constraints on \sigma_8, \omega_m, h_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu}become 30--80 per cent tighter than with cmb data alone, since our data breakseveral parameter degeneracies.

1207.2471	joint analysis of gravitational lensing, clustering and abundance:  toward the unification of large-scale structure analysis	we explore three different methods based on weak lensing to extractcosmological constraints from the large-scale structure. in the first approach(method i), small-scale galaxy lensing measurements of their halo mass providea constraint on the halo bias, which can be combined with the large-scalegalaxy clustering to measure the dark matter clustering. in the second approach(method ii), large-scale galaxy clustering and large-scale galaxy-galaxylensing can be combined into a direct measurement of the dark matterclustering. these two methods can be combined into one method i+ii to make useof lensing measurements on all scales. in the third approach (method iii), weadd abundance information to the method i. we explore the statistical power ofthese three approaches as a function of galaxy luminosity to investigate theoptimal mass range for each method and their cosmological constraining power.in the case of the sdss, we find that the three methods give comparableconstraints, but not in the same mass range: the method ii works best for halosof m~10^13 msun, and the methods i and iii work best for halos of m~10^14 msun.we discuss the robustness of each method against various systematics.furthermore, we extend the analysis to the future large-scale galaxy surveysand find that the cluster abundance method is not superior to the combinedmethod i+ii, both in terms of statistical power and robustness againstsystematic errors. the cosmic shear-shear correlation analysis in the futuresurveys yields constraints as strong as the combined method, but suffer fromadditional systematic effects. we thus advocate the combined analysis ofclustering and lensing (method i+ii) as a powerful alternative to otherlarge-scale probes. our analysis provides a guidance to observers planninglarge-scale galaxy surveys such as the des, euclid, and the lsst.

1308.1093	wide angle effects in future galaxy surveys	current and future galaxy surveys cover a large fraction of the entire skywith a significant redshift range, and the recent theoretical development showsthat general relativistic effects are present in galaxy clustering on verylarge scales. this trend has renewed interest in the wide angle effect ingalaxy clustering measurements, in which the distant-observer approximation isoften adopted. using the full wide-angle formula for computing theredshift-space correlation function, we show that compared to the samplevariance, the deviation in the redshift-space correlation function from thesimple kaiser formula with the distant-observer approximation is negligible ingalaxy surveys such as the sdss, euclid and the bigboss, if the theoreticalprediction from the kaiser formula is properly averaged over the survey volume.we also find corrections to the wide-angle formula and clarify the confusion inliterature between the wide angle effect and the velocity contribution ingalaxy clustering. however, when the fkp method is applied, substantialdeviations can be present in the power spectrum analysis in future surveys, dueto the non-uniform distribution of galaxy pairs.

1308.1401	signatures of first stars in galaxy surveys: multi-tracer analysis of  the supersonic relative velocity effect and the constraints from the boss  power spectrum measurements	we study the effect of the supersonic relative velocity between dark matterand baryons on large-scale galaxy clustering and derive the constraint on therelative velocity bias parameter from the baryonic oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss) power spectrum measurements. recent work has shown that therelative velocity effect may have a dramatic impact on the star formation athigh redshifts, if first stars are formed in minihalos around z~20, or if theeffect propagates through secondary effects to stars formed at later redshifts.the relative velocity effect has particularly strong signatures in the largescale clustering of these sources, including the bao position. assuming that asmall fraction of stars in low-redshift massive galaxies retain the memory ofthe primordial relative velocity effect, galaxy clustering measurements can beused to constrain the signatures of the first stars. luminous red galaxiescontain some of the oldest stars in the universe and are ideally suited tosearch for this effect. using the boss power spectrum measurements from thesloan data release 9, in combination with planck, we derive the upper limit onthe fraction of the stars sensitive to relative velocity effect f_star&lt;3.3% atthe 95% confidence level in the cmass galaxy sample. if additional galaxysample not sensitive to the effect is available in a given survey, a jointmulti-tracer analysis can be applied to construct a sample-variance cancellingcombination, providing a model-independent way to verify the presence of therelative velocity effect in the galaxy power spectrum on large scales. such amulti-tracer analysis in future galaxy surveys can greatly improve the currentconstraint, achieving a 0.1% level in f_star.

1312.4214	peculiar velocities in redshift space: formalism, n-body simulations and  perturbation theory	direct measurements of peculiar velocities of galaxies and clusters ofgalaxies can in principle provide explicit information on the three dimensionalmass distribution, but this information is modulated by the fact that velocityfield is sampled at galaxy positions, and is thus probing galaxy momentum. wederive expressions for the cross power spectrum between the density andmomentum field and the auto spectrum of the momentum field in redshift space,by extending the distribution function method to these statistics. theresulting momentum cross and auto power spectra in redshift space are expressedas infinite sums over velocity moment correlators in real space, as is the casefor the density power spectrum in redshift space. we compute each correlatorusing eulerian perturbation theory (pt) and halo biasing model and compare theresulting redshift-space velocity statistics to those measured from n-bodysimulations for both dark matter and halos. we find that in redshift spacelinear theory predictions for the density-momentum cross power spectrum as wellas for the momentum auto spectrum fail to predict the n-body results at verylarge scales. on the other hand, our nonlinear pt prediction for these velocitystatistics, together with real-space power spectrum for dark matter fromsimulations, improves the accuracy for both dark matter and halos. we alsopresent the same analysis in configuration space, computing the redshift-spacepairwise mean infall velocities and velocity correlation function and compareto nonlinear pt.

1407.0060	analytic model for the matter power spectrum, its covariance matrix, and  baryonic effects	we develop a model for the matter power spectrum as the sum of zeldovichapproximation and even powers of $k$, i.e., $a_0 - a_2k^2 + a_4k^4 - ...$,compensated at low $k$. with terms up to $k^4$ the model can predict the truepower spectrum to a few percent accuracy up to $k\sim 0.7 h \rm{mpc}^{-1}$,over a wide range of redshifts and models. the $a_n$ coefficients containinformation about cosmology, in particular amplitude of fluctuations. we writea simple form of the covariance matrix as a sum of gaussian part and $a_0$variance, which reproduces the simulations remarkably well. in contrast, weshow that one needs an n-body simulation volume of more than 1000 $({\rmgpc}/h)^3$ to converge to 1\% accuracy on covariance matrix. we investigate thesuper-sample variance effect and show it can be modeled as an additionalparameter that can be determined from the data. this allows a determination of$\sigma_8$ amplitude to about 0.2\% for a survey volume of 1$({\rm gpc}/h)^3$,compared to 0.4\% otherwise. we explore the sensitivity of these coefficientsto baryonic effects using hydrodynamic simulations of van daalen (2011). wefind that because of baryons redistributing matter inside halos all thecoefficients $a_{2n}$ for $n&gt;0$ are strongly affected by baryonic effects,while $a_0$ remains almost unchanged, a consequence of halo mass conservation.our results suggest that observations such as weak lensing power spectrum canbe effectively marginalized over the baryonic effects, while still preservingthe bulk of the cosmological information contained in $a_0$ and zeldovichterms.

1506.05814	galaxy power spectrum in redshift space: combining perturbation theory  with the halo model	theoretical modeling of the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies iscrucially important to correctly extract cosmological information from redshiftsurveys. the task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift spacedistortion effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distributionof halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. one of the main modelingchallenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radialdistribution and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known asthe finger-of-god effect. we present a model for the galaxy power spectrum ofin which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxiesand relate different contributions to 1- and 2-halo terms in a halo model. ourprimary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physicallymeaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. for the 2-halo terms weuse the previously developed rsd modeling of halos in the context ofdistribution function and perturbation theory approach. this term needs to bemultiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellitesinside the halo. to this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which arenon-perturbative. we show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled asalmost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the haloinducing a small k^2r^2 term, where r is related to the size of the halo. weadopt a similar model for fog in redshift space, ensuring that fog velocitydispersion is related to the halo mass. for fog k^2 type expansions do not workand fog resummation must be used instead. we test several damping functions tomodel the velocity dispersion fog effect. applying the formalism to mockgalaxies modeled after the "cmass" sample of the boss survey, we find that ourpredictions for the redshift-space power spectra are accurate up to k~0.4mpc/h.

0805.2552	halo mass - concentration relation from weak lensing	we perform a statistical weak lensing analysis of dark matter profiles aroundtracers of halo mass from galactic- to cluster-size halos. in this analysis weuse 170,640 isolated ~l* galaxies split into ellipticals and spirals, 38,236groups traced by isolated spectroscopic luminous red galaxies (lrgs) and 13,823maxbcg clusters from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) covering a wide rangeof richness. together these three samples allow a determination of the densityprofiles of dark matter halos over three orders of magnitude in mass, from10^{12} m_{sun} to 10^{15} m_{sun}. the resulting lensing signal is consistentwith an nfw or einasto profile on scales outside the central region. we findthat the nfw concentration parameter c_{200b} decreases with halo mass, fromaround 10 for galactic halos to 4 for cluster halos. assuming its dependence onhalo mass in the form of c_{200b} = c_0 [m/(10^{14}m_{sun}/h)]^{\beta}, we findc_0=4.6 +/- 0.7 (at z=0.22) and \beta=0.13 +/- 0.07, with very similar resultsfor the einasto profile. the slope (\beta) is in agreement with theoreticalpredictions, while the amplitude is about two standard deviations below thepredictions for this mass and redshift, but we note that the published valuesin the literature differ at a level of 10-20% and that for a proper comparisonour analysis should be repeated in simulations. we discuss the implications ofour results for the baryonic effects on the shear power spectrum: since theseare expected to increase the halo concentration, the fact that we see noevidence of high concentrations on scales above 20% of the virial radiussuggests that baryonic effects are limited to small scales, and are not asignificant source of uncertainty for the current weak lensing measurements ofthe dark matter power spectrum.

0805.3580	constraints on local primordial non-gaussianity from large scale  structure	recent work has shown that the local non-gaussianity parameter f_nl induces ascale-dependent bias, whose amplitude is growing with scale. here we firstrederive this result within the context of peak-background split formalism andshow that it only depends on the assumption of universality of mass function,assuming halo bias only depends on mass. we then use extended press-schechterformalism to argue that this assumption may be violated and the scale dependentbias will depend on other properties, such as merging history of halos. inparticular, in the limit of recent mergers we find the effect is suppressed.next we use these predictions in conjunction with a compendium of large scaledata to put a limit on the value of f_nl. when combining all data assuming thathalo occupation depends only on halo mass, we get a limit of -29 ~ (-65)&lt; f_nl&lt; +70 ~(+93) at 95% (99.7%) confidence. while we use a wide range of datasets,our combined result is dominated by the signal from the sdss photometric quasarsample. if the latter are modeled as recent mergers then the limits weaken to-31 ~(-96) &lt; f_nl &lt; +70 ~ (+96) . these limits are comparable to the strongestcurrent limits from the wmap 5 year analysis, with no evidence of a positivesignal in f_nl. while the method needs to be thoroughly tested against largescale structure simulations with realistic quasar and galaxy formation models,our results indicate that this is a competitive method relative to cmb andshould be further pursued both observationally and theoretically.

0807.1770	measuring primordial non-gaussianity without cosmic variance	non-gaussianity in the initial conditions of the universe is one of the mostpowerful mechanisms to discriminate among the competing theories of the earlyuniverse. measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number ofmodes. recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity oflocal type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biasedtracers of large scale structure. however, this power spectrum method is alsolimited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,and by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimicthe same effect. here we propose an alternative method that solves both ofthese problems. it is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,but not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biasedtracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates thecosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from thestructures comparable to the size of the survey. the square of errorimprovement on non-gaussianity parameter f_nl relative to the power spectrummethod scales as pn/2, where p and n is the power spectrum and the numberdensity of the biased tracer, respectively. for an ideal survey out to z=2 theerror reduction can be as large as a factor of seven, which should guarantee adetection of non-gaussianity from an all sky survey of this type. theimprovements could be even larger if high density tracers that are sensitive tonon-gaussianity can be identified and measured over a large volume.

astro-ph;0001493	analytic model for galaxy and dark matter clustering	we investigate an analytic model to compute nonlinear power spectrum of darkmatter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. the model is based onpress-schechter halos, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles.the total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlationsbetwen the halos and one from correlations within the same halo. we show thatsuch a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with theresults of n-body simulations, provided that concentration parameter decreaseswith the halo mass.  galaxy power spectrum differs from dark matter power spectrum because pairweighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, aspredicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters. in this case theresulting power spectrum becomes a power law with the slope closed to theobserved. such a model also predicts a later onset of nonlinear clusteringcompared to the dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cdm models withthe data. generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale dependent andnonmonotonic. for red or elliptical galaxies bias in power spectrum may bescale dependent even on very large scales.  our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observedthrough the galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simplyas an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo massesdominate at different scales and because larger halos host more than onegalaxy. we discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combinationwith galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum (abridged).

astro-ph;0009016	redshift space bias and beta from the halo model	we analyze scale dependence of redshift space bias $b$ and $\beta \equiv\omega_m^{0.6}/b$ in the context of the halo model. we show that linear bias isa good approximation only on large scales, for $k&lt;0.1h$mpc$^{-1}$. onintermediate scales the virial motions of the galaxies cause a suppression ofthe power spectrum relative to the linear one, which differs from the sameeffect in dark matter. this suppression can potentially mimic the effect ofmassive neutrinos and the degeneracy can only be broken if the power spectrumis measured for $k \ll 0.1h$mpc$^{-1}$. different methods to determine $\beta$converge for $k&lt;0.1h$mpc$^{-1}$, but give drastically different results onsmaller scales, which explains some of the trends observed in the real data. wealso asses the level of stochasticity by calculating the cross-correlationcoefficient between the reconstructed velocity field divergence and thegalaxies and show that the two fields decorrelate for $k&gt;0.1h$mpc$^{-1}$. mostproblematic are galaxies predominantly found in groups and clusters, such asbright, red or elliptical galaxies, where we find poor convergence to aconstant bias or $\beta$ even on large scales.

astro-ph;0106151	universal gas density and temperature profile	we present an analytic approach to predict gas density and temperatureprofiles in dark matter haloes. we assume that the gas density profile tracesthe dark matter density profile in outer parts of the haloes, as suggested bymany hydrodynamic simulations. under this assumption, the hydrostaticequilibrium uniquely fixes the two free parameters in the model, themass-temperature normalization and the polytropic index, that determine thetemperature profile. this enables us to predict a universal gas profile fromany universal dark matter profile. our results show that gas tracing darkmatter in the outer parts of the haloes is inconsistent with gas beingisothermal; on the contrary, it requires temperature to decrease slowly withradius, in agreement with observations. we compare our predictions for x-raysurface brightness profiles of the haloes and the mass-temperature relationwith observations. we find that they are generally in a good agreement. wecompare the universal profile with the beta profile and find that, although thebeta profile gives a reasonable fit to our predicted profiles, the deviationfrom it can explain many of the observed trends, once we take into account theobservational selection effects. our model predicts that the mass-temperaturerelation does not follow the self-similar relation because of themass-dependent halo concentration. we also predict surface brightness profilesof the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. we find that fitted to the beta profilethe core radii and beta inferred from the sz effect are systematically largerthan those from the x-ray measurement.

astro-ph;0108013	galaxy mass and luminosity scaling laws determined by weak gravitational  lensing	we present new measurements of scaling laws relating the luminosity ofgalaxies to the amplitude and shape of their dark matter halos. early imagingand spectroscopic data from the sloan digital sky survey are used to make weaklensing measurements of the surface mass density contrast delta sigma_+ aroundclasses of lens objects. this surface mass density contrast as a function ofradius is a measure of the galaxy-mass correlation function (gmcf). becausespectroscopic redshifts are available for all lens objects, the mass anddistance scales are well constrained. the gmcf measured around ~31,000 lensesis well fit by a power law of the form  delta sigma_+ = (2.5+0.7-0.6) (r/1 mpc)^{-0.8+-0.2} h m_sun pc^-2.  we compare this gmcf to galaxy luminosity, type, and environment, and findthat it varies strongly with all three. we quantify these variations bycomparing the normalization of a fit to the inner 260 h^-1 kpc, m_260, to thegalaxy luminosity. while m_260 is not strongly related to luminosity in bluestband u', there is a simple, linear relation between m_260 and luminosity inredder bands (g', r', i', and z'). we test the universality of thesemass-to-light scalings by independently measuring them for spiral andelliptical galaxies,and for galaxies in a variety of environments. we findremarkable consistency in these determinations in the red bands, especially i'and z'. this consistency across a wide range of systems suggests that themeasured scaling represents an excellent cosmic average, and that theintegrated star formation history of galaxies is strongly related to the darkmatter environments in which they form.

astro-ph;0111362	cluster abundance normalization from observed mass-temperature relation	abundance of rich clusters in local universe is currently believed to providethe most robust normalization of power spectrum at a scale of 10 mpc. thisnormalization depends very sensitively on the calibration between virial mass mand temperature t, which is usually taken from simulations. uncertainties inthe modelling, such as gas cooling and heating, can lead to a factor of twovariations in the normalization and are thus not very reliable. here we useinstead an empirical m_{500}-t relation derived from x-ray mass determinationsto calibrate the method. we use results from dark matter simulations to relatethe virial mass function to the mass function at observed m_{500}. we find thatthe best fitted value in flat models is sigma_8=(0.7 \pm 0.06)(\omega_m/0.35)^{-0.44}(\gamma/0.2)^{0.08}, where only the statistical error isquoted. this is significantly lower than previously obtained values from thelocal cluster abundance. this lower value for sigma_8 is in a better agreementwith cosmic microwave background and large scale structure constraints andhelps alleviate small scale problems of cdm models. presently the systematicuncertainties in the mass determination are still large, but ultimately thismethod should provide a more reliable way to normalize the m-t relation. thiscan be achieved by obtaining a larger sample of well measured cluster massesout to a significant fraction of virial radius with bepposax, chandra andxmm-newton.

astro-ph;0203117	cosmological constraints from the masses and abundances of l* galaxies	we place limits on the mean density of the universe and the slope of thelinear power spectrum around a megaparsec scale by comparing the universal massfunction to the observed luminosity function. numerical simulations suggestthat the dark matter halo mass function at small scales depends only onomega_m(n_eff+3) independent of the overall power spectrum normalization.matching the halo abundance to the observed luminosity function requiresknowing the relation between the virial mass and luminosity (separately forearly and late type galaxies) and the fraction of galaxies that reside inlarger halos such as groups and clusters, all of which can be extracted fromthe galaxy-galaxy lensing. we apply the recently derived values from sdss andfind omega_m(n_eff+3)= (0.15 \pm 0.05)/(1-f_dh), where f_dh accounts for thepossibility that some fraction of halos may be dark or without a bright centralgalaxy. a model with omega_m=0.25 and primordial n=0.8 or with omega_m=0.2 andn=1 agrees well with these constraints even in the absence of dark halos,although with the current data somewhat higher values for omega_m and n arealso acceptable.

astro-ph;0205468	the sunyaev-zel'dovich angular power spectrum as a probe of cosmological  parameters	the angular power spectrum of the sz effect, c_l, is a powerful probe ofcosmology. it is easier to detect than individual clusters in the field, isinsensitive to observational selection effects and does not require acalibration between cluster mass and flux, reducing the systematic errors whichdominate the cluster-counting constraints. it receives a dominant contributionfrom cluster region between 20-40% of the virial radius and is thus insensitiveto the poorly known gas physics in the cluster centre, such as cooling or(pre)heating. in this paper we derive a refined analytic prediction for c_lusing the universal gas-density and temperature profile and the dark-matterhalo mass function. the predicted c_l has no free parameters and fits all ofthe published hydrodynamic simulation results to better than a factor of twoaround l=3000. we find that c_l scales as (sigma_8)^7 times (omega_b h)^2 andis almost independent of all of the other cosmological parameters. this differsfrom the local cluster abundance studies, which give a relation between sigma_8and omega_m. we also compute the covariance matrix of c_l using the halo modeland find a good agreement relative to the simulations. we estimate how well wecan determine sigma_8 with sampling-variance-limited observations and find thatfor a several-square-degree survey with 1-2 arcminute resolution one should beable to determine sigma_8 to within a few percent, with the remaininguncertainty dominated by theoretical modelling. if the recent excess of the cmbpower on small scales reported by the cbi experiment is due to the sz effect,then we find sigma_8(omega_b h/0.029)^0.3 = 1.04 +- 0.12 at the 95% confidencelevel (statistical) and with a residual 10% systematic (theoretical)uncertainty.

astro-ph;0209489	analyzing weak lensing of the cosmic microwave background using the  likelihood function	future experiments will produce high-resolution temperature maps of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) and are expected to reveal the signature ofgravitational lensing by intervening large-scale structures. we constructall-sky maximum-likelihood estimators that use the lensing effect to estimatethe projected density (convergence) of these structures, its power spectrum,and cross-correlation with other observables. this contrasts with earlierquadratic-estimator approaches that taylor-expanded the observed cmbtemperature to linear order in the lensing deflection angle; these approachesgave estimators for the temperature-convergence correlation in terms of the cmbthree-point correlation function and for the convergence power spectrum interms of the cmb four-point correlation function, which can be biased andnon-optimal due to terms beyond the linear order. we show that for sufficientlyweak lensing, the maximum-likelihood estimator reduces to the computationallyless demanding quadratic estimator. the maximum likelihood and quadraticapproaches are compared by evaluating the root-mean-square (rms) error and biasin the reconstructed convergence map in a numerical simulation; it is foundthat both the rms errors and bias are of order 1 percent for the case of planckand of order 10--20 percent for a 1 arcminute beam experiment. we conclude thatfor recovering lensing information from temperature data acquired by theseexperiments, the quadratic estimator is close to optimal, but further work willbe required to determine whether this is also the case for lensing of the cmbpolarization field.

astro-ph;0301054	shear calibration biases in weak lensing surveys	we investigate biases induced by the conversion between the observed imageshape to shear distortion in current weak lensing analysis methods. suchoverall calibration biases cannot be detected by the standard tests such as e/bdecomposition or calibration with stars. we find that the non-gaussianity ofpoint spread function has a significant effect and can lead to up to 15 percent error on the linear amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8 depending on themethod of analysis. this could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recentamplitude determinations from weak lensing. using an elliptical laguerreexpansion method we develop a re-gaussianization method which reduces the errorto calibration error of order 1 per cent even for poorly resolved galaxies. wealso discuss a new type of shear selection bias which results in up to roughly8 percent underestimation of the signal. it is expected to scale with redshift,inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for.understanding and correcting for such effects is crucial if weak lensing is tobecome a high precision probe of cosmology.

astro-ph;0302571	cosmological constraints from the cmb and ly-alpha forest revisited	the wmap team has recently highlighted the usefulness of combining thely-alpha forest constraints with those from the cosmic microwave background(cmb). this combination is particularly powerful as a probe of the primordialshape of the power spectrum. converting between the ly-alpha forestobservations and the linear mass power spectrum requires a careful treatment ofnuisance parameters and modeling with cosmological simulations. we point outseveral issues which lead to an expansion of the errors, the two most importantbeing the range of cosmological parameters explored in simulations and thetreatment of the mean transmitted flux constraints. we employ a likelihoodcalculator for the current ly-alpha data set based on an extensive6-dimensional grid of simulations. we show that the current uncertainties inthe mean transmission and the flux power spectrum define a degeneracy line inthe amplitude-slope plane. the cmb degeneracy due to the primordial powerspectrum shape follows a similar relation in this plane. this weakens thestatistical significance of the primordial power spectrum shape constraintsbased on combined cmb+ly-alpha forest analysis. using the current data thesimplest n=1 scale invariant model with dn/dln k=0 and no tensors has a deltachi^2=4 compared to the best fitting model in which these 3 parameters arefree. current data therefore do not require relaxing these parameters toimprove the fit.

astro-ph;0306354	reconstruction of lensing from the cosmic microwave background  polarization	gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarizationfield has been recognized as a potentially valuable probe of the cosmologicaldensity field. we apply likelihood-based techniques to the problem of lensingof cmb polarization and show that if the b-mode polarization is mapped, thenlikelihood-based techniques allow significantly better lensing reconstructionthan is possible using the previous quadratic estimator approach. with thismethod the ultimate limit to lensing reconstruction is not set by the lensedcmb power spectrum. second-order corrections are known to produce a curlcomponent of the lensing deflection field that cannot be described by apotential; we show that this does not significantly affect the reconstructionat noise levels greater than 0.25 microk arcmin. the reduction of the meansquared error in the lensing reconstruction relative to the quadratic methodcan be as much as a factor of two at noise levels of 1.4 microk arcmin to afactor of ten at 0.25 microk arcmin, depending on the angular scale ofinterest.

astro-ph;0308446	weak lensing and cmb: parameter forecasts including a running spectral  index	we use statistical inference theory to explore the constraints from futuregalaxy weak lensing (cosmic shear) surveys combined with the current cmbconstraints on cosmological parameters, focusing particularly on the running ofthe spectral index of the primordial scalar power spectrum, $\alpha_s$. recentpapers have drawn attention to the possibility of measuring $\alpha_s$ bycombining the cmb with galaxy clustering and/or the lyman-$\alpha$ forest. weaklensing combined with the cmb provides an alternative probe of the primordialpower spectrum. we run a series of simulations with variable runnings andcompare them to semi-analytic non-linear mappings to test their validity forour calculations. we find that a ``reference'' cosmic shear survey with$f_{sky}=0.01$ and $6.6\times 10^8$ galaxies per steradian can reduce theuncertainty on $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$ by roughly a factor of 2 relative to thecmb alone. we investigate the effect of shear calibration biases on lensing byincluding the calibration factor as a parameter, and show that for ourreference survey, the precision of cosmological parameter determination is onlyslightly degraded even if the amplitude calibration is uncertain by as much as5%. we conclude that in the near future weak lensing surveys can supplement thecmb observations to constrain the primordial power spectrum.

astro-ph;0310163	gravitational lensing as a contaminant of the gravity wave signal in cmb	gravity waves (gw) in the early universe generate b-type polarization in thecosmic microwave background (cmb), which can be used as a direct way to measurethe energy scale of inflation. gravitational lensing contaminates the gw signalby converting the dominant e polarization into b polarization. byreconstructing the lensing potential from cmb itself one can decontaminate theb mode induced by lensing. we present results of numerical simulations of bmode delensing using quadratic and iterative maximum-likelihood lensingreconstruction methods as a function of detector noise and beam. in oursimulations we find the quadratic method can reduce the lensing b noise powerby up to a factor of 7, close to the no noise limit. in contrast, the iterativemethod shows significant improvements even at the lowest noise levels wetested. we demonstrate explicitly that with this method at least a factor of 40noise power reduction in lensing induced b power is possible, suggesting thatt/s=10^-6 may be achievable in the absence of sky cuts, foregrounds, andinstrumental systematics. while we do not find any fundamental lower limit dueto lensing, we find that for high-sensitivity detectors residual lensing noisedominates over the detector noise.

astro-ph;0310198	signatures of relativistic neutrinos in cmb anisotropy and matter  clustering	we present a detailed analytical study of ultra-relativistic neutrinos incosmological perturbation theory and of the observable signatures ofinhomogeneities in the cosmic neutrino background. we note that a modificationof perturbation variables that removes all the time derivatives of scalargravitational potentials from the dynamical equations simplifies their solutionnotably. the used perturbations of particle number per coordinate, not proper,volume are generally constant on superhorizon scales. in real space ananalytical analysis can be extended beyond fluids to neutrinos.  the faster cosmological expansion due to the neutrino background changes theacoustic and damping angular scales of the cosmic microwave background (cmb).but we find that equivalent changes can be produced by varying other standardparameters, including the primordial helium abundance. the low-l integratedsachs-wolfe effect is also not sensitive to neutrinos. however, the gravity ofneutrino perturbations suppresses the cmb acoustic peaks for the multipoleswith l&gt;~200 while it enhances the amplitude of matter fluctuations on thesescales. in addition, the perturbations of relativistic neutrinos generate a*unique phase shift* of the cmb acoustic oscillations that for adiabaticinitial conditions cannot be caused by any other standard physics. the originof the shift is traced to neutrino free-streaming velocity exceeding the soundspeed of the photon-baryon plasma. we find that from a high resolution, lownoise instrument such as cmbpol the effective number of light neutrino speciescan be determined with an accuracy of sigma(n_nu) = 0.05 to 0.09, depending onthe constraints on the helium abundance.

astro-ph;0403698	large scale bias and stochasticity of halos and dark matter	on large scales galaxies and their halos are usually assumed to trace thedark matter with a constant bias and dark matter is assumed to trace the lineardensity field. we test these assumption using several large n-body simulationswith 384^3-1024^3 particles and box sizes between 100-1000h/mpc, which can bothresolve the small galactic size halos and sample the large scale fluctuations.we explore the average halo bias relation as a function of halo mass and showthat existing fitting formulae overestimate the halo bias by up to 20% in theregime just below the nonlinear mass. we propose a new expression that fits oursimulations well. we find that the halo bias is nearly constant, b~0.65-0.7,for masses below one tenth of the nonlinear mass. we explore next the relationbetween the initial and final dark matter in individual fourier modes and showthat there are significant fluctuations in their ratio, ranging from 10% rms atk~0.03h/mpc to 50% rms at k~0.1h/mpc. we argue that these large fluctuationsare caused by perturbative effects beyond the linear theory, which aredominated by long wavelength modes with large random fluctuations. similar orlarger fluctuations exist between halos and dark matter and between halos ofdifferent mass. while these fluctuations are small compared to the samplingvariance, they are significant for attempts to determine the bias by relatingdirectly the maps of galaxies and dark matter or the maps of different galaxypopulations, which would otherwise be immune to sampling variance.

astro-ph;0404567	assessing the effects of foregrounds and sky removal in wmap	many recent analyses have indicated that large scale wmap data displayanomalies that appear inconsistent with the standard cosmological paradigm.however, the effects of foreground contamination, which require elimination ofsome fraction of the data, have not been carefully investigated due to thecomplexity in the analysis. here we develop a general formalism of how toincorporate these effects in any analysis of this type. our approach is tocompute the full multi-dimensional probability distribution function of allpossible sky realizations that are consistent with the data and with theallowed level of contamination. as an example we apply this method to computethe joint probability distribution function for the possible realizations ofquadrupole and octopole using the wmap data. this 12 dimensional distributionfunction is explored using the markov chain monte carlo technique. theresulting chains are used to asses the statistical significance of the lowquadrupole using frequentist methods, the quadrupole-octopole alignment usingseveral methods (angular momentum dispersion, multipole vectors and a newmethod based of feature matching) and the quadrupole-octopole aligment withecliptic.

astro-ph;0406275	intrinsic alignment-lensing interference as a contaminant of cosmic  shear	cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, butcan be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticitycorrelations of the source galaxies. the intrinsic alignments are believed tobe small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensingdistortions being uncorrelated. here we show that the gravitational lensingshear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between thetidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearbygalaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distantgalaxies. we estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsicalignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related tothe tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field assuggested by tidal torque theory. the first model predicts agravitational-intrinsic (gi) correlation that can be much greater than theintrinsic-intrinsic (ii) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and thatremains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. the secondmodel, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation.in the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recentlyclaimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the gi correlationterm can exceed the usual ii term by &gt;1 order of magnitude and the intrinsiccorrelation induced b-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. these interference effectscan suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by oforder ~10% at z_s=1 and ~30% at z_s=0.5.

(hep-th/0503117) that the acceleration of the universe could beexplained by large superhorizon fluctuations generated by inflation. we showthat no acceleration can be produced by this mechanism. we begin by showing howthe application of raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies resultsin several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. next we derive anexact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for whichapplication of the kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while theexact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. we show that thediscrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the kolbet al. analysis. we proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation ofgeneral relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observableeffects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. by constructing ariemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrareddivergence terms arise in this coordinate system. thus any divergences foundpreviously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and areunobservable. we perform an explicit analysis of the variance of thedeceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usualcoordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by barausse et al.and kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in theiranalysis. finally, we argue that introducing isocurvature perturbations doesnot alter our conclusion that the accelerating expansion of the universe cannotbe explained by superhorizon modes.

astro-ph;0507108	ellipticity of dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy weak lensing	we present the results of attempts to detect the ellipticity of dark matterhalos using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with sdss data. we use 2,020,256galaxies brighter than r=19 with photometric redshifts (divided into colour andluminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. we search forand identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to aspurious detection. these include systematic shear that leads to a slightspurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (dueto contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens sourcepairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. we develop methods that allow us toremove these contaminants to the signal. we split the analysis into blue(spiral) and red (elliptical) galaxies. assuming gaussian errors as in previouswork and a power-law profile, we find f_h=e_h/e_g=0.1+/-0.06 for red galaxiesand -0.8+/-0.4 for blue galaxies using 20-300 kpc/h, averaged over luminosity.inclusion of the more realistic non-gaussian error distributions and of the nfwdensity profile (which predicts much smaller ellipticity of the shear forscales above the scale radius) yields 0.60+/-0.38 for ellipticals and-1.4+1.7-2.0 for spirals. while there is no concrete detection of alignment ineither case, there is a suggestion in the data of a positive alignment in thebrightest lens sample of ellipticals. our results appear to be mildlyinconsistent with a previously reported detection by hoekstra et al. (2004),but more data and further tests are needed to clarify whether the discrepancyis real or a consequence of differences in the lens galaxy samples used andanalysis methods.

astro-ph;0507203	pairwise velocities in the halo model: luminosity and scale dependence	we investigate the properties of the pairwise velocity dispersion as afunction of galaxy luminosity in the context of a halo model. we derive thedistribution of velocities of pairs at a given separation taking into accountboth one-halo and two-halo contributions. we show that pairwise velocitydistribution in real space is a complicated mixture of host-satellite,satellite-satellite and two-halo pairs. the peak value is reached at around1$h^{-1}$mpc and does not reflect the velocity dispersion of a typical halohosting these galaxies, but is instead dominated by the satellite-satellitepairs in high mass clusters. this is true even for cross-correlations betweenbins separated in luminosity. as a consequence the velocity dispersion at agiven separation can decrease with luminosity, even if the underlying typicalhalo host mass is increasing, in agreement with recent observations. we compareour findings to numerical simulations and find a good agreement. numericalsimulations also suggest a luminosity dependent velocity bias, which depends onthe subhalo mass. we develop models of the auto- and cross-correlation functionof luminosity subsamples of galaxies in the observable $r_\proj - \pi$ spaceand calculate the inferred velocity dispersion as a function of wave vector ifdispersion model is fit to the redshift space power spectrum. we find that soderived pairwise velocity dispersion also exhibits a bump at $k\sim 1 h/{\rmmpc}$.

astro-ph;0508293	detectability of tensor modes in the presence of foregrounds	in inflationary models, gravitational waves are produced and generate b-typepolarization in the cmb. since b polarization is only generated by gravitywaves it does not suffer from the cosmic variance. a perfect decomposition ofthe cmb into b-modes and e-modes would require data from the entire sky, whichin practice is not possible because of the foreground contaminants. this leadsto mixing of e polarization into b, which introduces cosmic variance conta-mination of b polarization and reduces sensitivity to gravity wave amplitudeeven in absence of detector noise. we present numerical results for theuncertainty in the tensor-to-scalar ratio using the fisher matrix formalism forvarious resolutions, using foreground models based on dust maps and assuming 90ghz operating frequency. we find that the usual scaling delta(t/s) ~f_sky^(-1/2) is significantly degraded and becomes delta(t/s) ~ f_sky^(-2) forf_sky&gt;0.7. this dependence is affected only weakly by the choice of sky cuts.to achieve a t/s=10^(-3) detection at 3 sigma one needs to observe 15% of thesky as opposed to naive expectation of 0.3%. to prevent contamination over thislarge sky area at required level one must be able to remove polarized dustemission at or better than 0.1% of unpolarized intensity, assuming the cleanestpart of the sky has been chosen. to achieve t/s=10^(-4) detection at 3 sigmaone needs to observe 70% of the sky, which is only possible if dust emission isremoved everywhere over this region at 0.01% level. reaching t/s=10^(-2) shouldbe easier: 1% of the sky is needed over which polarized emission needs to beremoved at 1% of total intensity if the cleanest region is chosen. theseresults suggest that foreground contamination may make it difficult to achievelevels below t/s=10^(-3).

astro-ph;0509026	detection of large scale intrinsic ellipticity-density correlation from  the sloan digital sky survey and implications for weak lensing surveys	the power spectrum of weak lensing shear caused by large-scale structure isan emerging tool for precision cosmology, in particular for measuring theeffects of dark energy on the growth of structure at low redshift. onepotential source of systematic error is intrinsic alignments of ellipticitiesof neighbouring galaxies (ii correlation) that could mimic the correlations dueto lensing. a related possibility pointed out by hirata and seljak (2004) iscorrelation between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the densityfield responsible for gravitational lensing shear (gi correlation). we presentconstraints on both the ii and gi correlations using 265 908 spectroscopicgalaxies from the sdss, and using galaxies as tracers of the mass in the caseof the gi analysis. the availability of redshifts in the sdss allows us toselect galaxies at small radial separations, which both reduces noise in theintrinsic alignment measurement and suppresses galaxy- galaxy lensing (whichotherwise swamps the gi correlation). while we find no detection of the iicorrelation, our results are nonetheless statistically consistent with recentdetections found using the supercosmos survey. in contrast, we have a cleardetection of gi correlation in galaxies brighter than l* that persists to thelargest scales probed (60 mpc/h) and with a sign predicted by theoreticalmodels. this correlation could cause the existing lensing surveys at z~1 tounderestimate the linear amplitude of fluctuations by as much as 20% dependingon the source sample used, while for surveys at z~0.5 the underestimation mayreach 30%.

astro-ph;0511164	galaxy halo masses and satellite fractions from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the sdss: stellar mass, luminosity, morphology, and environment dependencies	the relationship between galaxies and dark matter can be characterized by thehalo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that aresatellites. here we present observational constraints from the sdss on thesequantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass usinggalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351,507 lenses. we use stellarmasses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weakgravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in thehalo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. we find that an l*galaxy with a stellar mass of 6x10^{10} m_{sun} is hosted by a halo with massof 1.4x10^{12} m_{sun}/h, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversionefficiencies of 17_{-5}^{+10} (early types) and 16_{-6}^{+15} (late types) percent at the 95 per cent cl (statistical, not including systematic uncertaintydue to assumption of a universal initial mass function, or imf). we find thatfor a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology belowm_{stellar}=10^{11} m_{sun}, in contrast to typically a factor of twodifference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity.this suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range andshould be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed.for higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function ofstellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early and late typesbecome larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster halos withmasses above 10^{13} m_{sun} host ellipticals at the center, while even thebrightest central spirals are hosted by halos of mass below 10^{13} m_{sun}.(abridged)

astro-ph;0604143	b polarization of cosmic microwave background as a tracer of strings	string models can produce successful inflationary scenarios in the context ofbrane collisions and in many of these models cosmic strings may also beproduced. in scenarios such as kklmmt the string contribution is naturallypredicted to be well below the inflationary signal for cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) temperature anisotropies, in agreement with the existinglimits. we find that for $b$ type polarization of cmb the situation is reversedand the dominant signal comes from vector modes generated by cosmic strings,which exceeds the gravity wave signal from both inflation and strings. thesignal can be detected for a broad range of parameter space: futurepolarization experiments may be able to detect the string signal down to thestring tension $g\mu=10^{-9}$, although foregrounds and lensing are likely toworsen these limits. we argue that the optimal scale to search for the stringsignature is at $\ell\sim 1000$, but in models with high optical depth thesignal from reionization peak at large scales is also significant. the shape ofthe power spectrum allows one to distinguish the string signature from thegravity waves from inflation, but only with a sufficiently high angularresolution experiment

astro-ph;0703114	a robust lower limit on the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the  universe from cluster abundance and weak lensing	cluster abundance measurements are among the most sensitive probes of theamplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe, which in turn can helpconstrain other cosmological parameters, like the dark energy equation of stateor neutrino mass. however, difficulties in calibrating the relation between thecluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,make this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. here weargue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on thestacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude offluctuations. the method compares the average weak lensing signal measuredaround the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that theclusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimummass threshold. if the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limitingvalue, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoreticalprediction falls below the observations. since any effects that modify themodel assumptions can only decrease the theoretical prediction, the limitingamplitude becomes a robust lower limit. here, we apply it to a volume limitedsample of 16,000 group/cluster candidates identified from isolated luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find $\sigma_8(\omega_m/0.25)^{0.5}&gt;0.62$ at the 95% c.l. after taking into accountobservational errors in the lensing analysis. while this is a relatively weakconstraint, both the scatter in the lrg luminosity-halo mass relation and thelensing errors are large; the constraints could improve considerably in thefuture with more sophisticated cluster identification algorithms and smallererrors in the lensing analysis.

astro-ph;9406050	a two-fluid approximation for calculating the cosmic microwave  background anisotropies	we present a simple, yet accurate approximation for calculating the cosmicmicrowave background anisotropy power spectrum in adiabatic models. it consistsof solving for the evolution of a two-fluid model until the epoch ofrecombination and then integrating over the sources to obtain the cmbanisotropy power spectrum. the approximation is useful both for a physicalunderstanding of cmb anisotropies, as well as for a quantitative analysis ofcosmological models. comparison with exact calculations shows that the accuracyis typically better than 20 percent over a large range of angles andcosmological models, including those with curvature and cosmological constant.using this approximation we investigate the dependence of the cmb anisotropieson the cosmological parameters. we identify six dimensionless parameters thatuniquely determine the anisotropy power spectrum within our approximation. cmbexperiments on different angular scales could in principle provide informationon all these parameters. in particular, mapping of the doppler peaks wouldallow an independent determination of baryon mass density, matter mass densityand hubble constant.

astro-ph;9603033	a line of sight approach to cosmic microwave background anisotropies	we present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photonpast light cone. in this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as atime integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. thegeometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on theparticular cosmological model. the source term can be expressed in terms ofphoton, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using asmall number of differential equations. this split clearly separates betweenthe dynamical and geometrical effects on the cmb anisotropies. moreimportantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time comparedto standard methods. this is achieved because the source term, which depends onthe model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is aslowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a smallnumber of points. the geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly thanthe source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputedin advance. standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require amuch higher number of evaluations. the new method leads to about two orders ofmagnitude reduction in cpu time when compared to standard methods and typicallyrequires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. the method shouldbe especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parametersfrom cmb anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possiblewith the next generation of experiments. a programm implementing this methodcan be obtained from the authors.

astro-ph;9608131	measuring polarization in cosmic microwave background	polarization induced by cosmological scalar perturbations leads to a typicalanisotropy pattern, which can best be analyzed in fourier domain. this allowsone to unambiguously distinguish cosmological signal of polarization from otherforegrounds and systematics, as well as from polarization induced by non-scalarperturbations. the precision with which polarization and cross-correlationpower spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise andforeground residuals. choice of estimator can significantly improve ourcapability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limitthe optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of twocompared to the simplest estimator. if foreground residuals are important thena different estimator can be used, which eliminates systematic effects fromforegrounds so that no further foreground subtraction is needed. a particularcombination of stokes $q$ and $u$ parameters vanishes for scalar inducedpolarization, thereby allowing an unambiguous determination of tensor modes.theoretical predictions of polarization in standard models show that onetypically expects a signal at the level of 5-10$\mu$k on small angular scalesand around 1$\mu$k on large scales ($l&lt;200$). satellite missions should be ableto reach sensitivities needed for an unambiguous detection of polarization,which would help to break the degeneracies in the determination of some of thecosmological parameters.

0810.0323	how to measure redshift-space distortions without sample variance	we show how to use multiple tracers of large-scale density with differentbiases to measure the redshift-space distortion parameterbeta=f/b=(dlnd/dlna)/b (where d is the growth rate and a the expansion factor),to a much better precision than one could achieve with a single tracer, to anarbitrary precision in the low noise limit. in combination with the powerspectrum of the tracers this allows a much more precise measurement of thebias-free velocity divergence power spectrum, f^2 p_m - in fact, in the lownoise limit f^2 p_m can be measured as well as would be possible if velocitydivergence was observed directly, with rms improvement factor ~[5.2(beta^2+2beta+2)/beta^2]^0.5 (e.g., ~10 times better than a single tracer for beta=0.4).this would allow a high precision determination of f d as a function ofredshift with an error as low as 0.1%. we find up to two orders of magnitudeimprovement in figure of merit for the dark energy equation of state relativeto stage ii, a factor of several better than other proposed stage iv darkenergy surveys. the ratio b_2/b_1 will be determined with an even greaterprecision than beta, producing, when measured as a function of scale, anexquisitely sensitive probe of the onset of non-linear bias. we also extend inmore detail previous work on the use of the same technique to measurenon-gaussianity. currently planned redshift surveys are typically designed withsignal to noise of unity on scales of interest, and are not optimized for thistechnique. our results suggest that this strategy may need to be revisited asthere are large gains to be achieved from surveys with higher number densitiesof galaxies.

0811.2748	scale-dependent bias induced by local non-gaussianity: a comparison to  n-body simulations	we investigate the effect of primordial non-gaussianity of the local f_nltype on the auto- and cross-power spectrum of dark matter haloes usingsimulations of the lcdm cosmology. we perform a series of large n-bodysimulations of both positive and negative f_nl, spanning the range between 10and 100. theoretical models predict a scale-dependent bias correction \deltab(k,f_nl) that depends on the linear halo bias b(m). we measure the powerspectra for a range of halo mass and redshifts covering the relevant range ofexisting galaxy and quasar populations. we show that auto and cross-correlationanalyses of bias are consistent with each other. we find that for lowwavenumbers with k&lt;0.03 h/mpc the theory and the simulations agree well witheach other for biased haloes with b(m)&gt;1.5. we show that a scale-independentbias correction improves the comparison between theory and simulations onsmaller scales, where the scale-dependent effect rapidly becomes negligible.the current limits on f_nl from slosar et al. (2008) come mostly from verylarge scales k&lt;0.01 h/mpc and, therefore, remain valid. for the halo sampleswith b(m)&lt;1.5-2 we find that the scale- dependent bias from non-gaussianityactually exceeds the theoretical predictions. our results are consistent withthe bias correction scaling linearly with f_nl.
