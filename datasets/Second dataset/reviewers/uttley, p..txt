0905.1981	correlation and time delays of the x-ray and optical emission of the  seyfert galaxy ngc3783	we present simultaneous x-ray and optical b and v band light curves of theseyfert galaxy ngc3783 spanning 2 years. the flux in all bands is highlyvariable and the fluctuations are significantly correlated. as shown before bystirpe et al. the optical bands vary simultaneously, with a delay of less than1.5 days but both b and v bands lag the x-ray fluctuations by 3-9 days. thisdelay points at optical variability produced by x-ray reprocessing and thevalue of the lag places the reprocessor close to the broad line region. a powerspectrum analysis of the light curve, however, shows that the x-ray variabilityhas a power law shape bending to a steeper slope at a time-scale ~2.9 dayswhile the variability amplitude in the optical bands continues to grow towardsthe longest time-scale covered, ~ 300 days. we show that the power spectratogether with the small value of the time delay is inconsistent with a picturewhere all the optical variability is produced by x-ray reprocessing, though thesmall amplitude, rapid optical fluctuations might be produced in this way. wedetect larger variability amplitudes on long time-scales in the optical bandsthan in the x-rays. this behaviour adds to similar results recently obtainedfor at least three other agn and indicates a separate source of long termoptical variability, possibly accretion rate or thermal fluctuations in theoptically emitting accretion disc.

0905.4383	the detection of broad iron k and l line emission in the narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 using xmm-newton	since the discovery of the first broad iron-k line in 1995 from the seyfertgalaxy mcg--6-30-15, broad iron-k lines have been found in several otherseyfert galaxies, from accreting stellar mass black holes and even fromaccreting neutron stars. the iron-k line is prominent in the reflectionspectrum created by the hard x-ray continuum irradiating dense accretingmatter. relativistic distortion of the line makes it sensitive to the stronggravity and spin of the black hole. the accompanying iron-l line emissionshould be detectable when the iron abundance is high. here we report the firstdiscovery of both iron-k and l emission, using xmm-newton observations of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495. the bright fe-l emission has enabledus, for the first time, to detect a reverberation lag of 30 s between thedirect x-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the hole.the observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing timeof the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. the combination ofspectral and timing data on 1h0707-495 provides strong evidence that we arewitnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction ofa light-minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly-spinning, massive blackhole.

0910.0367	broad iron l-line and x-ray reverberation in 1h0707-495	a detailed analysis of a long xmm-newton observation of the narrow lineseyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 is presented, including spectral fitting, spectralvariability and timing studies. the two main features in the spectrum are thedrop at ~ 7 kev and a complex excess below 1 kev. these are well described bytwo broad, k and l, iron lines. alternative models based on absorption,although they may fit the high energy drop, cannot account for the 1 kevcomplexity and the spectrum as a whole. spectral variability shows that thespectrum is composed of at least two components, which are interpreted as apower-law dominating between 1-4 kev, and a reflection component outside thisrange. the high count rate at the iron l energies has enabled us to measure asignificant soft lag of ~ 30 s between 0.3-1 and 1-4 kev, meaning that thedirect hard emission leads the reflected emissions. we interpret the lag as areverberation signal originating within a few gravitational radii of the blackhole.

0911.1003	relativistic disc reflection in the extreme nls1 iras13224-3809	we present a spectral variability study of the xmm-newton and suzakuobservations of one of the most extreme narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies,iras13224-3809. the x-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiarfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 kev and ii)a deep drop in flux above 8.2 kev. we focus here on a reflection-basedinterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large softexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.we show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can bereproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to fe k and fe l. the linesare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistentdisc parameters. we argue that the high l/k intensity ratio is broadlyconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,indicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. thespectral shape, x-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in thexmm-newton and suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart. the overallx-ray spectrum and variability can be described by a simple two-component modelcomprising a steep power law continuum plus its ionised reflection off theinner accretion disc. in this model, a rapidly rotating kerr black hole and asteep emissivity profile are required to describe the data. the simultaneousdetection of broad relativistic fe l and k lines in iras 13224-3809 followsthat in another extreme nls1 galaxy, 1h0707-495. although the data quality foriras13224-3809 does not allow us to rule out competing models as in 1h0707-495,we show here that our reflection-based interpretation describes in aself-consistent manner the available data and points towards iras13224-3809being a very close relative of 1h0707-495 in terms of both spectral andvariability properties.

0912.0544	twelve years of x-ray and optical variability in the seyfert galaxy ngc  4051	we discuss the origin of the optical variations in the narrow line seyfert 1galaxy ngc 4051 and present the results of a cross-correlation study usingx-ray and optical light curves spanning more than 12 years. the emission ishighly variable in all wavebands, and the amplitude of the optical variationsis found to be smaller than that of the x-rays, even after correcting for thecontaminating host galaxy flux falling inside the photometric aperture. theoptical power spectrum is best described by an unbroken power law model withslope $\alpha=1.4^{+0.6}_{-0.2}$ and displays lower variability power than the2-10 kev x-rays on all time-scales probed. we find the light curves to besignificantly correlated at an optical delay of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.3}$ days behindthe x-rays. this time-scale is consistent with the light travel time to theoptical emitting region of the accretion disc, suggesting that the opticalvariations are driven by x-ray reprocessing. we show, however, that a modelwhereby the optical variations arise from reprocessing by a flat accretion disccannot account for all the optical variability. there is also a secondsignificant peak in the cross-correlation function, at an optical delay of$39^{+2.7}_{-8.4}$ days. the lag is consistent with the dust sublimation radiusin this source, suggesting that there is a measurable amount of optical fluxcoming from the dust torus. we discuss the origin of the additional opticalflux in terms of reprocessing of x-rays and reflection of optical light by thedust.

1010.3744	understanding reverberation lags in 1h0707-495	the first reverberation lag from the vicinity of a supermassive black holewas recently detected in the nls1 galaxy 1h0707-495. we interpreted the lag asbeing due to reflection from matter close to the black hole, within a fewgravitational radii of the event horizon (an inner reflector). it has sincebeen claimed by miller et al that the lag can be produced by more distantmatter, at hundreds of gravitational radii (an outer reflector). here, wecritically explore their interpretation of the lag. the detailed energydependence of the time lags between soft and hard energy bands is well modelledby an inner reflector using our previously published spectral model. a contraryclaim by miller et al was obtained by neglecting the blackbody component in thesoft band. soft lags can be produced by a large-scale outer reflector ifseveral, implausible, conditions are met. an additional transfer function isrequired in the soft band corresponding to a region that is physically close tothe continuum source, or lies close to our line of sight and subtends a smallsolid angle at the source, challenging the production of the observed spectrum.we show that the original inner reflector interpretation of reverberation veryclose to the black hole provides a self-consistent and robust model whichexplains the energy spectrum and timing properties, including the time delays,power spectra and the shape of the coherence function. several of theseproperties are opposite to the predictions from a simple large-scale outerreflection model.

0709.0262	discovery of multiple lorentzian components in the x-ray timing  properties of the narrow line seyfert 1 ark 564	we present a power spectral analysis of a 100 ksec xmm-newton observation ofthe narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ark~564. when combined with earlier rxte andasca observations, these data produce a power spectrum covering seven decadesof frequency which is well described by a power law with two very clear breaks.this shape is unlike the power spectra of almost all other agn observed so far,which have only one detected break, and resemble galactic binary systems in asoft state. the power spectrum can also be well described by the sum of twolorentzian-shaped components, the one at higher frequencies having a hardspectrum, similar to those seen in galactic binary systems. previously we havedemonstrated that the lag of the hard band variations relative to the soft bandin ark 564 is dependent on variability time-scale, as seen in galactic binarysources. here we show that the time-scale dependence of the lags can bedescribed well using the same two-lorentzian model which describes the powerspectrum, assuming that each lorentzian component has a distinct time lag. thusall x-ray timing evidence points strongly to two discrete, localised, regionsas the origin of most of the variability. similar behaviour is seen in galacticx-ray binary systems in most states other than the soft state, i.e. in thelow-hard and intermediate/very high states. given the very high accretion rateof ark 564 the closest analogy is with the very high (intermediate) staterather than the low-hard state. we therefore strengthen the comparison betweenagn and galactic binary sources beyond previous studies by extending it to thepreviously poorly studied very high accretion rate regime.

1011.6321	quasi-periodic oscillations in xte j1550-564: the rms-flux relation	we present an analysis of the short timescale variations in the properties ofthe strong (type "c") quasi-periodic oscillation observed in xte j1550-564during its 1998 outburst. in particular, the qpo shows a correlation betweenabsolute rms amplitude and mean source flux over timescales shorter than ~ 3ksec. a linear rms-flux relation has been observed to be a common property ofbroad-band noise but here we report the first detection of rms-flux dependencein a qpo. the gradient of the rms-flux relation is correlated with the qpo peakfrequency: from a strong positive correlation when the qpo peak frequency isbelow ~ 4 hz, through no correlation, to a strong negative correlation when thepeak frequency is above 6 hz. this is the first time a negative short termrms-flux relation has been observed in any component of the power spectrum.previous work on both the broad-band noise and qpos in a range of sources havesuggested the presence of a filter reducing the amplitude of qpos withincreasing frequency. we attempt to remove the possible effects of this filterand find that the previously negative rms-flux relations above ~ 5 hz becomeconstant.

1101.1802	the rapid x-ray variability of ngc 4051	we present an analysis of the high frequency x-ray variability of ngc 4051(m_bh ~ 1.7*10^6 m_sun) based on a series of xmm-newton observations taken in2009 with a total exposure of ~570 ks (epic pn). these data reveal the form ofthe power spectrum over frequencies from 10^-4 hz, below the previouslydetected power spectral break, to &gt; 10^-2 hz, above the frequency of theinnermost stable circular orbit (isco) around the black hole (nu_isco ~ 10^-3 -10^-2 hz, depending on the black hole spin parameter j). this is equivalent toprobing frequencies &gt;1 khz in a stellar mass (m_bh ~ 10 msun) black hole binarysystem. the power spectrum is a featureless power law over the region of theexpected isco frequency, suggesting no strong enhancement or change in thevariability at the fastest orbital period in the system. despite the hugeamplitude of the flux variations between the observations (peak-to-peak factorof &gt;50) the power spectrum appears to be stationary in shape, and varies inamplitude at all observed frequencies following the previously establishedlinear rms-flux relation. the rms-flux relation is offset in flux by a smalland energy-dependent amount. the simplest interpretation of the offset is interms of a very soft spectral component that is practically constant (comparedto the primary source of variability). one possible origin for this emission isa circumnuclear shock energised by a radiatively driven outflow from thecentral regions, and emitting via inverse-compton scattering of the centralengine's optical-uv continuum (as inferred from a separate analysis of theenergy spectrum). a comparison with the power spectrum of a long xmm-newtonobservation taken in 2001 gives only weak evidence for non-stationarity inpower spectral shape or amplitude.

1104.1053	the connection between radio-loudness and central surface brightness  profiles in optically-selected low-luminosity active galaxies	recent results indicate a correlation between nuclear radio-loudness ofactive galaxies and their central stellar surface-brightness profiles, in that`core' galaxies (with inner logarithmic slope {\gamma}&lt;0.3) are significantlymore radio loud than `power-law' galaxies ({\gamma}&gt;0.5). this connection,which indicates possible links between radio-loudness and galaxy formationhistory (e.g. through black hole spin) has so far only been confirmed for aradio-selected sample of galaxies. furthermore, it has since been shown thatthe nuker law, which was used to parameterise the brightness profiles in thesestudies, gives a poor description of the brightness profile. here, we presentan analysis of the central surface brightness profiles of the active galaxiesof hubble type t&lt;3, that were identified by the optically-selected palomarspectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies. we fit the brightness profiles usingsersic, core-sersic and, where necessary, double-sersic models, which we fit tothe semi-major axis brightness profiles extracted from high resolution imagesof the galaxies from the hubble space telescope (hst). we use these fits toclassify the galaxies as `core', `sersic' or `double-sersic' and compare thisclassification with the properties of the active galactic nuclei (agns). wefind that agn hosted in core galaxies are generally more radio-loud than thosehosted in sersic galaxies, although there is a large overlap between the twosubsamples. the correlation between radio-loudness and brightness profile canpartly be explained by a correlation between radio-loudness and black holemass. additionally, there is a significant (99 per cent confidence) partialcorrelation between radio-loudness and the core/sersic classification of thehost galaxy, which lends support to the previous results based on theradio-selected sample.

1201.0196	discovery of a relation between black hole mass and soft x-ray time lags  in active galactic nuclei	we carried out a systematic analysis of time lags between x-ray energy bandsin a large sample (32 sources) of unabsorbed, radio quiet active galacticnuclei (agn), observed by xmm-newton. the analysis of x-ray lags (up to thehighest/shortest frequencies/time-scales), is performed in thefourier-frequency domain, between energy bands where the soft excess (softband) and the primary power law (hard band) dominate the emission. we report atotal of 15 out of 32 sources displaying a high frequency soft lag in theirlight curves. all 15 are at a significance level exceeding 97 per cent and 11are at a level exceeding 99 per cent. of these soft lags, 7 have not beenpreviously reported in the literature, thus this work significantly increasesthe number of known sources with a soft/negative lag. the characteristictime-scales of the soft/negative lag are relatively short (with typicalfrequencies and amplitudes of \nu\sim 0.07-4 \times 10^{-3} hz and \tau\sim10-600 s, respectively), and show a highly significant (\gsim 4\sigma)correlation with the black hole mass. the measured correlations indicate thatsoft lags are systematically shifted to lower frequencies and higher absoluteamplitudes as the mass of the source increases. to first approximation, all thesources in the sample are consistent with having similar mass-scaled lagproperties. these results strongly suggest the existence of a mass-scaling lawfor the soft/negative lag, that holds for agn spanning a large range of masses(about 2.5 orders of magnitude), thus supporting the idea that soft lagsoriginate in the innermost regions of agn and are powerful tools for testingtheir physics and geometry.

1202.1184	correlated x-ray/ultraviolet/optical variability in the very low mass  agn ngc 4395	we report the results of a one year swift x-ray/uv/optical programmemonitoring the dwarf seyfert nucleus in ngc 4395 in 2008-2009. the uv/opticalflux from the nucleus was found to vary dramatically over the monitoringperiod, with a similar pattern of variation in each of the observed uv/opticalbands (spanning 1900 - 5500 {\aa}). in particular, the luminosity of ngc 4395in the 1900 {\aa} band changed by more than a factor of eight over themonitoring period. the fractional variability was smaller in the uv/opticalbands than that seen in the x-rays, with the x-ray/optical ratio increasingwith increasing flux. pseudo-instantaneous flux measurements in the x-ray andeach uv/optical band were well correlated, with cross correlation coefficientsof &gt;0.7, significant at 99.9 per cent confidence. archival swift observationsfrom 2006 sample the intra-day x-ray/optical variability on ngc 4395. thesearchival data show a very strong correlation between the x-ray and b bands,with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.84 (significant at &gt;99 per centconfidence). the peak in the cross correlation function is marginally resolvedand asymmetric, suggesting that x-rays lead the b band, but by 1 hour. inresponse to recent (august 2011) very high x-ray flux levels from ngc4395 wetriggered swift too observations, which sample the intra-hour x-ray/uvvariability. these observations indicate, albeit with large uncertainties, alag of the 1900 {\aa} band behind the x-ray flux of ~400 s. the tightcorrelation between the x-ray and uv/optical lightcurves, together with theconstraints we place on lag time-scale are consistent with the uv/opticalvariability of ngc 4395 being primarily due to reprocessing of x-ray photons bythe accretion disc.

1202.5877	the ubiquity of the rms-flux relation in black hole x-ray binaries	we have investigated the short term linear relation between the rmsvariability and the flux in 1,961 observations of 9 black hole x-ray binaries.the rms-flux relation for the 1-10 hz range is ubiquitously observed in anyobservation with good variability signal to noise (&gt; 3 % 1-10 hz fractionalrms). this concurs with results from a previous study of cygnus x-1 (gleissneret. al. 2004), and extends detection of the rms-flux relation to a wider rangeof states. we find a strong dependence of the flux intercept of the rms-fluxrelation on source state; as the source transitions from the hard state intothe hard intermediate state the intercept becomes strongly positive. we findlittle evidence for flux dependence of the broad-band noise within the psdshape, excepting a small subset of observations from one object in an anomaloussoft-state. we speculate that the ubiquitous linear rms-flux relation in thebroad band noise of this sample, representing a range of different states andobjects, indicates that its formation mechanism is an essential property of theluminous accretion flow around black holes.

1208.6236	accretion flow diagnostics with x-ray spectral-timing: the hard state of  swift j1753.5-0127	(abridged) recent xmm-newton studies of x-ray variability in the hard statesof black hole x-ray binaries (bhxrbs) imply that the variability is generatedin the 'standard' optically-thick accretion disc. the variability originates inthe disc as mass-accretion fluctuations and propagates through the disc to'light up' inner disc regions, eventually modulating the power-law emissionthat is produced relatively centrally.  we present a comparative spectral-timing study of xmm-newton data from thebhxrb swift j1753.5-0127 in a bright 2009 hard state with that from thesignificantly fainter 2006 hard state, to show for the first time the change indisc spectral-timing properties associated with a global increase in both theaccretion rate and the relative contribution of the disc emission to thebolometric luminosity.  we show that, although there is strong evidence for intrinsic discvariability in the more luminous hard state, the disc variability amplitude issuppressed relative to that of the power-law emission, which contrasts with thebehaviour at lower luminosities where the disc variability is slightly enhancedwhen compared with the power-law variations. in the higher-luminosity data, thedisc variability below 0.6 kev becomes incoherent with the power-law andhigher-energy disc emission at frequencies below 0.5 hz, in contrast with thecoherent variations seen in the 2006 data.  we explain these differences and the associated complex lags in the 2009 datain terms of the fluctuating disc model. if the variable signals are generatedat small radii in the disc, the variability of disc emission can be naturallysuppressed by the fraction of unmodulated disc emission from larger radii. thedrop in coherence can be produced by disc accretion fluctuations arising atlarger radii which are viscously damped and hence unable to propagate to theinner, power-law emitting region.

1210.7874	a soft x-ray reverberation lag in the agn eso 113-g010	reverberation lags have recently been discovered in a handful of nearby,variable agn. here, we analyze a ~100 ksec archival xmm-newton observation ofthe highly variable agn, eso 113-g010 in order to search for lags between hard,1.5 - 4.5 kev, and soft, 0.3 - 0.9 kev, energy x-ray bands. at the lowestfrequencies available in the lightcurve (&lt;1.5e-4 hz), we find hard lags wherethe power-law dominated hard band lags the soft band (where the reflectionfraction is high). however, at higher frequencies in the range (2-3)e-4 hz wefind a soft lag of -325 +/- 89 s. the general evolution from hard to soft lagsas the frequency increases is similar to other agn where soft lags have beendetected. we interpret this soft lag as due to reverberation from the accretiondisk, with the reflection component responding to variability from the x-raycorona. for a black hole mass of 7e6 m(solar) this corresponds to alight-crossing time of ~9 r_g/c, however, dilution effects mean that theintrinsic lag is likely longer than this. based on recent black holemass-scaling for lag properties, the lag amplitude and frequency are moreconsistent with a black hole a few times more massive than the best estimates,though flux-dependent effects could easily add scatter this large.

1301.1924	revealing the x-ray source in iras 13224-3809 through flux-dependent  reverberation lags	iras 13224-3809 was observed in 2011 for 500 ks with the xmm-newtonobservatory. we detect highly significant x-ray lags between soft (0.3 - 1 kev)and hard (1.2 - 5 kev) energies. the hard band lags the soft at low frequencies(i.e. hard lag), while the opposite (i.e. soft lag) is observed at highfrequencies. in this paper, we study the lag during flaring and quiescentperiods. we find that the frequency and absolute amplitude of the soft lag isdifferent during high-flux and low-flux periods. during the low flux intervals,the soft lag is detected at higher frequencies and with smaller amplitude.assuming that the soft lag is associated with the light travel time betweenprimary and reprocessed emission, this behaviour suggests that the x-ray sourceis more compact during low-flux intervals, and irradiates smaller radii of theaccretion disc (likely because of light bending effects). we continue with aninvestigation of the lag dependence on energy, and find that isolating thelow-flux periods reveals a strong lag signature at the fe k line energy,similar to results found using 1.3 ms of data on another well known narrow-lineseyfert i galaxy, 1h0707-495.

1310.0822	hard x-ray lags in active galactic nuclei: testing the distant  reverberation hypothesis with ngc 6814	we present an x-ray spectral and temporal analysis of the variable activegalaxy ngc 6814, observed with suzaku during november 2011. remarkably, thex-ray spectrum shows no evidence for the soft excess commonly observed amongstother active galaxies, despite its relatively low level of obscuration, and isdominated across the whole suzaku bandpass by the intrinsic powerlaw-likecontinuum. despite this, we clearly detect the presence of a low frequency hardlag of ~1600s between the 0.5-2.0 and 2.0-5.0 kev energy bands at greater than6-sigma significance, similar to those reported in the literature for a varietyof other agn. at these energies, any additional emission from e.g. a very weak,undetected soft excess, or from distant reflection must contribute less than 3%of the observed countrates (at 90% confidence). given the lack of anysignificant continuum emission component other than the powerlaw, we can ruleout models that invoke distant reprocessing for the observed lag behavior,which must instead be associated with this continuum emission. these resultsare fully consistent with a propagating fluctuation origin for the lowfrequency hard lags, and with the interpretation of the high frequency softlags - a common feature seen in the highest quality agn data with strong softexcesses - as reverberation from the inner accretion disk.

1311.2997	modelling the broad fe k\alpha\ reverberation in the agn ngc 4151	the recent detection of x-ray reverberation lags, especially in the fek\alpha\ line region, around active galactic nuclei (agn) has opened up thepossibility of studying the time-resolved response (reflection) of hard x-raysfrom the accretion disk around supermassive black holes. here, we use generalrelativistic transfer functions for reflection of x-rays from a point sourcelocated at some height above the black hole to study the time lags expected asa function of frequency and energy in the fe k\alpha\ line region. we explorethe models and the dependence of the lags on key parameters such as the heightof the x-ray source, accretion disk inclination, black hole spin and black holemass. we then compare these models with the observed frequency and energydependence of the fe k\alpha\ line lag in ngc 4151. assuming the opticalreverberation mapping mass of $4.6\times10^7~m_\odot$ we get a best fit to thelag profile across the fe k\alpha\ line in the frequency range$(1-2)\times10^{-5}$ hz for an x-ray source located at a height $h =7^{+2.9}_{-2.6}~r_g$ with a maximally spinning black hole and an inclination $i&lt; 30^\circ$.

1405.2026	inclination-dependent spectral and timing properties in transient black  hole x-ray binaries	we use a simple one-dimensional parameterisation of timing properties to showthat hard and hard-intermediate state transient black hole x-ray binaries withthe same power-spectral shape have systematically harder x-ray power-lawemission in higher-inclination systems. we also show that the power-spectralshape and amplitude of the broadband noise (with low-frequency quasi-periodicoscillations, qpos, removed) is independent of inclination, confirming that itis well-correlated with the intrinsic structure of the emitting regions andthat the "type c" qpo, which is inclination-dependent, has a different originto the noise, probably geometric. our findings suggest that the power-lawemission originates in a corona which is flattened in the plane of the disc,and not in a jet-like structure which would lead to softer spectra at higherinclinations. however, there is tentative evidence that theinclination-dependence of spectral shape breaks down deeper into the hardstate. this suggests either a change in the coronal geometry and possibleevidence for contribution from jet emission, or alternatively an even moreoptically thin flow in these states.

1405.6575	x-ray reverberation around accreting black holes	luminous accreting stellar mass and supermassive black holes producepower-law continuum x-ray emission from a compact central corona. reverberationtime lags occur due to light travel time-delays between changes in the directcoronal emission and corresponding variations in its reflection from theaccretion flow. reverberation is detectable using light curves made indifferent x-ray energy bands, since the direct and reflected components havedifferent spectral shapes. larger, lower frequency, lags are also seen and areidentified with propagation of fluctuations through the accretion flow andassociated corona. we review the evidence for x-ray reverberation in activegalactic nuclei and black hole x-ray binaries, showing how it can be bestmeasured and how it may be modelled. the timescales and energy-dependence ofthe high frequency reverberation lags show that much of the signal isoriginating from very close to the black hole in some objects, within a fewgravitational radii of the event horizon. we consider how these signals can bestudied in the future to carry out x-ray reverberation mapping of the regionsclosest to black holes.

0807.4806	on the evidence for narrow, relativistically shifted x-ray lines	in recent years there have been many reported detections of highly redshiftedor blueshifted narrow spectral lines (both emission or absorption) in the x-rayspectra of active galaxies, but these are all modest detections in terms oftheir statistical significance. the aim of this paper is to review the issue ofthe significance of these detections and, in particular, take account ofpublication bias. a literature search revealed 38 reported detections ofnarrow, strongly shifted (v/c &gt;= 0.05) x-ray lines in the 1.5-20 kev spectra ofseyfert galaxies and quasars. these published data show a close, linearrelationship between the estimated line strength and its uncertainty, in thesense that better observations (with smaller uncertainties) only ever show thesmallest lines. this result is consistent with many of the reported lines beingfalse detections resulting from random fluctuations, drawn from a large body ofdata and filtered by publication bias such that only the most `significant'fluctuations are ever reported. the reality of many of these features, andcertainly their prevalence in the population at large, therefore remains anopen question that is best settled though uniform analysis (and reporting) ofhigher quality observations.

astro-ph;0005433	x-ray and optical variability in ngc 4051 and the nature of narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on the results of a three-year program of coordinated x-ray andoptical monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051. the rapidcontinuum variations observed in the x-ray spectra are not detected in theoptical, although the time-averaged x-ray and optical continuum fluxes arewell-correlated. variations in the flux of the broad hbeta line are found tolag behind the optical continuum variations by 6 days (with an uncertainty of2-3 days), and combining this with the line width yields a virial mass estimateof about 1.1 million solar masses, at the very low end of the distribution ofagn masses measured by line reverberation. strong variability of he ii 4686 isalso detected, and the response time measured is similar to that of hbeta, butwith a much larger uncertainty. the he ii 4686 line is almost five timesbroader than hbeta, and it is strongly blueward asymmetric, as are thehigh-ionization uv lines recorded in archival spectra of ngc 4051. the data areconsistent with the balmer lines arising in a low to moderate inclinationdisk-like configuration, and the high-ionization lines arising in an outflowingwind, of which we observe preferentially the near side. previous observationsof the narrow-line region morphology of this source suggest that the system isinclined by about 50 degrees, and if this is applicable to the broadhbeta-emitting region, a central mass of about 1.4 million solar masses can beinferred. during the third year of monitoring, both the x-ray continuum and thehe ii 4686 line went into extremely low states, although the optical continuumand the hbeta broad line were both still present and variable. we suggest thatthe inner part of the accretion disk may have gone into an advection-dominatedstate, yielding little radiation from the hotter inner disk.

astro-ph;0107075	multiwavelength monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564.  iii. optical observations and the optical--uv--x-ray connection	we present the results of a two-year long optical monitoring program of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy akn 564. the majority of this monitoring projectwas also covered by x-ray observations (rxte) and for a period of ~50 days, weobserved the galaxy in uv (hst) and x-rays (rxte &amp; asca) simultaneously withthe ground-based observations. rapid and large-amplitude variations seen in thex-ray band, on a daily and hourly time-scale, were not detected at optical anduv wavelengths, which in turn exhibited much lower variability either on short(one day) or long (several months) time-scales. the only significant opticalvariations can be described as two 2--4 day events with ~10% flux variations.we detect no significant optical line variations and thus cannot infer areverberation size for the broad-line region. similarly, the large x-rayvariations seem to vanish when the light curve is smoothed over a period of 30days. the uv continuum follows the x-rays with a lag of ~0.4 days, and theoptical band lags the uv band by ~2 days. no significant correlation was foundbetween the entire x-ray dataset and the optical band. focusing on a 20-dayinterval around the strongest optical event we detect a significantx-ray--optical correlation with similar events seen in the uv and x-rays. ourdata are consistent with reprocessing models on the grounds of the energyemitted in this single event. however, several large x-ray flares produced nocorresponding optical emission.

astro-ph;0201134	measuring the broadband power spectra of active galactic nuclei with  rxte	we have developed a monte carlo technique to test models for the true powerspectra of intermittently sampled lightcurves against the noisy, observed powerspectra, and produce a reliable estimate of the goodness of fit of the givenmodel. we apply this technique to constrain the broadband power spectra of asample of four seyfert galaxies monitored by the rossi x-ray timing explorer(rxte) over three years. we show that the power spectra of three of the agn inour sample (mcg-6-30-15, ngc5506 and ngc3516) flatten significantly towards lowfrequencies, while the power spectrum of ngc5548 shows no evidence offlattening. we fit two models for the flattening, a `knee' model, analogous tothe low-frequency break seen in the power spectra of bhxrbs in the low state(where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=0) and a `high-frequencybreak' model (where the power-spectral slope flattens to \alpha=1), analogousto the high-frequency break seen in the high and low-state power spectra of theclassic bhxrb cyg x-1. both models provide good fits to the power spectra ofall four agn. for both models, the characteristic frequency for flattening issignificantly higher in mcg-6-30-15 than in ngc 3516 (by factor ~10) althoughboth sources have similar x-ray luminosities, suggesting that mcg-6-30-15 has alower black hole mass and is accreting at a higher rate than ngc 3516. assuminglinear scaling of characteristic frequencies with black hole mass, the highaccretion rate implied for mcg-6-30-15 favours the high-frequency break modelfor this source and further suggests that mcg-6-30-15 and possibly ngc 5506,may be analogues of cyg x-1 in the high state [abridged].

astro-ph;0202498	long term spectral variability of seyfert galaxies from rxte color-flux  diagrams	we present results from rxte data obtained during a systematic monitoringprogram of four seyfert galaxies (ngc5548, ngc5506, mcg-6-30-15 and ngc4051).we studied the variability of three hardness ratios derived from the lightcurves in four energy bands. all the objects show similar spectral variationsin all ratios. in order to interpret the results we computed the hardnessratios corresponding to a simple spectral model of a power law plus iron lineplus reflection component, considering two possibilities: a)variations withconstant line equivalent width and reflection parameter r and b) variationswith constant line and reflection flux. the overall, mean observed trends canbe explained by spectral slope variations and a constant flux fe line andreflection component, although the existence of a line component which isvariable on short time scales cannot be excluded. finally, we find that thedata are not consistent with an increase of r with flux for individual sources,indicating that, as a single source varies, softer spectra do not correspond tolarger r values.

astro-ph;0209155	x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4051	we report on the x-ray spectral variability of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051observed with the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) during a 1000 day periodbetween may 1996 and march 1999. the spectra were obtained as part ofmonitoring observations and from two long observations using the rxteproportional counter array (pca). during the monitoring period the 2-10 kevflux of ngc 4051 varied between 10e-12 and 7x 10e11 (cgs). we re-analysed rxtepca observations from a distinct low state in may 1998 using the latestbackground and detector response models. the rxte and bepposax observations ofngc 4051 during the low state show a very hard spectrum with a strongunresolved fluorescence line. this emission, probably due to reflection from amolecular torus, is likely to be constant over long time-scales and istherefore assumed as an underlying component at all flux states. by subtractingthe torus component we are able to determine the spectral variability of theprimary continuum. in the variable component we observe a stronganti-correlation of x-ray flux and spectral hardness in the pca energy band. weshow that the changes in hardness are caused by slope variability of theprimary power law spectrum rather than by changing reflection or variablephotoelectric absorption. the primary spectral index varies between gamma=1.6for the faintest states and gamma=2.3 during the brightest states, at whichlevel the spectral index approaches an asympotic value. we find that theresponse of the flux of the 6.4 kev iron fluorescence line to changes in thecontinuum flux depends on the timescale of the observation. the profile of theline is very broad and indicates an origin in the innermost regions of theaccretion disk.

astro-ph;0303273	x-ray fluctuation power spectral densities of seyfert 1 galaxies	by combining complementary monitoring observations spanning long, medium andshort time scales, we have constructed power spectral densities (psds) of sixseyfert~1 galaxies. these psds span $\gtrsim$4 orders of magnitude in temporalfrequency, sampling variations on time scales ranging from tens of minutes toover a year. in at least four cases, the psd shows a "break," a significantdeparture from a power law, typically on time scales of order a few days. thisis similar to the behavior of galactic x-ray binaries (xrbs), lower masscompact systems with breaks on time scales of seconds. ngc 3783 shows tentativeevidence for a doubly-broken power law, a feature that until now has only beenseen in the (much better-defined) psds of low-state xrbs. it is alsointeresting that (when one previously-observed object is added to make a smallsample of seven), an apparently significant correlation is seen between thebreak time scale $t$ and the putative black hole mass $m_{\rm bh}$, while noneis seen between break time scale and luminosity. the data are consistent withthe linear relation $ t = m_{\rm bh}/10^{6.5} \msun$; extrapolation over 6--7orders of magnitude is in reasonable agreement with xrbs. all of thisstrengthens the case for a physical similarity between seyfert~1s and xrbs.

astro-ph;0305129	complex optical-x-ray correlations in the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy  ngc 4051	this paper presents the results of a dense and intensive x-ray and opticalmonitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 carried out in 2000.results of the optical analysis are consistent with previous measurements. theamplitude of optical emission line variability is a factor of two larger thanthat of the underlying optical continuum, but part or all of the difference canbe due to host-galaxy starlight contamination or due to the lines being drivenby the unseen uv continuum, which is more variable than the optical continuum.we measured the lag between optical lines and continuum and found a lower, moreaccurate broad line region size of 3.0+-1.5 light days in this object. theimplied black hole mass is m_bh=5(+6,-3)x10^5 m_sun; this is the lowest massfound, so far, for an active nucleus. we find significant evidence for anx-ray-optical (xo) correlation with a peak lag of about &lt;1 day, although thecentroid of the asymmetric correlation function reveals that part of theoptical flux varies in advance of the x-ray flux by 2.4+-1.0 days. this complexxo correlation is explained as a possible combination of x-ray reprocessing andperturbations propagating from the outer (optically emitting) parts of theaccretion disc into its inner (x-ray emitting) region.

astro-ph;0305130	an absorption event in the x-ray lightcurve of ngc 3227	we have monitored the seyfert galaxy ngc 3227 with the rossi x-ray timingexplorer (rxte) since january 1999. during late 2000 and early 2001 we observedan unusual hardening of the 2-10 kev x-ray spectrum which lasted severalmonths. the spectral hardening was not accompanied by any correlated variationin flux above 8 kev. we therefore interpret the spectral change as transientabsorption by a gas cloud of column density 2.6 10^23 cm^-2 crossing the lineof sight to the x-ray source. a spectrum obtained by xmm-newton during an earlyphase of the hard-spectrum event confirms the obscuration model and shows thatthe absorbing cloud is only weakly ionised. the xmm-newton spectrum also showsthat ~10% of the x-ray flux is not obscured, but this unabsorbed component isnot significantly variable and may be scattered radiation from a large-scalescattering medium. applying the spectral constraints on cloud ionisationparameter and assuming that the cloud follows a keplerian orbit, we constrainthe location of the cloud to be r~10-100 light-days from the central x-raysource, and its density to be n_h~10^8cm^-3, implying that we have witnessedthe eclipse of the x-ray source by a broad line region cloud.

astro-ph;0306234	catching ngc 4051 in the low state with chandra	we report the results from a chandra too observation of the low-luminositynarrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051, obtained during a 6-week durationlow-flux state in 2001 february. during the chandra observation, the 2-10 kevsource flux was 7e-12 erg/cm^2/s, corresponding to a 2-10 kev luminosity of8e40 erg/s. we confirm the absence of strong extended soft x-ray emission inngc 4051, and that the low state spectrum is dominated by the central pointsource. the x-ray spectrum has an unusual, hybrid shape, very soft below ~3 kev(and which we model with a black body of temperature 0.14 kev) and very hard athigher energies (power-law slope of gamma~1). the lightcurves in both soft andhard bands are significantly variable and correlated, implying a connectionbetween hard and soft components and proving that the hard component isdominated by primary continuum emission and is not due to pure reflection fromdistant cold material. however, a comparison with rxte data obtained during thesame 2001 low state suggests the presence of unusually prominent diskreflection features, which may help to explain the apparent upwards curvatureand extreme hardness of the chandra spectrum above a few kev. the shape of the2001 low state spectrum is consistent with that observed in a brief (&lt;3 d) lowflux excursion during the source's normal state in april 2000, suggesting thatemission processes during the low state are not significantly different tothose in the normal state. the unusual spectral shape observed in the low statemay be a continuation to low fluxes of the normal, flux-dependent spectralvariability of the source.

astro-ph;0307420	on characterising the variability properties of x-ray light curves from  active galaxies	we review some practical aspects of measuring the amplitude of variability in`red noise' light curves typical of those from active galactic nuclei (agn).the quantities commonly used to estimate the variability amplitude in agn lightcurves, such as the fractional rms variability amplitude, f_var, and excessvariance, sigma_xs^2, are examined. their statistical properties, relationshipto the power spectrum, and uses for investigating the nature of the variabilityprocesses are discussed. we demonstrate that sigma_xs^2 (or similarly f_var)shows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when thevariability is produced by a stationary process. this limits the usefulness ofthese estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude betweendifferent sources or from epoch to epoch in one source. some examples of theexpected scatter in the variance are tabulated for various typical powerspectral shapes, based on monte carlo simulations. the excess variance can beuseful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in differentenergy bands from the same observation. monte carlo simulations are used toderive a description of the uncertainty in the amplitude expected betweendifferent energy bands (due to measurement errors). finally, these estimatorsare used to demonstrate some variability properties of the bright seyfert 1galaxy markarian 766. the source is found to show a strong, linear correlationbetween rms amplitude and flux, and to show significant spectral variability.

astro-ph;0310701	complex x-ray spectral behaviour of ngc 4051 in the low flux state	the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 was observed in one of itsprolonged low-lux states by xmm-newton in november 2002. here we present theresults of an analysis of epic-pn data obtained during the observation. withinthe low state, the source shows complex spectral variability which cannoteasily be explained by any simple model. however, by making a `flux-flux' plotwhich combines the low state data with data obtained during a normal fluxstate, we demonstrate that the extremely hard spectrum observed above 2 kevresults from a continuation of the spectral variability seen in the normalstate, which is caused by spectral pivoting of the power-law continuum. thepivoting power-law appears to be attached to a comptonised thermal component ofvariable flux (blackbody temperature kt~0.1 kev, consistent with the smallblack hole mass in ngc 4051) which dominates the soft x-ray band in the lowstate, and is probably the source of seed photons for comptonisation.additional constant thermal and reflection components, together with absorptionby ionised gas, seem to be required to complete the picture and explain thecomplex x-ray spectral variability seen in the low state of ngc 4051.

astro-ph;0407472	xmm-newton observation of the seyfert 1.8 eso 113-g010: discovery of a  highly redshifted iron line at 5.4 kev	we present a spectral analysis of the seyfert 1.8 eso 113-g010 observed withxmm-newton for 4 ks. the spectrum shows a soft excess below 0.7 kev and moreinterestingly a narrow emission gaussian line at 5.4 kev (in its rest-frame),most probably originating from a redshifted iron kalpha line. no significantline at or above 6.4 kev is found contrary to other objects showing redshiftedlines, ruling out a strong blue-wing to the line profile. the line is detectedat 99% confidence, from performing monte carlo simulations which fully accountfor the range of energies where a narrow iron line is likely to occur. theenergy of the line could indicate emission from relativistic (0.17 - 0.23 c)ejected matter moving away from the observer, as proposed for mrk 766 by turneret al. (2004). alternatively, the emission from a narrow annulus at the surfaceof the accretion disk is unlikely due to the very small inclination angle (i.e.less than 10 deg) required to explain the narrow, redshifted line in thisintermediate seyfert galaxy. however emission from a small, localized hot-spoton the disk, occurring within a fraction of a complete disk orbit, could alsoexplain the redshifted line. this scenario would be directly testable in alonger observation, as one would see significant variations in the energy andintensity of the line within an orbital timescale.

astro-ph;0502112	non-linear x-ray variability in x-ray binaries and active galaxies	we show that the rms-flux relation recently discovered in the x-ray lightcurves of active galactic nuclei (agn) and x-ray binaries (xrbs) implies thatthe light curves have a formally non-linear, exponential form, provided therms-flux relation applies to variations on all time-scales (as it appears to).this phenomenological model implies that stationary data will have a lognormalflux distribution. we confirm this result using an observation of cyg x-1, andfurther demonstrate that our model predicts the existence of the powerfulmillisecond flares observed in cyg x-1 in the low/hard state, and explains thegeneral shape and amplitude of the bicoherence spectrum in that source. ourmodel predicts that the most variable light curves will show the most extremenon-linearity. this result can naturally explain the apparent non-linearvariability observed in some highly variable narrow line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxies, as well as the low states observed on long time-scales in the nls1ngc 4051, as being nothing more than extreme manifestations of the samevariability process that is observed in xrbs and less variable agn. thatvariability process must be multiplicative (with variations coupled together onall time-scales) and cannot be additive (such as shot-noise), or related toself-organised criticality, or result from completely independent variations inmany separate emitting regions. successful models for variability mustreproduce the observed rms-flux relation and non-linear behaviour, which aremore fundamental characteristics of the variability process than the powerspectrum or spectral-timing properties. models where x-ray variability isdriven by accretion rate variations produced at different radii remain the mostpromising.

astro-ph;0506455	where are the x-ray qpos in active galaxies?	in this paper we address the question of whether existing x-ray observationsof seyfert galaxies are sufficiently sensitive to detect quasi-periodicoscillations (qpos) similar to those observed in the x-ray variations ofgalactic black holes (gbhs). we use data from xmm-newton and simulated databased on the best rxte long-term monitoring light curves, to show that if x-rayqpos are present in seyfert x-ray light curves - with similar shapes andstrengths to those observed in gbhs, but at lower frequencies commensurate withtheir larger black hole masses - they would be exceedingly difficult to detect.our results offer a simple explanation for the present lack of qpo detectionsin seyferts. we discuss the improvements in telescope size and monitoringpatterns needed to make qpo detections feasible. the most efficient type offuture observatory for searching for x-ray qpos in agn is an x-ray all-skymonitor (asm). a sufficiently sensitive asm would be ideally suited todetecting low frequency qpos in nearby agn. the detection of agn qpos wouldstrengthen the agn-gbh connection and could serve as powerful diagnostics ofthe black hole mass, and the structure of the x-ray emitting region in agn.

astro-ph;0512394	investigating a fluctuating-accretion model for the spectral-timing  properties of accreting black hole systems	the fluctuating accretion model of lyubarskii (1997) and its extension bykotov et al. (2001), seeks to explain the spectral-timing properties of thex-ray variability of accreting black holes in terms of inward-propagating massaccretion fluctuations produced at a broad range of radii. the fluctuationsmodulate the x-ray emitting region as they move inwards and can producetemporal-frequency-dependent lags between energy bands, and energy-dependentpower spectral densities (psds) as a result of the different emissivityprofiles, which may be expected at different x-ray energies. here we use asimple numerical implementation to investigate in detail the x-rayspectral-timing properties of the model and their relation to severalphysically interesting parameters, namely the emissivity profile in differentenergy bands, the geometrical thickness and viscosity parameter of theaccretion flow, the strength of damping on the fluctuations and the temporalcoherence (measured by the `quality-factor', q) of the fluctuations introducedat each radius. we find that a geometrically thick flow with large viscosityparameter is favoured, and confirm that the predicted lags are quite robust tochanges in the emissivity profile, and physical parameters of the accretionflow, which may help to explain the similarity of the lag spectra in thelow/hard and high/soft states of cyg x-1. we also demonstrate the model regimewhere the light curves in different energy bands are highly spectrallycoherent. we compare model predictions directly to x-ray data from the narrowline seyfert~1 galaxy ngc 4051 and the bhxrb cyg x-1 in its high/soft state andshow that this general scheme can reproduce simultaneously the time lags andenergy-dependence of the psd.

astro-ph;0610154	xmm-newton observation of the nls1 galaxy ark 564: i. spectral analysis  of the time-average spectrum	we use the data from a recent, 100 ksec xmm-newton observation of the narrowline seyfert 1 galaxy ark 564 to obtain its time average, x-ray spectrum. the3-11 kev spectrum is well fitted by a power-law of slope 2.43. we detect a weak(equivalent width ~80 ev) emission line at ~6.7 kev, which implies emissionfrom ionized iron. there is no compelling evidence for significant broadeningof the line.we also detect a possible doppler shifted absorption line at 8.1kev. at energies lower than 2 kev, the spectrum is dominated by a smooth softexcess component which can be well fitted either by a two black body components(kt~0.15 and 0.07 kev) or by a black body plus a relativistically blurredphotoionized disc reflection model. we detect a broad, shallow flux deficit inthe 0.65-0.85 kev band, reminiscent of the iron unresolved transition array(uta) features. we do not detect neither a strong absorption edge around 0.7kev nor an emission line around 1 kev. the soft excess emission is consistentwith being reflected emission from a geometrically flat disc, with solarabundances, illuminated by an isotropic source. the weakness of the iron lineemission can be explained by relativistic blurring. the uta feature implies thepresence of warm material with a column density of 2-5*10^{20} cm^{-2}. if theabsorption line at 8.1 kev corresponds to fexxvi kalpha, it suggests thepresence of a highly ionized absorbing material with n_h &gt; 10^{23} cm^{-2},outflowing at a high velocity of ~0.17c.

astro-ph;9905104	the swansong in context: long-timescale x-ray variability of ngc 4051	on 9-11 may 1998, the highly-variable, low luminosity seyfert 1 galaxyngc4051 was observed in an unusual low flux state by bepposax (guainazzi et al.1998) rxte and euve. we present fits of the 4-15 kev rxte spectrum and bepposaxmecs spectrum obtained during this observation, which are consistent with theinterpretation that the source had switched off, leaving only the spectrum ofpure reflection from distant cold matter. we place this result in context byshowing the x-ray lightcurve of ngc4051 obtained by our rxte monitoringcampaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low statelasted for ~150 days before the may observations (implying that the reflectingmaterial is &gt; 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of alightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux overtimescales &gt; months. we show that the long-timescale component to x-rayvariability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct fromthe variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations inthe accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. as the sourceapproaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. ngc4051may represent a microcosm of all x-ray variability in radio quiet activegalactic nuclei (agns), displaying in a few years a variety of flux states andvariability properties which more luminous agns may pass through on timescalesof decades to thousands of years.

0812.0810	long term optical and x-ray variability of the seyfert galaxy markarian  79	we present the results of concurrent x-ray and optical monitoring of theseyfert 1 galaxy mrk 79 over a period of more than five years. we find that onshort to medium time-scales (days to a few tens of days) the 2-10 kev x-ray andoptical u and v band fluxes are significantly correlated, with a delay betweenthe bands consistent with zero days. we show that most of these variations maybe well reproduced by a model where the short-term optical variations originatefrom reprocessing of x-rays by an optically thick accretion disc. the opticallight curves, however, also display long time-scale variations over thousandsof days, which are not present in the x-ray light curve. these opticalvariations must originate from an independent variability mechanism and we showthat they can be produced by variations in the (geometrically) thin discaccretion rate as well as by varying reprocessed fractions through changes inthe location of the x-ray corona.
