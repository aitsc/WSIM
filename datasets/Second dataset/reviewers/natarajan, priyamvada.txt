0901.4372	subaru weak lensing measurements of four strong lensing clusters: are  lensing clusters over-concentrated?	we derive radial mass profiles of four strong lensing selected clusters whichshow prominent giant arcs (abell 1703, sdss j1446+3032, sdss j1531+3414, andsdss j2111-0115), by combining detailed strong lens modeling with weak lensingshear measured from deep subaru suprime-cam images. weak lensing signals aredetected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range fromz=0.28 to 0.64. we demonstrate that adding strong lensing information withknown arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass densityprofile, compared to those obtained from weak lensing alone. while the massprofiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in n-body simulationsof the lcdm model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrallyconcentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \sim 8) than theoreticalpredictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrationsinherent in lensing selected samples. our results are consistent with previousstudies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increases thetotal number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensingtechnique to ten. combining our sample with previous work, we find thatclusters with larger einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. we alsopresent a detailed model of the lensing cluster a1703 with constraints frommultiple image families, and find the dark matter inner density profile to becuspy with the slope consistent with -1, in agreement with expectations.

0903.2262	journey to the m_bh -sigma relation: the fate of low mass black holes in  the universe	in this paper, we explore the establishment and evolution of the empiricalcorrelation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion with redshift. wetrack the growth and accretion history of massive black holes starting fromhigh redshift using two seeding models:(i) population iii remnants, and (ii)massive seeds from direct gas collapse. although the seeds do not initiallysatisfy the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ relation, the correlation is established andmaintained at all times if self-regulating accretion episodes are associatedwith major mergers. the massive end of the $m_{\rm bh} - \sigma$ relation isestablished early, and lower mass mbhs migrate over time. how mbhs migratetoward the relation, the slope and the scatter of the relation all dependcritically on the seeding model as well as the adopted self-regulationprescription. we expect flux limited agn surveys and lisa to select accretingand merging mbhs respectively that have already migrated onto the $\msigma$relation. this is a consequence of major mergers being more common at highredshift for the most massive, biased, galaxies that anchor the $\msigma$relation early. we also predict the existence of a large population of low mass`hidden' mbhs at high redshift which can easily escape detection. additionally,we find that if mbh seeds are massive, $\sim 10^5 m_{\odot}$, the low-mass endof the $\msigma$ flattens towards this asymptotic value, creating acharacteristic `plume'.

0706.3149	probing the truncation of galaxy dark matter halos in high density  environments from hydrodynamical n-body simulations	we analyze high resolution, n-body hydrodynamical simulations of fiducialgalaxy clusters to probe tidal stripping of the dark matter subhalos. thesesimulations include a prescription for star formation allowing us to track thefate of the stellar component as well. we investigate the effect of tidalstripping on cluster galaxies hosted in these dark matter subhalos as afunction of cluster-centric radius. to quantify the extent of the dark matterhalos of cluster galaxies, we introduce the half mass radius r_half as adiagnostic, and study its evolution with projected cluster-centric distance ras a function of redshift. we find a well defined trend for (r_half,r): thecloser the galaxies are to the center of the cluster, the smaller the half massradius. interestingly, this trend is inferred in all redshift frames examinedin this work ranging from z=0 to z=0.7. at z=0, galaxy halos in the centralregions of clusters are found to be highly truncated, with the most compacthalf mass radius of 10 kpc. we also find that r_half depends on luminosity andwe present scaling relations of r_half with galaxy luminosity. thecorresponding total mass of the cluster galaxies is also found to increase withprojected cluster-centric distance and luminosity, but with more scatter thanthe (r_half,r) trend. comparing the distribution of stellar mass to total massfor cluster galaxies, we find that the dark matter component is preferentiallystripped, whereas the stellar component remains protected by the halo and ismuch less affected by tidal forces. we compare these results with galaxy-galaxylensing probes of r_half and find qualitative agreement.

1003.0670	spin and structural halo properties at high redshift in a lcdm universe	in this paper, we examine in detail the key structural properties of highredshift dark matter haloes as a function of their spin parameter. we performand analyze high resolution cosmological simulations of the formation ofstructure in a lcdm universe. we study the mass function, ellipticities,shapes, density profiles, rotation curves and virialization for a large sampleof dark matter haloes from z = 15 - 6. we also present detailed convergencetests for individual haloes. we find that high spin haloes have strongerclustering strengths (up to 25%) at all mass and redshift ranges at these earlyepochs. high redshift spherical haloes are also up to 50% more clustered thanaspherical haloes. high spin haloes at these redshifts are also preferentiallyfound in high density environments, and have more neighbors than their low spincounterparts. we report a systematic offset in the peak of the circularvelocity curves for high and low spin haloes of the same mass. therefore,estimating halo masses without knowledge of the spin, using only the circularvelocity can yield errors of up to 40%. the strong dependence of key structuralproperties on spin that we report here likely have important implications forstudies of star formation and feedback from these galaxies.

1003.2175	hydrostatic equilibrium profiles for gas in elliptical galaxies	we present an analytic formulation for the equilibrium gas density profile ofearly-type galaxies that explicitly includes the contribution of stars in thegravitational potential. we build a realistic model for an isolated ellipticalgalaxy and explore the equilibrium gas configurations as a function of multipleparameters. for an assumed central gas temperature k_b*t_0=0.6 kev, we findthat neglecting the gravitational effects of stars, which can contributesubstantially in the innermost regions, leads to an underestimate of theenclosed baryonic gas mass by up to ~65% at the effective radius, and by up to~15% at the nfw scale radius, depending on the stellar baryon fraction. thisformula is therefore important for estimating the baryon fraction in anunbiased fashion. these new hydrostatic equilibrium solutions, derived for theisothermal and polytropic cases, can also be used to generate more realisticinitial conditions for simulations of elliptical galaxies. moreover, the newformulation is relevant when interpreting x-ray data. we compare our compositeisothermal model to the standard beta-model used to fit x-ray observations ofearly-type galaxies, to determine the value of the nfw scale radius r_s.assuming a 10% stellar baryon fraction, we find that the exclusion of starsfrom the gravitational potential leads to (i) an underestimate of r_s by ~80%,and to (ii) an overestimate of the enclosed dark matter at r_s by a factor of~2, compared to the equivalent beta-model fit results when stars are not takeninto account. for higher stellar mass fractions, a beta-model is unable toaccurately reproduce our solution, indicating that when the observed surfacebrightness profile of an isolated elliptical galaxy is found to be well fittedby a beta-model, the stellar mass fraction cannot be much greater than ~10%.

1004.0694	observed scaling relations for strong lensing clusters: consequences for  cosmology and cluster assembly	scaling relations of observed galaxy cluster properties are useful tools forconstraining cosmological parameters as well as cluster formation histories.one of the key cosmological parameters, sigma8, is constrained using observedclusters of galaxies, although current estimates of sigma8 from the scalingrelations of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters are limited by the largescatter in the observed cluster mass-temperature (m-t) relation. with a sampleof eight strong lensing clusters at 0.3 &lt; z &lt;0.8, we find that the observedcluster concentration-mass relation can be used to reduce the m-t scatter by afactor of 6. typically only relaxed clusters are used to estimate sigma8, butcombining the cluster concentration-mass relation with the m-t relation enablesthe inclusion of unrelaxed clusters as well. thus, the resultant gains in theaccuracy of sigma8 measurements from clusters are twofold: the errors on sigma8are reduced and the cluster sample size is increased. therefore, the statisticson sigma8 determination from clusters are greatly improved by the inclusion ofunrelaxed clusters. exploring cluster scaling relations further, we find thatthe correlation between brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) luminosity and clustermass offers insight into the assembly histories of clusters. we findpreliminary evidence for a steeper bcg luminosity - cluster mass relation forstrong lensing clusters than the general cluster population, hinting thatstrong lensing clusters may have had more active merging histories.

1007.4196	virialization of high redshift dark matter haloes	we present results of a study of the virial state of high redshift darkmatter haloes in an n-body simulation. we find that the majority of collapsed,bound haloes are not virialized at any redshift slice in our study ($z=15-6$)and have excess kinetic energy. at these redshifts, merging is still rampantand the haloes cannot strictly be treated as isolated systems. to assess ifthis excess kinetic energy arises from the environment, we include the surfacepressure term in the virial equation explicitly and relax the assumption thatthe density at the halo boundary is zero. upon inclusion of the surface term,we find that the haloes are much closer to virialization, however, they stillhave some excess kinetic energy. we report trends of the virial ratio includingthe extra surface term with three key halo properties: spin, environment, andconcentration. we find that haloes with closer neighbors depart more fromvirialization, and that haloes with larger spin parameters do as well. weconclude that except at the lowest masses ($m &lt; 10^6 \msun$), dark matterhaloes at high redshift are not fully virialized. this finding has interestingimplications for galaxy formation at these high redshifts, as the excesskinetic energy will impact the subsequent collapse of baryons and the formationof the first disks and/or baryonic structures.

1010.0004	cosmography with cluster strong lenses: the influence of substructure  and line-of-sight halos	we explore the use of strong lensing by galaxy clusters to constrain the darkenergy equation of state and its possible time variation. the cores of massiveclusters often contain several multiply imaged systems of background galaxiesat different redshifts. the locations of lensed images can be used to constraincosmological parameters due to their dependence on the ratio of angulardiameter distances. we employ monte-carlo simulations of cluster lenses,including the contribution from substructures, to assess the feasibility ofthis potentially powerful technique. at the present, parametric lens models usewell motivated scaling relations between mass and light to incorporate clustermember galaxies, and do not explicitly model line-of-sight structure. here, wequantify modeling errors due to scatter in the cluster galaxy scaling relationsand un-modeled line-of-sight halos. these errors are of the order of a fewarcseconds on average for clusters located at typical redshifts (z ~ 0.2 -0.3). using bayesian markov chain monte-carlo techniques, we show that theinclusion of these modeling errors is critical to deriving unbiased constraintson dark energy. however, when the uncertainties are properly quantified, weshow that constraints competitive with other methods may be obtained bycombining results from a sample of just 10 simulated clusters with 20 familieseach. cosmography with a set of well studied cluster lenses may provide apowerful complementary probe of the dark energy equation of state. oursimulations provide a convenient method of quantifying modeling errors andassessing future strong lensing survey strategies.

1102.5097	the effects of primordial non-gaussianity on giant-arc statistics	for over a decade, it has been debated whether the concordance lcdm model isconsistent with the observed abundance of giant arcs in clusters. whileprevious theoretical studies have focused on properties of the lens and sourcepopulations, as well as cosmological effects such as dark energy, the impact ofinitial conditions on the giant-arc abundance is relatively unexplored. here,we quantify the impact of non-gaussian initial conditions with the localbispectrum shape on the predicted frequency of giant arcs. using apath-integral formulation of the excursion set formalism, we extend asemi-analytic model for calculating halo concentrations to the case ofprimordial non-gaussianity, which may be useful for applications outside ofthis work. we find that massive halos tend to collapse earlier in models withpositive f_nl, relative to the gaussian case, leading to enhanced concentrationparameters. the converse is true for f_nl &lt; 0. in addition to these effects,which change the lensing cross sections, non-gaussianity also modifies theabundance of supercritical clusters available for lensing. these combinedeffects work together to either enhance (f_nl &gt; 0) or suppress (f_nl &lt; 0) theprobability of giant-arc formation. using the best value and 95% confidencelevels currently available from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe, wefind that the giant-arc optical depth for sources at z_s~2 is enhanced by ~20%and ~45% for f_nl = 32 and 74 respectively. in contrast, we calculate asuppression of ~5% for f_nl = -10. these differences translate to similarrelative changes in the predicted all-sky number of giant arcs.

1103.1644	how important is the dark matter halo for black hole growth?	in this paper, we examine if the properties of central black holes ingalactic nuclei correlate with their host dark matter halo. we analyze theentire sample of galaxies where black hole mass, velocity dispersion, sigma,and asymptotic circular velocity, vc, have all been measured. we fit m-sigmaand m-vc to a power law, and find that in both relationships the scatter andslope are similar. this model-independent analysis suggests that although theblack hole masses are not uniquely determined by dark matter halo mass, whenconsidered for the current sample as a whole, the m-vc correlation may be asstrong (or as weak) as m-sigma. although the data are sparse, there appears tobe more scatter in the correlation for both sigma and vc at the low--mass end.this is not unexpected given our current understanding of galaxy and black holeassembly. in fact, there are several compelling reasons that account for this:(i) smbh formation is likely less efficient in low-mass galaxies with largeangular momentum content; (ii) smbh growth is less efficient in low-mass diskgalaxies that have not experienced major mergers; (iii) dynamical effects, suchas gravitational recoil, increase scatter preferentially at the low-mass end.therefore, the recent observational claim of the absence of central smbhs inbulgeless, low mass galaxies, or deviations from the correlations defined byhigh-mass black holes in large galaxies today is, in fact, predicated bycurrent models of black hole growth. we show how this arises as a directconsequence of the coupling between dark matter halos and central black holesat the earliest epochs.

1104.4797	the formation and evolution of massive black hole seeds in the early  universe	tracking the evolution of high redshift seed black hole masses to late times,we examine the observable signatures today. these massive initial black holeseeds form at extremely high redshifts from the direct collapse of pre-galacticgas discs. populating dark matter halos with seeds formed in this fashion, wefollow the mass assembly history of these black holes to the present time usinga monte-carlo merger tree approach. utilizing this formalism, we predict theblack hole mass function at high redshifts and at the present time; theintegrated mass density of black holes in the universe; the luminosity functionof accreting black holes as a function of redshift and the scatter in observed,local m-sigma relation. comparing the predictions of the `light' seed modelwith these massive seeds we find that significant differences appearpredominantly at the low mass end of the present day black hole mass function.however, all our models predict that low surface brightness, bulge-lessgalaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation ofmassive seed black holes at high redshifts. the efficiency of seed formation athigh redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction ingalaxies at z=0. this effect is more pronounced for low mass galaxies. this isthe key discriminant between the models studied here and the population iiiremnant `light' seed model. we find that there exists a population of low massgalaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. our prediction of the shape ofthe m-sigma relation at the low mass end and increased scatter has recentlybeen corroborated by observations.

1106.3079	black hole growth in the early universe is self-regulated and largely  hidden from view	the formation of the first massive objects in the infant universe remainsimpossible to observe directly and yet it sets the stage for the subsequentevolution of galaxies. while some black holes with masses &gt; billion solarmasses? have been detected in luminous quasars less than one billion yearsafter the big bang, these individual extreme objects have limited utility inconstraining the channels of formation of the earliest black holes. the initialconditions of black hole seed properties are quickly erased during the growthprocess. from deep, optimally stacked, archival x-ray observations, we measurethe amount of black hole growth in z=6-8 galaxies (0.7-1 billion years afterthe big bang). our results imply that black holes grow in tandem with theirhosts throughout cosmic history, starting from the earliest times. we find thatmost copiously accreting black holes at these epochs are buried in significantamounts of gas and dust that absorb most radiation except for the highestenergy x-rays. this suggests that black holes grow significantly more thanpreviously thought during these early bursts, and due to obscuration they donot contribute to the re-ionization of the universe with their ultravioletemission.

1109.2594	combined strong and weak lensing analysis of 28 clusters from the sloan  giant arcs survey	we study the mass distribution of a sample of 28 galaxy clusters using strongand weak lensing observations. the clusters are selected via their stronglensing properties as part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas) from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). mass modelling of the strong lensing informationfrom the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deepsubaru/suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on theconcentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. we find thatthe concentration c_vir is a steep function of the mass, c_vir \proptom_vir^-0.59\pm0.12, with the value roughly consistent with thelensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high mass (10^15 h^-1 m_sun)clusters. however, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appearto be much higher at lower masses (10^14 h^-1 m_sun), possibly a consequence ofthe modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. thesteep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stackinganalysis of the tangential shear profiles. in addition, we explore thetwo-dimensional shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weaklensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on theposition angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for alarge mean ellipticity with the best-fit value of e = 0.47 \pm 0.06 for themass distribution of the stacked sample. we find that the luminous clustermember galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well,although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be moreextended than the total mass.

1202.0185	cluster lenses	clusters of galaxies are the most recently assembled, massive, boundstructures in the universe. as predicted by general relativity, given theirmasses, clusters strongly deform space-time in their vicinity. clusters act assome of the most powerful gravitational lenses in the universe. light raystraversing through clusters from distant sources are hence deflected, and theresulting images of these distant objects therefore appear distorted andmagnified. lensing by clusters occurs in two regimes, each with uniqueobservational signatures. the strong lensing regime is characterized by effectsreadily seen by eye, namely, the production of giant arcs, multiple-images, andarclets. the weak lensing regime is characterized by small deformations in theshapes of background galaxies only detectable statistically. cluster lenseshave been exploited successfully to address several important current questionsin cosmology: (i) the study of the lens(es) - understanding cluster massdistributions and issues pertaining to cluster formation and evolution, as wellas constraining the nature of dark matter; (ii) the study of the lensed objects- probing the properties of the background lensed galaxy population - which isstatistically at higher redshifts and of lower intrinsic luminosity thusenabling the probing of galaxy formation at the earliest times right up to thedark ages; and (iii) the study of the geometry of the universe - as thestrength of lensing depends on the ratios of angular diameter distances betweenthe lens, source and observer, lens deflections are sensitive to the value ofcosmological parameters and offer a powerful geometric tool to probe darkenergy. in this review, we present the basics of cluster lensing and provide acurrent status report of the field.

0711.2302	consequences of dark matter self-annihilation for galaxy formation	galaxy formation requires a process that continually heats gas and quenchesstar formation in order to reproduce the observed shape of the luminosityfunction of bright galaxies. to accomplish this, current models invoke heatingfrom supernovae, and energy injection from active galactic nuclei. however,observations of radio-loud active galactic nuclei suggest that their feedbackis likely to not be as efficient as required, signaling the need for additionalheating processes. we propose the self-annihilation of weakly interactingmassive particles that constitute dark matter as a steady source of heating. inthis paper, we explore the circumstances under which this process may providethe required energy input. to do so, dark matter annihilations are incorporatedinto a galaxy formation model within the millennium cosmological simulation.energy input from self-annihilation can compensate for all the required gascooling and reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function only for whatappear to be extreme values of the relevant key parameters. the key parametersare: the slope of the inner density profile of dark matter haloes and the outerspike radius. the inner density profile needs to be steepened to slopes of -1.5or more and the outer spike radius needs to extend to a few tens of parsecs ongalaxy scales and a kpc or so on cluster scales. if neutralinos or any thermalrelic wimp with s-wave annihilation constitute dark matter, theirself-annihilation is inevitable and could provide enough power to modulategalaxy formation. energy from self-annihilating wimps could be yet anotherpiece of the feedback puzzle along with supernovae and active galactic nuclei.

1311.1614	the effect of large-scale structure on the magnification of  high-redshift sources by cluster-lenses	cluster gravitational lensing surveys like the hubble space telescopefrontier fields survey will detect distant galaxies 10-50 times fainter thanany yet discovered. using these surveys to measure the luminosity function ofsuch faint, distant galaxies, however, requires that magnification maps builtfrom the constraints of strongly-lensed images be accurate. for models thatassume the cluster and nearby (correlated) structures are the only significantsources of lensing, a potential source of error in these maps comes from thefact that light rays also suffer weak deflections by uncorrelated large-scalestructure along the line-of-sight, i.e. cosmic weak lensing (cwl). todemonstrate the magnitude of this effect, we calculate the magnification changewhich results when the same cluster-lens is placed along different lines ofsight. using a simple density profile for a cluster-lens at z~0.3-0.5 and thepower spectrum of the matter density fluctuations responsible for cwl, we showthat the typical magnifications of ~5(10) of sources at z=6-10 can differ by~10-20(20-30)% from one line-of-sight to another. however, these fluctuationsrise to greater than order unity near critical curves, indicating that cwltends to make its greatest contribution to the most magnified images. weconclude that the neglect of cwl in determining the intrinsic luminosities ofhighly-magnified galaxies may introduce errors significant enough to warrantfurther effort to include this contribution in cluster-lens modeling. wesuggest that methods of modeling cwl in galaxy-strong-lensing systems should begeneralized to cluster-lensing systems.

0803.1843	wmap5 and the cluster mass function	the recently revised cosmological constraints from the five-year wmap dataameliorate previous tension between cosmological constraints from the microwavebackground and from cluster abundances. we demonstrate that the revisedestimates of cosmological parameters are in excellent agreement with the massfunction of x-ray clusters in the sloan digital sky survey. velocitysegregation between galaxies and the underlying dark matter could cause virialmass estimates to be biased, causing the mass scale of the mass function to beoffset from the true value. modest velocity segregation($\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{dm}$=1.13$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$) is sufficient to match themass function to the five-year wmap results. when the new wmap results arecombined with constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations,there is no need for velocity segregation($\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{dm}$=1.05$\pm$0.05). this result agrees withexpectations for velocity segregation from state-of-the-art numericalsimulations of clusters. together with the improved agreement between the newwmap results and recent cosmic shear measurements, this result demonstratesthat the amplitude of large-scale structure in the nearby universe matches thatpredicted from the structure seen in the microwave background. the newconstraint we place on velocity segregation in clusters indicates that virialmass estimates for clusters are reasonably accurate. this result suggests thatfuture cluster surveys will be able to probe both cosmological parameters andfundamental cluster physics.

1512.03434	bulge-driven fueling of seed black holes	we examine radiation-regulated accretion onto intermediate-mass and massiveblack holes (bhs) embedded in a bulge component. using spherically symmetricone-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, we track the growth of bhsaccreting from a cold, neutral gas reservoir with temperature t=10^4 k. we findthat the accretion rate of bhs embedded in bulges is proportional tor_{b,eff}/r_b, where r_{b,eff} is the increased effective bondi radius thatincludes the gravitational potential of the bulge, and r_b is the bondi radiusof the bh. the radiative feedback from the bh suppresses the cold accretionrate to ~1 percent of the bondi rate when a bulge is not considered. however,we find that the bh fueling rate increases rapidly when the bulge mass m_bulgeis greater than the critical value of 10^6 m_sun and is proportional tom_bulge. since the critical bulge mass is independent of the central bh massm_{bh}, the growth rate of bhs with masses of 10^2, 10^4, and 10^6 m_sunexhibits distinct dependencies on the bulge-to-bh mass ratio. our results implythat light seed bhs (&lt;= 10^2 m_sun) which might be the remnants of the pop iiistars, cannot grow through accretion coevally with the early assembly of thebulge of the host galaxies until the bulge reaches the critical mass. however,massive bh seeds (&gt;= 10^5 m_sun) that may form via direct collapse, are morelikely to be embedded in a supercritical bulge and thus can grow efficientlycoupling to the host galaxies and driving the early evolution of them_{bh}-$\sigma$ relationship.

astro-ph;0110435	probing the mass distribution in groups of galaxies using gravitational  lensing	in this paper, we study gravitational lensing by groups of galaxies. sincegroups are abundant and therefore have a large covering fraction on the sky,lensing by groups is likely to be very important observationally. besides, ithas recently become clear that many lens models for strong lensing byindividual galaxies require external shear to reproduce the observed imagegeometries; in many cases a nearby group is detected that could provide thisshear. in this work, we study the expected lensing behavior of galaxy groups inboth the weak and strong lensing regime. we examine the shear and magnificationproduced by a group and its dependence on the detailed mass distribution withinthe group. we find that the peak value of the weak lensing shear signal is ofthe order of 3 per cent and varies by a factor of about 2 for different massdistributions. these variations are large enough to be detectable in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). in the strong lensing regime we find that the imagegeometries and typical magnifications are sensitive to the group properties andthat groups can easily provide enough external shear to produce quadrupleimages. we investigate the statistical properties of lensing galaxies that arenear or part of a group and find that statistical lens properties, like thedistribution of time delays, are affected measurably by the presence of thegroup which can therefore introduce an additional systematic error in themeasurement of the hubble constant from such systems. we conclude that both thedetection of weak lensing by groups and accurate observations of strong galaxylens systems near groups could provide important information on the total massand matter distribution within galaxy groups.

astro-ph;0201318	accretion during the merger of supermassive black holes	we study the evolution of disk accretion during the merger of supermassiveblack hole binaries in galactic nuclei. in hierarchical galaxy formationmodels, the most common binaries are likely to arise from minor galacticmergers, and have unequal mass black holes. once such a binary becomes embeddedin an accretion disk at a separation of the order of 0.1 pc, the mergerproceeds in two distinct phases. during the first phase, the loss of orbitalangular momentum to the gaseous disk shrinks the binary on a timescale of ~10myr. the accretion rate onto the primary black hole is not increased, and canbe substantially reduced, during this disk-driven migration. at smallerseparations, gravitational radiation becomes the dominant angular momentum lossprocess, and any gas trapped inside the orbit of the secondary is driveninwards by the inspiralling black hole. the implied accretion rate just priorto coalescence exceeds the eddington limit, so the final merger is likely tooccur within a common envelope formed from the disrupted inner disk, and beaccompanied by high velocity (~10,000 km/s) outflows.

astro-ph;0505496	the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts revisited	in this letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray burstsassuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii)the average metallicity in the universe. while at redshifts 5 and below, boththe star formation rate and metallicity are observationally determined modulosome uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. weextrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts andexplore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depthfrom wmap results. in addition, we also include parametric descriptions of theluminosity function, and the typical spectrum for grbs. with these essentialingredients included in the modeling, we find that a substantial fraction 75%of grbs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with someprevious estimates. conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsarmodel that gamma-ray bursts favour a low metallicity environment and therefore,relate the grb rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a functionof redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40% originate fromredshifts greater than 4. we conclude with the implications of swift grbdetections.

astro-ph;0508493	eccentricity of supermassive black hole binaries coalescing from gas  rich mergers	angular momentum loss to circumbinary gas provides a possible mechanism forovercoming the `last parsec' problem and allowing the most massive black holebinaries formed from galactic mergers to coalesce. here, we show that if gasdisks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower mass binaries detectablewith the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa), then there may be a purelygravitational wave signature of the role of gas in the form of a small butfinite eccentricity just prior to merger. numerical simulations suggest thateccentricity, excited by the interaction between the binary and surrounding gasdisk, is only partially damped during the final phase of gravitationalradiation-driven inspiral. we estimate that the typical eccentricity at oneweek prior to coalescence is of the order of 0.01. higher terminaleccentricities, which can approach 0.1, are possible if the binary has anextreme mass ratio. the detection of even a small eccentricity prior to mergerby lisa provides a possible discriminant between gas-driven inspirals and thoseeffected by stellar processes.

astro-ph;0605245	cosmography with cluster strong lensing	by stacking an ensemble of strong lensing clusters, we demonstrate thefeasibility of placing constraints on the dark energy equation of state. thisis achieved by using multiple images of sources at two or more distinctredshift planes. the sample of smooth clusters in our simulations is based onobservations of massive clusters and the distribution of background galaxies isconstructed using the hubble deep field. our source distribution reproduces theobserved redshift distribution of multiply imaged sources in abell 1689. thecosmology recovery depends on the number of image families with knownspectroscopic redshifts and the number of stacked clusters. our simulationssuggest that constraints comparable to those derived from other competingestablished techniques on a constant dark energy equation of state can beobtained using 10 to 40 clusters with 5 or more families of multiple images. wehave also studied the observational errors in the image redshifts andpositions. we find that spectroscopic redshifts and high resolution {\it hubblespace telescope} images are required to eliminate confidence contour relaxationrelative to the ideal case in our simulations. this suggests that the darkenergy equation of state, and other cosmological parameters, can be constrainedwith existing {\it hubble space telescope} images of lensing clusters coupledwith dedicated ground-based arc spectroscopy.

astro-ph;0702340	the mass function of high redshift seed black holes	in this paper we derive the mass function of seed black holes that resultfrom the central mass concentrated via disc accretion in collapsed haloes atredshift $z\approx 15$. using standard arguments including stability, we showthat these pre-galactic discs can assemble a significant mass concentration inthe inner regions, providing fuel for the formation and initial growth ofsuper-massive black holes. assuming that these mass concentrations do result incentral seed black holes, we determine the mass distribution of these seeds asa function of key halo properties. the seed mass distribution determined hereturns out to be asymmetric and skewed to higher masses. starting with theseinitial seeds, building up to $10^9$ solar masses by $z = 6$ to power thebright quasars is not a problem in the standard lcdm cosmogony. these seedblack holes in gas rich environments are likely to grow into the supermassiveblack holes at later times via mergers and accretion. gas accretion onto theseseeds at high redshift will produce miniquasars that likely play an importantrole in the reionization of the universe. some of these seed black holes on theother hand could be wandering in galaxy haloes as a consequence of frequentmergers, powering the off-nuclear ultra-luminous x-ray sources detected innearby galaxies.

astro-ph;0703126	the observed concentration-mass relation for galaxy clusters	the properties of clusters of galaxies offer key insights into the assemblyprocess of structure in the universe. numerical simulations of cosmic structureformation in a hierarchical, dark matter dominated universe suggest that galaxycluster concentrations, which are a measure of a halo's central density,decrease gradually with virial mass. however, cluster observations have yet toconfirm this correlation. the slopes of the run of measured concentrations withvirial mass are often either steeper or flatter than predicted by simulations.in this work, we present the most complete sample of observed clusterconcentrations and masses yet assembled, including new measurements for 10strong lensing clusters, thereby more than doubling the existing number ofstrong lensing concentration estimates. we fit a power law to the observedconcentrations as a function of virial mass, and find that the slope isconsistent with the slopes found in simulations, though our normalizationfactor is higher. observed lensing concentrations appear to be systematicallylarger than x-ray concentrations, a more pronounced effect than found insimulations. we also find that at fixed mass, the bulk of observed clusterconcentrations are distributed log-normally, with the exception of a fewanomalously high concentration clusters. we examine the physical processeslikely responsible for the discrepancy between lensing and x-rayconcentrations, and for the anomalously high concentrations in particular. theforthcoming millennium simulation results will offer the most comprehensivecomparison set to our findings of an observed concentration-mass power lawrelation.

astro-ph;9609008	lensing by galaxy halos in clusters of galaxies	weak shear maps of the outer regions of clusters have been successfully usedto map the distribution of mass at large radii from the cluster center. thetypical smoothing lengths employed thus far preclude the systematic study ofthe effects of galactic-scale substructure on the measured weak lensing signal.in this paper, we present two methods to infer the possible existence andextent of dark halos around bright cluster galaxies by quantifying the `local'weak lensing induced by them. the proposed methods are: direct radial averagingof the shear field in the vicinity of bright cluster members and amaximum-likelihood method to extract fiducial parameters characterizing galaxyhalos. we demonstrate using simulations that these observed local weak-sheareffects on galaxy scales within the cluster can be used to statisticallyconstrain the mean mass-to-light ratio, and fiducial parameters like the halosize, velocity dispersion and hence mass of cluster galaxies. we compare thetwo methods and investigate their relative drawbacks and merits in the contextof feasibility of application to hst cluster data, whereby we find that theprospects are promising for detection on stacking a minimum of 20 wfpc2 deepcluster fields.

astro-ph;9609049	distribution functions for clusters of galaxies from n-body simulations	we present the results of an attempt to adapt the distribution functionformalism to characterize large-scale structures like clusters of galaxies thatform in a cosmological n-body simulation. while galaxy clusters are systemsthat are not strictly in equilibrium, we show that their evolution cannevertheless be studied using a physically motivated extension of the languageof equilibrium stellar dynamics. restricting our analysis to the virializedregion, a prescription to limit the accessible phase-space is presented, whichpermits the construction of both the isotropic and the anisotropic distributionfunctions $f(e)$ and $f(e,l)$. the method is applied to models extracted from acatalogue of simulated clusters. clusters evolved in open and flat backgroundcosmologies are followed during the course of their evolution, and are found totransit through a sequence of what we define as `quasi-equilibrium' states. aninteresting feature is that the computed $f(e)$ is well fit by an exponentialform. we conclude that the dynamical evolution of a cluster, undergoingrelaxation punctuated by interactions and violent mergers with consequentenergy-exchange, can be studied both in a qualitative and quantitative fashionby following the time evolution of $f(e)$.

0809.2796	the abundance of lensing protoclusters	weak gravitational lensing provides a potentially powerful method for thedetection of clusters. in addition to cluster candidates, a large number ofobjects with possibly no optical or x-ray component have been detected inshear-selected samples. we develop an analytic model to investigate the claimof weinberg &amp; kamionkowski (2002) that unvirialised protoclusters account for asignificant number of these so-called "dark" lenses. in our model, aprotocluster consists of a small virialised region surrounded by in-fallingmatter. we find that, in order for a protocluster to simultaneously escapex-ray detection and create a detectable weak lensing signal, it must have asmall virial mass (~10^{13} \msun) and large total mass (~ 10^{15} \msun), witha relatively flat density profile outside of the virial radius. such objectswould be characterized by rising tangential shear profiles well beyond thevirial radius. we use a semi-analytic approach based on the excursion setformalism to estimate the abundance of lensing protoclusters with a lowprobability of x-ray detection. we find that they are extremely rare,accounting for less than 0.4 per cent of the total lenses in a survey withbackground galaxy density n = 30 arcmin^{-2} and an intrinsic ellipticitydispersion of 0.3. we conclude that lensing protoclusters with undetectablex-ray luminosities are too rare to account for a significant number of darklenses.

astro-ph;9708183	gamma-ray bursts from stellar remnants: probing the universe at high  redshift	a gamma-ray burst (grb) releases an amount of energy similar to that of asupernova explosion, which combined with its rapid variability suggests anorigin related to neutron stars or black holes. since these compact stellarremnants form from the most massive stars not long after their birth, gamma-raybursts should trace the star formation rate in the universe; we show that thegrb flux distribution is consistent with this. because of the strong evolutionof the star formation rate with redshift, it follows that the dimmest knownbursts have z ~ 6, much above the value usually quoted and beyond the mostdistant quasars. this explains the absence of bright galaxies in well-studiedgamma-ray burst error boxes. the increased distances imply a peak luminosity of8.3e51 erg/s and a rate density of 0.025 per million years per galaxy. thesevalues are 20 times higher and 150 times lower, respectively, than are impliedby fits with non-evolving grb rates. this means that grbs are either caused bya much rarer phenomenon than mergers of binary neutron stars, or theirgamma-ray emission is often invisible to us due to beaming. precise burstlocations from optical transients will discriminate between the various modelsfor grbs from stellar deaths, because the distance between progenitor birthplace and burst varies greatly among them. the dimmest grbs are then the mostdistant known objects, and may probe the universe at an age when the firststars were forming.

astro-ph;9812001	warped discs and the directional stability of jets in active galactic  nuclei	warped accretion discs in active galactic nuclei (agn) exert a torque on theblack hole that tends to align the rotation axis with the angular momentum ofthe outer disc. we compute the magnitude of this torque by solving numericallyfor the steady state shape of the warped disc, and verify that the analyticsolution of scheuer and feiler (1996) provides an excellent approximation. wegeneralise these results for discs with strong warps and arbitrary surfacedensity profiles, and calculate the timescale on which the black hole becomesaligned with the angular momentum in the outer disc. for massive holes andaccretion rates of the order of the eddington limit the alignment timescale isalways short (less than a myr), so that jets accelerated from the inner discregion provide a prompt tracer of the angular momentum of gas at large radii inthe disc. longer timescales are predicted for low luminosity systems, dependingon the degree of anisotropy in the disc's hydrodynamic response to shear andwarp, and for the final decay of modest warps at large radii in the disc thatare potentially observable via vlbi. we discuss the implications of this forthe inferred accretion history of those active galactic nuclei whose jetdirections appear to be stable over long timescales. the large energydeposition rate at modest disc radii during rapid realignment episodes shouldmake such objects transiently bright at optical and infrared wavelengths.

astro-ph;9812219	consequences of feedback from early supernovae for disk assembly	in this letter we examine the role of the first supernovae in proto-galaxies,their role in feedback and the consequences for disk assembly. extending thepicture proposed by dekel &amp; silk (1986), we argue that energetic supernovaewinds can expel baryons from all proto-galaxies with varying degrees ofefficiency. the fraction of baryons retained and hence available to assembleinto the baryonic disk is therefore, a function of the central velocitydispersion of the halo. such a coupling of the baryonic component to the darkhalo leads to the following interesting consequence, a prediction for a weakscaling of the zero-point of the tully-fisher relation or alternatively, themass-to-light ratio with the central velocity dispersion of the halo. onapplying to the case of the milky way halo, this feedback mechanism implies:(i) that the milky way halo lost approximately 10% of its original gas content;(ii) a range in the inferred redshift of formation $z_f$, and the local baryonfraction $f_b$ for the milky way that depends on the initial spin parameter ofthe halo. we find that for a low spin halo - $z_f &lt; 1$, $f_b \sim 2%$; for amedian spin halo - $z_f \sim 1 - 2.5$, $f_b \sim 5%$; and for a high spin halo- $z_f \sim 4 - 8$, $f_b \sim 20%$. the observationally determined ages for theoldest disk stars in the milky way seem to rule out a low value for the spinparameter. given the shape of the spin distribution of halos obtained in n-bodysimulations, while a high value of the spin parameter is not very probable, itis interesting to note that if this is indeed the case for the milky way halo,then feedback processes can cause the local baryon fraction to differsignificantly from the universal value.

astro-ph;9911468	gamma-ray bursts and the history of star formation	popular models for the origin of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) include short-livedmassive stars as the progenitors of the fireballs. hence the redshiftdistribution of grbs should track the cosmic star formation rate of massivestars accurately. a significant proportion of high-mass star formation activityappears to occur in regions that are obscured from view in the optical wavebandby interstellar dust. the amount of dust-enshrouded star formation activitytaking place has been estimated by observing the thermal radiation from thedust that has been heated by young stars in the far-infrared and submillimetrewavebands. here we discuss an alternative probe - the redshift distribution ofgrbs. grbs are detectable at the highest redshifts, and because gamma rays arenot absorbed by dust, the redshift distribution of grbs should therefore beunaffected by dust extinction. at present the redshifts of grbs can only bedetermined from the associated optical transient emission; however, usefulinformation about the prevalence of dust-obscured star formation can also beobtained from the ratio of grbs with and without an associated opticaltransient. eight grbs currently have spectroscopic redshifts. once about ahundred redshifts are known, the population of grbs will provide an importanttest of different models of the star formation history of the universe.
