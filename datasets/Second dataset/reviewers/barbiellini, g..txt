0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0906.1446	observation of grbs with agile	since its early phases of operation, the agile satellite is observing gammaray bursts (grbs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders ofmagnitude. in the hard x-ray band the superagile imager provides localizationof about one grb/month plus the detection of 1-2 grbs per month out of itsfield of view. the mini-calorimeter detects about one grb/week in the 350kev -100mev energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.in fact, the on-board mcal trigger logic, implemented for the first time ontime windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for veryshort bursts detection. the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid), sensitive in the30mev - 30gev range, firmly detected three grbs (grb080514b, grb090401b andgrb090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. moreover,all grbs localized by other spacecrafts inside the grid field of view arecurrently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. inthis paper we review the status of the observation of grbs with agile, withparticular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.

0908.1908	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from the short gamma-ray  burst grb 090510	short gamma-ray bursts (grbs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a specialclass of grbs of great interest. we report the detection by the agile satelliteof the short grb 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: aprompt phase lasting ~ 200 msec and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. theprompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 mev range with a spectrumcharacterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 mev, in this phase, nosignificant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. at the end of theprompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 mev is detected showing apower-law time decay of the flux of the type t^-1.3 and a broad-band spectrumremarkably different from that of the prompt phase. it extends from sub-mev tohundreds of mev energies with a photon index alpha ~ 1.5. grb 090510 providesthe first case of a short grb with delayed gamma-ray emission. we present thetiming and spectral data of grb 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkableproperties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short grbs.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.4895	monitoring the hard x-ray sky with superagile	superagile is the hard x-ray monitor of the agile gamma ray mission, in orbitsince 23$^{rd}$ april 2007. it is an imaging experiment based on a set of fourindependent silicon strip detectors, equipped with one-dimensional coded masks,operating in the nominal energy range 18-60 kev. the main goal of superagile isthe observation of cosmic sources simultaneously with the main gamma-ray agileexperiment, the gamma ray imaging detector (grid). given its$\sim$steradian-wide field of view and its $\sim$15 mcrab day-sensitivity,superagile is also well suited for the long-term monitoring of galactic compactobjects and the detection of bright transients. the superagile detectorproperties and design allow for a 6 arcmin angular resolution in each of thetwo independent orthogonal projections of the celestial coordinates. photon byphoton data are continuously available by the experiment telemetry, and areused to derive images and fluxes of individual sources, with integration timesdepending on the source intensity and position in the field of view. in thispaper we report on the main scientific results achieved by superagile over itsfirst two years in orbit, until april 2009.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

0911.3743	temporal properties of gx 301-2 over a year-long observation with  superagile	we present the long-term monitoring of the high mass x-ray binary gx 301-2performed with the superagile instrument on-board the agile mission. the sourcewas monitored in the 20-60 kev energy band during the first year of the missionfrom 2007 july 17 to 2008 august 31, covering about one whole orbital periodand three more pre-periastron passages for a total net observation time ofabout 3.7 ms. the superagile dataset represents one of the most continuous andcomplete monitoring at hard x-ray energies of the 41.5 day long binary periodavailable to date. the source behavior was characterized at all orbital phasesin terms of hard x-ray flux, spectral hardness, spin period history, pulsedfraction and pulse shape profile. we also complemented the superagileobservations with the soft x-ray data of the rossixte/asm. our analysis shows aclear orbital modulation of the spectral hardness, with peaks in correspondencewith the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25. the hardness peaks we foundcould be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order toexplain the orbital light curve modulation of gx 301-2. timing analysis of thepulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the about 680 s pulse periodis consistent with the previous observations, although there is evidence of aslight decrease in the spin-down rate. the analysis of the hard x-ray pulsedemission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of theorbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron,and a clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in turn stronglyanti-correlated with the source intensity.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1306.5735	constraints on the galactic population of tev pulsar wind nebulae using  fermi large area telescope observations	pulsar wind nebulae (pwne) have been established as the most populous classof tev gamma-ray emitters. since launch, the fermi large area telescope(lat)identified five high-energy (100mev &lt;e&lt; 100 gev) gamma-ray sources aspwne, and detected a large number of pwne candidates, all powered by young andenergetic pulsars. the wealth of multi-wavelength data available and the newresults provided by fermi-lat give us an opportunity to find new pwne and toexplore the radiative processes taking place in known ones. the tev gamma-rayunidentifiedsources (unids) are the best candidates for finding new pwne. using45 months of fermi-lat data for energies above 10 gev, an analysis wasperformed near the position of 58tev pwne and unids within 5deg of the galacticplane to establish new constraints on pwne properties and find new clues on thenature of unids. of the 58 sources, 30 were detected, and this work providestheir gamma-rayfluxes for energies above 10 gev. the spectral energydistributions (sed) andupper limits, in the multi-wavelength context, alsoprovide new information on the source nature and can help distinguish betweenemission scenarios, i.e. between classification as a pulsar candidate or as apwn candidate. six new gev pwne candidates are described in detail and comparedwith existing models. a population study of gev pwne candidates as a functionof the pulsar/pwn system characteristics is presented.

1308.5654	search for cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission in galaxy clusters	current theories predict relativistic hadronic particle populations inclusters of galaxies in addition to the already observed relativistic leptons.in these scenarios hadronic interactions give rise to neutral pions which decayinto $\gamma$ rays, that are potentially observable with the large areatelescope (lat) on board the fermi space telescope. we present a jointlikelihood analysis searching for spatially extended $\gamma$-ray emission atthe locations of 50 galaxy clusters in 4 years of fermi-lat data under theassumption of the universal cosmic-ray model proposed by pinzke &amp; pfrommer(2010). we find an excess at a significance of $2.7\sigma$ which upon closerinspection is however correlated to individual excess emission towards threegalaxy clusters: abell 400, abell 1367 and abell 3112. we discuss these casesin detail and conservatively attribute the emission to unmodeled background(for example, radio galaxies within the clusters). through the combinedanalysis of 50 clusters we exclude hadronic injection efficiencies in simplehadronic models above 21% and establish limits on the cosmic-ray to thermalpressure ratio within the virial radius, $r_{200}$, to be below 1.2-1.4%depending on the morphological classification. in addition we derive new limitson the $\gamma$-ray flux from individual clusters in our sample.

1310.0828	dark matter constraints from observations of 25 milky way satellite  galaxies with the fermi large area telescope	the dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies of the milky way are some of the mostdark-matter-dominated objects known. due to their proximity, high dark mattercontent, and lack of astrophysical backgrounds, dwarf spheroidal galaxies arewidely considered to be among the most promising targets for the indirectdetection of dark matter via gamma rays. here we report on gamma-rayobservations of 25 milky way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies based on 4years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data. none of the dwarf galaxies aresignificantly detected in gamma rays, and we present gamma-ray flux upperlimits between 500 mev and 500 gev. we determine the dark matter content of 18dwarf spheroidal galaxies from stellar kinematic data and combine latobservations of 15 dwarf galaxies to constrain the dark matter annihilationcross section. we set some of the tightest constraints to date on the theannihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 2 gev and 10 tev intoprototypical standard model channels. we find these results to be robustagainst systematic uncertainties in the lat instrument performance, diffusegamma-ray background modeling, and assumed dark matter density profile.

1410.3696	the spectrum of isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 100 mev and  820 gev	the {\gamma}-ray sky can be decomposed into individually detected sources,diffuse emission attributed to the interactions of galactic cosmic rays withgas and radiation fields, and a residual all-sky emission component commonlycalled the isotropic diffuse {\gamma}-ray background (igrb). the igrb comprisesall extragalactic emissions too faint or too diffuse to be resolved in a givensurvey, as well as any residual galactic foregrounds that are approximatelyisotropic. the first igrb measurement with the large area telescope (lat) onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope (fermi) used 10 months of sky-surveydata and considered an energy range between 200 mev and 100 gev. improvementsin event selection and characterization of cosmic-ray backgrounds, betterunderstanding of the diffuse galactic emission, and a longer data accumulationof 50 months, allow for a refinement and extension of the igrb measurement withthe lat, now covering the energy range from 100 mev to 820 gev. the igrbspectrum shows a significant high-energy cutoff feature, and can be welldescribed over nearly four decades in energy by a power law with exponentialcutoff having a spectral index of $2.32\pm0.02$ and a break energy of$(279\pm52)$ gev using our baseline diffuse galactic emission model. the totalintensity attributed to the igrb is $(7.2\pm0.6) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ above 100 mev, with an additional $+15$%/$-30$% systematicuncertainty due to the galactic diffuse foregrounds.

1411.4915	gamma-ray flaring activity from the gravitationally lensed blazar pks  1830-211 observed by fermi lat	the large area telescope (lat) on board the fermi gamma-ray space telescoperoutinely detects the highly dust-absorbed, reddened, and mev-peaked flatspectrum radio quasar pks 1830-211 (z=2.507). its apparent isotropic gamma-rayluminosity (e&gt;100 mev) averaged over $\sim$ 3 years of observations and peakingon 2010 october 14/15 at 2.9 x 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightesthigh-redshift fermi blazars. no published model with a single lens can accountfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. based on radioobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 daysafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. two large gamma-rayflares of pks 1830-211 have been detected by the lat in the considered periodand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. this allowsus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between thetwo lensed images. swift xrt observations from a dedicated target ofopportunity program indicate a hard spectrum and with no significantcorrelation of x-ray flux with the gamma-ray variability. the spectral energydistribution can be modeled with inverse compton scattering of thermal photonsfrom the dusty torus. the implications of the lat data in terms of variability,the lack of evident delayed flare events, and different radio and gamma-rayflux ratios are discussed. microlensing effects, absorption, size and locationof the emitting regions, the complex mass distribution of the system, anenergy-dependent inner structure of the source, and flux suppression by thelens galaxy for one image path may be considered as hypotheses forunderstanding our results.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

astro-ph;0112432	a fireworks model for gamma-ray bursts	the energetics of the long duration grb phenomenon is compared with models ofa rotating black hole (bh) in a strong magnetic field generated by an accretingtorus. a rough estimate of the energy extracted from a rotating bh with theblandford-znajek mechanism is obtained with a very simple assumption: aninelastic collision between the rotating bh and the torus. the grb energyemission is attributed to an high magnetic field that breaks down the vacuumaround the bh and gives origin to a e+- fireball. its subsequent evolution ishypothesized, in analogy with the in-flight decay of an elementary particle, toevolve in two distinct phases. the first one occurs close to the engine and isresponsible of energizing and collimating the shells. the second one consistsof a radiation dominated expansion, which correspondingly accelerates therelativistic photon--particle fluid and ends at the transparency time. thismechanism simply predicts that the observed lorentz factor is determined by theproduct of the lorentz factor of the shell close to the engine and the lorentzfactor derived by the expansion. an anisotropy in the fireball propagation isthus naturally produced, whose degree depends on the bulk lorentz factor at theend of the collimation phase.

0810.1516	high-resolution timing observations of spin-powered pulsars with the  agile gamma-ray telescope	agile is a small gamma-ray astronomy satellite mission of the italian spaceagency dedicated to high-energy astrophysics launched in 2007 april. its 1microsecond absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity inthe 30 mev-30 gev range, with simultaneous x-ray monitoring in the 18-60 kevband, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following upon the cgro/egret heritage. in this paper we present the first agile timingresults on the known gamma-ray pulsars vela, crab, geminga and b 1706-44. thedata were collected from 2007 july to 2008 april, exploiting the missionscience verification phase, the instrument timing calibration and the earlyobserving pointing program. thanks to its large field of view, agile collecteda large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (about 10,000 pulsedcounts for vela) in only few months of observations. the coupling of agiletiming capabilities, simultaneous radio/x-ray monitoring and new tools aimed atprecise photon phasing, exploiting also timing noise correction, unveiled newinteresting features at sub-millisecond level in the pulsars' high-energylight-curves.

0810.1676	agile detection of intense gamma-ray emission from the blazar pks  1510-089	we report the detection by the agile (astro-rivelatore gamma a immaginileggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source aglj1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar pks 1510-089, during ten daysof observations from 23 august to 1 september 2007. during the observationperiod, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitoredby the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt). the simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us tostudy the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on thesynchrotron and inverse compton (ic) emission mechanisms. agile observed thesource with its two co-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector and thehard x-ray imager super-agile sensitive in the 30 mev - 50 gev and 18 - 60 kevbands, respectively. between 23 and 27 august 2007, agile detected gamma-rayemission from pks 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degreesoff-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}for photon energy above 100 mev. in the following period, 28 august - 1september, after a satellite re-pointing, agile detected the source at about 35degrees off-axis, with an average flux (e &gt; 100 mev) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no emission was detected by super-agile, with a 3-sigmaupper limit of 45 mcrab in 200 ksec. the spectral energy distribution ismodelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton (ssc) emissionplus contributions by external photons: the ssc emission contributes primarilyto the x-ray band, whereas the contribution of the ic from the external discand the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.
