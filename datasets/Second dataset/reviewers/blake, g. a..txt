0707.0304	cold disks: spitzer spectroscopy of disks around young stars with large  gaps	we have identified four circumstellar disks with a deficit of dust emissionfrom their inner 15-50 au. all four stars have f-g spectral type, and wereuncovered as part of the spitzer space telescope ``cores to disks'' legacyprogram infrared spectrograph (irs) first look survey of ~100 pre-main sequencestars. modeling of the spectral energy distributions indicates a reduction indust density by factors of 100-1000 from disk radii between ~0.4 and 15-50 au,but with massive gas-rich disks at larger radii. this large contrast betweenthe inner and outer disk has led us to use the term `cold disks' to distinguishthese unusual systems. however, hot dust [0.02-0.2 mmoon] is still presentclose to the central star (r ~0.8 au). we introduce the 30/13 micron, fluxdensity ratio as a new diagnostic for identifying cold disks. the mechanismsfor dust clearing over such large gaps are discussed. though rare, cold disksare likely in transition from an optically thick to an optically thin state,and so offer excellent laboratories for the study of planet formation.

0908.4153	c2d spitzer-irs spectra of disks around t tauri stars. iv. crystalline  silicates	dust grains in the planet forming regions around young stars are expected tobe heavily processed due to coagulation, fragmentation and crystallization.this paper focuses on the crystalline silicate dust grains in protoplanetarydisks. as part of the cores to disks legacy program, we obtained more than ahundred spitzer/irs spectra of ttauri stars. more than 3/4 of our objects showat least one crystalline silicate emission feature that can be essentiallyattributed to mg-rich silicates. observational properties of the crystallinefeatures seen at lambda &gt; 20 mu correlate with each other, while they arelargely uncorrelated with the properties of the amorphous silicate 10 mufeature. this supports the idea that the irs spectra essentially probe twoindependent disk regions: a warm zone (&lt; 1 au) emitting at lambda ~ 10 mu and amuch colder region emitting at lambda &gt; 20 mu (&lt; 10 au). we identify acrystallinity paradox, as the long-wavelength crystalline silicate features are3.5 times more frequently detected (~55 % vs. ~15%) than the crystallinefeatures arising from much warmer disk regions. this suggests that the disk hasan inhomogeneous dust composition within ~10 au. the abundant crystallinesilicates found far from their presumed formation regions suggests efficientoutward radial transport mechanisms in the disks. the analysis of the shape andstrength of both the amorphous 10 mu feature and the crystalline feature around23 mu provides evidence for the prevalence of micron-sized grains in upperlayers of disks. their presence in disk atmospheres suggests efficient verticaldiffusion, likely accompanied by grain-grain fragmentation to balance theefficient growth expected. finally, the depletion of submicron-sized grainspoints toward removal mechanisms such as stellar winds or radiation pressure.

0909.0975	radiative transfer models of mid-infrared h2o lines in the  planet-forming region of circumstellar disks	the study of warm molecular gas in the inner regions of protoplanetary disksis of key importance for the study of planet formation and especially for thetransport of h2o and organic molecules to the surfaces of rockyplanets/satellites. recent spitzer observations have shown that themid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks are covered in emission lines dueto water and other molecules. here, we present a non-lte 2d radiative transfermodel of water lines in the 10-36 mum range that can be used to constrain theabundance structure of water vapor, given an observed spectrum, and show thatan assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (lte) does not accuratelyestimate the physical conditions of the water vapor emission zones. by applyingthe model to published spitzer spectra we find that: 1) most water lines aresubthermally excited, 2) the gas-to-dust ratio must be one to two orders ofmagnitude higher than the canonical interstellar medium ratio of 100-200, and3) the gas temperature must be higher than the dust temperature, and 4) thewater vapor abundance in the disk surface must be truncated beyond ~ 1 au. alow efficiency of water formation below ~ 300 k may naturally result in a lowerwater abundance beyond a certain radius. however, we find that chemistry, maynot be sufficient to produce an abundance drop of many orders of magnitude andspeculate that the depletion may also be caused by vertical turbulent diffusionof water vapor from the superheated surface to regions below the snow line,where the water can freeze out and be transported to the midplane as part ofthe general dust settling. such a vertical cold finger effect is likely to beefficient due to the lack of a replenishment mechanism of large, water-icecoated dust grains to the disk surface.

0909.5595	evidence for dust clearing through resolved submillimeter imaging	mid-infrared spectrophotometric observations have revealed a small sub-classof circumstellar disks with spectral energy distributions (seds) suggestive oflarge inner gaps with low dust content. however, such data provide only anindirect and model-dependent method of finding central holes. imaging ofprotoplanetry disks provides an independent check of sed modeling. we presenthere the direct characterization of three 33-47 au radii inner gaps, in thedisks around lkha 330, sr 21n and hd 135344b, via 340 ghz (880 micron) dustcontinuum aperture synthesis observations obtained with the submillimeter array(sma). the large gaps are fully resolved at ~0\farcs3 by the sma observationsand mostly empty of dust, with less than 1 - 7.5 x 10^-6 msolar of fine grainedsolids inside the holes. gas (as traced by atomic accretion markers and co 4.7micron rovibrational emission) is still present in the inner regions of allthree disks. for each, the inner hole exhibits a relatively steep rise in dustemission to the outer disk, a feature more likely to originate from thegravitational influence of a companion body than from a process expected toshow a more shallow gradient like grain growth. importantly, the good agreementof the spatially resolved data and spectrophotometry-based models lendsconfidence to current interpretations of seds, wherein the significant dustemission deficits arise from disks with inner gaps or holes. further sed-basedsearches can therefore be expected to yield numerous additional candidates thatcan be examined at high spatial resolution.

1005.2031	origin of the hot gas in low-mass protostars: herschel-pacs spectroscopy  of hh 46	'water in star-forming regions with herschel' (wish) is a herschel keyprogramme aimed at understanding the physical and chemical structure of youngstellar objects (ysos) with a focus on water and related species. the low-massprotostar hh 46 was observed with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) on the herschel space observatory to measure emission inh2o, co, oh, [oi], and [cii] lines located between 63 and 186 um. theexcitation and spatial distribution of emission can disentangle the differentheating mechanisms of ysos, with better spatial resolution and sensitivity thanpreviously possible. far-ir line emission is detected at the position of theprotostar and along the outflow axis. the oh emission is concentrated at thecentral position, co emission is bright at the central position and along theoutflow, and h2o emission is concentrated in the outflow. in addition, [oi]emission is seen in low-velocity gas, assumed to be related to the envelope,and is also seen shifted up to 170 km/s in both the red- and blue-shifted jets.envelope models are constructed based on previous observational constraints.they indicate that passive heating of a spherical envelope by the protostellarluminosity cannot explain the high-excitation molecular gas detected with pacs,including co lines with upper levels at &gt;2500 k above the ground state.instead, warm co and h2o emission is probably produced in the walls of anoutflow-carved cavity in the envelope, which are heated by uv photons andnon-dissociative c-type shocks. the bright oh and [oi] emission is attributedto j-type shocks in dense gas close to the protostar. in the scenario describedhere, the combined cooling by far-ir lines within the central spatial pixel isestimated to be 2 \times 10-2 l_sun, with 60-80% attributed to j- and c-typeshocks produced by interactions between the jet and the envelope.

1005.3472	first results of the herschel key program 'dust, ice and gas in time':  dust and gas spectroscopy of hd 100546	we present far-infrared spectroscopic observations, taken with thephotodetector array camera and spectrometer (pacs) on the herschel spaceobservatory, of the protoplanetary disk around the pre-main-sequence star hd100546. these observations are the first within the digit herschel key program,which aims to follow the evolution of dust, ice, and gas from young stellarobjects still embedded in their parental molecular cloud core, through thefinal pre-main-sequence phases when the circumstellar disks are dissipated.  our aim is to improve the constraints on temperature and chemical compositionof the crystalline olivines in the disk of hd 100546 and to give an inventoryof the gas lines present in its far-infrared spectrum. the 69 \mu\m feature isanalyzed in terms of position and shape to derive the dust temperature andcomposition. furthermore, we detected 32 emission lines from five gaseousspecies and measured their line fluxes. the 69 \mu\m emission comes either fromdust grains with ~70 k at radii larger than 50 au, as suggested by blackbodyfitting, or it arises from ~200 k dust at ~13 au, close to the midplane, assupported by radiative transfer models. we also conclude that the forsteritecrystals have few defects and contain at most a few percent iron by mass.forbidden line emission from [cii] at 157 \mu\m and [oi] at 63 and 145 \mu\m,most likely due to photodissociation by stellar photons, is detected.furthermore, five h2o and several oh lines are detected. we also found high-jrotational transition lines of co, with rotational temperatures of ~300 k forthe transitions up to j=22-21 and t~800 k for higher transitions.

1007.0644	c2d spitzer-irs spectra of disks around t tauri stars v. spectral  decomposition	(abridged) dust particles evolve in size and lattice structure inprotoplanetary disks, due to coagulation, fragmentation and crystallization,and are radially and vertically mixed in disks. this paper aims at determiningthe mineralogical composition and size distribution of the dust grains in disksaround 58 t tauri stars observed with spitzer/irs. we present a spectraldecomposition model that reproduces the irs spectra over the full spectralrange. the model assumes two dust populations: a warm component responsible forthe 10\mu m emission arising from the disk inner regions and a colder componentresponsible for the 20-30\mu m emission, arising from more distant regions. weshow evidence for a significant size distribution flattening compared to thetypical mrn distribution, providing an explanation for the usual boxy 10\mu mfeature profile generally observed. we reexamine the crystallinity paradox,observationally identified by olofsson et al. (2009), and we find asimultaneous enrichment of the crystallinity in both the warm and cold regions,while grain sizes in both components are uncorrelated. our modeling results donot show evidence for any correlations between the crystallinity and either thestar spectral type, or the x-ray luminosity (for a subset of the sample). thesize distribution flattening may suggests that grain coagulation is a slightlymore effective process than fragmentation in disk atmospheres, and that thisimbalance may last over most of the t tauri phase. this result may also pointtoward small grain depletion via strong stellar winds or radiation pressure inthe upper layers of disk. the non negligible cold crystallinity fractionssuggests efficient radial mixing processes in order to distribute crystallinegrains at large distances from the central object, along with possible nebularshocks in outer regions of disks that can thermally anneal amorphous grains.

1007.1248	water vapor toward starless cores: the herschel view	swas and odin provided stringent upper limits on the gas phase waterabundance of dark clouds (x(h2o) &lt; 7x10^-9). we investigate the chemistry ofwater vapor in starless cores beyond the previous upper limits using the highlyimproved angular resolution and sensitivity of herschel and measure theabundance of water vapor during evolutionary stages just preceding starformation. high spectral resolution observations of the fundamental ortho water(o-h2o) transition (557 ghz) were carried out with herschel hifi toward twostarless cores: b68, a bok globule, and l1544, a prestellar core embedded inthe taurus molecular cloud complex. the rms in the brightness temperaturemeasured for the b68 and l1544 spectra is 2.0 and 2.2 mk, respectively, in avelocity bin of 0.59 km s^-1. the continuum level is 3.5+/-0.2 mk in b68 and11.4+/-0.4 mk in l1544. no significant feature is detected in b68 and the 3sigma upper limit is consistent with a column density of o-h2o n(o-h2o) &lt;2.5x10^13 cm^-2, or a fractional abundance x(o-h2o) &lt; 1.3x10^-9, more than anorder of magnitude lower than the swas upper limit on this source. the l1544spectrum shows an absorption feature at a 5 sigma level from which we obtainthe first value of the o-h2o column density ever measured in dark clouds:n(o-h2o) = (8+/-4)x10^12 cm^-2. the corresponding fractional abundance isx(o-h2o) ~ 5x10^-9 at radii &gt; 7000 au and ~2x10^-10 toward the center. theradiative transfer analysis shows that this is consistent with a x(o-h2o)profile peaking at ~10^-8, 0.1 pc away from the core center, where bothfreeze-out and photodissociation are negligible. herschel has provided thefirst measurement of water vapor in dark regions. prestellar cores such asl1544 (with their high central densities, strong continuum, and largeenvelopes) are very promising tools to finally shed light on the solid/vaporbalance of water in molecular clouds.

1007.5470	herschel observations of extra-ordinary sources (hexos): observations of  h2o and its isotopologues towards orion kl	we report the detection of more than 48 velocity-resolved ground rotationalstate transitions of h2(16)o, h2(18)o, and h2(17)o - most for the first time -in both emission and absorption toward orion kl using herschel/hifi. we showthat a simple fit, constrained to match the known emission and absorptioncomponents along the line of sight, is in excellent agreement with the spectralprofiles of all the water lines. using the measured h2(18)o line fluxes, whichare less affected by line opacity than their h2(16)o counterparts, and anescape probability method, the column densities of h2(18)o associated with eachemission component are derived. we infer total water abundances of 7.4e-5,1.0e-5, and 1.6e-5 for the plateau, hot core, and extended warm gas,respectively. in the case of the plateau, this value is consistent withprevious measures of the orion-kl water abundance as well as those of othermolecular outflows. in the case of the hot core and extended warm gas, thesevalues are somewhat higher than water abundances derived for other quiescentclouds, suggesting that these regions are likely experiencing enhancedwater-ice sublimation from (and reduced freeze-out onto) grain surfaces due tothe warmer dust in these sources.

1008.0981	recurring millimeter flares as evidence for star-star magnetic  reconnection events in the dq tauri pms binary system	observations of the t tauri spectroscopic binary dq tau in april 2008captured an unusual flare at 3 mm, which peaked at an observed max flux of 0.5jy (about 27x the quiescent value). here we present follow-up mm observationsthat demonstrate a periodicity to the phenomenon. while monitoring 3 newperiastron encounters, we detect flares within 17.5 hrs (or 4.6%) of theorbital phase of the first reported flare, and we constrain the main emittingregion to a stellar height of 3.7-6.8 rstar. the recorded activity isconsistent with the proposed picture for synchrotron emission initiated by amagnetic reconnection event when the two stellar magnetospheres of the highlyeccentric (e=0.556) binary are believed to collide near periastron as the starsapproach a minimum separation of 8 rstar (~13 rsolar). the similar light curvedecay profiles allow us to estimate an average flare duration of 30 hrs.assuming one mm flare per orbit, dq tau could spend approximately 8% of its15.8-d orbital period in an elevated flux state. our analysis of the mmemission provides an upper limit of 5% on the linear polarization. we discussthe extent to which a severely entangled magnetic field structure and faradayrotation effects are likely to reduce the observed polarization fraction. wealso predict that, for the current picture, the stellar magnetospheres must bemisaligned at a significant angle or, alternatively, that the topologies of theouter magnetospheres are poorly described by a well-ordered dipole inside aradius of 7 rstar. finally, to investigate whether reorganization of themagnetic field during the interaction affects mass accretion, we also presentsimultaneous optical (vri) monitoring, as an established tracer of accretionactivity in this system. we find that an accretion event can occur coincidentin both time and duration with the synchrotron fallout of a magneticreconnection event.

1012.3936	hunting for millimeter flares from magnetic reconnection in pre-main  sequence spectroscopic binaries	recent observations of the low-mass pre-main sequence, eccentricspectroscopic binaries dq tau and v773 tau a reveal that their millimeterspectrum is occasionally dominated by flares from non-thermal emissionprocesses. the transient activity is believed to be synchrotron in nature,resulting from powerful magnetic reconnection events when the separate magneticstructures of the binary components are capable of interacting and forced toreorganize, typically near periastron. we conducted the first systematic studyof the millimeter variability toward a sample of 12 pms spectroscopic binarieswith the aim to characterize the proliferation of flares amongst sources likelyto experience similar interbinary reconnection events. the source sampleconsists of short-period, close-separation binaries that possess either a highorbital eccentricity or a circular orbit. using the mambo2 array on the iram30m telescope, we carried out continuous monitoring at 1.25 mm over a 4-nightperiod during which all of the high-eccentricity binaries approachedperiastron. we also obtained simultaneous optical vri measurements, since astrong link is often observed between stellar reconnection events and opticalbrightenings. uz tau e is the only source to be detected at millimeterwavelengths: it exhibited significant variation; it is also the only source toundergo strong simultaneous optical variability. the binary possesses thelargest orbital eccentricity in the current sample, a predicted factor instar-star magnetic interaction events. with orbital parameters and variableaccretion activity similar to dq tau, the millimeter behavior of uz tau e drawsmany parallels to the dq tau model for colliding magnetospheres. however, onthe basis of our observations alone, we cannot determine whether thevariability is repetitive, or if it could also be due to variable free-freeemission in an ionized wind.

1101.2486	ice and dust in the quiescent medium of isolated dense cores	the relation between ices in the envelopes and disks surrounding ysos andthose in the quiescent interstellar medium is investigated. for a sample of 31stars behind isolated dense cores, ground-based and spitzer spectra andphotometry in the 1-25 um wavelength range are combined. the baseline for thebroad and overlapping ice features is modeled, using calculated spectra ofgiants, h2o ice and silicates. the adopted extinction curve is derivedempirically. its high resolution allows for the separation of continuum andfeature extinction. the extinction between 13-25 um is ~50% relative to that at2.2 um. the strengths of the 6.0 and 6.85 um absorption bands are in line withthose of ysos. thus, their carriers, which, besides h2o and ch3oh, may includenh4+, hcooh, h2co and nh3, are readily formed in the dense core phase, beforestars form. the 3.53 um c-h stretching mode of solid ch3oh was discovered. thech3oh/h2o abundance ratios of 5-12% are larger than upper limits in the taurusmolecular cloud. the initial ice composition, before star formation occurs,therefore depends on the environment. signs of thermal and energetic processingthat were found toward some ysos are absent in the ices toward backgroundstars. finally, the peak optical depth of the 9.7 um band of silicates relativeto the continuum extinction at 2.2 um is significantly shallower than in thediffuse interstellar medium. this extends the results of chiar et al.

1102.4976	warm dust resolved in the cold disk around t cha with vlti/amber	the transition between massive class ii circumstellar disks and class iiidebris disks, with dust residuals, has not yet been clearly understood. disksare expected to dissipate with time, and dust clearing in the inner regions canbe the consequence of several mechanisms. planetary formation is one of themthat will possibly open a gap inside the disk. according to recent models basedon photometric observations, t cha is expected to present a large gap withinits disk, meaning that an inner dusty disk is supposed to have survived closeto the star. we investigate this scenario with new near-infraredinterferometric observations. we observed t cha in the h and k bands using theamber instrument at vlti and used the mcfost radiative transfer code to modelthe sed of t cha and the interferometric observations simultaneously and totest the scenario of an inner dusty structure. we also used a toy model of abinary to check that a companion close to the star can reproduce ourobservations. the scenario of a close (few mas) companion cannot satisfactorilyreproduce the visibilities and sed, while a disk model with a large gap and aninner ring producing the bulk of the emission (in h and k-bands) close to 0.1au is able to account for all the observations. with this study, the presenceof an optically thick inner dusty disk close to the star and dominating the hand k- bands emission is confirmed. according to our model, the large gapextends up to ~ 7.5 au. this points toward a companion (located at several au)gap-opening scenario to explain the morphology of t cha.

0808.1099	the texes survey for h2 emission from protoplanetary disks	we report the results of a search for pure rotational molecular hydrogenemission from the circumstellar environments of young stellar objects withdisks using the texas echelon cross echelle spectrograph (texes) on the nasainfrared telescope facility and the gemini north observatory. we searched formid-infrared h2 emission in the s(1), s(2), and s(4) transitions. keck/nirspecobservations of the h2 s(9) transition were included for some sources as anadditional constraint on the gas temperature. we detected h2 emission from 6 of29 sources observed: ab aur, doar 21, elias 29, gss 30 irs 1, gv tau n, and hltau. four of the six targets with detected emission are class i sources thatshow evidence for surrounding material in an envelope in addition to acircumstellar disk. in these cases, we show that accretion shock heating is aplausible excitation mechanism. the detected emission lines are narrow (~10km/s), centered at the stellar velocity, and spatially unresolved at scales of0.4 arcsec, which is consistent with origin from a disk at radii 10-50 au fromthe star. in cases where we detect multiple emission lines, we derivetemperatures &gt; 500 k from ~1 m_earth of gas. our upper limits for thenon-detections place upper limits on the amount of h2 gas with t &gt; 500 k ofless than a few earth masses. such warm gas temperatures are significantlyhigher than the equilibrium dust temperatures at these radii, suggesting thatthe gas is decoupled from the dust in the regions we are studying and thatprocesses such as uv, x-ray, and accretion heating may be important.

astro-ph;0107006	h2 and co emission from disks around ttauri and herbigae  pre-main-sequence stars and from debris disks around young stars: warm and  cold circumstellar gas	we present iso-sws observations of h2 pure-rotational line emission from thedisks around low and intermediate mass pre-main-sequence stars as well as fromyoung stars thought to be surrounded by debris disks. we detect `warm' (t ~100-200 k) h2 gas around many sources, including tentatively the debris-diskobjects. the mass of this warm gas ranges from ~1e-4 solar mass up to 8e-3solar mass, and can constitute a non-negligible fraction of the total diskmass. complementary single-dish 12co 3-2, 13co 3-2 and 12co 6-5 observationshave been obtained as well. these transitions probe cooler gas at t ~ 20-80 k.most objects show a double-peaked co emission profile characteristic of a diskin keplerian rotation, consistent with interferometer data on the lower-jlines. the ratios of the 12co 3-2/ 13co 3-2 integrated fluxes indicate that12co 3-2 is optically thick but that 13co 3-2 is optically thin or at mostmoderately thick. the 13co 3-2 lines have been used to estimate the cold gasmass. if a h2/co conversion factor of 1e4 is adopted, the derived cold gasmasses are factors of 10-200 lower than those deduced from 1.3 millimeter dustemission assuming a gas/dust ratio of 100,in accordance with previous studies.the warm gas is typically 1-10 % of the total mass deduced from millimetercontinuum emission, but can increase up to 100% or more for the debris-diskobjects. thus, residual molecular gas may persist into the debris-disk phase.no significant evolution in the h2, co or dust masses is found for stars withages in the range of 1e6-1e7 years, although a decrease is found for the olderdebris-disk star beta pictoris. existing models fail to explain the amount ofwarm gas quantitatively.

astro-ph;0112163	high resolution 4.7 um keck/nirspec spectra of protostars. i: ices and  infalling gas in the disk of l1489 irs	we explore the infrared m band (4.7 um) spectrum of the class i protostarl1489 irs in the taurus molecular cloud. this is the highest resolution widecoverage spectrum at this wavelength of a low mass protostar observed to date(r=25,000; dv=12 km/s). many narrow absorption lines of gas phase 12co, 13co,and c18o are detected, as well as a prominent band of solid 12co. the gas phase12co lines have red shifted absorption wings (up to 100 km/s), likelyoriginating from warm disk material falling toward the central object. theisotopes and the 12co line wings are successfully fitted with a contractingdisk model of this evolutionary transitional object (hogerheijde 2001). thisshows that the inward motions seen in millimeter wave emission lines continueto within ~0.1 au from the star. the colder parts of the disk are traced by theprominent co ice band. the band profile results from co in 'polar' ices (comixed with h2o), and co in 'apolar' ices. at the high spectral resolution, the'apolar' component is, for the first time, resolved into two distinctcomponents, likely due to pure co and co mixed with co2, o2 and/or n2. the iceshave probably experienced thermal processing in the upper disk layer traced byour pencil absorption beam: much of the volatile 'apolar' ices has evaporatedand the depletion factor of co onto grains is remarkably low (~7%). this studyshows that high spectral resolution 4.7 um observations provide important andunique information on the dynamics and structure of protostellar disks and theevolution of ices in these disks.

astro-ph;0201317	the environment and nature of the class i protostar elias 29: molecular  gas observations and the location of ices	a (sub-)millimeter line and continuum study of the class i protostar elias 29in the rho ophiuchi molecular cloud is presented, whose goals are to understandthe nature of this source, and to locate the ices that are abundantly presentalong this line of sight. within 15-60" beams, several different componentscontribute to the line emission. two different foreground clouds are detected,an envelope/disk system and a dense ridge of hco+ rich material. the latter twocomponents are spatially separated in millimeter interferometer maps. weanalyze the envelope/disk system by using inside-out collapse and flared diskmodels. the disk is in a relatively face-on orientation (&lt;60 degrees), whichexplains many of the remarkable observational features of elias 29, such as itsflat sed, its brightness in the near infrared, the extended components found inspeckle interferometry observations, and its high velocity molecular outflow.it cannot account for the ices seen along the line of sight, however. a smallfraction of the ices is present in a (remnant) envelope of mass 0.12-0.33 msun,but most of the ices (~70%) are present in cool (t&lt;40 k) quiescent foregroundclouds. this explains the observed absence of thermally processed ices(crystallized h2o) toward elias 29. nevertheless, the temperatures could besufficiently high to account for the low abundance of apolar (co, n2, o2) ices.this work shows that it is crucial to obtain spectrally and spatially resolvedinformation from single-dish and interferometric molecular gas observations inorder to determine the nature of protostars and to interpret infrared isosatellite observations of ices and silicates along a pencil beam.

astro-ph;0205457	does iras 16293-2422 have a hot core? chemical inventory and abundance  changes in its protostellar environment	a detailed radiative transfer analysis of the observed continuum andmolecular line emission toward the deeply embedded young stellar object iras16293-2422 is performed. the continuum modelling is used to constrain thetemperature and density distributions in the envelope, enabling quantitativeestimates of various molecular abundances. the molecular excitation analysisreveals that the emission from some molecular species is well reproducedassuming a constant fractional abundance throughout the envelope. theabundances and isotope ratios are generally close to typical values found incold molecular clouds in these cases, and there is a high degree of deuteriumfractionation. there are, however, a number of notable exceptions. linescovering a wide range of excitation conditions indicate for some molecules,e.g., h2co, ch3oh, so, so2 and ocs, a drastic increase in their abundances inthe warm and dense inner region of the circumstellar envelope. the location atwhich this increase occurs is consistent with the radius at which ices areexpected to thermally evaporate off the grains. in all, there is strongevidence for the presence of a `hot core' close to the protostar, whosephysical properties are similar to those detected towards most high massprotostars except for a scaling factor. however, the small scale of the hot gasand the infalling nature of the envelope lead to very different chemical timescales between low mass and high mass hot cores, such that only very rapidlyproduced second-generation complex molecules can be formed in iras 16293-2422.alternatively, the ices may be liberated due to grain-grain collisions inturbulent shear zones where the outflow interacts with the envelope.

astro-ph;0310110	the structure of the ngc1333-iras2 protostellar system on 500 au scales:  an infalling envelope, a circumstellar disk, multiple outflows, and chemistry	this paper investigates small-scale structures of dense gas and dust aroundthe low-mass protostellar binary ngc1333-iras2 using millimeter-wavelengthaperture-synthesis observations from the ovro and bima interferometers. thedetected 3 mm continuum emission is consistent with models of the envelopearound iras2a, based on previously reported submillimeter continuum images,down to the 3", or 500 au, resolution of the interferometer data. our dataconstrain the contribution of an unresolved point source to 22 mjy. within theaccuracy of the parameters describing the envelope model, the point source fluxhas an uncertainty by up to 25%. we interpret this point source as a cold diskof mass \gtrsim 0.3 m_\odot. the same envelope model also reproducesaperture-synthesis line observations of the optically thin isotopic speciesc34s and h13co+. the more optically thick main isotope lines show a variety ofcomponents in the protostellar environment: n2h+ is closely correlated withdust concentrations as seen at submillimeter wavelengths and is particularlystrong toward the starless core iras2c. we hypothesize that n2h+ is destroyedthrough reactions with co that is released from icy grains near theprotostellar sources iras2a and b. cs, hco+, and hcn have complex line shapesapparently affected by both outflow and infall. in addition to the east-westjet from iras2a, a north-south velocity gradient near this source indicates asecond, perpendicular outflow. this suggests the presence of a binary companionwithin 0.3" (65 au) from iras2a as driving source of this outflow. alternativeexplanations of the velocity gradient such as rotation in a circumstellarenvelope or a single, wide-angle outflow are less likely.

astro-ph;0311132	the impact of shocks on the chemistry of molecular clouds: high  resolution images of chemical differentiation along the ngc1333-iras2a  outflow	this paper presents a detailed study of the chemistry in the outflowassociated with the low-mass protostar ngc1333-iras2a down to 3" (650 au)scales. millimeter-wavelength aperture-synthesis observations from the ovro andbima interferometers and (sub)millimeter single-dish observations from theonsala 20m telescope and cso are presented. the interaction of the highlycollimated protostellar outflow with a molecular condensation ~15000 au fromthe central protostar is clearly traced by molecular species such as hcn, sio,so, cs, and ch3oh. especially sio traces a narrow high velocity component atthe interface between the outflow and the molecular condensation.multi-transition single-dish observations are used to distinguish the chemistryof the shock from that of the molecular condensation and to address thephysical conditions therein. statistical equilibrium calculations revealtemperatures of 20 and 70 k for the quiescent and shocked components,respectively, and densities near 10^6 cm^{-3}. significant abundanceenhancements of two to four orders of magnitude are found in the shocked regionfor molecules such as ch3oh, sio and the sulfur-bearing molecules. hco+ is seenonly in the aftermath of the shock consistent with models where it is destroyedthrough release of h2o from grain mantles in the shock. n2h+ shows narrowlines, not affected by the outflow but rather probing the ambient cloud.differences in abundances of hcn, h2co and cs are seen between differentoutflow regions and are suggested to be related to differences in the atomiccarbon abundance. compared to the warm inner parts of protostellar envelopes,higher abundances of in particular ch3oh and sio are found in the outflows,which may be related to density differences between the regions.

astro-ph;0401635	on the origin of h2co abundance enhancements in low-mass protostars	high angular resolution h2co 218 ghz line observations have been carried outtoward the low-mass protostars iras 16293-2422 and l1448-c using the owensvalley millimeter array at ~2" resolution. simultaneous 1.37 mm continuum datareveal extended emission which is compared with that predicted by modelenvelopes constrained from single-dish data. for l1448-c the model densitystructure works well down to the 400 au scale to which the interferometer issensitive. for iras 16293-2422, a known proto-binary object, the interferometerobservations indicate that the binary has cleared much of the material in theinner part of the envelope, out to the binary separation of ~800 au. themorphology and velocity structure of the h2co array data have been used toinvestigate whether the abundance enhancements inferred from single-dishmodelling are due to thermal evaporation of ices or due to liberation of theice mantles by shocks in the inner envelope. a scenario in which the h2coabundance drops in the cold dense part of the envelope where co is frozen outbut is undepleted in the outermost region provides good fits to the single-dishand interferometer data on short baselines for both sources. emission on thelonger baselines is best reproduced if the h2co abundance is increased by aboutan order of magnitude from ~1e-10 to ~1e-9 in the inner parts of the envelopedue to thermal evaporation when the temperature exceeds ~50k. other scenarios,including weak outflow-envelope interactions and photon heating of theenvelope, are discussed and predictions for future generation interferometersare presented, illustrating their potential in distinguishing these competingscenarios.

astro-ph;0511467	spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of ices toward extincted background  stars	a powerful way to observe directly the solid state inventory of densemolecular clouds is by infrared spectroscopy of background stars. we presentspitzer/irs 5-20 micron spectra of ices toward stars behind the serpens andtaurus molecular clouds, probing visual extinctions of 10-34 mag. these dataprovide the first complete inventory of solid-state material in dense cloudsbefore star formation begins. the spectra show prominent 6.0 and 6.85 micronbands. in contrast to some young stellar objects (ysos), most (~75%) of the 6.0micron band is explained by the bending mode of pure water ice. in realisticmixtures this number increases to 85%, because the peak strength of the waterbending mode is very sensitive to the molecular environment. the strength ofthe 6.85 micron band is comparable to what is observed toward ysos. thus, theproduction of the carrier of this band does not depend on the energetic inputof a nearby source. the spectra show large abundances of carbon monoxide andcarbon dioxide (20-40% with respect to water ice). compared to ysos, the bandprofile of the 15 micron carbon dioxide bending mode lacks the signatures ofcrystallization, confirming the cold, pristine nature of these lines of sight.after the dominant species are removed, there are residuals that suggest thepresence of minor species such as formic acid and possibly ammonia. clearly,models of star formation should begin with dust models already coated with afairly complex mixture of ices.

astro-ph;0612450	probing protoplanetary disks with silicate emission: where is the  silicate emission zone?	recent results indicate that the grain size and crystallinity inferred fromobservations of silicate features may be correlated with spectral type of thecentral star and/or disk geometry. in this paper, we show that grain size, asprobed by the 10 um silicate feature peak-to-continuum and 11.3-to-9.8 um fluxratios, is inversely proportional to log l_star. these trends can be understoodusing a simple two-layer disk model for passive irradiated flaring disks,cgplus. we find that the radius, r_10, of the 10 um silicate emission zone inthe disk goes as (l_star/l_sun)^0.56, with slight variations depending on diskgeometry (flaring angle, inner disk radius). the observed correlations,combined with simulated emission spectra of olivine and pyroxene mixtures,imply a grain size dependence on luminosity. combined with the fact that r_10is smaller for less luminous stars, this implies that the apparent grain sizeof the emitting dust is larger for low-luminositysources. in contrast, ourmodels suggest that the crystallinity is only marginally affected, because forincreasing luminosity, the zone for thermal annealing (assumed to be at t&gt;800k) is enlarged by roughly the same factor as the silicate emission zone. theobserved crystallinity is affected by disk geometry, however, with increasedcrystallinity in flat disks. the apparent crystallinity may also increase withgrain growth due to a corresponding increase in contrast between crystallineand amorphous silicate emission bands.

astro-ph;0701651	abundant crystalline silicates in the disk of a very low mass star	we announce the discovery of sst-lup3-1, a very low mass star close to thebrown dwarf boundary in lupus iii with a circum(sub)stellar disk, discovered bythe `cores to disks' spitzer legacy program from mid-, near-infrared andoptical data, with very conspicuous crystalline silicate features in itsspectrum. it is the first of such objects with a full 5 to 35 micron spectrumtaken with the irs and it shows strong 10 and 20 micron silicate features withhigh feature to continuum ratios and clear crystalline features out to 33micron. the dust in the disk upper layer has a crystalline silicate grainfraction between 15% and 33%, depending on the assumed dust continuum. theavailability of the full spitzer infrared spectrum allows an analysis of thedust composition as a function of temperature and position in the disk. the hot(~ 300 k) dust responsible for the 10 micron feature consists of a roughlyequal mix of small (~ 0.1 micron) and large (~ 1.5 micron) grains, whereas thecold (~ 70 k) dust responsible for the longer wavelength silicate featurescontains primarily large grains (&gt; 1 micron). since the cold dust emissionarises from deeper layers in the inner (&lt; 3 au) disk as well as from thesurface layers of the outer (3-5 au) disk, this provides direct evidence forcombined grain growth and settling in the disk. the inferred crystalline massfractions in the two components are comparable. since only the inner 0.02 au ofthe disk is warm enough to anneal the amorphous silicate grains, even thelowest fraction of 15% of crystalline material requires either very efficientmixing or other formation mechanisms.

astro-ph;0701711	the spitzer c2d survey of large, nearby, interstellar clouds: vi.  perseus observed with mips	we present observations of 10.6 square degrees of the perseus molecular cloudat 24, 70, and 160 microns with the spitzer space telescope multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips). the image mosaics show prominent, complexextended emission dominated by illuminating b stars on the east side of thecloud, and by cold filaments of 160 micron emission on the west side. of 3950point sources identified at 24 microns, 1141 have 2mass counterparts. a quarterof these populate regions of the ks vs. ks-[24] diagram that are distinct fromstellar photospheres and background galaxies, and thus are likely to be cloudmembers with infrared excess. nearly half (46%) of these 24 micron excesssources are distributed outside the ic 348 and ngc 1333 clusters. ngc 1333shows the highest fraction of stars with flat or rising spectral energydistributions (28%), while class ii seds are most common in ic 348. theseresults are consistent with previous relative age determinations for the twoclusters.  the intercluster region contains several tightly clumped (r~0.1 pc) youngstellar aggregates whose members exhibit a wide variety of infrared spectralenergy distributions characteristic of different circumstellar environments.one possible explanation is a significant age spread among the aggregatemembers, such that some have had time to evolve more than others.alternatively, if the aggregate members all formed at roughly the same time,then remarkably rapid circumstellar evolution would be required to account forthe association of class i and class iii sources at ages &lt;~1 myr.  we highlight important results for several other objects as well (fullabstract in the paper).

astro-ph;9709288	sub-arcsecond imaging at 267 ghz of a young binary system: detection of  a &lt;70 au radius dust disk around t tau n	the young binary system t tau was observed with the owens valley millimeterarray at 267 ghz continuum and hco+ j=3-2 emission at 0.8'' resolution, withthe jcmt-cso single-baseline interferometer in 357 ghz continuum, and with thew. m. keck telescope at 4 micron. the 267 ghz emission is unresolved with aflux of 397 +/- 35 mjy, located close to the position of the optical star t taun. an upper limit of 100 mjy is obtained toward the infrared companion t tau s.the 357 ghz continuum emission is unresolved, with a flux of 1.35 +/- 0.68 jy.hco+ 3-2 was detected from a 2'' diameter core surrounding t tau n and s. bothstars are detected ar 4 micron, but there is no evidence of the radio source ttau r. we propose a model in which t tau s is intrinsically similar to t tau n,but is obscured by the outer parts of t tau n's disk. a fit to the spectralenergy distribution (sed) between 21 cm and 1.22 micron is constructed on thisbasis. adopting a r^-1 surface density distribution and an exponentiallytruncated edge, disk masses of 0.04 +/- 0.01 msol and 6e-5 - 3e-3 msol areinferred for t tau n and s, respectively. a 0.005-0.03 msol circumbinaryenvelope is also required to fit the millimeter to mid-infrared sed.

astro-ph;9810047	envelope structure of deeply embedded young stellar objects in the  serpens molecular cloud	aperture synthesis and single-dish (sub) millimeter molecular lines andcontinuum observations reveal in great detail the envelope structure of deeplyembedded young stellar objects (smm1, smm2, smm3, smm4) in the denselystar-forming serpens molecular cloud. resolved millimeter continuum emissionconstrains the density structure to a radial power law with index -2.0 +/- 0.5,and envelope masses of 8.7, 3.0, and 5.3 m_sol for smm1, smm3, and smm4. thecore smm2 does not seem to have a central condensation and may not have formeda star yet. the molecular line observations can be described by the sameenvelope model, if an additional, small amount of warm (100 k) material isincluded. this probably corresponds to the inner few hundred au of the envelopewere the temperature is high. in the interferometer beam, the molecular linesreveal the inner regions of the envelopes, as well as interaction of theoutflow with the surrounding envelope. bright hco+ and hcn emission outlinesthe cavities, while sio and so trace the direct impact of the outflow onambient gas. taken together, these observations provide a first comprehensiveview of the physical and chemical structure of the envelopes of deeply embeddedyoung stellar objects in a clustered environment on scales between 1000 and10,000 au.

astro-ph;9909086	imaging the haro 6-10 infrared companion	we present an infrared imaging study of the low-mass pre-main sequence binarysystem haro 6-10. this system is one of a handful in which theoptically-visible primary has the characteristics of a normal t tauri star,while the secondary is a so-called "infrared companion" (irc), a stronglyextincted object which emits most of its luminosity in the infrared. a speckleholographic technique was used to produce nearly diffraction-limited images onthree nights over a one-year period starting in late 1997. the images show thatthe irc is obscured and surrounded by a compact, irregular, and variablenebula. this structure is in striking contrast to the well-ordered edge-on diskassociated with hk tauri b, the extincted companion to another t tauri star ofsimilar age. a new, resolved intensity peak was found 0".4 southwest of theirc. we suggest that it may represent light scattered by a clump of dustymaterial illuminated by starlight escaping along an outflow-carved cavity inthe irc envelope. the primary star became fainter and the companion became moreextended during the observing period.

0810.4162	captured at millimeter wavelengths: a flare from the classical t tauri  star dq tau	for several hours on 2008 april 19 the t tauri spectroscopic binary dq tauwas observed to brighten, reaching a maximum detected flux of 468 mjy andlikely making it (briefly) the brightest object at 3 mm in the taurusstar-forming region. we present the light curve of a rarely before observedmillimeter flare originating in the region around a pre-main-sequence star, andthe first from a classical t tauri star. we discuss the properties and natureof the flaring behavior in the context of pulsed accretion flows (the currentpicture based largely on studies of this object's optically variable spectrum),as well as magnetospheric re-connection models (a separate theory that predictsmillimeter flares for close binaries of high orbital eccentricity). we believethat the flare mechanism is linked to the binary orbit, and therefore periodic.dq tau makes a strong case for multi-wavelength follow-up studies, performed inparallel, of future flares to help determine whether magnetospheric anddynamical interactions in a proto-binary system are independent.

0812.3664	lack of pah emission toward low-mass embedded young stellar objects	pahs have been detected toward molecular clouds and some young stars withdisks, but have not yet been associated with embedded young stars. we present asensitive mid-ir spectroscopic survey of pah features toward a sample oflow-mass embedded ysos. the aim is to put constraints on the pah abundance inthe embedded phase of star formation using radiative transfer modeling.  vlt-isaac l-band spectra for 39 sources and spitzer irs spectra for 53sources are presented. line intensities are compared to recent surveys ofherbig ae/be and t tauri stars. the radiative transfer codes radmc and radicalare used to model the pah emission from embedded ysos consisting of a pms starwith a circumstellar disk embedded in an envelope. the dependence of the pahfeature on pah abundance, stellar radiation field, inclination and theextinction by the surrounding envelope is studied.  the 3.3 micron pah feature is undetected for the majority of the sample(97%), with typical upper limits of 5e-16 w/m^2. compact 11.2 micron pahemission is seen directly towards 1 out of the 53 spitzer short-high spectra,for a source that is borderline embedded. for all 12 sources with both vlt andspitzer spectra, no pah features are detected in either. in total, pah featuresare detected toward at most 1 out of 63 (candidate) embedded protostars (&lt;~2%), even lower than observed for class ii t tauri stars with disks (11-14%).assuming typical class i stellar and envelope parameters, the absence of pahsemission is most likely explained by the absence of emitting carriers through apah abundance at least an order of magnitude lower than in molecular clouds butsimilar to that found in disks. thus, most pahs likely enter the protoplanetarydisks frozen out in icy layers on dust grains and/or in coagulated form.
