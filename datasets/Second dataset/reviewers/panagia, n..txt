0903.1086	type ia supernova science 2010-2020	in the next decade type ia supernovae (sne ia) will be used to test theoriespredicting changes in the dark energy equation of state with time. ultimatelythis requires a dedicated space mission like jdem. sne ia are maturecosmological probes --- their limitations are well characterized, and a path toimprovement is clear. dominant systematic errors include photometriccalibration, selection effects, reddening, and population-dependentdifferences. building on past lessons, well-controlled new surveys are poisedto make strides in these areas: the palomar transient factory, skymapper, lasilla quest, pan-starrs, the dark energy survey, lsst, and jdem. they willobviate historical calibrations and selection biases, and allow comparisons vialarge subsamples. some systematics follow from our ignorance of sn iaprogenitors, which there is hope of determining with sn ia rate studies from0&lt;z&lt;4.  aside from cosmology, sne ia regulate galactic and cluster chemicalevolution, inform stellar evolution, and are laboratories for extreme physics.essential probes of sne ia in these contexts include spectroscopy from the uvto the ir, x-ray cluster and sn remnant observations, spectropolarimetry, andadvanced theoretical studies. while there are an abundance of discoveryfacilities planned, there is a deficit of follow-up resources. living in thesystematics era demands deep understanding rather than larger statistics. noaorestar initiative to build 2-4m telescopes would provide necessary follow-upcapability. finally, to fully exploit lsst, well-matched wide-fieldspectroscopic capabilities are desirable.

0706.2653	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: i. the faint-end slope of the  lyman-break galaxy population at z~5	we present the udf05 project, a hst large program of deep acs (f606w, f775w,f850lp) and nicmos (f110w, f160w) imaging of three fields, two of whichcoincide with the nicp1-4 nicmos parallel observations of the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf). in this first paper we use the acs data for the nicp12 field, aswell as the original hudf acs data, to measure the uv luminosity function (lf)of z~5 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) down to very faint levels. specifically,based on a v-i, i-z selection criterion, we identify a sample of 101 and 133candidate z~5 galaxies down to z_{850}=28.5 and 29.25 magnitudes in the nicp12and in the hudf fields, respectively. using an extensive set of monte carlosimulations we derive corrections for observational biases and selectioneffects, and construct the rest-frame 1400 a lbg lf over the rangem_{1400}=[-21.4, -17.1], i.e. down to ~0.04 l* at z~5, and complement it withdata from the subaru deep field (sdf) from yoshida et al. (2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0904.0337	23 ghz vlbi observations of sn 2008ax	we report on phase-referenced 23 ghz very-long-baseline-interferometry (vlbi)observations of the type iib supernova sn 2008ax, made with the very longbaseline array (vlba) on 2 april 2008 (33 days after explosion). theseobservations resulted in a marginal detection of the supernova. the total fluxdensity recovered from our vlbi image is 0.8$\pm$0.3 mjy (one standarddeviation). as it appears, the structure may be interpreted as either acore-jet or a double source. however, the supernova structure could be somewhatconfused with a possible close by noise peak. in such a case, the recoveredflux density would decrease to 0.48$\pm$0.12 mjy, compatible with the fluxdensities measured with the vla at epochs close in time to our vlbiobservations. the lowest average expansion velocities derived from ourobservations are $(1.90 \pm 0.30) \times 10^5$ km s$^{-1}$ (case of a doublesource) and $(5.2 \pm 1.3) \times 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ (taking the weaker sourcecomponent as a spurious, close by, noise peak, which is the more likelyinterpretation). these velocities are 7.3 and 2 times higher, respectively,than the maximum ejecta velocity inferred from optical-line observations.

0904.3463	five supernova survey galaxies in the southern hemisphere. i. optical  and near-infrared database	the determination of the supernova (sn) rate is based not only on the numberof detected events, but also on the properties of the parent galaxy population.this is the first paper of a series aimed at obtaining new, refined, sn ratesfrom a set of five sn surveys, by making use of a joint analysis ofnear-infrared (nir) data. we describe the properties of the 3838 galaxies thatwere monitored for sne events, including newly determined morphologies andtheir denis and poss-ii/ukst i, 2mass and denis j and ks and 2mass hmagnitudes. we have compared 2mass, denis and poss-ii/ukst ijk magnitudes inorder to find possible systematic photometric shifts in the measurements. thedenis and poss-ii/ukst i band magnitudes show large discrepancies (meanabsolute difference of 0.4 mag), mostly due to different spectral responses ofthe two instruments, with an important contribution (0.33 mag rms) from thelarge uncertainties in the photometric calibration of the poss-ii and ukstphotographic plates. in the other wavebands, the limiting near infraredmagnitude, morphology and inclination of the galaxies are the most influentialfactors which affect the determination of photometry of the galaxies.nevertheless, no significant systematic differences have been found between ofany pair of nir magnitude measurements, except for a few percent of galaxiesshowing large discrepancies. this allows us to combine denis and 2mass data forthe j and ks filters.

0905.1328	spitzer sage infrared photometry of massive stars in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a catalog of 1750 massive stars in the large magellanic cloud,with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a photometriccatalog for a subset of 1268 of these stars, with the goal of exploring theirinfrared properties. the photometric catalog consists of stars with infraredcounterparts in the spitzer sage survey database, for which we present uniformphotometry from 0.3-24 microns in the ubvijhks+irac+mips24 bands. the resultinginfrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant b[e], redsupergiant and luminous blue variable (lbv) stars are among the brightestinfrared point sources in the large magellanic cloud, due to their intrinsicbrightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. we detect infrared excessesdue to free-free emission among ~900 ob stars, which correlate with luminosityclass. we confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant b[e] stars, findingthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (seds) to be very similar, incontrast to the variety of sed shapes among the spectrally variable lbvs. thesimilar luminosities of b[e] supergiants (log l/lo&gt;=4) and the rare, dustyprogenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. sn 2008s and ngc 300ot), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests acommon origin for them. we find the infrared colors for wolf-rayet stars to beindependent of spectral type and their seds to be flatter than what modelspredict. the results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap forinterpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxiesat infrared wavelengths.

0907.2644	radio monitoring of ngc 7469: late time radio evolution of sn 2000ft and  the circumnuclear starburst in ngc 7469	we present the results of an eight-year long monitoring of the radio emissionfrom the luminous infrared galaxy (lirg) ngc 7469, using 8.4 ghz very largearray (vla) observations at 0.3'' resolution. our monitoring shows that thelate time evolution of the radio supernova sn 2000ft follows a decline verysimilar to that displayed at earlier times of its optically thin phase. thelate time radio emission of sn 2000ft is therefore still being powered by itsinteraction with the presupernova stellar wind, and not with the interstellarmedium (ism). indeed, the ram pressure of the presupernova wind is \rho_w v_w^2\approx 7.6e-9 dyn/cm^2, at a supernova age of approximately 2127 days, whichis significantly larger than the expected pressure of the ism around sn 2000ft.at this age, the sn shock has reached a distance r_{sh \approx 0.06 pc, and ourobservations are probing the interaction of the sn with dense material that wasejected by the presupernova star about 5820 years prior to its explosion. fromour vla monitoring, we estimate that the swept-up mass by the supernova shockafter about six years of expansion is \approx 0.29 m_sun, assuming an averageexpansion speed of the supernova of 10000 km/s.  we also searched for recently exploded core-collapse supernovae in our vlaimages. apart from sn 2000ft (s_\nu \approx 1760 microjy at its peak,corresponding to 1.1e28 erg/s/hz, we found no evidence for any other radiosupernova (rsn) more luminous than \approx 6.0e26 erg/s/hz, which suggests thatno other type iin sn has exploded since 2000 in the circumnuclear starburst ofngc 7469.

0909.0967	multi-wavelength properties of the type iib sn 2008ax	we present the uv, optical, x-ray, and radio properties of the type iib sn2008ax discovered in ngc 4490. the observations in the uv are one of theearliest of a type iib supernova (sn). on approximately day four after theexplosion, a dramatic upturn in the u and uvw1 (lambda_c = 2600 angstroms)light curves occurred after an initial rapid decline which is attributed toadiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. this rapid decline andupturn is reminiscent of the type iib sn 1993j on day six after the explosion.optical/near-ir spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent h-alpha, hei,and caii absorption lines. a fading x-ray source is also located at theposition of sn 2008ax, implying an interaction of the sn shock with thesurrounding circumstellar material and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor ofm_dot = (9+/-3)x10^-6 solar masses per year. the unusual time evolution (14days) of the 6 cm peak radio luminosity provides further evidence that themass-loss rate is low. combining the uv, optical, x-ray, and radio data withmodels of helium exploding stars implies the progenitor of sn 2008ax was anunmixed star in an interacting-binary. modeling of the sn light curve suggestsa kinetic energy (e_k) of 0.5x10^51 ergs, an ejecta mass (m_ej) of 2.9 solarmasses, and a nickel mass (m_ni) of 0.06 solar masses.

0909.3847	the effect of dust geometry on the lyman-alpha output of galaxies	we present the optical spectroscopic follow-up of 31 z=0.3 lyman-alpha (lya)emitters, previously identified by deharveng et al. (2008). we find that 17% ofthe lya emitters have line ratios that require the hard ionizing continuumproduced by an agn. the uniform dust screen geometry traditionally used instudies similar to ours is not able to simultaneously reproduce the observedhigh lya/halpha and halpha/hbeta line ratios. we consider differentpossibilities for the geometry of the dust around the emitting sources. we findthat also a uniform mixture of sources and dust does not reproduce the observedline ratios. instead, these are well reproduced by a clumpy dust screen. thismore realistic treatment of the geometry results in extinction corrected(lya/halpha)_c values consistent with case b recombination theory, whereas auniform dust screen model would imply values (lya/halpha)_c higher than 8.7.our analysis shows that there is no need to invoke "ad-hoc" multi phase mediain which the lya photons only scatter between the dusty clouds and eventuallyescape.

1111.0835	photometric determination of the mass accretion rates of pre-main  sequence stars. iii. results in the large magellanic cloud	we present a multi-wavelength study of three star forming regions, spanningthe age range 1-14 myr, located between the 30 doradus complex and supernovasn1987a in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). we reliably identify about 1000pre-main sequence (pms) star candidates actively undergoing mass accretion andestimate their stellar properties and mass accretion rate (macc). ourmeasurements represent the largest macc dataset of low-metallicity starspresented so far. as such, they offer a unique opportunity to study on astatistical basis the mass accretion process in the lmc and, more in general,the evolution of the mass accretion process around low-metallicity stars. wefind that the typical \dot{m} of pms stars in the lmc is higher than forgalactic pms stars of the same mass, independently of their age. taking intoaccount the caveats of isochronal age and \dot{m} estimates, the difference inmacc between the lmc and our galaxy appears to be about an order of magnitude.we review the main mechanisms of disk dispersal and find indications thattypically higher macc are to be expected in low-metallicity environments.however, many issues of this scenario need to be clarified by futureobservations and modeling. we also find that, in the mass range 1-2 m_sun, themacc of pms stars in the lmc increases with stellar mass as\dot{m}acc\proptom^b, with b \approx1, i.e. slower than the second power lowfound for galactic pms stars in the same mass regime.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1501.07282	a semi-analytical line transfer (salt) model to interpret the spectra of  galaxy outflows	we present a semi-analytical line transfer model, salt, to study theabsorption and re-emission line profiles from expanding galactic envelopes. theenvelopes are described as a superposition of shells with density and velocityvarying with the distance from the center. we adopt the sobolev approximationto describe the interaction between the photons escaping from each shell andthe remaining of the envelope. we include the effect of multiple scatteringswithin each shell, properly accounting for the atomic structure of thescattering ions. we also account for the effect of a finite circular apertureon actual observations. for equal geometries and density distributions, ourmodels reproduce the main features of the profiles generated with morecomplicated transfer codes. also, our salt line profiles nicely reproduce thetypical asymmetric resonant absorption line profiles observed instar-forming/starburst galaxies whereas these absorption profiles cannot bereproduced with thin shells moving at a fixed outflow velocity. we show thatscattered resonant emission fills in the resonant absorption profiles, with astrength that is different for each transition. observationally, the effect ofresonant filling depends on both the outflow geometry and the size of theoutflow relative to the spectroscopic aperture. neglecting these effects willlead to incorrect values of gas covering fraction and column density. when afluorescent channel is available, the resonant profiles alone cannot be used toinfer the presence of scattered re-emission. conversely, the presence ofemission lines of fluorescent transitions reveals that emission filling cannotbe neglected.

0804.4874	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: ii. constraints on reionization from  z-dropout galaxies	[abridged] we detect three (plus one less certain) z-dropout sources in twoseparate fields of our udf05 hst nicmos images. these z~7 lyman-break galaxy(lbg) candidates allow us to constrain the luminosity function (lf) of the starforming galaxy population at those epochs. by assuming a change in only m* andadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values atz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unitredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a valueof m*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. this implies a steady evolution for the lbg lf out toz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. thisputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whoseensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 myrbefore the epoch at which they are observed. in particular, a large fraction ofstars in the z~6 lbg population must form at redshifts well above z~7.extrapolating this steady evolution of the lf out to higher redshifts, weestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, providedthat the faint-end slope of the z&gt;7 lf steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faintgalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute asubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. this scenario giveshowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigmabelow the wmap-5 measurement. therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either thecurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z&gt;7, or thelf evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and acorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

0805.4698	outliers from the mainstream: how a massive star can produce a gamma-ray  burst	it is now recognized that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are linked tothe collapse of massive stars, based on the association between (low-redshift)grbs and (type ic) core-collapse supernovae (sne). the census of massive starsand grbs reveals, however, that not all massive stars do produce a grb. only~1% of core collapse sne are able to produce a highly relativistic collimatedoutflow, and hence a grb. the extra crucial parameter has long been suspectedto be metallicity and/or rotation. we find observational evidence stronglysupporting that both ingredients are necessary in order to make a grb out of acore-collapsing star. a detailed study of the absorption pattern in the x-rayspectrum of grb060218 reveals evidence of material highly enriched in lowatomic number metals ejected before the sn/grb explosion. we find that, withinthe current scenarios of stellar evolution, only a progenitor starcharacterized by a fast stellar rotation and sub-solar initial metallicitycould produce such a metal enrichment in its close surrounding.

astro-ph;0205337	the axially symmetric ejecta of supernova 1987a	extensive early observations proved that the ejecta of supernova 1987a (sn1987a) are aspherical. fifteen years after the supernova explosion, the hubblespace telescope has resolved the rapidly expanding ejecta. the late-time imagesand spectroscopy provide a geometrical picture that is consistent with earlyobservations and suggests a highly structured, axially symmetric geometry. wepresent here a new synthesis of the old and new data. we show that the bochumevent, presumably a clump of $^{56}$ni, and the late-time image, the locus ofexcitation by $^{44}$ti, are most naturally accounted for by sharing a commonposition angle of about 14\degree, the same as the mystery spot and earlyspeckle data on the ejecta, and that they are both oriented along the axis ofthe inner circumstellar ring at 45\degree to the plane of the sky. we alsodemonstrate that the polarization represents a prolate geometry with the sameposition angle and axis as the early speckle data and the late-time image andhence that the geometry has been fixed in time and throughout the ejecta. thebochum event and the doppler kinematics of the [ca ii]/[o ii] emission inspatially resolved hst spectra of the ejecta can be consistently integratedinto this geometry. the radioactive clump is deduced to fall approximatelyalong the axis of the inner circumstellar ring and therefore to be redshiftedin the north whereas the [ca ii]/[o ii] 7300 \aa emission is redshifted in thesouth. we present a jet-induced model for the explosion and argue that such amodel can account for many of the observed asymmetries. in the jet models, theoxygen and calcium are not expected to be distributed along the jet, butprimarily in an expanding torus that shares the plane and northern blue shiftof the inner circumstellar ring.

astro-ph;0309368	new constraints on $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from an  independent set of eleven high-redshift supernovae observed with hst	we report measurements of $\omega_m$, $\omega_\lambda$, and w from elevensupernovae at z=0.36-0.86 with high-quality lightcurves measured using wfpc-2on the hst. this is an independent set of high-redshift supernovae thatconfirms previous supernova evidence for an accelerating universe. combinedwith earlier supernova cosmology project data, the new supernovae yield aflat-universe measurement of the mass density $\omega_m=0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$(statistical) $\pm0.04$ (identified systematics), or equivalently, acosmological constant of $\omega_\lambda=0.75^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ (statistical)$\pm0.04$ (identified systematics). when the supernova results are combinedwith independent flat-universe measurements of $\omega_m$ from cmb and galaxyredshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of$w=-1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ (statistical) $\pm0.09$ (identified systematic), if wis assumed to be constant in time. the new data offer greatly improved colormeasurements of the high-redshift supernovae, and hence improved host-galaxyextinction estimates. these extinction measurements show no anomalous negativee(b-v) at high redshift. the precision of the measurements is such that it ispossible to perform a host-galaxy extinction correction directly for individualsupernovae without any assumptions or priors on the parent e(b-v) distribution.our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that darkenergy is required with $p(\omega_\lambda&gt;0)&gt;0.99$, a result consistent withprevious and current supernova analyses which rely upon the identification of alow-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinctiondistribution.

astro-ph;0309835	observable properties of cosmological reionization sources	motivated by recent evidence that the epoch of reionization of hydrogen mayhave ended at a redshift as low as z~6 we consider the detectability of thesources responsible for this reionization. the main idea is that reionizationplaces limits on the mean surface brightness of the population of reionizationsources. reducing the number of model-dependent assumptions to a minimum, wediscuss the observability of these sources with existing and plannedtelescopes. we define a family of models characterized by two parameters: thelyman continuum escape fraction f_c from the sources, and the clumpinessparameter c of the intergalactic medium. the minimum surface brightness modelcorresponds to a value of unity for both parameters. we find that the detectionof the non-ionizing uv continuum of the reionization sources will be difficultto accomplish before the launch of jwst if these sources have a mean surfacebrightness close to the minimum value. however, if the values of f_c and c aremore realistic, the reionization sources may well be detected by hst beforejwst, perhaps by exploiting gravitational lensing amplification by foregroundclusters of galaxies. instead of a detection in the continuum, one may attemptto detect the lyalpha emission line by narrow-band imaging. present lyalphasearches at z&gt;6 suggest that either the typical sources are fainter than dwarfgalaxies, or that the escape fraction of ionizing photons is much higher than50%, so that there are no bright compact hii regions formed around the ionizingsources.

astro-ph;0402195	hst/wfpc2 study of the trapezium cluster: the influence of circumstellar  disks on the initial mass function	we have performed the first measures of mass accretion rates in the core ofthe orion nebula cluster. four adjacent fields centered on the trapezium starshave been imaged in the u- and b-bands using the wide field planetary camera 2on board the hubble space telescope. in this paper we focus our attention on agroup of 40 stars with known spectral types and complete ubvi wfpc2 photometry.approximately three quarters of the sources show excess luminosity in theu-band, that we attribute to mass accretion. the known correlation between theu-band excess and the total accretion luminosity allows us to estimate theaccretion rates. overall, mass accretion rates appear lower than those measuredby other authors in the orion flanking fields or in taurus-auriga. massaccretion rates remain low even in the vicinity of the birth line of palla &amp;stahler, suggesting that in the core of the trapezium cluster disk accretionhas been recently depressed by an external mechanism. we suggest that the uvradiation generated by the trapezium ob stars, responsible for the diskevaporation, may also cause the drop of the mass accretion rate. in thisscenario, low-mass stars may terminate their pre-main sequence evolution withmasses lower than those they would have reached if disk accretion could haveproceeded undisturbed until the final disk consumption. in ob associations thelow-mass end of the initial mass function may therefore be affected by therapid evolution of the most massive cluster's stars, causing a surplus"accretion aborted" very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and a deficit ofintermediate mass stars. this trend is in agreement with recent observations ofthe imf in the trapezium cluster.

astro-ph;0406546	the hubble higher-z supernova search: supernovae to z=1.6 and  constraints on type ia progenitor models	we present results from the hubble higher-z supernova search, the firstspace-based open field survey for supernovae (sne). in cooperation with thegreat observatories origins deep survey, we have used the hubble spacetelescope with the advanced camera for surveys to cover 300 square arcmin inthe area of the chandra deep field south and the hubble deep field north onfive separate search epochs (separated by 45 day intervals) to a limitingmagnitude of z'=26. these deep observations have allowed us to discover 42 snein the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.6. as these data span a large range inredshift, they are ideal for testing the validity of type ia supernovaprogenitor models with the distribution of expected ``delay times,'' fromprogenitor star formation to sn ia explosion, and the sn rates these modelspredict. through a bayesian maximum likelihood test, we determine whichdelay-time models best reproduce the redshift distribution of sne ia discoveredin this survey. we find that models that require a large fraction of ``prompt''(less than 2 gyr) sne ia poorly reproduce the observed redshift distributionand are rejected at 95% confidence. we find that gaussian models best fit theobserved data for mean delay times in the range of 3 to 4 gyr.

astro-ph;0412097	stars in the hubble ultra deep field	we identified 46 unresolved source candidates in the hubble ultra deep field,down to i775 = 29.5. unresolved objects were identified using a parameter s,which measures the deviation from the curve-of-growth of a point source.extensive testing of this parameter was carried out, including the effects ofdecreasing signal-to-noise and of the apparent motions of stars, whichdemonstrated that stars brighter than i775 = 27.0 could be robustly identified.low resolution grism spectra of the 28 objects brighter than i775 = 27.0identify 18 m and later stellar type dwarfs, 2 candidate l-dwarfs, 2 qsos, and4 white dwarfs. using the observed population of dwarfs with spectral type m4or later, we derive a galactic disk scale height of 400 \pm 100 pc for m and lstars. the local white dwarf density is computed to be as high as (1.1 \pm 0.3)x10^(-2) stars/pc^3. based on observations taken 73 days apart, we determinedthat no object in the field has a proper motion larger than 0.027"/year (3sigma detection limit). no high velocity white dwarfs were identified in thehudf, and all four candidates appear more likely to be part of the galacticthick disk. the lack of detected halo white dwarfs implies that, if the darkmatter halo is 12 gyr old, white dwarfs account for less than 10% of the darkmatter halo mass.

astro-ph;0504087	why are radio-galaxies prolific producers of type ia supernovae?	an analysis of snia events in early type galaxies from the cappellaro et al(1999) database provides conclusive evidence that the rate of type iasupernovae (sne) in radio-loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the ratemeasured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e. snia-rate$(radio-loud galaxies) =0.43^{+0.19}_{-0.14}h^2_{75}$ snu as compared to snia-rate$(radio-quietgalaxies) = 0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.03}h^2_{75}$ snu. the actual value of theenhancement is likely to be in the range $\sim 2-7$ (p$\sim 10^{-4}$). thisfinding puts on robust empirical grounds the results obtained by della valle &amp;panagia (2003) on the basis of a smaller sample of sne. we analyse the possiblecauses of this result and conclude that the enhancement of snia explosion ratein radio-loud galaxies has the same origin as their being strong radio sources,but there is no causality link between the two phenomena. we argue thatrepeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies withdwarf companions, on times-scale of about 1 gyr, are responsible for inducingboth strong radio activity observed in $\sim$14% of early type galaxies and tosupply an adequate number of snia progenitors to the stellar population ofellipticals.

astro-ph;0509551	morphology and evolution of emission line galaxies in the hubble ultra  deep field	we investigate the properties and evolution of a sample of galaxies selectedto have prominent emission lines in low-resolution grism spectra of the hubbleultra deep field (hudf). these objects, egrapes, are late type blue galaxies,characterized by small proper sizes (r_50 &lt; 2 kpc) in the 4350a rest-frame, lowmasses (5x10^9 m_sun), and a wide range of luminosities and surfacebrightnesses. the masses, sizes and volume densities of these objects appear tochange very little up to a redshift of z=1.5. on the other hand, their surfacebrightness decreases significantly from z=1.5 to z=0 while their mass-to-lightratio increases two-folds. this could be a sign that most of low redshiftegrapes have an older stellar population than high redshift egrapes and hencethat most egrapes formed at higher redshifts. the average volume density ofegrapes is (1.8 \pm 0.3)x10^{-3} mpc^{-3} between 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5. many egrapeswould formally have been classified as luminous compact blue galaxies (lcbgs)if these had been selected based on small physical size, blue intrinsic color,and high surface brightness, while the remainder of the sample discussed inthis paper forms an extension of lcbgs towards fainter luminosities.

astro-ph;0510315	two populations of progenitors for type ia sne?	we use recent observations of type ia supernova (sn ia) rates to derive, onrobust empirical grounds, the distribution of the delay time (dtd) between theformation of the progenitor star and its explosion as a sn. our analysis finds:i) delay times as long as 3-4 gyr, derived from observations of sne ia at highredshift, cannot reproduce the dependence of the sn ia rate on the colors andon the radio-luminosity of the parent galaxies, as observed in the localuniverse; ii) the comparison between observed sn rates and a grid oftheoretical "single-population" dtds shows that only a few of them are possiblyconsistent with observations. the most successful models are all predicting apeak of sn explosions soon after star formation and an extended tail in thedtd, and can reproduce the data but only at a modest statistical confidencelevel; iii) present data are best matched by a bimodal dtd, in which about 50%of type ia sne (dubbed "prompt" sn ia) explode soon after their stellar birth,in a time of the order of 10^8 years, while the remaining 50% ("tardy" sn ia)have a much wider distribution, well described by an exponential function witha decay time of about 3 gyr. this fact, coupled with the well establishedbimodal distribution of the decay rate, suggests the existence of two classesof progenitors. we discuss the cosmological implications of this result andmake simple predictions.

astro-ph;0607504	a new formulation of the type ia sn rate and its consequences on  galactic chemical evolution	in recent papers mannucci et al. (2005, 2006) suggested, on the basis ofobservational arguments, that there is a bimodal distribution of delay timesfor the explosion of type ia sne. in this paper, we test this hypothesis inmodels of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. we show that this proposed scenario iscompatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. when the newrate is introduced in the two-infall model for the milky way, the derived typeia sn rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at veryearly epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo morethan in the previous widely adopted formulations for the snia rate. as aconsequence of this, the [o/fe] ratio decreases faster for [fe/h] &gt; -2.0 dex,relative to the old models. for a typical elliptical of 10^11 m_sun of luminousmass, the new rate produces average [alpha/ fe] ratios in the dominant stellarpopulation still in agreement with observations. the type ia sn rate also inthis case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to theprevious results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of ourgalaxy. we have also checked the effects of the new type ia sn rate on theevolution of the fe content in the icm, as a consequence of its production fromcluster ellipticals and we found that less fe in the icm is produced with thenew rate, due to the higher fraction of fe synthesized at early times andremaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. for dwarf irregular galaxiessuffering few bursts of star formation we obtain [o/fe] ratios larger by 0.2dex relative to the previous models.

astro-ph;9610021	the evolution of ultraviolet emission lines from the circumstellar  material surrounding sn 1987a	the presence of narrow high-temperature emission lines from nitrogen-rich gasclose to sn 1987a has been the principal observational constraint on the evolu-tionary status of the supernova's progenitor. a new analysis of the completefive-year set of low and high resolution iue ultraviolet spectra of sn 1987a(1987.2--1992.3) provide fluxes for the n v 1240, n iv] 1486, he ii 1640, oiii]1665, niii] 1751, and ciii] 1908 lines with significantly reduced random andsystematic errors and reveals significant short-term fluctuations in the lightcurves. the n v, n iv] and n iii] lines turn on sequentially over 15 to 20 daysand show a progression from high to low ionization potential, implying an ioni-zation gradient in the emitting region. the line emission turns on suddenly at83+/-4 days after the explosion, as defined by n iv]. the n iii] line reachespeak luminosity at 399+/-15 days. a ring radius of (6.24+/-0.20)e{17} cm andinclination of 41.0+/-3.9 is derived from these times, assuming a circularring. the probable role of resonant scattering in the n v light curveintroduces systematic errors that leads us to exclude this line from the timinganalysis. a new nebular analysis yields improved cno abundance ratiosn/c=6.1+/-1.1 and n/o=1.7+/-0.5, confirming the nitrogen enrichment found inour previous paper. from the late-time behavior of the light curves we findthat the emission origi- nates from progressively lower density gas. weestimate the emitting mass near maximum (roughly 400 days) to be roughly4.7e{-2} solar masses, assuming a filling factor of unity and an electrondensity of 2.6e4 cm^{-3}. these results are discussed in the context of currentmodels for the emission and hydrodynamics of the ring.

astro-ph;9712212	discovery of a supernova explosion at half the age of the universe and  its cosmological implications	the ultimate fate of the universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can bedetermined by measuring the redshifts, apparent brightnesses, and intrinsicluminosities of very distant supernovae. recent developments have providedtools that make such a program practicable: (1) studies of relatively nearbytype ia supernovae (sne ia) have shown that their intrinsic luminosities can beaccurately determined; (2) new research techniques have made it possible toschedule the discovery and follow-up observations of distant supernovae,producing well over 50 very distant (z = 0.3 -- 0.7) sne ia to date. thesedistant supernovae provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over thepast several billion years. by making precise measurements of supernovae atstill greater distances, and thus extending this expansion history back farenough in time, we can distinguish the slowing caused by the gravitationalattraction of the universe's mass density omega_m from the effect of a possiblyinflationary pressure caused by a cosmological constant lambda. we report herethe first such measurements, with our discovery of a type ia supernova (sn1997ap) at z = 0.83. measurements at the keck ii 10-m telescope make this themost distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. over two months ofphotometry of sn 1997ap with the hubble space telescope and ground-basedtelescopes, when combined with previous measurements of nearer sne ia, suggeststhat we may live in a low mass-density universe. further supernovae atcomparable distances are currently scheduled for ground and space-basedobservations.

astro-ph;9801205	radio supernovae as distance indicators	long-term monitoring of the radio emission from supernovae with the verylarge array (vla) shows that the radio ``light curves'' evolve in a systematicfashion with a distinct peak flux density (and thus, in combination with adistance, a peak spectral luminosity) at each frequency and a well-defined timefrom explosion to that peak. studying these two quantities at 6 cm wavelength,peak spectral luminosity (l_{6 cm peak}) and time after explosion date (t_0) toreach that peak (t_{6 cm peak} - t_0), we find that they appear related. inparticular, based on two objects, type ib supernovae may be approximate radio``standard candles'' with a 6 cm peak luminosity l_{6 cm peak} \approx 19.9 x10^{26} erg s^{-1} hz^{-1}; also based on two objects, type ic supernovae maybe approximate radio ``standard candles'' with a 6 cm peak luminosity l_{6 cmpeak} \approx 6.5 x 10^{26} erg s^{-1} hz^{-1}; and, based on twelve objects,type ii supernovae appear to obey a relation l_{6 cm peak} \simeq 5.5 x 10^{23}(t_{6 cm peak} - t_0)^{1.4} erg s^{-1} hz^{-1}, with time measured in days. ifthese relations are supported by further observations, they provide a means fordetermining distances to supernovae, and thus to their parent galaxies, frompurely radio continuum observations.

astro-ph;9812133	measurements of omega and lambda from 42 high-redshift supernovae	we report measurements of the mass density, omega_m, andcosmological-constant energy density, omega_lambda, of the universe based onthe analysis of 42 type ia supernovae discovered by the supernova cosmologyproject. the magnitude-redshift data for these sne, at redshifts between 0.18and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of sne from the calan/tololo supernovasurvey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmologicalparameters. all sn peak magnitudes are standardized using a sn ia lightcurvewidth-luminosity relation. the measurement yields a joint probabilitydistribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by therelation 0.8 omega_m - 0.6 omega_lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region ofinterest (omega_m &lt;~ 1.5). for a flat (omega_m + omega_lambda = 1) cosmology wefind omega_m = 0.28{+0.09,-0.08} (1 sigma statistical) {+0.05,-0.04}(identified systematics). the data are strongly inconsistent with a lambda = 0flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. an open, lambda = 0cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that thecosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of p(lambda &gt;0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. the best-fit ageof the universe relative to the hubble time is t_0 = 14.9{+1.4,-1.1} (0.63/h)gyr for a flat cosmology. the size of our sample allows us to perform a varietyof statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. wefind no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution ormalmquist bias between the low-redshift calan/tololo sample and ourhigh-redshift sample. the conclusions are robust whether or not awidth-luminosity relation is used to standardize the sn peak magnitudes.

astro-ph;9904389	cepheid calibration of the peak brightness of sne ia -- ix. sn 1989b in  ngc 3627	(abridged) repeated imaging observations have been made of ngc 3627 with thehst in 1997/98, over an interval of 58 days. images were obtained on 12 epochsin the f555w band and on five epochs in the f814w band. the galaxy hosted theprototypical, `branch normal', type ia supernova sn 1989b. a total of 83variables have been found, of which 68 are definite cepheid variables withperiods ranging from 75 days to 3.85 days. the de-reddened distance modulus isdetermined to be (m-m)_0= 30.22+/-0.12 (internal uncertainty) using a subset ofthe cepheid data whose reddening and error parameters are secure.  the photometric data of wells et al. (1994), combined with the cepheid datafor ngc 3627 give m_b(max)= -19.36+/-0.18 and m_v(max)= -19.34+/-0.16 for sn1989b. combined with the previous six calibrations in this program, plus twoadditional calibrations determined by others gives the mean absolute magnitudesat maximum of &lt;m_b&gt;= -19.48+/-0.07 and &lt;m_v&gt;= -19.48 +/-0.07 for `branchnormal' sne ia at this interim stage in the calibration program.  the second parameter correlations of m(max) of blue sne ia with decay rate,color at maximum, and hubble type are re-investigated. the dependence of&lt;m(max)&gt; on decay rate is non-linear, showing a minimum for decay rates between1.0&lt; delta m_15 &lt;1.6. magnitudes corrected for decay rate show no dependence onhubble type, but a dependence on color remains. correcting both the fiducialsample of 34 sne ia with decay-rate data and the current 8 calibrating sne iafor the correlation with decay rate as well as color gives h_0= 60+/-2(internal) km/s/mpc, in both b and v. the same value to within 4% is obtainedif only the sne ia in spirals (without second parameter corrections) areconsidered.

astro-ph;9906496	direct analysis of spectra of the type ic supernova 1994i	synthetic spectra generated with the parameterized supernovasynthetic-spectrum code synow are compared to observed photospheric-phasespectra of the type ic supernova 1994i. the observed optical spectra can bewell matched by synthetic spectra that are based on the assumption of sphericalsymmetry. we consider the identification of the infrared absorption featureobserved near 10,250 \aa, which previously has been attributed to he i$\lambda10830$ and regarded as strong evidence that sn 1994i ejected somehelium. we have difficulty accounting for the infrared absorption with he ialone. it could be a blend of he i and c i lines. alternatively, we find thatit can be fit by si i lines without compromising the fit in the optical region.  in synthetic spectra that match the observed spectra, from 4 days before to26 days after the time of maximum brightness, the adopted velocity at thephotosphere decreases from 17,500 to 7000 \kms. simple estimates of the kineticenergy carried by the ejected mass give values that are near the canonicalsupernova energy of $10^{51}$ ergs. the velocities and kinetic energies that wefind for sn 1994i in this way are much lower than those that we find elsewherefor the peculiar type ic sne 1997ef and 1998bw, which therefore appear to havebeen hyper-energetic.
