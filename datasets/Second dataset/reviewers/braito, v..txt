0901.4809	variable partial covering and a relativistic iron line in ngc 1365	we present a complete analysis of the hard x-ray (2-10 kev) properties of theseyfert galaxy ngc 1365, based on a 60 ks xmm-newton observation performed injanuary 2004. the two main results are: 1) we detect an obscuring cloud withn_h~3.5x10^23 cm^(-2) crossing the line of sight in ~25 ks. this implies adimension of the x-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance ofthe obscuring cloud of the order of 10^16 cm. adopting the black hole massm(bh) estimated from the m(bh)-velocity dispersion relation, the source size isd_s&lt;20 r_g and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds arer~3000-10000 r_g and n~10^(10) cm^(-3), i.e. typical values for broad lineregion clouds. 2) an iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detectedwith high statistical significance. a time integrated fit of the line+continuumreflection components suggests a high iron abundance (~3 times solar) and anorigin of these components in the inner part (~10 r_g) of the accretion disk,in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of theabsorption variability.

0905.1041	a suzaku observation of the ulirg iras19254-7245: disclosing the agn  component	we discuss here a long suzaku observation of iras 19254-7245 (also known asthe superantennae), one of the brightest and well studied ultra luminousinfrared galaxies in the local universe. this long observation provided thefirst detection of iras 19254-7245 above 10 kev, and measured a 15-30 kev fluxof ~5x10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. the detection above 10 kev has allowed us tounveil, for the first time, the intrinsic luminosity of the agn hosted in iras19254-7245, which is strongly absorbed (nh ~ 3x10^(24) cm^-2) and has anintrinsic luminosity in the qso regime (l(2-10 kev) ~ 3 x 10^(44) erg s^-1).the 2-10 kev spectrum of iras 19254-7245 is remarkably hard (gamma~1.2), andpresents a strong iron line (ew ~0.7 kev), clearly suggesting that below 10 kevwe are seeing only reprocessed radiation. since the energy of the fe k emissionis found to be at ~6.7 kev, consistent with he-like fe, and its ew is too highto be explained in a starburst dominated scenario, we suggest that the 2--10kev emission of iras 19254-7245 is dominated by reflection/scattering fromhighly ionized matter. indeed, within this latter scenario we found that thephoton index of the illuminating source is gamma=1.87 (+0.11,-0.28), inexcellent agreement with the mean value found for radio quiet unobscured agn.

0906.0312	a compton-thick wind in the high luminosity quasar, pds 456	pds 456 is a nearby (z=0.184), luminous (l_bol ~10^47 erg/s) type i quasar. adeep 190 ks suzaku observation in february 2007 revealed the complex, broadband x-ray spectrum of pds 456. the suzaku spectrum exhibits highlystatistically significant absorption features near 9 kev in the quasarrest--frame. we show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is fromblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 kevin the rest frame). this indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be presentmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). a possible hard x-ray excessis detected above 15 kev with hxd (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise fromhigh column density gas (nh&gt;10^24cm^-2) partially covering the x-ray emission,or through strong compton reflection. here we propose that the iron k-shellabsorption in pds 456 is associated with a thick, possibly clumpy outflow,covering about 20% of $4\pi$ steradian solid angle. the outflow is likelylaunched from the inner accretion disk, within 15-100 gravitational radii ofthe black hole. the kinetic power of the outflow may be similar to thebolometric luminosity of pds 456. such a powerful wind could have a significanteffect on the co-evolution of the host galaxy and its supermassive black hole,through feedback.

0906.0799	structure of the accretion flow in broad-line radio galaxies: the case  of 3c390.3	we present xmm and suzaku observations of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg)3c390.3. the fe ka line has a width fwhm ~ 8,800 km/s, consistent within afactor two with the width of the double-peaked h_alpha line, suggesting anorigin from the broad line region. the data show for the first time a weak,broad bump extending from 5 to 7 kev. when fitted with a gaussian, its centroidenergy is 6.6 kev in the source's rest-frame with fwhm of 43,000 km/s and ew of50 ev; its most likely interpretation is emission from he-like fe (fe xxv),suggesting the presence of an ionized medium in the inner regions of 3c390.3.the broad-band 0.5-100 kev continuum is well described by a single power lawwith photon index gamma=1.6 and cutoff energy 157 kev, plus cold reflectionwith strength r=0.5. in addition, ionized reflection is required to account forthe 6.6 kev bump in the broad-band continuum, yielding an ionization parameterxi ~ 2700 ergs cm s^-1; the inner radius of the ionized reflector isconstrained to be larger than 20 r_g, although this result depends on theassumed emissivity profile of the disk. if true, we argue that the lack ofbroad fe k emission from within 20 r_g indicates that the innermost regions ofthe disk in 3c390.3 are obscured and/or poorly illuminated. while the sed of3c390.3 is generally dominated by accretion-related continuum, during accretionlow states the jet can significantly contribute in the optical to x-ray bandsvia synchrotron self-compton emission.

0907.2659	swift observations of gw lib: a unique insight into a rare outburst	the second known outburst of the wz sge type dwarf nova gw lib was observedin april 2007. we have obtained unique multiwavelength data of this outburstwhich lasted ~ 26 days. aavso observers recorded the outburst in the optical,which was also monitored by wasp, with a peak v magnitude of ~ 8. the outburstwas followed in the uv and x-ray wavelengths by the swift uvot and xrttelescopes. the x-ray flux at optical maximum was found to be three orders ofmagnitude above the pre-outburst quiescent level, whereas x-rays are normallysuppressed during dwarf nova outbursts. a distinct supersoft x-ray componentwas also detected at optical maximum, which probably arises from anoptically-thick boundary layer. follow-up swift observations taken one and twoyears after the outburst show that the post-outburst quiescent x-ray fluxremains an order of magnitude higher than the pre-outburst flux. the longinteroutburst timescale of gw lib with no observed normal outbursts support theidea that the inner disc in gw lib is evacuated or the disc viscosity is verylow.

0908.0716	short-term variability and psd analysis of the radio-loud agn 3c 390.3	we investigate the short-term variability properties and the power spectraldensity (psd) of the broad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 390.3 using observationsmade by xmm, rxte, and suzaku on several occasions between october 2004 anddecember 2006. the main aim of this work is to derive model-independentconstraints on the origin of the x-ray emission and on the nature of thecentral engine in 3c 390.3. on timescales of the order of few hours, probed byuninterrupted xmm light curves, the flux of 3c 390.3 is consistent with beingconstant in all energy bands. on longer timescales, probed by the 2-day rxteand suzaku observations, the flux variability becomes significant. the latterobservation confirms that the spectral variability behavior of 3c 390.3 isconsistent with the spectral evolution observed in radio-quiet seyfertgalaxies: the spectrum softens as the source brightens. the correlatedvariability between soft and hard x-rays, observed during the suzaku exposureand between the 2 xmm pointings, taken 1 week apart, argues against scenarioscharacterized by the presence of two distinct variable components in the 0.5-10kev x-ray band. a detailed psd analysis carried out over five decades infrequency suggests the presence of a break at t_br~43 days at a 92% confidencelevel. this is the second tentative detection of a psd break in a radio-loud,non-jet dominated agn, after the blrg 3c120, and appears to be in generalagreement with the relation between t_br, m_bh, and l_bol, followed by seyfertgalaxies. our results indicate that the x-ray variability properties of 3c390.3 are broadly consistent with those of radio-quiet agn, suggesting that thex-ray emission mechanism in 3c 390.3 is similar to that of nearby seyfertgalaxies without any significant contribution from a jet component.

0707.2950	relativistic iron k emission and absorption in the seyfert 1.9 galaxy  mcg-5-23-16	we present the results of the simultaneous deep xmm and chandra observationsof the bright seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg-5-23-16, which is thought to have one ofthe best known examples of a relativistically broadened iron k-alpha line. thetime averaged spectral analysis shows that the iron k-shell complex is bestmodeled with an unresolved narrow emission component (fwhm &lt; 5000 km/s, ew ~ 60ev) plus a broad component. this latter component has fwhm ~ 44000 km/s and ew~ 50 ev. its profile is well described by an emission line originating from anaccretion disk viewed with an inclination angle ~ 40^\circ and with theemission arising from within a few tens of gravitational radii of the centralblack hole. the time-resolved spectral analysis of the xmm epic-pn spectrumshows that both the narrow and broad components of the fe k emission lineappear to be constant in time within the errors. we detected a narrow sporadicabsorption line at 7.7 kev which appears to be variable on a time-scale of 20ksec. if associated with fe xxvi ly-alpha this absorption is indicative of apossibly variable, high ionization, high velocity outflow. the variability ofthis absorption feature appears to rule out a local (z=0) origin. the analysisof the xmm rgs spectrum reveals that the soft x-ray emission of mcg-5-23-16 islikely dominated by several emission lines superimposed on an unabsorbedscattered power-law continuum. the lack of strong fe l shell emission togetherwith the detection of a strong forbidden line in the o vii triplet isconsistent with a scenario where the soft x-ray emission lines are produced ina plasma photoionized by the nuclear emission.

1002.0082	significant x-ray line emission in the 5-6 kev band of ngc 4051	a suzaku x-ray observation of ngc 4051 taken during 2005 nov reveals lineemission at 5.44 kev in the rest-frame of the galaxy which does not have anobvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. the improvement to thefit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at &gt;99.9%confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three xisunits independently. comparison between the data and monte carlo simulationsshows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p &lt;3.3 x 10^-4. consideration of three independent line detections in suzaku datataken at different epochs yields a probability p&lt; 3 x 10^-11 and thusconclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in thedata. the new line and a strong component of fe ka emission from neutralmaterial are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. spectra from2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energyas that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constantequivalent width against the observed continuum. the stability of the line fluxand energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has beensuggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a speciallocation in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of fe into cr, asdiscussed in a companion paper.

1003.1789	ngc 2992 in an x-ray high state observed by xmm: response of the  relativistic fe k$\alpha$ line to the continuum	we present the analysis of an xmm observation of the seyfert galaxy ngc 2992.the source was found in its highest level of x-ray activity yet detected, afactor $\sim 23.5$ higher in 2--10 kev flux than the historical minimum. ngc2992 is known to exhibit x-ray flaring activity on timescales of days to weeks,and the xmm data provide at least factor of $\sim 3$ better spectral resolutionin the fe k band than any previously measured flaring x-ray state. we find thatthere is a broad feature in the \sim 5-7 kev band which could be interpreted asa relativistic fe k$\alpha$ emission line. its flux appears to have increasedin tandem with the 2--10 kev continuum when compared to a previous suzakuobservation when the continuum was a factor of $\sim 8$ lower than that duringthe xmm observation. the xmm data are consistent with the general picture thatincreased x-ray activity and corresponding changes in the fe k$\alpha$ lineemission occur in the innermost regions of the putative accretion disk. thisbehavior contrasts with the behavior of other agn in which the fe k$\alpha$line does not respond to variability in the x-ray.

1005.3365	"comets" orbiting a black hole	we use a long (300 ksec), continuous suzaku x-ray observation of the activenucleus in ngc1365 to investigate the structure of the circumnuclear blr cloudsthrough their occultation of the x-ray source. the variations of the absorbingcolumn density and of the covering factor indicate that the clouds surroundingthe black hole are far from having a spherical geometry (as sometimes assumed),instead they have a strongly elongated and cometary shape, with a dense head(n=10^11 cm^-3) and an expanding, dissolving tail. we infer that the cometarytails must be longer than a few times 10^13 cm and their opening angle must besmaller than a few degrees. we suggest that the cometary shape may be a commonfeature of blr clouds in general, but which has been difficult to recognizeobservationally so far. the cometary shape may originate from shocks andhydrodynamical instabilities generated by the supersonic motion of the blrclouds into the intracloud medium. as a consequence of the mass loss into theirtail, we infer that the blr clouds probably have a lifetime of only a fewmonths, implying that they must be continuously replenished. we also find alarge, puzzling discrepancy (two orders of magnitude) between the mass of theblr inferred from the properties of the absorbing clouds and the mass of theblr inferred from photoionization models; we discuss the possible solutions tothis discrepancy.

1006.1318	evidence for a truncated accretion disc in the low luminosity seyfert  galaxy, ngc 7213?	we present the broad-band 0.6-150 kev suzaku and swift bat spectra of the lowluminosity seyfert galaxy, ngc 7213. the time-averaged continuum emission iswell fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index gamma = 1.75 and fromconsideration of the fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be350 kev &lt; e &lt; 25 mev. line emission from both near-neutral iron k_alpha at 6.39kev and highly ionised iron, from fe_(xxv) and fe_(xxvi), is strongly detectedin the suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observationswith chandra and xmm-newton. we find the centroid energies for the fe_(xxv) andfe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 kev and 6.95 kev respectively, with the latterappearing to be resolved in the suzaku spectrum. we show that the fe_(xxv) andfe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of columndensity n_(h) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). a compton reflection component, e.g.,originating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a compton-thick torus,appears either very weak or absent in this agn, subtending &lt; 1 sr to the x-raysource, consistent with previous findings. indeed the absence of either neutralor ionised compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic fe ksignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretiondisc is absent in this source. instead, the accretion disc could be truncatedwith the inner regions perhaps replaced by a compton-thin radiativelyinefficient accretion flow. thus, the fe_(xxv) and fe_(xxvi) emission couldboth originate in ionised material perhaps at the transition region between thehot, inner flow and the cold, truncated accretion disc on the order of 10^(3) -10^(4) gravitational radii from the black hole. the origin for the unresolvedneutral fe k_alpha emission is then likely to be further out, perhapsoriginating in the optical blr or a compton-thin pc-scale torus.

1006.2858	evidence for ultra-fast outflows in radio-quiet agns: i - detection and  statistical incidence of fe k-shell absorption lines	we performed a blind search for narrow absorption features at energiesgreater than 6.4 kev in a sample of 42 radio-quiet agns observed withxmm-newton. we detect 36 narrow absorption lines on a total of 101 xmm-newtonepic pn observations. the number of absorption lines at rest-frame energies e&gt;7kev is 22. their global probability to be generated by random fluctuations isvery low, less than 3x10^-8, and their detection have been independentlyconfirmed by a spectral analysis of the mos data, with associated randomprobability &lt;10^-7. we identify the lines as fe xxv and fe xxvi k-shellresonant absorption. they are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocitydistribution ranging from zero up to 0.3c, with a peak and mean value at 0.1c.we detect variability of the lines on both ews and blue-shifted velocitiesamong different observations even on time-scales as short as a few days,possibly suggesting somewhat compact absorbers. moreover, we find nosignificant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources andthe lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination bylocal absorption. if we define ultra-fast outflows (ufos) those highly ionizedabsorbers with outflow velocities higher than 10^4 km/s, then the majority ofthe lines are consistent with being associated to ufos and the fraction ofobjects with detected ufos in the whole sample is at least 35%. this fractionis similar for type 1 and type 2 sources. the global covering fraction of theabsorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range c=0.4-0.6, therebyimplying large opening angles. these lines indicate that ufos are a rathercommon phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and theyare probably the direct signature of agn accretion disk winds/ejecta. thedetailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in acompanion paper.

1006.3536	discovery of ultra-fast outflows in a sample of broad line radio  galaxies observed with suzaku	we present the results of a uniform and systematic search for blue-shifted fek absorption lines in the x-ray spectra of five bright broad-line radiogalaxies (blrgs) observed with suzaku. we detect, for the first time at x-raysin radio-loud agn, several absorption lines at energies greater than 7 kev inthree out of five sources, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. the lines aredetected with high significance according to both the f-test and extensivemonte carlo simulations. their likely interpretation as blue-shifted fe xxv andfe xxvi k-shell resonance lines implies an origin from highly ionized gasoutflowing with mildly relativistic velocities, in the range 0.04-0.15c. a fitwith specific photo-ionization models gives ionization parameters in the rangelog_xi~4-5.6 and column densities of n_h~10^22-10^23 cm^-2. thesecharacteristics are very similar to those of the ultra-fast outflows (ufos)previously observed in radio-quiet agn. their estimated location within~0.01-0.3pc from the central super-massive black hole suggests a likely originrelated with accretion disk winds/outflows. depending on the absorber coveringfraction, the mass outflow rate of these ufos can be comparable to theaccretion rate and their kinetic power can correspond to a significant fractionof the bolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power.therefore, these ufos can play a significant role in the expected feedback fromthe agn on the surrounding environment and can give us further clues on therelation between the accretion disk and the formation of winds/jets in bothradio-quiet and radio-loud agn.

1006.5035	x-ray reverberation in 1h0707-495 revisited	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 has previously been identified asshowing time lags between flux variations in the soft- (0.3-1 kev) andmedium-energy (1-4 kev) x-ray bands that oscillate between positive andnegative values as a function of the frequency of the mode of variation. herewe measure and analyse the lags also between a harder x-ray band (4-7.5 kev)and the soft and medium bands, using existing xmm-newton data, and demonstratethat the entire spectrum of lags, considering both the full energy range,0.3-7.5 kev, and the full frequency range, 10^-5 &lt; nu &lt; 10^-2 hz, areinconsistent with previous claims of arising as reverberation associated withthe inner accretion disk. instead we demonstrate that a simple reverberationmodel, in which scattering or reflection is present in all x-ray bands,explains the full set of lags without requiring any ad hoc explanation for thetime lag sign changes. the range of time delays required to explain theobserved lags extends up to about 1800 s in the hard band. the results areconsistent with reverberation caused by scattering of x-rays passing through anabsorbing medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy and thatpartially-covers the source. a high covering factor of absorbing and scatteringcircumnuclear material is inferred.

1010.2085	suzaku and swift-bat observations of a newly discovered compton-thick  agn	obscured agn are fundamental to understand the history of super massive blackhole growth and their influence on galaxy formation. however, the compton-thickagn (nh&gt;1e24 cm^-2) population is basically unconstrained, with less than fewdozen confirmed compton-thick agn found and studied so far. a way to selectheavily obscured agn is to compare the x-ray emission below 10 kev (which isstrongly depressed) with the emission from other bands less affected by theabsorption, i.e. the ir band. to this end, we have cross-correlated the 2xmmcatalogue with the iras point source catalogue and, by using the x-ray toinfrared flux ratio and x-ray colors, we selected a well defined sample ofcompton-thick agn candidates at z&lt;0.1. the aim of this work is to confirm thenature and to study one of these local compton-thick agn candidates, the nearby(z=0.029) seyfert 2 galaxy iras 04507+0358, by constraining the amount ofintrinsic absorption (nh) and thus the intrinsic luminosity. to this end weobtained deep (100 ks) suzaku observations (ao4 call) and performed a joint fitwith swift-bat data. we analyzed xmm-newton, suzaku and swift-bat data and wepresent here the results of this broad-band (0.4-100 kev) spectral analysis. wefound that the broad-band x-ray emission of iras 04507+0358 requires a largeamount of absorption (larger than 1e24 cm^-2) to be well reproduced, thusconfirming the compton-thick nature of this source. in particular, the mostprobable scenario is that of a mildly (nh (1.3-1.5)x1e24 cm^-2, l(2-10 kev)(5-7)x1e43 erg s^-1) compton-thick agn.

1104.1812	the suzaku view of 3c 382	we present a long suzaku observation of 3c 382. a swift bat spectrum from the58-month survey is also analyzed, together with an archival xmm-newton epicexposure. our main result is the finding with suzaku of a broad fek line with arelativistic profile consistent with emission from an accretion disk at tens ofgravitational radii from the central black hole. the xis data indicate emissionfrom highly ionized iron and allow us to set tight, albeit model-dependent,constraints on the inner and outer radii of the disk reflecting region,r_in~10r_g and r_out~20r_g, respectively, and on the disk inclination, i~30deg.two ionized reflection components are possibly observed, with similarcontributions of ~10% to the total continuum. a highly ionized one, withlog_xi~3, which successfully models the relativistic line and a mildly ionizedone, with log_xi~1.5, which models the narrow fe k line and high energy hump.when both these components are included, there is no further requirement for anadditional black body soft excess below 2kev. the suzaku data confirm thepresence of a warm absorber previously known from grating studies. afteraccounting for all the spectral features, the intrinsic photon index of thex-ray continuum is ~1.8 with a cutoff energy at ~200kev, consistent withcomptonization models and excluding jet-related emission up to these energies.comparison of the x-ray properties of 3c 382 and other blrgs to seyfertsconfirms the idea that the distinction between radio-loud and radio-quiet agnat x-rays is blurred.

1108.2609	the high energy view of the broad line radio galaxy 3c 111	we present the analysis of suzaku and xmm-newton observations of thebroad-line radio galaxy (blrg) 3c 111. its high energy emission showsvariability, a harder continuum with respect to the radio quiet agn population,and weak reflection features. suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;a comparison with the xmm-newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 inthe 0.5-10 kev flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. the ironk complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).the intensity of the iron k complex does not respond to the change in continuumflux. an ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in thexis data; the absorber is most likely unstable. indeed, during the xmm-newtonobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. no clearroll-over in the hard x-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergenceof the jet as a dominant component in the hard x-ray band, as suggested by thedetection above ~ 100 kev with the gso on-board suzaku, although the presentdata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of thedifferent components. the fluxes observed by the gamma-ray satellites cgro andfermi would be compatible with the putative jet component if peaking atenergies e ~ 100 mev. in the x-ray band, the jet contribution to the continuumstarts to be significant only above 10 kev. if the detection of the jetcomponent in 3c 111 is confirmed, then its relative importance in the x-rayenergy band could explain the different observed properties in the high-energyemission of blrgs, which are otherwise similar in their other multiwavelengthproperties. comparison between x-ray and gamma-ray data taken at differentepochs suggests that the strong variability observed for 3c 111 is probablydriven by a change in the primary continuum.

1109.2882	evidence for ultra-fast outflows in radio-quiet agns: ii - detailed  photo-ionization modeling of fe k-shell absorption lines	x-ray absorption line spectroscopy has recently shown evidence for previouslyunknown ultra-fast outflows (ufos) in radio-quiet agns. in the previous paperof this series we defined ufos as those absorbers with an outflow velocityhigher than 10,000km/s and assessed the statistical significance of theassociated blueshifted fek absorption lines in a large sample of 42 localradio-quiet agns observed with xmm-newton. in the present paper we report adetailed curve of growth analysis and directly model the fek absorbers with thexstar photo-ionization code. we confirm that the frequency of sources in theradio-quiet sample showing ufos is &gt;35%. the outflow velocity distributionspans from \sim10,000km/s (\sim0.03c) up to \sim100,000km/s (\sim0.3c), with apeak and mean value of \sim42,000km/s (\sim0.14c). the ionization parameter isvery high and in the range log\xi 3-6erg s^{-1} cm, with a mean value of log\xi4.2 erg s^{-1} cm. the associated column densities are also large, in the rangen_h\sim10^{22}-10^{24} cm^{-2}, with a mean value of n_h\sim10^{23} cm^{-2}. wediscuss and estimate how selection effects, such as those related to thelimited instrumental sensitivity at energies above 7kev, may hamper thedetection of even higher velocities and higher ionization absorbers. we arguethat, overall, these results point to the presence of extremely ionized andpossibly almost compton thick outflowing material in the innermost regions ofagns. this also suggests that ufos may potentially play a significant role inthe expected cosmological feedback from agns and their study can provideimportant clues on the connection between accretion disks, winds and jets.

1111.0908	new insights on the accretion disk-winds connection in radio-loud agns  from suzaku	from the spectral analysis of long suzaku observations of five radio-loudagns we have been able to discover the presence of ultra-fast outflows withvelocities ~0.1c in three of them, namely 3c 111, 3c 120 and 3c 390.3. they areconsistent with being accretion disk winds/outflows. we also performed afollow-up on 3c 111 to monitor its outflow on ~7days time-scales and detectedan anti-correlated variability of a possible relativistic emission line withrespect to blue-shifted fe k features, following a flux increase. this providesthe first direct evidence for an accretion disk-wind connection in an agn. themass outflow rate of these outflows can be comparable to the accretion rate andtheir mechanical power can correspond to a significant fraction of thebolometric luminosity and is comparable to their typical jet power. therefore,they can possibly play a significant role in the expected feedback from agnsand can give us further clues on the relation between the accretion disk andthe formation of winds/jets.

0704.3053	the remarkable x-ray spectrum of the broad-line radio galaxy 3c 445	we present the results of the analysis of an archival 15 ks xmm-newtonobservation of the nearby (z=0.057) radio-loud source 3c445, opticallyclassified as a broad-line radio galaxy. while the rgs data are of insufficientquality to allow a meaningful analysis, the epic data show a remarkable x-rayspectrum. the 2-10 kev continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (nh~ 1e22 -1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index gamma ~1.4, and strong (r~2) coldreflection. a narrow, unresolved fe kalpha emission line is detected,confirming previous findings, with ew 120ev. a soft excess is present below 2kev over the extrapolation of the hard x-ray power law, which we model with apower law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by acolumn density nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to galactic. a host of emission lines arepresent below 2 kev, confirming previous indications from asca, due to h- andhe-like o, mg, and si. we attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionizedgas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured agn. two differentionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the softx-ray data satisfactorily. the similarity of the x-ray spectrum of 3c445 toseyferts underscores that the central engines of radio-loud and radio-quiet agnsimilarly host both cold and warm gas.

1201.1897	evidence for ultra-fast outflows in radio-quiet agns: iii - location and  energetics	using the results of a previous x-ray photo-ionization modelling ofblue-shifted fe k absorption lines on a sample of 42 local radio-quiet agnsobserved with xmm-newton, in this letter we estimate the location andenergetics of the associated ultra-fast outflows (ufos). due to significantuncertainties, we are essentially able to place only lower/upper limits. onaverage, their location is in the interval ~0.0003-0.03pc (~10^2-10^4 r_s) fromthe central black hole, consistent with what is expected for accretion diskwinds/outflows. the mass outflow rates are constrained between ~0.01-1m_{\odot} yr^{-1}, corresponding to &gt;5-10% of the accretion rates. the averagelower-upper limits on the mechanical power are log\dot{e}_k~42.6-44.6 ergs^{-1}. however, the minimum possible value of the ratio between the mechanicalpower and bolometric luminosity is constrained to be comparable or higher thanthe minimum required by simulations of feedback induced by winds/outflows.therefore, this work demonstrates that ufos are indeed capable to provide asignificant contribution to the agn cosmological feedback, in agreement withtheoretical expectations and the recent observation of interactions between agnoutflows and the interstellar medium in several seyferts galaxies.

1204.2258	observations of outflowing uv absorbers in ngc 4051 with the cosmic  origins spectrograph	we present new hubble space telescope (hst)/cosmic origins spectrographobservations of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051. these data wereobtained as part of a coordinated observing program including x-rayobservations with the chandra/high energy transmission grating (hetg)spectrometer and suzaku. we detected nine kinematic components of uvabsorption, which were previously identified using the hst/space telescopeimaging spectrograph. none of the absorption components showed evidence forchanges in column density or profile within the \sim 10 yr between the stis andcos observations, which we interpret as evidence of 1) saturation, for thestronger components, or 2) very low densities, i.e., n_h &lt; 1 cm^-3, for theweaker components. after applying a +200 km s^-1 offset to the hetg spectrum,we found that the radial velocities of the uv absorbers lay within the o viiprofile. based on photoionization models, we suggest that, while uv components2, 5 and 7 produce significant o vii absorption, the bulk of the x-rayabsorption detected in the hetg analysis occurs in more highly ionized gas.moreover, the mass loss rate is dominated by high ionization gas which lacks asignificant uv footprint.

1204.3461	investigating slim disk solutions for hlx-1 in eso 243-49	the hyper luminous x-ray source hlx-1 in the galaxy eso 243-49, currently thebest intermediate mass black hole candidate, displays spectral transitionssimilar to those observed in galactic black hole binaries, but with aluminosity 100-1000 times higher. we investigated the x-ray properties of thisunique source fitting multi-epoch data collected by swift, xmm-newton &amp; chandrawith a disk model computing spectra for a wide range of sub- andsuper-eddington accretion rates assuming a non-spinning black hole and aface-on disk (i = 0 deg). under these assumptions we find that the black holein hlx-1 is in the intermediate mass range (~2 x 10^4 m_odot) and the accretionflow is in the sub-eddington regime. the disk radiation efficiency is eta =0.11 +/-0.03. we also show that the source does follow the l_x ~ t^4 relationfor our mass estimate. at the outburst peaks, the source radiates near theeddington limit. the accretion rate then stays constant around 4 x 10^(-4)m_odot yr^(-1) for several days and then decreases exponentially. such"plateaus" in the accretion rate could be evidence that enhanced mass transferrate is the driving outburst mechanism in hlx-1. we also report on the newoutburst observed in august 2011 by the swift-x-ray telescope. the time of thisnew outburst further strengthens the ~1 year recurrence timescale.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1210.5949	decoupling absorption and continuum variability in the seyfert 2 ngc  4507	we present the results of the suzaku observation of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc4507. this source is one of the x-ray brightest compton-thin seyfert 2s and acandidate for a variable absorber. suzaku caught ngc 4507 in a highly absorbedstate characterised by a high column density (nh \sim8 x10^23 cm^-2), a strongreflected component (r\sim 1.9) and a high equivalent width fe k alpha emissionline (ew\sim 500 ev). the fe k alpha emission line is unresolved at theresolution of the suzaku ccds (sigma &lt; 30 ev or fwhm &lt; 3000 km s^-1) and mostlikely originates in a distant absorber. the fe k beta emission line is alsoclearly detected and its intensity is marginally higher than the theoreticalvalue for low ionisation fe. a comparison with previous observations performedwith xmm-newton and bepposax reveals that the x-ray spectral curvature changeson a timescale of a few months. we analysed all these historical observations,with standard models as well as with a most recent model for a toroidalreprocessor and found that the main driver of the observed 2-10 kev spectralvariability is a change of the line-of-sight obscuration, varying from\sim4x10^23 cm^-2 to \sim9 x 10^23 cm^-2. the primary continuum is alsovariable, although its photon index does not appear to vary, while the fe kalpha line and reflection component are consistent with being constant acrossthe observations. this suggests the presence of a rather constant reprocessorand that the observed line of sight nh variability is either due to a certaindegree of clumpiness of the putative torus or due to the presence of a secondclumpy absorber.

1212.4851	unification of x-ray winds in seyfert galaxies: from ultra-fast outflows  to warm absorbers	the existence of ionized x-ray absorbing layers of gas along the line ofsight to the nuclei of seyfert galaxies is a well established observationalfact. this material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range inparameters. however, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. inorder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literaturesearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft x-ray warm absorbers(was) in 35 type 1 seyferts and compared their properties to those of theultra-fast outflows (ufos) detected in the same sample. the fraction of sourceswith was is &gt;60%, consistent with previous studies. the fraction of sourceswith ufos is &gt;34%, &gt;67% of which also show was. the large dynamic rangeobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the firsttime, to investigate general relations among them. in particular, we findsignificant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to thecentral black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity andconsequently the mechanical power. the absorbers continuously populate thewhole parameter space, with the was and the ufos lying always at the two endsof the distribution. this strongly suggest that these absorbers, oftenconsidered of different types, could actually represent parts of a singlelarge-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the blackhole. the observed parameters and correlations are consistent with bothradiation pressure through compton scattering and mhd processes contributing tothe outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role. most of theabsorbers, especially the ufos, have a sufficiently high mechanical power tosignificantly contribute to agn feedback.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

1402.3700	revealing the location and structure of the accretion disk-wind in  pds456	we present evidence for the rapid variability of the high velocity ironk-shell absorption in the nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar pds456. from a recent longsuzaku observation in 2013 ($\sim1$ms effective duration) we find that the theequivalent width of iron k absorption increases by a factor of $\sim5$ duringthe observation, increasing from $&lt;105$ev within the first 100ks of theobservation, towards a maximum depth of $\sim500$ev near the end. the impliedoutflow velocity of $\sim0.25$c is consistent with that claimed from earlier(2007, 2011) suzaku observations. the absorption varies on time-scales as shortas $\sim1$ week. we show that this variability can be equally well attributedto either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpytime-variable outflow, or (ii) the decreasing ionization of a smoothhomogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the localphoton field. the variability allows a direct measure of absorber location,which is constrained to within $r=200-3500$$\rm{r_{g}}$ of the black hole. evenin the most conservative case the kinetic power of the outflow is $\gtrsim6\%$of the eddington luminosity, with a mass outflow rate in excess of $\sim40\%$of the eddington accretion rate. the wind momentum rate is directly equivalentto the eddington momentum rate which suggests that the flow may have beenaccelerated by continuum-scattering during an episode of eddington-limitedaccretion.

1402.4483	the puzzling x-ray continuum of the quasar mr 2251-178	we report on a comprehensive x-ray spectral analysis of the nearbyradio-quiet quasar mr 2251-178, based on the long-look (~ 400 ks) xmm-newtonobservation carried out in november 2011. as the properties of the multiphasewarm absorber (thoroughly discussed in a recent, complementary work) hint at asteep photoionizing continuum, here we investigate into the nature of theintrinsic x-ray emission of mr 2251-178 by testing several physical models. theapparent 2-10 kev flatness as well as the subtle broadband curvature can beascribed to partial covering of the x-ray source by a cold, clumpy absorptionsystem with column densities ranging from a fraction to several x10^23 cm^-2.as opposed to more complex configurations, only one cloud is required along theline of sight in the presence of a soft x-ray excess, possibly arising ascomptonized disc emission in the accretion disc atmosphere. on statisticalgrounds, even reflection with standard efficiency off the surface of the innerdisc cannot be ruled out, although this tentatively overpredicts the observed ~14-150 kev emission. it is thus possible that each of the examined physicalprocesses is relevant to a certain degree, and hence only a combination ofhigh-quality, simultaneous broadband spectral coverage and multi-epochmonitoring of x-ray spectral variability could help disentangling the differentcontributions. yet, regardless of the model adopted, we infer for mr 2251-178 abolometric luminosity of ~ 5-7 x 10^45 erg/s, implying that the central blackhole is accreting at ~ 15-25 per cent of the eddington limit.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1501.01444	exploring the active galactic nuclei population with extreme x-ray to  optical flux ratios (fx/fo &gt;50)	the cosmic history of the growth of supermassive black holes in galacticcenters parallels that of star-formation in the universe. however, an importantfraction of this growth occurs inconspicuously in obscured objects, whereultraviolet/optical/near-infrared emission is heavily obscured by dust. sincethe x-ray flux is less attenuated, a high x-ray-to-optical flux ratio (fx/fo)is expected to be an efficient tool to find out these obscured accretingsources. we explore here via optical spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy andinfrared photometry the most extreme cases of this population (those with fx/fo&gt;50, exo50 sources hereafter), using a well defined sample of seven x-raysources extracted from the 2xmm catalogue. five exo50 sources (about 70 percentof the sample) in the bright flux regime explored by our survey (f(2-10 kev) &gt;1.5e-13 cgs) are associated with obscured agn (nh &gt; 1.0e22 cm-2), spanning aredshift range between 0.75 and 1 and characterised by 2-10 kev intrinsicluminosities in the qso regime (e.g. well in excess to 1.0e44 cgs). we did notfind compelling evidence of compton thick agn. overall the exo50 type 2 qsos donot seem to be different from standard x-ray selected type 2 qsos in terms ofnuclear absorption; a very high agn/host galaxy ratio seems to play a majorrole in explaining their extreme properties. interestingly three out of fiveexo50 type 2 qso objects can be classified as extreme dust obscured galaxies(edogs), suggesting that a very high agn/host ratios (along with the largeamount of dust absorption) could be the natural explanation also for a part ofthe edog population. the remaining two exo50 sources are classified as bl lacobjects, having rather extreme properties, and which are good candidates fortev emission.

1506.00614	the suzaku view of highly-ionised outflows in agn: ii -- location,  energetics and scalings with bolometric luminosity	ongoing studies with xmm-newton have shown that powerful accretion discwinds, as revealed through highly-ionised fe\,k-shell absorption at e&gt;=6.7 kev,are present in a significant fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn) in thelocal universe (tombesi et al. 2010). in gofford et al. (2013) we analysed asample of 51 suzaku-observed agn and independently detected fe k absorption in~40% of the sample, and we measured the properties of the absorbing gas. inthis work we build upon these results to consider the properties of theassociated wind. on average, the fast winds (v_out&gt;0.01c) are located&lt;r&gt;~10^{15-18} cm (typically ~10^{2-4} r_s) from their black hole, their massoutflow rates are of the order &lt;m_out&gt;~0.01-1 msun/yr or ~(0.01-1) m_edd andkinetic power is constrained to &lt;l_k&gt; ~10^{43-45} erg/s, equivalent to~(0.1-10%) l_edd. we find a fundamental correlation between the sourcebolometric luminosity and the wind velocity, with v_out \propto l_bol^{\alpha}and \alpha=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ (90% confidence), which indicates that moreluminous agn tend to harbour faster fe k winds. the mass outflow rate m_out,kinetic power l_k and momentum flux p_out of the winds are also consequentlycorrelated with l_bol, such that more massive and more energetic winds arepresent in more luminous agn. we investigate these properties in the frameworkof a continuum-driven wind, showing that the observed relationships are broadlyconsistent with a wind being accelerated by continuum-scattering. we find that,globally, a significant fraction (~85%) of the sample can plausibly exceed thel_k/l_bol~0.5% threshold thought necessary for feedback, while 45% may alsoexceed the less conservative ~5% of l_bol threshold as well. this suggests thatthe winds may be energetically significant for agn--host-galaxy feedbackprocesses.

1506.09002	agn feedback in action: a new powerful wind in 1sxpsj050819.8+172149?	galaxy merging is widely accepted to be a key driving factor in galaxyformation and evolution, while the feedback from agn is thought to regulate thebh-bulge coevolution and the star formation process. in this context, wefocused on 1sxpsj050819.8+172149, a local (z=0.0175) seyfert 1.9 galaxy(l_bol~4x10^43 ergs/s). the source belongs to an ir-luminous interacting pairof galaxies, characterized by a luminosity for the whole system (due to thecombination of star formation and accretion) of log(l_ir/l_sun)=11.2. wepresent the first detailed description of the 0.3-10kev spectrum of1sxpsj050819.8+172149, monitored by swift with 9 pointings performed in lessthan 1 month. the x-ray emission of 1sxpsj050819.8+172149 is analysed bycombining all the swift pointings, for a total of ~72ks xrt net exposure. theaveraged swift-bat spectrum from the 70-month survey is also analysed. theslope of the continuum is ~1.8, with an intrinsic column density nh~2.4x10^22cm-2, and a deabsorbed luminosity l(2-10kev)~4x10^42 ergs/s. our observationsprovide a tentative (2.1sigma) detection of a blue-shifted fexxvi absorptionline (rest-frame e~7.8 kev), suggesting the discovery for a new candidatepowerful wind in this source. the physical properties of the outflow cannot befirmly assessed, due to the low statistics of the spectrum and to the observedenergy of the line, too close to the higher boundary of the swift-xrt bandpass.however, our analysis suggests that, if the detection is confirmed, the linecould be associated with a high-velocity (vout~0.1c) outflow most likelylaunched within 80r_s. to our knowledge this is the first detection of apreviously unknown ultrafast wind with swift. the high nh suggested by theobserved equivalent width of the line (ew~ -230ev, although with largeuncertainties), would imply a kinetic output strong enough to be comparable tothe agn bolometric luminosity.

1508.01198	the chandra/hetg view of ngc 1365 in a compton-thick state	we present the analysis of a chandra high-energy transmission grating (hetg)observation of the local seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. the source, well known forits dramatic x-ray spectral variability, was caught in a reflection-dominated,compton-thick state. the high spatial resolution afforded by chandra allowed usto isolate the soft x-ray emission from the active nucleus, neglecting most ofthe contribution from the kpc-scale starburst ring. the hetg spectra thusrevealed a wealth of he- and h-like lines from photoionized gas, whereas inlarger aperture observations these are almost exclusively produced throughcollisional ionization in the circumnuclear environment. once the residualthermal component is accounted for, the emission-line properties of thephotoionized region close to the hard x-ray continuum source indicate that ngc1365 has some similarities to the local population of obscured active galaxies.in spite of the limited overall data quality, several soft x-ray lines seem tohave fairly broad profiles (~800-1300 km/s full-width at half maximum), and arange of outflow velocities (up to ~1600 km/s, but possibly reaching a fewthousands km/s) appears to be involved. at higher energies, the k$\alpha$fluorescence line from neutral iron is resolved with &gt; 99 per cent confidence,and its width of ~3000 km/s points to an origin from the same broad-line regionclouds responsible for eclipsing the x-ray source and likely shielding thenarrow-line region.

1509.00738	the structure of the x-ray absorber in mrk 915 revealed by swift	in this paper we present the results obtained with a monitoring programme (23days long) performed with swift-xrt on the local seyfert galaxy mrk 915. thelight-curve analysis shows a significant count rate variation (about a factorof 2-3) on a time-scale of a few days, while the x-ray colours show a change inthe spectral curvature below 2 kev and the presence of two main spectralstates. from the spectral analysis we find that the observed variations can beexplained by the change of the intrinsic nuclear power (about a factor of 1.5)coupled with a change of the properties of an ionized absorber. the quality ofthe data prevents us from firmly establishing if the spectral variation is dueto a change in the ionization state and/or in the covering factor of theabsorbing medium. the latter scenario would imply a clumpy structure of theionized medium. by combining the information provided by the light curve andthe spectral analyses, we can derive some constraints on the location of theabsorber under the hypotheses of either homogeneous or clumpy medium. in bothcases, we find that the absorber should be located inside the outer edge of anextended torus and, in particular, under the clumpy hypothesis, it should belocated near, or just outside, to the broad emission line region.

1512.00192	multiwavelength survey of a sample of flat-spectrum radio-loud  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on a multiwavelength survey of a sample of 42 flat-spectrumradio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s). this is the largest knownsample of this type of active galactic nucleus (agn) to date. we found that 17%of sources were detected at high-energy gamma rays (e&gt;100 mev), and 90% atx-rays (0.3-10 kev). the masses of the central black holes are in the range$\sim 10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than the values of blazars. the diskluminosities are about 1-49% of the eddington value, with one outlier at 0.3%,comparable with the luminosities observed in flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). the jet powers are $\sim 10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable with bllac objects, yet relatively smaller than fsrqs. however, once renormalized bythe mass of the central black hole, the jet powers of rlnls1s, bl lacs, andfsrqs are consistent each other, indicating the scalability of the jets. wefound episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours.in some cases, dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as theinterplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk. we concludethat, despite the distinct observational properties, the central engines ofrlnls1s are similar to those of blazars.

astro-ph;0001030	a hard medium survey with asca. iii.: a type 2 agn revealed from x-ray  spectroscopy	in this paper we report the discovery of an hard x-ray selected type 2seyfert galaxy and we present and discuss its x-ray and optical spectrumtogether with the radio to x-ray energy distribution. the x-ray source -axj2254+1146 - is part of the asca hard serendipitous survey (hss). what makesthis discovery particularly noteworthy is the fact that the type 2classification of this seyfert galaxy has resulted directly from the x-ray dataand has been confirmed by optical spectroscopy only subsequently. the x-rayspectrum of axj2254+1146 is best described by a model consisting of anunresolved gaussian line at $6.43\pm 0.1$ kev plus the so called"leaky-absorber" continua having an intrinsic power law photon index of$\gamma$ = $2.51^{2.76}_{2.17}$ (1 $\sigma$ confidence interval). the best fitvalues of the absorbing column density ($n_h$ = $1.85^{2.24}_{1.47} \times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), of the line equivalent width ($0.6^{0.84}_{0.36}$ kev) andof the scattering fraction ($0.7^{1.4}_{0.1} %$), lead us to classify it as atype 2 agn from an x-ray point of view. inspection of the poss ii image revealsthe presence, within the asca x-ray error circle, of the nearby sbc spiralgalaxy ugc 12237 ($m_{b_o}=14.26$) that, even on positional groundconsiderations alone, is the most likely optical counterpart of axj2254+1146.subsequent optical spectroscopy of ugc 12237 has confirmed its seyfert 2optical nature.

astro-ph;0205529	origin of the x-ray background and agn unification: new perspectives	we critically review the basic assumptions of the standard model for thesynthesis of the xrb in the light of new data from ultradeep surveys by chandraand xmm, resolving major parts of it. important constraints come in particularfrom the observed z-distributions of faint hard x-ray sources -- showing largeexcesses at redshifts (z~0.8) much lower than expected by the synthesis models-- and from their x/optical/ir seds combined with the ir counts of type-iiagns. our analysis, although supporting the general scheme which interprets thexrb as due to absorbed agns with broad n_h distributions, requires majorrevision of the other postulate of the xrb synthesis models: the agnunification. we argue that the unification scheme based on a simple orientationeffect fails at high redshifts, where galaxy activity is induced by stronginteractions and mergers among gas-rich systems. this helps explaining theobservational evidence that type-i and ii agns follow different evolutionarypatterns, with type-i quasars providing a very biased trace of this activity.combined deep x-ray and ir surveys consistently find that the universe hasexperienced a violent phase of galaxy activity around z~1, probably relatedwith the assembly of massive galaxies, involving both sf and obscured agnfueling. roughly 10 to 20% of this activity has involved substantial agnemission, this fraction likely reflecting the agn/starburst duty cycle duringthe activation phase.

astro-ph;0304308	xmm-newton observations expose agn in apparently normal galaxies	we have performed a detailed analysis of 3 optically normal galaxiesextracted from the xmm bright serendipitous source sample. thanks to the goodstatistics of the xmm-newton data, we have unveiled the presence of an agn inall of them. in particular, we detect both x-ray obscured (n_h&gt;10^{22} cm^{-2})and unobscured (n_h&lt;10^{22} cm^{-2}) agn with intrinsic 2--10 kev luminositiesin the range between 10^{42} -- 10^{43} erg s^{-1}. we find that the x-ray andoptical properties of the sources discussed here could be explained assuming astandard agn hosted by galaxies with magnitudes m_r&lt;m^*, taking properly intoaccount the absorption associated with the agn, the optical faintness of thenuclear emission with respect to the host galaxy, and the inadequate set--upand atmospheric conditions during the optical spectroscopic observations. ournew spectroscopic observations have revealed the expected agn features also inthe optical band. these results clearly show that optical spectroscopysometimes can be inefficient in revealing the presence of an agn, which insteadis clearly found from an x-ray spectroscopic investigation. this remarks theimportance of being careful in proposing the identification of x-ray sources(especially at faint fluxes) when only low quality optical spectra are in hand.this is particularly important for faint surveys (such as those with xmm-newtonand chandra), in which optically dull but x-ray active objects are being foundin sizeable numbers.

astro-ph;0304529	an xmm-newton hard x-ray survey of ulirgs	xmm-newton observations of 10 ulirgs are reported. the aim is to investigatein hard x-rays a complete ulirg sample selected from the bright iras 60$\mu$mcatalogue. all sources are detected in x-rays, 5 of which for the first time.these observations confirm that ulirgs are intrinsically faint x-rays sources,their observed x-ray luminosities being typically l(2-10 kev)&lt;1e42-43 erg/s,whereas their bolometric luminosities are l&gt;1e45 erg/s. in all sources we findevidence for thermal emission from hot plasma with kt~0.7kev, dominating thex-ray spectra below 1kev, and likely associated with a nuclear or circumnuclearstarburst. this thermal emission appears uncorrelated with the fir luminosity,suggesting that,in addition to the ongoing rate of star formation, otherparameters may also affect it. the soft x-ray emission appears to be extendedon a scale of ~30kpc for mkn231 and iras19254-7245, possible evidence ofgalactic superwinds. in these 2 sources, in iras20551-4250 and iras23128-5919we find evidence for the presence of hidden agns, while a minor agncontribution may be suspected also in iras20100-4156. in particular, we havedetected a strong fe line at 6.4kev in the spectrum of iras19254-7245 and aweaker one in mkn231, suggestive of deeply buried agns. for the other sources,the x-ray luminosities and spectral shapes are consistent with hot thermalplasma and x-ray binary emissions of mainly starburst origin. we find that the2-10kev luminosities in these sources, most likely due to high-mass x-raybinaries, are correlated with l_fir: both luminosities are good indicators ofthe current global sfr in the galaxy. the composite nature of ulirgs is thenconfirmed, with hints for a predominance of the starburst over the agnphenomenon in these objects.

astro-ph;0402568	2-10 kev luminosity of high-mass binaries as a gauge of ongoing  star-formation rate	based on recent work on spectral decomposition of the emission ofstar-forming galaxies, we assess whether the integrated 2-10 kev emission fromhigh-mass x-ray binaries (hmxbs), l_{2-10}^{hmxb}, can be used as a reliableestimator of ongoing star formation rate (sfr). using a sample of 46 local (z &lt;0.1) star forming galaxies, and spectral modeling of asca, bepposax, andxmm-newton data, we demonstrate the existence of a linear sfr-l_{2-10}^{hmxb}relation which holds over ~5 decades in x-ray luminosity and sfr. the total2-10 kev luminosity is not a precise sfr indicator because at low sfr (i.e., innormal and moderately-starbursting galaxies) it is substantially affected bythe emission of low-mass x-ray binaries, which do not trace the current sfr dueto their long evolution lifetimes, while at very high sfr (i.e., for veryluminous fir-selected galaxies) it is frequently affected by the presence ofstrongly obscured agns. the availability of purely sb-powered galaxies - whose2-10 kev emission is mainly due to hmxbs - allows us to properly calibrate thesfr-l_{2-10}^{hmxb} relation. the sfr-l_{2-10}^{hmxb} relation holds also fordistant (z ~ 1) galaxies in the hubble deep field north sample, for which welack spectral information, but whose sfr can be estimated from deep radio data.if confirmed by more detailed observations, it may be possible to use thededuced relation to identify distant galaxies that are x-ray overluminous fortheir (independently estimated) sfr, and are therefore likely to hide stronglyabsorbed agns.

(2000).the new quasars span the luminosity range -26 ge m_b ge -29 while most of ourlow redshift sample (n=215) involve sources in the range -19 ge m_b ge -26. thehigh redshift sources show e1 parameter values and domain occupation that aresimilar to our low redshift sample supporting earlier findings that e1parameters are uncorrelated with source luminosity. elementary accretion theorycan account for a systematic increase of the minimum observed h-beta profilewidth with source luminosity. narrow line seyfert 1 sources with m_b = -28 showfwhm(h-beta) as much as 2000 km/s broader than those with m_b = -22. a possiblechange in the higher redshift/luminosity sources involves systematically weaker[oiii]4959,5007 narrow line emission.

astro-ph;0407481	exploring the x-ray sky with the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	abridged. we present "the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey", twoflux-limited samples with flux limit fx ~7e-14 cgs in the 0.5-4.5 kev (bss) and4.5-7.5 kev (hbss) energy band, respectively. after discussing the surveystrategy, we present the basic data on a complete sample of 400 x-ray sourcesderived from the analysis of 237 xmm-newton fields. the survey covers an areaof 28.10 (25.17 for the hbss) sq. deg. up to now ~71% (~90%) of the sourceshave been spectroscopically identified making the bss (hbss) the sample withthe highest number of identified xmm-newton sources published so far. we findthat: a) the optical counterpart in the majority (~90%) of cases has amagnitude brighter than the poss ii limit; b) the majority of the objectsidentified so far are broad line agn. no obvious trend of the source spectra(as deduced from the hardness ratios analysis) as a function of the count rateis seen and the average spectra of the "extragalactic" population correspondsto an x-ray energy spectral index of ~0.8 (~0.64) for the bss (hbss) sample.about 13% (40%) of the sources are described by an energy spectral indexflatter than that of the cxb. we measure a surface density of optically type 1and type 2 agn of 1.63+/-0.25 deg-2 and 0.83+/-0.18$ deg-2, respectively;optically type 2 agn represent 34+/-9% of the total agn population. finally, wefind a clear separation, in the hardness ratio diagram and in the (hardnessratio) vs. (x-ray to optical flux ratio) diagram, between "coronal emitting"stars and extragalactic sources.

astro-ph;0410432	xmm-newton spectroscopy of an x-ray selected sample of rl agns	this paper presents the x-ray spectroscopy of an x-ray selected sample of 25radio-loud (rl) agns extracted from the xbss sample. the main goal is to studythe origin of the x-ray spectral differences usually observed betweenradio-loud and radio-quiet (rq) agns. to this end, a comparison sample of 53 rqagns has been also extracted from the same xbss sample and studied togetherwith the sample of rl agns. we have focused the analysis on the distribution ofthe x-ray spectral indices of the power-law component that models the largemajority of the spectra in both samples. we find that the mean x-ray energyspectral index is very similar in the 2 samples and close to alpha_x~1.however, the intrinsic distribution of the spectral indices is significantlybroader in the sample of rl agns. in order to investigate the origin of thisdifference, we have divided the rl agns into blazars and ``non-blazars'', onthe basis of the available optical and radio information. we find strongevidence that the broad distribution observed in the rl agn sample is mainlydue to the presence of the blazars. furthermore, within the blazar class wehave found a link between the x-ray spectral index and the value of theradio-to-x-ray spectral index suggesting that the observed x-ray emission isdirectly connected to the emission of the relativistic jet. this trend is notobserved among the ``non-blazars'' rl agns. this favours the hypothesis that,in these latter sources, the x-ray emission is not significantly influenced bythe jet emission and it has probably an origin similar to the rq agns. overall,the results presented here indicate that the observed distribution of the x-rayspectral indices in a given sample of rl agns is strongly dependent on theamount of relativistic beaming present in the selected sources.

astro-ph;0410434	looking for obscured qsos in the x-ray emitting ero population	we present xmm-newton data centered on one of the munics near infraredcluster survey fields (s2f1) and we discuss the x-ray properties of the 6 x-rayemitting eros found. for one of them we have already obtained the redshiftusing near-infrared spectroscopic data, while for the remaining 5 eros theanalysis is based on photometric redshifts. we find evidence for the presenceof an x-ray obscured qso in at least 5 out of the 6 x-ray emitting eros. forthese 5 objects we derive intrinsic (2-10 kev) luminosities in excess of 10^44erg/s and intrinsic column densities higher than 10^22 cm^-2. these values havebeen obtained through a basic x-ray spectral analysis for the three brightestsources and through the analysis of the hardness ratios for the remaining two.all of these 5 x-ray emitting eros appear extended in the optical/near-infraredbands indicating that the host galaxy emission dominates at these wavelengths.this suggests that the hosted agns are likely to be absorbed also in theoptical/near-infrared bands: i.e. they are likely x-ray obscured possible type2 qsos. for the remaining ero the presence of an agn is suggested both by itshigh 0.5-2 kev luminosity (l(0.5-2 kev)~10^43 erg/s) and by itsx-ray-to-optical flux ratio. in this case the quality of the present dataprevents us from placing firm constraints on the agn type hosted. finally, thenear-ir spectrum obtained for one of the 6 eros classifies the host galaxy asan elliptical at z~1.7 with a stellar mass well in excess of 10^11 m_\odot.this result corroborates the possible link between the qso activity and theformation of massive spheroids.

astro-ph;0412020	the density of very massive evolved galaxies to z~1.7	we spectroscopically identified 7 massive evolved galaxies with magnitudes17.8&lt;k&lt;18.4 at 1.3&lt;z&lt;1.7 over an area of ~160 arcmin^2 of the munics survey.their rest-frame k-band absolute magnitudes are -26.8&lt;m$_k&lt;-26.1 (5l*&lt;l_k&lt;10l*)and the resulting stellar masses are in the range 3-6.5x10^{11} m_sun. theanalysis we performed unambiguously shows the early-type nature of theirspectra. the 7 massive evolved galaxies account for a comoving density of\~5.5(+-2) x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3} at &lt;z&gt;~1.5, a factor 1.5 lower than the density(8.4(+-1) x 10^{-5} mpc^{-3}) of early-types with comparable masses at z=0. theincompleteness (30%) of our spectroscopic observations accounts for thisdiscrepancy. thus, our data do not support a decrease of the comoving densityof early-type galaxies with masses comparable to the most massive ones in thelocal universe up to z~1.7. this suggests that massive evolved galaxies do notplay an important role in the evolution of the mass density outlined by recentsurveys in this redshift range, evolution which instead has to be ascribed tothe accretion of the stellar mass in late-type galaxies. finally, the presenceof such massive evolved galaxies at these redshifts suggests that the assemblyof massive spheroids has taken place at z&gt;2 supporting a high efficiency in theaccretion of the stellar mass in massive halos in the early universe.

astro-ph;0503665	the xmm-newton view of the relativistic spectral features in  axj0447-0627	the xmm-newton observation of the optically type 1 agn axj0447-0627 (z=0.214)unambiguously reveals a complex, bright and prominent set of lines in the 4-8kev rest frame energy range. although, from a phenomenological point of view,the observed properties can be described by a simple power law model plus 5narrow gaussian lines (at rest frame energies of nearly 4.49, 5.55, 6.39, 7.02and 7.85 kev), we find that a model comprising a power law (gamma of the orderof 2.2), a reflected relativistic continuum, a narrow fe i kalpha line fromneutral material as well as a broad fe kalpha relativistic line from a ionizedaccretion disk represents a good physical description of the data. the ''doublehorned'' profile of the relativistic line implies an inclination of theaccretion disk of the order of 45 degree, and an origin in a narrow region ofthe disk, from r_in of the order of 19 gm/c^2 to r_out of the order of 30gm/c^2. the narrow fe i kalpha line from neutral material is probably producedfar from the central black hole, most likely in the putative molecular torus.although some of these properties have been already found in other type 1 agnand discussed in the literature, at odd with the objects reported so far wemeasure high equivalent widths (ews) of the observed lines: nearly 1.4 kev forthe ``double horned'' relativistic line and nearly 0.4 kev for the narrow line.

astro-ph;0505467	dating the stellar population in massive early-type galaxies at  $z\sim$1.5	we present the analysis of 10 massive early-type galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. theyhave been identified by means of a near-ir low resolution spectroscopicfollow-up of a complete sample of 36 bright (k' $&lt;$ 18.5) extremely red objects(eros, r-k'$&gt;$ 5) selected from the munich near-ir clustersurvey (munics; droryet al. 2001). the low resolution near-ir spectra constrain their redshift at$1.2&lt;z&lt;1.7$, implying absolute magnitudes m$_{k'}&lt;-26.0$ and stellar masseswell in excess of 10$^{11}$ m$_\odot$. under the hypothesis of pure passiveevolution from $z\sim1.5$ to $z=0$, in the local universe they would haveluminosities l$_k\ge2.5$l$^*$. thus, they are the high-z counterparts of thelocal old massive (10$^{11}-10^{12}$ m$_\odot$) early-type galaxies populatingthe bright end of the local luminosity function of galaxies. the comparison oftheir spectro-photometric properties with a grid of synthetic models suggeststhat the stellar populations in more than half of the sample are about$\sim$3-5 gyr old and 1-2 gyr old in the remaining part. these ages implyformation redshift $z_{f} &gt; 2$ for all the galaxies and $z_{f} \geq 4$ for theoldest ones. the comparison of the 4000\aa break and of the overall spectralshape of the average spectrum of the 10 galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with those oftheir local counterpartsconfirms that field massive early-type galaxies formedthe bulk of their stellar mass at $2&lt;z&lt;4$, most likely over a short ($&lt;$ 1 gyr)star formation time scale, consistently with the results derived from theanalysis of their individual spectro-photometric properties.

astro-ph;0510282	unveiling the nature of ultraluminous infrared galaxies with 3-4 micron  spectroscopy	we present the results of l-band spectroscopical observations of local brightulirgs, performed with isaac at the vlt. we discuss the l-band spectralfeatures of seven single sources, and the statistical properties of a completesample of 15 sources obtained combining our observations with other published3-4 micron spectra. our main results are: 1. when a spectral indicatorsuggesting the presence of an agn (low equivalent width of the 3.3 micronemission line, steep lambda-f_lambda spectrum, presence of an absorptionfeature at 3.4 micron) is found, the agn is always confirmed by independentanalysis at other wavelengths. conversely, in all known agns at least one ofthe above indicators is present. 2. two new diagnostic diagrams are proposedcombining the above indicators, in which starbursts and agns are clearly andcompletely separated. 3. the above diagnostic techniques are possible withspectra of relatively low quality, which can be obtained for several tens ofulirgs with currently available telescopes. this makes l-band spectroscopy thecurrent best tool to disentangle agns and starbursts contributions in ulirgs.4. the l-band properties of ulirgs are heterogeneous. however, we show that allthe spectral differences among ulirgs can be reproduced starting from pureintrinsic agn and sb spectra and varying two parameters: the amount of dustextinction of the agn component, and the relative agn/sb contribution to thebolometric luminosity. 5. using the above decomposition model, we show thatagns in ulirgs have a low dust-to-gas ratio and a dust extinction curvedifferent from galactic. 6. the estimate of the contribution of agns in acomplete sample show that agns are hosted by ~2/3 of ulirgs, but theirenergetic contribution is relevant only in ~20% of the sample.

astro-ph;0602486	an x-ray bright ero hosting a type 2 qso	we present the xmm-newton and the optical-vlt spectra along with the opticaland the near-infrared photometric data of one of the brightest x-ray (f(2-10kev)~1e-13 erg/s cm^2) extremely red objects (r-k&gt;=5) discovered so far. thesource, xbsj0216-0435, belongs to the xmm-newton bright serendipitous surveyand it has extreme x-ray-to-optical (~220) and x-ray-to-near-infrared (~60)flux ratios. thanks to its brightness, the x-ray statistics are good enough foran accurate spectral analysis by which the presence of an x-ray obscured(nh&gt;1e22 cm^-2) qso (l(2-10 kev)=4e45 erg/s) is determined. a statisticallysignificant (~99%) excess around 2 kev in the observed-frame suggests thepresence of an emission line. by assuming that this feature corresponds to theiron kalpha line at 6.4 kev, a first estimate of the redshift of the source isderived (z_x~2). the presence of a high redshift qso2 has been finallyconfirmed through dedicated vlt optical spectroscopic observations(z_o=1.985+/-0.002). this result yields to an optical validation of a new x-rayline emitting object (xleo) for which the redshift has been firstly derivedfrom the x-ray data. xbsj0216-0435 can be considered one of the few examples ofx-ray obscured qso2 at high redshift for which a detailed x-ray and opticalspectral analysis has been possible. the spectral energy distribution fromradio to x-rays is also presented. finally from the near-infrared data theluminosity and the stellar mass of the host galaxy has been estimated finding anew example of the coexistence at high-z between massive galaxies and powerfulqsos.

astro-ph;0604353	fe k emission and absorption in the xmm-epic spectrum of the seyfert  galaxy ic 4329a	we present a detailed analysis of the xmm-newton long-look of the seyfertgalaxy ic 4329a. the fe k bandpass is dominated by two resolved peaks at 6.4kev and 7.0 kev, consistent with neutral or near-neutral fe k alpha and k betaemission. there is a prominent redward asymmetry in the 6.4 kev line, whichcould indicate emission from a compton shoulder. alternatively, models usingdual relativistic disklines are found to describe the emission profile well. alow-inclination, moderately-relativistic dual-diskline model is possible if thecontribution from narrow components, due to distant material, is small orabsent. a high-inclination, moderately relativistic profile for each peak ispossible if there are roughly equal contributions from both the broad andnarrow components. combining the xmm-newton data with rxte monitoring data, weexplore the time-resolved spectral behavior on time scales from hours to 2years. we find no strong evidence for variability of the fe k line flux on anytime scale, likely due to the minimal level of continuum variability. wedetect, at high significance, a narrow absorption line at 7.68 kev. thisfeature is most likely due to fe xxvi k alpha absorption blueshifted to about0.1c relative to the systemic velocity, suggesting a high-velocity,highly-ionized outflow component. as is often the case with similar outflowsseen in high-luminosity quasars, the power associated with the outflowrepresents a substantial portion of the total energy budget of the agn. theoutflow could arise from a radiatively-driven disk wind, or it may be in theform of a discrete, transient blob of ejected material.

astro-ph;0610354	the stellar content of the xmm-newton bright serendipitous survey	context: the comparison of observed counts in a given sky direction withpredictions by galactic models yields constraints to the spatial distributionand the stellar birthrate of young stellar populations. in this work we presentthe results of the analysis of the stellar content of the xmm-newton brightserendipitous survey (xbss). this unbiased survey includes a total of 58stellar sources selected in the 0.5 -- 4.5 kev energy band, having a limitingsensitivity of $10^{-2}$ cnt s$^{-1}$ and covering an area of 28.10 sq. deg.aims: our main goal is to understand the recent star formation history of thegalaxy in the vicinity of the sun. methods: we compare the observations withthe predictions obtained with xcount, a model of the stellar x-ray content ofthe galaxy. the model predicts the number and properties of the stars to beobserved in terms of magnitude, colour, population and$f_\mathrm{x}/f_\mathrm{v}$ ratio distributions of the coronal sources detectedwith a given instrument and sensitivity in a specific sky direction. results:as in other shallow surveys, we observe an excess of stars not predicted by ourgalaxy model. comparing the colours of the identified infrared counterpartswith the model predictions, we observe that this excess is produced by yellow(g+k) stars. the study of the x-ray spectrum of each source reveals a mainpopulation of stars with coronal temperature stratification typical ofintermediate-age stars. as no assumptions have been made for the selection ofthe sample, our results must be representative of the entire solarneighbourhood. some stars show excess circumstellar absorption indicative ofyouth.

0810.1249	a comprehensive x-ray spectral analysis of the seyfert 1.5 ngc 3227	we present results of a 100 ks xmm observation of the seyfert 1.5 ngc 3227.our best-fit broadband model to the pn spectrum consists of a moderately flat(photon index 1.57) hard x-ray power-law absorbed by cold gas with n_h = 3 *10^21 cm^-2, plus a strong soft excess, modeled as a steep power law with aphoton index of 3.35, absorbed by cold gas with n_h = 9 * 10^20 cm^-2. the softexcess normalization increases by ~20% in ~20 ks, independently of the hardx-ray component, and the uv continuum, tracked via the om, also shows a strongincreasing trend over the observation, consistent with reprocessing of softx-ray emission. warm absorber signatures are evident in both the epic and rgs;we model two layers, with log(xi) = 1.2 and 2.9 erg cm s^-1, and with similarcolumn densities (~1-2 * 10^21 cm^-2). the outflow velocities relative tosystemic of the high- and low-ionization absorbers are estimated to be-(2060(+240,-170)) km/s and -(420(+430,-190)) km/s, respectively. the fe kalpha line width fwhm is 7000 +/- 1500 km/s; its inferred radius is consistentwith the blr and with the inner radius of the dust reverberation-mapped bysuganuma et al. an emission feature near 6.0 kev is modeled equally well as anarrow redshifted fe k line, possibly associated with a disk "hot-spot," or asthe red wing to a relativistically broadened fe line profile. swift-bat andarchival rxte data suggest at most weak compton reflection (r &lt;~ 0.5), and ahigh-energy cutoff near 100 kev. from rxte monitoring, we find tentativeevidence for a significant fraction of the fe line flux to track continuumvariations on time scales &lt; 700 days.
