0706.2164	spitzer mid-to-far-infrared flux densities of distant galaxies	we study the infrared (ir) properties of high-redshift galaxies using deepspitzer 24, 70, and 160 micron data. our primary interest is to improve theconstraints on the total ir luminosities, l(ir), of these galaxies. we combinethe spitzer data in the southern extended chandra deep field with ak-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from themultiwavelength survey by yale-chile. we used a stacking analysis to measurethe average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 galaxies as afunction of 24 micron flux density, x-ray activity, and rest-frame near-ircolor. galaxies with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 and s(24)=53-250 micro-jy have l(ir) derivedfrom their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of thosederived from the 24 micron flux densities only. however, l(ir) derived from theaverage 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy and1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron fluxdensity by factors of 2-10. galaxies with s(24) &gt; 250 micro-jy have s(70)/s(24)flux ratios comparable to sources with x-ray detections or red rest-frame ircolors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by agn may contribute to thehigh 24 micron emission. based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities,nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5 have l(ir) &lt; 6 x 10^12solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to &lt; 1000solar masses per year. this suggests that high redshift galaxies may havesimilar star formation efficiencies and feedback processes as local analogs.objects with l(ir) &gt; 6 x 10^12 solar luminosities are quite rare, with asurface density ~ 30 +/- 10 per sq. deg, corresponding to ~ 2 +/- 1 x 10^-6mpc^-3 over 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5.

0902.4464	a submillimetre galaxy at z=4.76 in the laboca survey of the extended  chandra deep field south	we report on the identification of the highest redshift submm-selected sourcecurrently known: lessj033229.4-275619. this source was detected in the largeapex bolometer camera (laboca) extended chandra deep field south (ecdfs)submillimetre survey (less), a sensitive 870-um survey (~1.2-mjy rms) of thefull 30'x30' ecdfs with the laboca camera on the atacama pathfinder experiment(apex) telescope. the submm emission is identified with a radio counterpart forwhich optical spectroscopy provides a redshift of z=4.76. we show that thebolometric emission is dominated by a starburst with a star formation rate of~1000 msun/yr, although we also identify a moderate luminosity active galacticnucleus (agn) in this galaxy. thus it has characteristics similar to those ofz~2 submm galaxies (smgs), with a mix of starburst and obscured agn signatures.this demonstrates that ultraluminous starburst activity is not just restrictedto the hosts of the most luminous (and hence rare) qsos at z~5, but was alsooccurring in less extreme galaxies at a time when the universe was less than10% of its current age. assuming that we are seeing the major phase of starformation in this galaxy, then we demonstrate that it would be identified as aluminous distant red galaxy at z~3 and that the current estimate of the spacedensity of z&gt;4 smgs is only sufficient to produce ~10% of the luminous redgalaxy population at these early times. however, this leaves open thepossibility that some of these galaxies formed through less intense, but moreextended star formation events. if the progenitors of all of the luminous redgalaxies at z~3 go through an ultraluminous starburst at z&gt;4 then the requiredvolume density of z&gt;4 smgs will exceed that predicted by current galaxyformation models by more than an order of magnitude.

0903.3700	history of galaxy interactions and their impact on star formation over  the last 7 gyr from gems	we perform a comprehensive estimate of the frequency of galaxy mergers andtheir impact on star formation over z~0.24--0.80 (lookback time t_b~3--7 gyr)using 3698 (m*&gt;=1e9 msun) galaxies with gems hst, combo-17, and spitzer data.our results are: (1) among 790 high mass (m*&gt;=2.5e10 msun) galaxies, thevisually-based merger fraction over z~0.24--0.80, ranges from 9%+-5% to 8%+-2%.lower limits on the major and minor merger fractions over this interval rangefrom 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. this is the firstapproximate empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers at z&lt;1. for avisibility timescale of ~0.5 gyr, it follows that over t_b~3--7 gyr, ~68% ofhigh mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio &gt;1/10, with ~16%, 45%,and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous`major or minor' mergers. the mean merger rate is a few x 1e-4 gyr-1 mpc-3. (2)we compare the empirical merger fraction and rate for high mass galaxies to asuite of lambda cdm-based models: halo occupation distribution models,semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic sph simulations. we find qualitativeagreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) mergerfraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show afactor of five dispersion. near-future improvements can now start to rule outcertain merger scenarios. (3) among ~3698 m*&gt;=1e9 msun galaxies, we find thatthe mean sfr of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared tonon-interacting galaxies over z~0.24--0.80. visibly merging systems onlyaccount for less than 30% of the cosmic sfr density over t_b~3--7 gyr. thissuggests that the behavior of the cosmic sfr density over the last 7 gyr ispredominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies.

0905.0162	mid-ir luminosities and uv/optical star formation rates at z&lt;1.4	uv continuum and mid-ir emission constitute two widely used star formationindicators at intermediate and high redshifts. we study 2430 galaxies withz&lt;1.4 in the extended groth strip with mips 24 mic observations from fidel,spectroscopy from deep2, and uv, optical, and near-ir photometry from aegis.the data are coupled with stellar population models and bayesian sed fitting toestimate dust-corrected sfrs. in order to probe the dust heating from stellarpopulations of various ages, the derived sfrs were averaged over varioustimescales--from 100 myr for "current" sfr to 1--3 gyr for long-timescale sfrs.these sed-based uv/optical sfrs are compared to total infrared luminositiesextrapolated from 24 mic observations. we find that for the blue, actively starforming galaxies the correlation between the ir luminosity and the uv/opticalsfr shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer sfr-averagingtimescales. we interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellarpopulations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. this holds overthe entire redshift range. many so-called green valley galaxies are simplydust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. however, there exist 24mic-detected galaxies, some with l&gt;10^11 l_sun, yet with little current starformation. for them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light issufficient to produce the observed levels of ir. in our sample optical andx-ray agns do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-irluminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "ir excess"galaxies (abridged).

0905.1122	turning back the clock: inferring the history of the eight o'clock arc	we present the results from an optical and near-infrared spectroscopic studyof the ultraviolet-luminous z = 2.73 galaxy, the 8 o'clock arc. due togravitational lensing, this galaxy is magnified by a factor of &gt; 10, allowingin-depth measurements which are usually unfeasible at such redshifts. in theoptical spectra, we measured the systemic redshift of the galaxy, z = 2.7322+/- 0.0012, using stellar photospheric lines. this differs from the redshift ofabsorption lines in the interstellar medium, z = 2.7302 +/- 0.0006, implyinggas outflows on the order of 160 km/s. with h and k-band near-infrared spectra,we have measured nebular emission lines of halpha, hbeta, hgamma, [n ii] and [oiii], which have a redshift z = 2.7333 +/- 0.0001, consistent with the derivedsystemic redshift. from the balmer decrement, we measured the dust extinctionto be a_5500 = 1.17 +/- 0.36 mag. correcting halpha for dust extinction and theassumed lensing factor, we measure a star-formation rate of ~ 270 msol/yr,which is higher than ~ 85% of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. usingcombinations of all detected emission lines, we find that the 8 o'clock arc hasa gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.8 zsol, showing that enrichment at high-redshiftis not rare, even in blue, star-forming galaxies. studying spectra from two ofthe arc components separately, we find that one component dominates the dustextinction and star-formation rate, although the metallicities between the twocomponents are similar. we derive the mass via stellar population modeling, andfind that the arc has a total stellar mass of ~ 4 x 10^11 msol, which falls onthe mass-metallicity relation at z ~ 2. finally, we estimate the total gasmass, and find it to be only ~ 12% of the stellar mass, implying that the 8o'clock arc is likely nearing the end of a starburst.

0906.4554	a plethora of agn among lyman alpha galaxies at low redshift	we investigate the fraction of z ~ 0.3 lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes)which host active galactic nucleus activity, which is typically from 1 - 5% at2 &lt; z &lt; 6. using optical spectroscopy of 23 laes at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.45 selectedwith galex uv data, we probe for agn with a variety of methods, including linewidths, diagnostic line ratios, high-ionization emission, infrared activity andx-ray luminosity. we found that our sample of low-redshift laes has an agnfraction of 43 ^{+18}{-26}%, significantly higher than at high redshift. whileprevious results have shown that low-redshift laes have a lower space densitythan their high-redshift analogs, these results show that star-forming laes atlow-redshift are rarer still. accounting for differences in available agnclassification methods, we conclude that rest-frame optical spectroscopy isnecessary to identify low-luminosity agns in laes at high redshift, and thatlimits on the x-ray flux are necessary to determine the extent to which the agncontaminates the lyman alpha fluxes.

0907.3728	less than 10 percent of star formation in z=0.6 massive galaxies is  triggered by major interactions	both observations and simulations show that major tidal interactions ormergers between gas-rich galaxies can lead to intense bursts of starformation.yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (sfr) in major mergers andthe contribution of such events to the cosmic sfr are not well estimated. herewe use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and uv sfrs from combo-17, 24micron sfrs from spitzer and morphologies from two deep hst cosmological surveyfields (ecdfs/gems and a901/stages) to study the enhancement in sfr as afunction of projected galaxy separation. we apply two-point projectedcorrelation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selectedvery close pairs (separation &lt;2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the hstimaging. our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems areindeed interacting or merging. yet, for massive (m* &gt; 10^10 msun) star-forminggalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8, we find that the sfrs of galaxies undergoing a majorinteraction (mass ratios &lt;1:4 and separations &lt; 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30times higher than the sfrs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over allinteractions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with otherobservational works.  we demonstrate that these results imply that &lt;10% of star formation at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these eventsare not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.

0910.2986	paschen-alpha emission in the gravitationally lensed galaxy smm  j163554.2+661225	we report the detection of the paschen-alpha emission line in the z=2.515galaxy smm j163554.2+661225 using spitzer spectroscopy. smm j163554.2+661225 isa sub-millimeter-selected infrared (ir)-luminous galaxy maintaining a highstar-formation rate (sfr), with no evidence of an agn from optical or infraredspectroscopy, nor x-ray emission. this galaxy is lensed gravitationally by thecluster abell 2218, making it accessible to spitzer spectroscopy. correctingfor nebular extinction derived from the h-alpha and pa-alpha lines, thedust-corrected luminosity is l(pa-alpha) = (2.57+/-0.43) x 10^43 erg s^-1,which corresponds to an ionization rate, q = (1.6+/-0.3) x 10^55 photons s^-1.the instantaneous sfr is 171+/-28 solar masses per year, assuming asalpeter-like initial mass function. the total ir luminosity derived using 70,450, and 850 micron data is l(ir) = (5-10) x 10^11 solar luminosities,corrected for gravitational lensing. this corresponds to a sfr=90-180 solarmasses per year, where the upper range is consistent with that derived from thepaschen-alpha luminosity. while the l(8 micron) / l(pa-alpha) ratio isconsistent with the extrapolated relation observed in local galaxies andstar-forming regions, the rest-frame 24 micron luminosity is significantlylower with respect to local galaxies of comparable paschen-alpha luminosity.thus, smm j163554.2+661225 arguably lacks a warmer dust component (t ~ 70 k),which is associated with deeply embedded star formation, and which contrastswith local galaxies with comparable sfrs. rather, the starburst is consistentwith star-forming local galaxies with intrinsic luminosities, l(ir) ~ 10^10solar luminosities, but "scaled-up" by a factor of 10-100.

1005.3817	spectroscopic confirmation of a z=2.79 multiply imaged luminous infrared  galaxy behind the bullet cluster	we report spectroscopic confirmation and high-resolution infrared imaging ofa z=2.79 triply-imaged galaxy behind the bullet cluster. this source, aspitzer-selected luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), is confirmed via polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah) features using the spitzer infrared spectrograph(irs) and resolved with hst wfc3 imaging. in this galaxy, which with a stellarmass of m*=4e9 msun is one of the two least massive ones studied with irs atz&gt;2, we also detect h_2 s(4) and h_2 s(5) pure rotational lines (at 3.1 sigmaand 2.1 sigma) - the first detection of these molecular hydrogen lines in ahigh-redshift galaxy. from the molecular hydrogen lines we infer an excitationtemperature t=377+68-84 k. the detection of these lines indicates that the warmmolecular gas mass is 6(+36-4)% of the stellar mass and implies the likelyexistence of a substantial reservoir of cold molecular gas in the galaxy.future spectral observations at longer wavelengths with facilities like theherschel space observatory, the large millimeter telescope, and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) thus hold the promise of precisely determining thetotal molecular gas mass. given the redshift, and using refined astrometricpositions from the high resolution imaging, we also update the magnificationestimate and derived fundamental physical properties of this system. thepreviously published values for total infrared luminosity, star formation rate,and dust temperature are confirmed modulo the revised magnification; however wefind that pah emission is roughly a factor of five stronger than would bepredicted by the relations between the total infrared and pah luminosityreported for smgs and starbursts in pope et al.

1006.4359	the evolution of the star formation rate of galaxies at 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2	we present the 24 micron rest-frame luminosity function (lf) of star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 constructed from 4047spectroscopic redshifts from the agn and galaxy evolution survey of 24 micronselected sources in the bootes field of the noao deep wide-field survey. thissample provides the best available combination of large area (9 deg^2), depth,and statistically complete spectroscopic observations, allowing us to probe theevolution of the 24 micron lf of galaxies at low and intermediate redshiftswhile minimizing the effects of cosmic variance. in order to use the observed24 micron luminosity as a tracer for star formation, active galactic nuclei(agns) that could contribute significantly at 24 micron are identified andexcluded from our star-forming galaxy sample based on their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions or the detection of x-ray emission. the evolution of the24 micron lf of star-forming galaxies for redshifts of z &lt; 0.65 is consistentwith a pure luminosity evolution where the characteristic 24 micron luminosityevolves as (1+z)^(3.8+/-0.3). we extend our evolutionary study to encompass 0.0&lt; z &lt; 1.2 by combining our data with that of the far-infrared deepextragalactic legacy survey. over this entire redshift range the evolution ofthe characteristic 24 micron luminosity is described by a slightly shallowerpower law of (1+z)^(3.4+/-0.2). we find a local star formation rate density of(1.09+/-0.21) x 10^-2 msun/yr/mpc^-3, and that it evolves as (1+z)^(3.5+/-0.2)over 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2. these estimates are in good agreement with the rates usingoptical and uv fluxes corrected for the effects of intrinsic extinction in theobserved sources. this agreement confirms that star formation at z &lt;~ 1.2 isrobustly traced by 24 micron observations and that it largely occurs inobscured regions of galaxies.

0709.0946	the warm spitzer mission: prospects for studies of the distant universe	irac excels at detecting distant objects. due to a combination of the shapesof the spectral energy distributions of galaxies and the low backgroundachieved from space, irac reaches greater depth in comparable exposure time at3.6 and 4.5 micron than any ground- or space-based facility currently can at2.2 micron. furthermore, the longer wavelengths probed by irac enable studiesof the rest-frame optical and near-infrared light of galaxies and agn to muchhigher redshift than is possible from the ground. this white paper explores themerits of different survey strategies for studying the distant universe duringthe warm mission. a three-tiered approach serves a wide range of science goalsand uses the spacecraft effectively: 1) an ultra-deep survey of ~0.04 squaredegrees to a depth of ~250 hrs (in conjunction with an hst/wfc3 program), tostudy the universe at 7&lt;z&lt;14; 2) a survey of ~2 square degrees to the goodsdepth of 20 hrs, to identify luminous galaxies at z&gt;6 and characterize therelation between the build-up of dark matter halos and their constituentgalaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;6, and 3) a 500 square degree survey to the swire depth of 120s, to systematically study large scale structure at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and characterize highredshift agn. one or more of these programs could conceivably be implemented bythe ssc, following the example of the hubble deep field campaigns. aspriorities in this field continuously shift it is also crucial that a fractionof the exposure time remains unassigned, thus enabling science that willreflect the frontiers of 2010 and beyond rather than those of 2007.

1012.4010	dust extinction and metallicities of star-forming lyman alpha emitting  galaxies at low redshift	we present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of 12galex-discovered star-forming lyman alpha emitting galaxies (laes) at z ~ 0.3.we measure the emission line fluxes from these galaxies by fitting theirobserved spectra to stellar population models in order to correct forunderlying stellar absorption. we revisit earlier stellar population modelfitting results, finding that excluding now-known agns lowers the typicalstellar population age and stellar mass of this sample to ~ 300 myr and ~ 4 x10^9 msol, respectively. we calculate their dust extinction using the balmerdecrement, and find a typical visual attenuation of av ~ 0.3 mag, similar tothat seen in many high-redshift laes. comparing the ratio of lyalpha/halpha andthe lyman alpha equivalent widths to the measured dust extinction, we find thatthe isms in these objects appear to be neither enhancing nor seriouslyattenuating the lyman alpha equivalent widths, as would be the case in aquasi-clumpy ism. lastly, we perform a detailed analysis of the gas-phasemetallicities of these galaxies, and we find that most galaxies in our samplehave z &lt; 0.4 zsol. we find that at a fixed stellar mass, these low-redshift laeanalogs are offset by ~ 0.6 dex lower in metallicity from the general galaxypopulation at similar redshifts based on the local mass-metallicityrelationship. this implies that galaxies with lyman alpha in emission may besystematically more metal poor than star-forming galaxies at the same stellarmass and redshift, similar to preliminary results at z ~ 2.

1103.3711	extended schmidt law: role of existing stars in current star formation	we propose an "extended schmidt law" with explicit dependence of the starformation efficiency (sfe=sfr/mgas) on the stellar mass surface density. thisrelation has a power-law index of 0.48+-0.04 and an 1-sigma observed scatter onthe sfe of 0.4 dex, which holds over 5 orders of magnitude in the stellardensity for individual global galaxies including various types especially thelow-surface-brightness (lsb) galaxies that deviate significantly from thekennicutt-schmidt law. when applying it to regions at sub-kpc resolution of asample of 12 spiral galaxies, the extended schmidt law not only holds for lsbregions but also shows significantly smaller scatters both within and acrossgalaxies compared to the kennicutt-schmidt law. we argue that this new relationpoints to the role of existing stars in regulating the sfe, thus encodingbetter the star formation physics. comparison with physical models of starformation recipes shows that the extended schmidt law can be reproduced by somemodels including gas free-fall in a stellar-gravitational potential andpressure-supported star formation. by implementing this new law into theanalytic model of gas accretion in lambda cdm, we show that it can re-producethe observed main sequence of star-forming galaxies (a relation between the sfrand stellar mass) from z=0 up to z=2.

1110.3323	probing the star formation history and initial mass function of the  z~2.5 lensed galaxy smm j163554.2+661225 with herschel	we present the analysis of herschel spire far-infrared (fir) observations ofthe z = 2.515 lensed galaxy smm j163554.2+661225. combining new 250, 350, and500 micron observations with existing data, we make an improved fit to the firspectral energy distribution (sed) of this galaxy. we find a total infrared(ir) luminosity of l(8--1000 micron) = 6.9 +/- 0.6x10^11 lsol; a factor of 3more precise over previous l_ir estimates for this galaxy, and one of the mostaccurate measurements for any galaxy at these redshifts. this fir luminosityimplies an unlensed star formation rate (sfr) for this galaxy of 119 +/- 10msol per yr, which is a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.35 lower than the sfr derived fromthe nebular pa-alpha emission line (a 2.5-sigma discrepancy). both sfrindicators assume identical salpeter initial mass functions (imf) with slopegamma=2.35 over a mass range of 0.1 - 100 msol, thus this discrepancy suggeststhat more ionizing photons may be necessary to account for the higherpa-alpha-derived sfr. we examine a number of scenarios and find that theobservations can be explained with a varying star formation history (sfh) dueto an increasing star formation rate (sfr), paired with a slight flattening ofthe imf. if the sfr is constant in time, then larger changes need to be made tothe imf by either increasing the upper-mass cutoff to ~ 200 msol, or aflattening of the imf slope to 1.9 +/- 0.15, or a combination of the two. thesescenarios result in up to double the number of stars with masses above 20 msol,which produce the requisite increase in ionizing photons over a salpeter imfwith a constant sfh.

1110.3786	what turns galaxies off? the different morphologies of star-forming and  quiescent galaxies since z~2 from candels	we use hst/wfc3 imaging from the candels multicycle treasury survey, inconjunction with the sloan digital sky survey, to explore the evolution ofgalactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses &gt;3e10m_sun from z=2.2 tothe present epoch, a time span of 10gyr. we explore the relationship betweenrest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxystructure. we confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day inthe number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10m_sun reported byothers. we further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems haveconcentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the sersic index, and thepopulation of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. we examine thejoint distribution of star formation activity, sersic index, stellar mass,inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. quiescencecorrelates poorly with stellar mass at all z&lt;2.2. quiescence correlates wellwith sersic index at all redshifts. quiescence correlates well with `velocitydispersion' and stellar surface density at z&gt;1.3, and somewhat less well atlower redshifts. yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence andgalaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominentbulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominatedgalaxies have significant star formation. noting the rarity of quiescentgalaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (andperhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important conditionfor quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10gyr, inqualitative agreement with the agn feedback paradigm.

1110.3794	candels observations of the structural properties and evolution of  galaxies in a cluster at z=1.62	we discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in az=1.62 proto-cluster using near-ir imaging data from hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 data of the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphologyrelation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally havemorphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistentwith ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. the sizedistribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (&lt;1kpc), massive galaxies compared to candels field galaxies at z=1.6. as aresult the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizescompared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent clustergalaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). if this result is generalizable, then it implies thatphysical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to havecaused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slowersubsequent growth at z&lt;1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. thequiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lowerredshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggestthat they contain extended stellar disks. we argue the cluster galaxies requiredissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the diskmaterial and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, andcolor of early-type galaxies in z&lt;1 clusters.

1111.1233	how do star-forming galaxies at z&gt;3 assemble their masses?	we investigate how star-forming galaxies typically assemble their masses athigh redshift. using the deep multi-wavelength coverage of the goods dataset,we measure stellar mass of a large sample of star-forming galaxies at z~4 and5, and make a robust determination of stellar mass function (smf). we report abroad correlation between stellar mass and uv luminosity, such that moreuv-luminous galaxies are, on average, more massive. however, the correlationhas a substantial intrinsic scatter evidenced by a non-negligible number ofuv-faint but massive galaxies. furthermore, the low-mass end of the smf doesnot rise as steeply as the uv luminosity function (alpha_uvlf} -(1.7-1.8),alpha_smf -(1.3-1.4)) of the same galaxies. in a smooth formation scenariowhere star formation (sf) is sustained at the observed rates for a long time,these galaxies would have accumulated more mass (by a factor of ~3) thanobserved and therefore the smf would mirror more closely that of the uvlf. therelatively shallow slope of the smf is due to the fact that many of theuv-selected galaxies are not massive enough, and therefore are too faint intheir rest-frame optical bands, to be detected in the current observations. ourresults favor a episodic formation history in which sf in low-mass galaxiesvary significantly over time, a scenario favored by galaxy clustering. ourfindings for the uv-faint galaxies are in contrast with those found for moreuv-luminous galaxies, which exhibit tighter sfr-m_star correlations. thediscrepancy may suggest that galaxies at different luminosities may havedifferent evolutionary paths.

1112.2691	first results from z-fourge: discovery of a candidate cluster at z = 2.2  in cosmos	we report the first results from the z-fourge survey: the discovery of acandidate galaxy cluster at z = 2.2 consisting of two compact overdensitieswith red galaxies detected at &gt;20{\sigma} above the mean surface density. thediscovery was made possible by a new deep (ks &lt; 24.8 ab 5{\sigma})magellan/fourstar near-ir imaging survey with 5 custom medium-bandwidthfilters. the filters pinpoint the location of the balmer/4000\aa\ break inevolved stellar populations at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, yielding significantly moreaccurate photometric redshifts than possible with broadband imaging alone. theoverdensities are within 1' of each other in the cosmos field and appear to beembedded in a larger structure that contains at least one additionaloverdensity (\sim10{\sigma}). considering the global properties of theoverdensities, the z = 2.2 system appears to be the most distant example of agalaxy cluster with a population of red galaxies. a comparison to a large{\lambda}cdm simulation suggests that the system may consist of mergingsubclusters, with properties in between those of z &gt; 2 protoclusters with morediffuse distributions of blue galaxies and the lower-redshift galaxy clusterswith prominent red sequences. the structure is completely absent in publicoptical catalogs in cosmos and only weakly visible in a shallower near-irsurvey. the discovery showcases the potential of deep near-ir surveys withmedium-band filters to advance the understanding of environment and galaxyevolution at z &gt; 1.5.

1203.3541	a tale of dwarfs and giants: using a z=1.62 cluster to understand how  the red sequence grew over the last 9.5 billion years	we study the red sequence in a cluster of galaxies at z=1.62 and follow itsevolution over the intervening 9.5 gyr to the present day. using deep yjksimaging with the hawk-i instrument on the vlt we identify a tight red sequenceand construct its rest-frame i-band luminosity function (lf). there is a markeddeficit of faint red galaxies in the cluster that causes a turnover in the lf.we compare the red sequence lf to that for clusters at z&lt;0.8 correcting theluminosities for passive evolution. the shape of the cluster red sequence lfdoes not evolve between z=1.62 and z=0.6 but at z&lt;0.6 the faint populationbuilds up significantly. meanwhile, between z=1.62 to 0.6 the inferred totallight on the red sequence grows by a factor of about 2 and the bright end ofthe lf becomes more populated. we construct a simple model for red sequenceevolution that grows the red sequence in total luminosity and matches theconstant lf shape at z&gt;0.6. in this model the cluster accretes blue galaxiesfrom the field that are then quenched and subsequently allowed to merge. wefind that 3--4 mergers among cluster galaxies during the 4 gyr between z=1.62and z=0.6 matches the observed luminosity function evolution between the tworedshifts. the inferred merger rate is consistent with other studies of thiscluster. our result supports the picture that galaxy merging during the majorgrowth phase of massive clusters is an important process in shaping the redsequence population at all luminosities.

(2011) on a z=1.5 cluster and its surrounding region. the fact that thestar-forming activity of galaxies in the cluster core is as high as that in thefield at z~1.6 may suggest that the star-forming galaxies are probably just ina transition phase from a starburst mode to a quiescent mode, and are thusshowing comparable level of star formation rates to those in lower densityenvironments. we may be witnessing the start of the reversal of the localsfr--density relation due to the "biased" galaxy formation and evolution inhigh density regions at high this redshift, beyond which massive galaxies wouldbe forming vigorously in a more biased way in proto-cluster cores.

0705.0660	hudf-jd2: mid-infrared evidence for a z~2 luminous infrared galaxy	the hubble ultra deep field source jd2 presented in mobasher et al. (2005) isan unusual galaxy that is very faint at all wavelengths shortward of 1.1micron. photometric redshift fits to data at 0.4 to 8 microns yield asignificant probability that it is an extremely massive galaxy at z~6.5. inthis paper we present new photometry at 16 microns and 22 micron from spitzerinfrared spectrograph (irs) peak-up imaging of the great observatories originsdeep survey (goods) fields. we find that the spectral energy distribution showsa factor of ~4 rise in flux density between the 16 micron and 22 micronbandpass which is most likely due to the entrance of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission features into the 22 micron and 24 micron passbands. theflux ratio between these bandpasses can be best fit by a z~1.7 luminousinfrared galaxy with a bolometric luminosity of (2-6)\times10^{11} l_suncorresponding to a star-formation rate of 80 m_sun/yr. the predicted fluxdensity values at other longer wavelengths are below the detection limits ofcurrent instrumentation but such sources could potentially be detected inlensed submillimeter surveys. re-evaluation of the optical/near-infraredphotometry continues to favor z&gt;6 photometric redshift solutions, but we arguethat the consistency of the multiwavelength parameters of this galaxy withother dusty starbursts favor the z~2 mid-infrared photometric redshift. thedata presented here provide evidence that optically undetected near-infraredsources which are detected at 24 microns are most likely dusty, starburstgalaxies at a redshift of z~2 with stellar masses &gt;10^{10} m_sun.

1309.5972	galaxy stellar mass functions from zfourge/candels: an excess of  low-mass galaxies since z=2 and the rapid buildup of quiescent galaxies	using observations from the fourstar galaxy evolution survey (zfourge), weobtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function at0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. zfourge provides well-constrained photometric redshifts madepossible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2um . we combine this withhst imaging from the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalactic legacy survey(candels), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxiesdown to stellar masses ~10^9.5 msol at z ~ 2.5. the total surveyed area is 316arcmin^2 distributed over three independent fields. we supplement these datawith the wider and shallower newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to providestronger constraints at high masses. several studies at z&lt;=1 have revealed asteepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf),leading to an upturn at masses &lt;10^10 msol that is not well-described by astandard single-schechter function. we find evidence that this feature extendsto at least z ~ 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming andquiescent populations individually. the characteristic mass (m*) and slope atthe lowest masses (alpha) of a double-schechter function fit to the smf stayroughly constant at log(m/msol) ~ 10.65 and ~-1.5 respectively. the smf ofstar-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the changein shape is relatively minor. this is not the case for quiescent galaxies: thedepth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly moreevolution at log(m/msol) &lt; 10.5 than at higher masses. we find that the totalmass density (down to 10^9 msol) in star-forming galaxies has increased by afactor of ~2.2 since z ~ 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased bya factor of ~12 .

1312.4952	a substantial population of massive quiescent galaxies at z~4 from  zfourge	we report the likely identification of a substantial population of massivem~10^11m_sun galaxies at z~4 with suppressed star formation rates (sfrs),selected on rest-frame optical to near-ir colors from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey. the observed spectral energy distributions show pronouncedbreaks, sampled by a set of near-ir medium-bandwidth filters, resulting intightly constrained photometric redshifts. fitting stellar population modelssuggests large balmer/4000aa breaks, relatively old stellar populations, largestellar masses and low sfrs, with a median specific sfr of 2.9+/-1.8 x10^-11/yr. ultradeep herschel/pacs 100micron, 160micron and spitzer/mips24micron data reveal no dust-obscured sfr activity for 15/19 (79%) galaxies.two far-ir detected galaxies are obscured qsos. stacking the far-ir undetectedgalaxies yields no detection, consistent with the sed fit, indicatingindependently that the average specific sfr is at least 10x smaller than oftypical star-forming galaxies at z~4. assuming all far-ir undetected galaxiesare indeed quiescent, the volume density is 1.8+/-0.7 x 10^-5mpc^-3 to a limitof log10m/m_sun&gt;10.6, which is 10x and 80x lower than at z = 2 and z = 0.1.they comprise a remarkably high fraction (~35%) of z~4 massive galaxies,suggesting that suppression of star formation was efficient even at very highredshift. given the average stellar age of 0.8gyr and stellar mass of0.8x10^11m_sun, the galaxies likely started forming stars before z =5, withsfrs well in excess of 100m_sun/yr, far exceeding that of similarly abundantuv-bright galaxies at z&gt;4. this suggests that most of the star-formation in theprogenitors of quiescent z~4 galaxies was obscured by dust.

1403.7524	star-forming blue etgs in two newly discovered galaxy overdensities in  the hudf at z=1.84 and 1.9: unveiling the progenitors of passive etgs in  cluster cores	we present the discovery of two galaxy overdensities in the hubble spacetelescope udf: a proto-cluster, hudfj0332.4-2746.6 at $z = 1.84 \pm 0.01$, anda group, hudfj0332.5-2747.3 at $z =1.90 \pm 0.01$. assuming viralization, thevelocity dispersion of hudfj0332.4-2746.6 implies a mass of $m_{200}= (2.2 \pm1.8) \times 10^{14} m_{\odot}$, consistent with the lack of extended x-rayemission. neither overdensity shows evidence of a red sequence. about $50\%$ oftheir members show interactions and/or disturbed morphologies, which aresignatures of merger remnants or disk instability. most of their etgs have bluecolors and show recent star-formation. these observations reveal for the firsttime large fractions of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming blue etgs inproto-clusters at $z\approx 2$. these star-forming etgs are most likely amongthe progenitors of the quiescent population in clusters at more recent epochs.their mass-size relation is consistent with that of passive etgs in clusters at$z\sim0.7-1.5$. if these galaxies are the progenitors of cluster etgs at theselower redshifts, their size would evolve according to a similar mass-sizerelation. it is noteworthy that quiescent etgs in clusters at $z=1.8-2$ also donot show any significant size evolution over this redshift range, contrary tofield etgs. the etg fraction is $\lesssim 50\%$, compared to the typicalquiescent etg fraction of $\approx 80\%$ in cluster cores at $z&lt; 1$. thefraction, masses, and colors of the newly discovered etgs imply that othercluster etgs will be formed/accreted at a later time.

1405.1048	exploring the z=3-4 massive galaxy population with zfourge: the  prevalence of dusty and quiescent galaxies	our understanding of the redshift $z&gt;3$ galaxy population relies largely onsamples selected using the popular "dropout" technique, typically consisting ofuv-bright galaxies with blue colors and prominent lyman breaks. as it iscurrently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxypopulation, we here use the fourstar galaxy evolution (zfourge) survey tocreate a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. uniquely, zfourge uses deepnear-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshiftsand stellar population properties. the mass-complete sample consists of 57galaxies with log m $&gt;10.6$, reaching below $m^{\star}$ at $z=3-4$.  on average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observedoptical with median $r_{tot}^{ab}=27.48\pm0.41$ (restframe$m_{1700}=-18.05\pm0.37$). they lie far below the uv luminosity-stellar massrelation for lyman break galaxies and are about $\sim100\times$ fainter at thesame mass. the massive galaxies are red ($r-ks_{ab}=3.9\pm0.2$; restframeuv-slope $\beta=-0.2\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. we classifythe galaxy seds by their restframe $u-v$ and $v-j$ colors and find a diversepopulation: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming lyman break galaxies.this study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies athigher redshift than previously known. furthermore,we uncover a reservoir ofdusty star-forming galaxies with $4\times$ lower specific star-formation ratescompared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z&gt;3$. with $5\times$ highernumbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formationcompared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.

1405.4869	rapid decline of lyman-alpha emission toward the reionization era	the observed deficit of strongly lyman-alpha emitting galaxies at z&gt;6.5 isattributed to either increasing neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium(igm) and/or to the evolving galaxy properties. to investigate this, we haveperformed very deep near-ir spectroscopy of z&gt;7 galaxies using mosfire on thekeck-i telescope. we measure the lyman-alpha fraction at z~8 (combinedphotometric redshift peak at z=7.7) using two methods. first, we derivednly{\alpha}/ntot directly using extensive simulations to correct forincompleteness. second, we used a bayesian formalism (introduced by treu et al.2012) that compares the z&gt;7 galaxy spectra to models of the lyman-alphaequivalent width (wly{\alpha}) distribution at z~6. we explored two simpleevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where lyman-alpha is attenuated in allgalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolutionor a slowly increasing igm opacity), and patchy evolution where lyman-alpha isblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the igm being opaque alongonly some fraction of sightlines). the bayesian formalism places strongerconstraints compared with the direct method. combining our data with that inthe literature we find that at z~8 the lyman-alpha fraction has dropped by afactor &gt;3(84% confidence interval) using both the smooth and patchy scenarioscompared to the z~6 values. furthermore, we find a tentative evidence that thedata favor the patchy scenario over smooth (with "positive" bayesian evidence),extending trends observed at z~7 to higher redshift. if this decrease is aresult of reionization as predicted by theory, then our data imply the volumeaveraged neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm to be &gt;0.3 suggesting that thereionization of the universe is in progress at z~8.

1406.6056	the distribution of satellites around massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  zfourge/candels: dependence on star formation activity	we study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming andquiescent central galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 using imaging from the fourstar galaxyevolution survey (zfourge) and the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the deep near-ir data select satellites down to$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;9$ at z&lt;3. the radial satellite distribution around centralsis consistent with a projected nfw profile. massive quiescent centrals,$\log(m/m_\odot)&gt;10.78$, have $\sim$2 times the number of satellites comparedto star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ even afteraccounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. we findno statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-massquiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48&lt;\log(m/m_\odot)&lt;10.78$. comparingto the guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicatesthat quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-formingcentrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. we use a simpletoy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces theobserved quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass betweenstar-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenchingprobability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for$\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(m_h/m_\odot)\sim$13.5. a singlehalo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction andsatellite distribution of centrals. therefore, while halo quenching may be animportant mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. itremains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even inrelatively massive halos.

1407.6012	the relation between sfr and stellar mass for galaxies at 3.5 $\le z\le$  6.5 in candels	distant star-forming galaxies show a correlation between their star formationrates (sfr) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxyformation. here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatterof the sfr-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ usingmulti-wavelength photometry in goods-s from the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and spitzer extended deep survey. wedescribe an updated, bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method thatincorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories thatare constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions(starburst and small magellanic cloud). from $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forminggalaxies in candels follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar massand sfr that follows sfr $\sim$ $m_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. this evolution requires a star formationhistory that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the sfrs ofindividual galaxies rise with time). the observed scatter in the sfr-stellarmass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{sfr}/\mathrm{m}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})&lt;0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log m_\star/\mathrm{m}_\odot &gt; 9$ dex.assuming that the sfr is tied to the net gas inflow rate (sfr $\sim$$\dot{m}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is alsosmaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass andredshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.we further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected onthe basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolutionin the sfr-stellar mass relation.

1409.4791	kpc-scale properties of emission-line galaxies	we perform a detailed study of the resolved properties of emission-linegalaxies at kpc-scale to investigate how small-scale and global properties ofgalaxies are related. 119 galaxies with high-resolution keck/deimos spectra areselected to cover a wide range in morphologies over the redshift range0.2&lt;z&lt;1.3. using the hst/acs and hst/wfc3 imaging data taken as a part of thecandels project, for each galaxy we perform sed fitting per resolution element,producing resolved rest-frame u-v color, stellar mass, star formation rate, ageand extinction maps. we develop a technique to identify blue and red "regions"within individual galaxies, using their rest-frame color maps. as expected, forany given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surfacedensities and older ages compared to the blue regions. furthermore, we quantifythe spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshiftand stellar mass, finding that the stronger concentration of red regions towardthe centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift orstellar mass. we find that the "main sequence" of star forming galaxies existsamong both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blueregions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of~0.6 dex. the blue regions show higher specific star formation rates (ssfr)than their red counterparts with the ssfr decreasing since z~1, driverprimarily by the stellar mass surface densities rather than the sfrs at a giverresolution element.

1409.5433	the herschel view of the dominant mode of galaxy growth from z=4 to the  present day	we present an analysis of the deepest herschel images in four majorextragalactic fields goods-north, goods-south, uds and cosmos obtained withinthe goods-herschel and candels-herschel key programs. the picture provided by10497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stackinganalysis of a mass-complete sample of 62361 star-forming galaxies from thecandels-hst h band-selected catalogs and from two deep ground-based ksband-selected catalogs in the goods-north and the cosmos-wide fields, in orderto obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of thestellar mass growth over the cosmic history. we show, for the first time, thatstacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of aphysical correlation and describe our method called "scatter stacking" that maybe easily generalized to other experiments. we demonstrate that galaxies of allmasses from z=4 to 0 follow a universal scaling law, the so-called mainsequence of star-forming galaxies. we find a universal close-to-linear slope ofthe logsfr-logm* relation with evidence for a flattening of the main sequenceat high masses (log(m*/msun) &gt; 10.5) that becomes less prominent withincreasing redshift and almost vanishes by z~2. this flattening may be due tothe parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies.within the main sequence, we measure a non varying sfr dispersion of 0.3 dex.the specific sfr (ssfr=sfr/m*) of star-forming galaxies is found tocontinuously increase from z=0 to 4. finally we discuss the implications of ourfindings on the cosmic sfr history and show that more than 2/3 of present-daystars must have formed in a regime dominated by the main sequence mode. as aconsequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant universe,galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation historyover the last 12.5 gyr.

1410.5439	the evolution of the galaxy rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function  over the first two billion years	we present a robust measurement and analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet(uv) luminosity function at z=4-8. we use deep hubble space telescope imagingover the candels/goods fields, the hubble ultra deep field and the year 1hubble frontier field deep parallel observations. these surveys provides aneffective volume of 0.6-1.2 x 10^6 mpc^3 over this epoch, allowing us toperform a robust search for faint (m_uv=-18) and bright (m_uv &lt; -21) galaxies.we select candidate galaxies using a well-tested photometric redshift techniquewith careful screening of contaminants, finding a sample of 7446 galaxies at3.5&lt;z&lt;8.5, with &gt;1000 galaxies at z~6-8. we measure the luminosity functionusing a markov chain monte carlo analysis to measure robust uncertainties. atthe faint end our results agree with previous studies, yet we find a higherabundance of uv-bright galaxies at z&gt;6, with m* ~ -21 at z&gt;5, different thanthat inferred based on previous trends at lower redshift. at z=8, a singlepower-law provides an equally good fit to the uv luminosity function, while atz=6 and 7, an exponential cutoff at the bright-end is moderately preferred. wecompare to semi-analytical models, and find that the lack of evolution in m* isconsistent with models where the impact of dust attenuation on the bright-endof the luminosity function decreases at higher redshift. we measure theevolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density, correcting for dustattenuation, and find that it declines as (1+z)^(-4.3 +/- 0.5) at z&gt;4,consistent with observations at z&gt;9. our observations are consistent with areionization history that starts at z&gt;10, completes at z&gt;6, and reaches amidpoint (x_hii = 0.5) at 6.7&lt;z&lt;9.4. finally, our observations predict that theabundance of bright z=9 galaxies is likely higher than previous constraints,though consistent with recent estimates of bright z~10 galaxies.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

1501.06840	quenching and morphological transformation in semi-analytic models and  candels	we examine the spheroid growth and star formation quenching experienced bygalaxies from z~3 to the present by studying the evolution with redshift of thequiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the candels andgama surveys. we compare the observed fractions with predictions from asemi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and agnfeedback due to mergers and disk instabilities. we facilitate directmorphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar massratios to sersic indices. we then subdivide our population into the fourquadrants of the ssfr-sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of thesesubpopulations. we find that the fraction of star forming disks declinessteadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time.the fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are bothnon-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, atabout 10% and 15-20% respectively. our model is qualitatively successful atreproducing the evolution of the two "main" populations (star formingdisk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), andapproximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predictsa stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks,than seen in the observations. a model with an additional channel for bulgegrowth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations thana model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. we study evolutionarytracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphologicaltransformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physicaldrivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and diskinstabilities). we find that complex histories with multiple transformativeevents are the norm.

1504.00005	an increasing stellar baryon fraction in bright galaxies at high  redshift	recent observations have shown that the characteristic luminosity of therest-frame ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function does not significantly evolveat 4 &lt; z &lt; 7 and is approximately m*_uv ~ -21. we investigate this apparentnon-evolution by examining a sample of 178 bright, m_uv &lt; -21 galaxies at z=4to 7, analyzing their stellar populations and host halo masses. including deepspitzer/irac imaging to constrain the rest-frame optical light, we find thatm*_uv galaxies at z=4-7 have similar stellar masses of log(m/msol)=9.6-9.9 andare thus relatively massive for these high redshifts. however, bright galaxiesat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly brightgalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formationrates and levels of dust attenuation. we match the abundances of these brightz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the bolshoi lambda-cdm simulation toestimate the halo masses. we find that the typical halo masses in ~m*_uvgalaxies decrease from log(m_h/msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(m_h/msol)=11.4 at z=7.thus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multipleredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift. thestellar baryon fraction in units of the cosmic mean omega_b/omega_m rises from5.1% at z=4 to 11.7% at z=7; this evolution is significant at the ~3-sigmalevel. this rise does not agree with simple expectations of how galaxies grow,and implies that some effect, perhaps a diminishing efficiency of feedback, isallowing a higher fraction of available baryons to be converted into stars athigh redshifts.

1504.03326	the differential size growth of field and cluster galaxies at z=2.1  using the zfourge survey	there is ongoing debate regarding the extent that environment affects galaxysize growth beyond z&gt;1. to investigate the differences in star-forming andquiescent galaxy properties as a function of environment at z=2.1, we create amass-complete sample of 59 cluster galaxies spitler et al. (2012) and 478 fieldgalaxies with log(m)&gt;9 using photometric redshifts from the zfourge survey. wecompare the mass-size relation of field and cluster galaxies using measuredgalaxy semi-major axis half-light radii ($r_{1/2,maj}$) from candels hst/f160wimaging. we find consistent mass normalized (log(m)=10.7) sizes for quiescentfield galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=1.81\pm0.29$ kpc) and quiescent cluster galaxies($r_{1/2,maj}=2.17\pm0.63$ kpc). the mass normalized size of star-formingcluster galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=4.00\pm0.26$ kpc ) is 12% larger (ks test$2.1\sigma$) than star-forming field galaxies ($r_{1/2,maj}=3.57\pm0.10$ kpc).from the mass-color relation we find that quiescent field galaxies with9.7&lt;log(m)&lt;10.4 are slightly redder (ks test $3.6\sigma$) than quiescentcluster galaxies, while cluster and field quiescent galaxies with log(m)&gt;10.4have consistent colors. we find that star-forming cluster galaxies are onaverage 20% redder than star-forming field galaxies at all masses. furthermore,we stack galaxy images to measure average radial color profiles as a functionof mass. negative color gradients are only present for massive star-formingfield and cluster galaxies with log(m)&gt;10.4, the remaining galaxy masses andtypes have flat profiles. our results suggest given the observed differences insize and color of star-forming field and cluster galaxies, that the environmenthas begun to influence/accelerate their evolution. however, the lack ofdifferences between field and cluster quiescent galaxies indicates that theenvironment has not begun to significantly influence their evolution at z~2.

1507.00728	dusty galaxies and the degeneracy between their dust distributions and  the attenuation formula	do spatial distributions of dust grains in galaxies have typical forms, as dospatial distributions of stars? we investigate whether or not the distributionsresemble uniform foreground screens, as commonly assumed by the high-redshiftgalaxy community. we use rest-frame infrared, ultraviolet, and h$\alpha$ lineluminosities of dust-poor and dusty galaxies at z ~ 0 and z ~ 1 to comparemeasured h$\alpha$ escape fractions with those predicted by the calzettiattenuation formula. the predictions, based on uv escape fractions,overestimate the measured h$\alpha$ escape fractions for all samples. theinterpretation of this result for dust-poor z ~ 0 galaxies is that regions withionizing stars have more dust than regions with nonionizing uv-emitting stars.dust distributions for these galaxies are nonuniform. the interpretation of theoverestimates for dusty galaxies at both redshifts is less clear. if theattenuation formula is inapplicable to these galaxies, perhaps thedisagreements are unphysical; perhaps dust distributions in these galaxies areuniform. if the attenuation formula does apply, then dusty galaxies havenonuniform dust distributions; the distributions are more uniform than they arein dust-poor galaxies. a broad range of h$\alpha$ escape fractions at a givenuv escape fraction for z ~ 1 dusty galaxies, if real, indicates diverse dustmorphologies and the implausibility of the screen assumption.

1510.06072	the sfr-m* relation and empirical star-formation histories from zfourge  at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4	we explore star-formation histories (sfhs) of galaxies based on the evolutionof the star-formation rate stellar mass relation (sfr-m*). using data from thefourstar galaxy evolution survey (zfourge) in combination with far-ir imagingfrom the spitzer and herschel observatories we measure the sfr-m* relation at0.5 &lt; z &lt; 4. similar to recent works we find that the average infrared seds ofgalaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broadrange of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.we find that the sfr-m* relation is not consistent with a single power-law ofthe form sfr ~ m*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at lowmasses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (m_0) that ranges from10^9.5 - 10^10.8 msol, with evidence that m_0 increases with redshift. wecompare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmologicalsimulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the sfr-m* relationalbeit with systematic offsets. we use the evolving sfr-m* sequence to generatesfhs, finding that typical sfrs of individual galaxies rise at early times anddecline after reaching a peak. this peak occurs earlier for more massivegalaxies. we integrate these sfhs to generate mass-growth histories and compareto the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. wefind that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but thatthere is room for improvement at a more detailed level. at early times the sfhssuggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from thestellar mass function. however, at later times the sfhs under-predict theinferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due tomergers.

astro-ph;0105087	the stellar populations and evolution of lyman break galaxies	using deep near-ir and optical observations of the hdf-n from the hst nicmosand wfpc2 and from the ground, we examine the spectral energy distributions(seds) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.5. the uv-to-opticalrest-frame seds of the galaxies are much bluer than those of present-day spiraland elliptical galaxies, and are generally similar to those of local starburstgalaxies with modest amounts of reddening. we use stellar population synthesismodels to study the properties of the stars that dominate the light from lbgs.under the assumption that the star-formation rate is continuous or decreasingwith time, the best-fitting models provide a lower bound on the lbg massestimates. lbgs with ``l*'' uv luminosities are estimated to have minimumstellar masses ~ 10^10 solar masses, or roughly 1/10th that of a present-day l*galaxy. by considering the effects of a second component of maximally-oldstars, we set an upper bound on the stellar masses that is ~ 3-8 times theminimum estimate. we find only loose constraints on the individual galaxy ages,extinction, metallicities, initial mass functions, and prior star-formationhistories. we find no galaxies whose seds are consistent with young (&lt; 10^8yr), dust-free objects, which suggests that lbgs are not dominated by ``firstgeneration'' stars, and that such objects are rare at these redshifts. we alsofind that the typical ages for the observed star-formation events aresignificantly younger than the time interval covered by this redshift range (~1.5 gyr). from this, and from the relative absence of candidates for quiescent,non-star-forming galaxies at these redshifts in the nicmos data, we suggestthat star formation in lbgs may be recurrent, with short duty cycles and atimescale between star-formation events of &lt; 1 gyr.

astro-ph;0204198	lyman break galaxies and the reionization of the intergalactic medium	near-infrared observations of lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~3 arebeginning to provide constraints on ages, star-formation histories, dustcontent, metallicities, and stellar masses. at present, uncertainties of morethan an order of magnitude are typical for many of these parameters. it isnonetheless interesting to ask what the stellar-population models imply for theexistence and luminosities of lyman-break galaxies at higher redshift. to thisend we examine the inferred star-formation rates in two well-studied samples ofgalaxies as a function of redshift out to z = 10 for various best-fit andlimiting cases.  taken at face value, the generally young ages (typically 10^8 +- 0.5 yr) ofthe z = 3 lyman break galaxies imply that their stars were not present muchbeyond z=4. by z = 6 the cosmic star-formation rate from the progenitors ofthese galaxies is less than 10% of star-formation rate at z=3 +- 0.5, even formaximally-old models, provided the derivative of the star-formation rate sfr(t)is monotonic. the escaping lyman-continuum radiation from such galaxies wouldbe insufficient to reionize the igm. thus other sources of ionizing photons(e.g. very massive population iii stars) may be needed, and the more normallyman-break galaxies may be a phenomenon confined to redshifts z &lt;~ 4. thisconclusion changes if sfr(t) was episodic, and we examine the parameters ofsuch bursty star-formation that might be consistent with both the z=2-4luminosity functions and the z~3 spectral energy distributions.

astro-ph;0209588	on measuring the infrared luminosity of distant galaxies with the space  infrared telescope facility	the space infrared telescope facility (sirtf) will revolutionize the study ofdust-obscured star formation in distant galaxies. although deep images from themultiband imaging photometer for sirtf (mips) will provide coverage at 24, 70,and 160 micron, the bulk of mips-detected objects may only have accuratephotometry in the shorter wavelength bands due to the confusion noise.therefore, we have explored the potential for constraining the total infrared(ir) fluxes of distant galaxies with solely the 24 micron flux density, and forthe combination of 24 micron and 70 micron data. we also discuss the inherentsystematic uncertainties in making these transitions. under the assumption thatdistant star-forming galaxies have ir spectral energy distributions (seds) thatare represented somewhere in the local universe, the 24 micron data (plusoptical and x-ray data to allow redshift estimation and agn rejection)constrains the total ir luminosity to within a factor of 2.5 for galaxies with0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.6. incorporating the 70 micron data substantially improves thisconstraint by a factor &lt; 6. lastly, we argue that if the shape of the ir sed isknown (or well constrained; e.g., because of high ir luminosity, or lowultraviolet/ir flux ratio), then the ir luminosity can be estimated with morecertainty.

astro-ph;0212242	the evolution of the global stellar mass density at 0 &lt; z &lt; 3	the build-up of stellar mass in galaxies is the consequence of their paststar formation and merging histories. here we report measurements of rest-frameoptical light and calculations of stellar mass at high redshift based on aninfrared-selected sample of galaxies from the hubble deep field north. thebright envelope of rest-frame b-band galaxy luminosities is similar from 0&lt;z&lt;3,and the co-moving luminosity density is constant to within a factor of 3 overthat redshift range. however, galaxies at higher redshifts are bluer, andstellar population modeling indicates that they had significantly lowermass-to-light ratios than those of present-day l* galaxies. this leads to aglobal stellar mass density, omega_*(z), which rises with time from z=3 to thepresent. this measurement essentially traces the integral of the cosmic starformation history that has been the subject of previous investigations. 50-75%of the present-day stellar mass density had formed by z ~ 1, but at z ~= 2.7 wefind only 3-14% of today's stars were present. this increase in omega_* withtime is broadly consistent with observations of the evolving global starformation rate once dust extinction is taken into account, but is steeper at1&lt;z&lt;3 than predicted by some recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.the observations appear to be inconsistent with scenarios in which the bulk ofstars in present-day galactic spheroids formed at z&gt;&gt;2.

astro-ph;0306106	a direct measurement of major galaxy mergers at z &lt; 3	this paper presents direct evidence for hierarchical galaxy assembly out toredshifts z ~ 3. we identify major mergers using the model-independent cas(concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness) physical morphological system ongalaxies detected, and photometrically selected, in the wfpc2 and nicmos hubbledeep field north. we specifically use the asymmetric distributions ofrest-frame optical light measured through the asymmetry parameter (a) todetermine the fraction of galaxies undergoing major mergers as a function ofredshift (z), stellar mass (m_{*}), and absolute magnitude (m_{b}). we findthat the fraction of galaxies consistent with undergoing a major mergerincreases with redshift for all galaxies, but most significantly, at 5 - 10sigma confidence, for the most luminous and massive systems. the highest mergerfractions we find are 40% - 50% for galaxies with m_{b} &lt; -21, or m_{*} &gt; 10^10m_0 at z &gt; 2.5, i.e., objects identified as lyman-break galaxies. we model themerger fraction evolution in the form: f x (1+z)^m, finding m values ~4-6 forthe most luminous and massive galaxies. we use these merger fractions combinedwith merger time scales calculated from n-body simulations to derive galaxymerger rates to z ~ 3. we also use stellar masses of hdf-n galaxies todetermine the mass accretion rate of field galaxies involved in major mergers,and how this changes with redshift. we further find that the fraction ofstellar mass density in galaxies involved in major mergers increases withredshift. by comparing merger fractions predicted in cold dark mattersemi-analytic models with our results there is a reasonably good agreement forthe largest and brightest systems, although there are more low-mass galaxymergers at lower redshifts than what these models predict.

astro-ph;0308386	the internal ultraviolet-to-optical color dispersion: quantifying the  morphological k-correction	we present a quantitative measure of the internal color dispersion withingalaxies, which quantifies differences in morphology as a function ofwavelength. we apply this statistic to a local galaxy sample with archivalimages at 1500 and 2500 angstroms from the ultraviolet imaging telescope, andground-based b-band observations to investigate how the color dispersionrelates to global galaxy properties. the intenal color dispersion generallycorrelates with transformations in galaxy morphology as a function ofwavelength, i.e., it quantifies the morphological k-correction. mid-type spiralgalaxies exhibit the highest dispersion in their internal colors, which stemsfrom differences in the bulge, disk, and spiral-arm components. irregulars andlate-type spirals show moderate internal color dispersion, which implies thatyoung stars generally dominate the colors. ellipticals, lenticulars, andearly-type spirals generally have low or negligible internal color dispersion,which indicates that the stars contributing to the uv-to-optical emission havea very homogeneous distribution. we discuss the application of the internalcolor dispersion to high-redshift galaxies in deep, hubble space telescopeimages. by simulating local galaxies at cosmological distances, many of thegalaxies have luminosities that are sufficiently bright at rest--frame opticalwavelengths to be detected within the limits of the currently deepestnear-infrared surveys even with no evolution. under assumptions that theluminosity and color evolution of the local galaxies conform with the measuredvalues of high-redshift objects, we show that galaxies' intrinsic internalcolor dispersion remains measurable out to z ~ 3.

astro-ph;0309067	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies in the great  observatories origins deep survey as a test of galaxy formation scenarios	the redshift distribution of near-ir selected galaxies is often used toattempt to discriminate between the classical view of galaxy formation, inwhich present-day luminous galaxies were assembled at early times and evolvedue to the passive aging of their stellar populations, and that of hierarchicalstructure formation, in which galaxies were assembled more recently via themerging of smaller objects. we carry out such a test here, by computing thedistribution of photometric redshifts of k_ab&lt;22 galaxies in the greatobservatories origins deep field survey goods southern field, and comparing theresults with predictions from a semi-analytic model based on hierarchicalstructure formation, and a classical `passive evolution' model. we find thatthe redshift distributions at z &lt;~ 1.5 of both the hierarchical and passivemodels are very similar to the observed one. at z&gt;~1.5, the hierarchical modelshows a deficit of galaxies, while the passive model predicts an excess. weinvestigate the nature of the observed galaxies in the redshift range where themodels diverge, and find that the majority have highly disturbed morphologies,suggesting that they may be merger-induced starbursts. while the hierarchicalmodel used here does not produce these objects in great enough numbers, theappearance of this population is clearly in better qualitative agreement withthe hierarchical picture than with the classical passive evolution scenario. weconclude that the observations support the general framework of hierarchicalformation, but suggest the need for new or modified physics in the models.

astro-ph;0310888	evolution in the colors of lyman-break galaxies from z~4 to z~3	the integrated colors of distant galaxies provide a means for interpretingthe properties of their stellar content. here, we use rest-frame uv-to-opticalcolors to constrain the spectral-energy distributions and stellar populationsof color-selected, b-dropout galaxies at z ~ 4 in the great observatoriesorigins deep survey. we combine the acs data with ground-based near-infraredimages, which extend the coverage of galaxies at z ~ 4 to the rest-frameb-band. we observe a color-magnitude trend in the rest-frame m(uv) - b versus bdiagram for the z ~ 4 galaxies that has a fairly well-defined "blue-envelope",and is strikingly similar to that of color-selected, u-dropout galaxies at z ~3. we also find that although the co-moving luminosity density at rest-frame uvwavelengths (1600 angstroms) is roughly comparable at z ~ 3 and z ~ 4, theluminosity density at rest-frame optical wavelengths increases by aboutone-third from z ~ 4 to z ~ 3. although the star-formation histories ofindividual galaxies may involve complex and stochastic events, the evolution inthe global luminosity density of the uv-bright galaxy population corresponds toan average star-formation history with a star-formation rate that is constantor increasing over these redshifts. this suggests that the evolution in theluminosity density corresponds to an increase in the stellar-mass density ofmore than 33%.

astro-ph;0501088	the assembly of diversity in the morphologies and stellar populations of  high-redshift galaxies	we have studied the evolution in the morphologies, sizes, stellar-masses,colors, and internal color dispersion (icd) of galaxies at z=1 and 2.3, using anear-ir, flux-limited catalog for the hdf-n. at z=1 most luminous galaxies havemorphologies of early-to-mid hubble-types, and many show transformationsbetween their rest-frame uv-optical morphologies. galaxies at z=2.3 havecompact and irregular morphologies with no clearly evident hubble-sequencecandidates. the mean galaxy size grows from z=2.3 to 1 by 40%, and the densityof galaxies larger than 3 kpc increases by 7 times. at z=1, the size-luminositydistribution is broadly consistent with that of local galaxies, with passiveevolution. however, galaxies at z=2.3 are smaller than the large present-daygalaxies, and must continue to grow in size and stellar mass. we have measuredthe galaxies' uv-optical icd, which quantifies differences in morphology andthe relative amount of on-going star-formation. the mean and scatter ingalaxies' total colors and icd increase from z=2.3 to 1. at z=1 many galaxieswith large icd are spirals, with a few irregular systems. few z=2.3 galaxieshave high icd, and those that do are actively merging. we interpret this asevidence for the presence of older and more diverse stellar populations at z=1that are not generally present at z&gt;2. we conclude that the star-formationhistories of galaxies at z&gt;2 are dominated by discrete, recurrent bursts, whichquickly homogenize the galaxies' stellar content, and are possibly associatedwith mergers. the increase in the stellar-population diversification by z&lt;1.4implies that merger-induced starbursts occur less frequently than at higherredshifts, and more quiescent star-forming modes dominate. this transitioncoincides with the emergence of hubble-sequence galaxies.

astro-ph;0505101	spitzer view on the evolution of star-forming galaxies from z=0 to z~3	we use a 24 micron selected sample containing more than 8,000 sources tostudy the evolution of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range from z=0 toz~3. we obtain photometric redshifts for most of the sources in our surveyusing a method based on empirically-built templates spanning from ultravioletto mid-infrared wavelengths. the accuracy of these redshifts is better than 10%for 80% of the sample. the derived redshift distribution of the sourcesdetected by our survey peaks at around z=0.6-1.0 (the location of the peakbeing affected by cosmic variance), and decays monotonically from z~1 to z~3.we have fitted infrared luminosity functions in several redshift bins in therange 0&lt;z&lt;~3. our results constrain the density and/or luminosity evolution ofinfrared-bright star-forming galaxies. the typical infrared luminosity (l*)decreases by an order of magnitude from z~2 to the present. the cosmic starformation rate (sfr) density goes as (1+z)^{4.0\pm0.2} from z=0 to z=0.8. fromz=0.8 to z~1.2, the sfr density continues rising with a smaller slope. at1.2&lt;z&lt;3, the cosmic sfr density remains roughly constant. the sfr density isdominated at low redshift (z&lt;0.5) by galaxies which are not very luminous inthe infrared (l_tir&lt;1.e11 l_sun, where l_tir is the total infrared luminosity,integrated from 8 to 1000 micron). the contribution from luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies (l_tir&gt;1.e11 l_sun) to the total sfr densityincreases steadily from z~0 up to z~2.5, forming at least half of thenewly-born stars by z~1.5. ultraluminous infrared galaxies (l_tir&gt;1.e12 l_sun)play a rapidly increasing role for z&gt;~1.3.

astro-ph;0510625	building galaxies with simulations	we present an overview of some of the issues surrounding current models ofgalaxy formation, highlighting recent insights obtained from cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulations. detailed examination of gas accretion processes showa hot mode of gas cooling from near the halo's virial temperature, and apreviously underappreciated cold mode where gas flows in along filaments ondynamical timescales, emitting its energy in line radiation. cold modedominates in systems with halo masses slightly smaller than the milky way andbelow, and hence dominates the global accretion during the heydey of galaxyformation. this rapid accretion path enables prompt assembly of massivegalaxies in the early universe, and results in $z\sim 4$ galaxy properties inbroad agreement with observations, with the most massive galaxies being themost rapid star formers. massive galaxies today are forming stars at a muchreduced rate, a trend called downsizing. the trend of downsizing is naturallyreproduced in simulations, owing to a transition from cold mode accretion inthe early growth phase to slower hot mode accretion once their halos growlarge. however, massive galaxies at the present epoch are still observed tohave considerably redder colors than simulations suggest, suggesting that starformation is not sufficiently truncated in models by the transition to hotmode, and that another process not included in current simulations is requiredto suppress star formation.

astro-ph;0601558	spectral energy distributions and multiwavelength selection of type 1  quasars	we present an analysis of the mid-infrared (mir) and optical properties oftype 1 (broad-line) quasars detected by the spitzer space telescope. the mircolor-redshift relation is characterized to z=3, with predictions to z=7. wedemonstrate how combining mir and optical colors can yield even more efficientselection of active galactic nuclei (agn) than mir or optical colors alone.composite spectral energy distributions (seds) are constructed for 259 quasarswith both sloan digital sky survey and spitzer photometry, supplemented bynear-ir, galex, vla and rosat data where available. we discuss how the spectraldiversity of quasars influences the determination of bolometric luminositiesand accretion rates; assuming the mean sed can lead to errors as large as afactor of 2 for individual quasars. finally, we show that careful considerationof the shape of the mean quasar sed and its redshift dependence leads to alower estimate of the fraction of reddened/obscured agns missed by opticalsurveys as compared to estimates derived from a single mean mir to optical fluxratio.

astro-ph;0610842	aegis: extinction and star formation tracers from line emission	strong nebular emission lines are a sensitive probe of star formation andextinction in galaxies, and the [o ii] line detects star forming populationsout to z&gt;1. however, star formation rates from emission lines depend oncalibration of extinction and the [o ii]/h-alpha line ratio, and separatingstar formation from agn emission. we use calibrated line luminosities from thedeep2 survey and palomar k magnitudes to show that the behavior of emissionline ratios depends on galaxy magnitude and color. for galaxies on the blueside of the color bimodality, the vast majority show emission signatures ofstar formation, and there are strong correlations of extinction and [oii]/h-alpha with restframe h magnitude. the conversion of [o ii] toextinction-corrected h-alpha and thus to star formation rate has a significantslope with m_h, 0.23 dex/mag. red galaxies with emission lines have a muchhigher scatter in their line ratios, and more than half show agn signatures. weuse 24 micron fluxes from spitzer/mips to demonstrate the differing populationsprobed by nebular emission and by mid-ir luminosity. although extinction iscorrelated with luminosity, 98% of ir-luminous galaxies at z~1 are stilldetected in the [o ii] line. mid-ir detected galaxies are mostly bright andintermediate color, while fainter, bluer galaxies with high [o ii] luminosityare rarely detected at 24 microns.

astro-ph;0702208	the dependence of star formation on galaxy stellar mass	we combine spitzer 24micron observations with data from the combo-17 surveyfor ~15,000 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 galaxies to determine how the average star formation rates(sfr) have evolved for galaxy sub-populations of different stellar masses. inthe determination of &lt;sfr&gt; we consider both the ultraviolet (uv) and theinfrared (ir) luminosities, and account for the contributions of galaxies thatare individually undetected at 24micron through image stacking. for allredshifts we find that higher-mass galaxies have substantially lower specificsfr, &lt;sfr&gt;/&lt;m*&gt;, than lower-mass ones. however, we find the striking resultthat the rate of decline in cosmic sfr with redshift is nearly the same formassive and low-mass galaxies, i.e. not a strong function of stellar mass. thisanalysis confirms one version of what has been referred to as `downsizing',namely that the epoch of major mass build-up in massive galaxies issubstantially earlier than the epoch of mass build-up in low-mass galaxies. yetit shows that star formation activity is not becoming increasingly limited tolow-mass galaxies towards the present epoch. we argue that this suggests thatheating by agn-powered radio jets is not the dominant mechanism responsible forthe decline in cosmic sfr since z~1, which is borne out by comparison withsemi-analytic models that include this effect.

0811.3873	the stages view of red spirals and dusty red galaxies: mass-dependent  quenching of star-formation in cluster infall	we investigate the properties of optically passive spirals and dusty redgalaxies in the a901/2 cluster complex at redshift ~0.17 using restframenear-uv-optical seds, 24 micron ir data and hst morphologies from the stagesdataset. the cluster sample is based on combo-17 redshifts with an rmsprecision of sigma_cz~2000 km/sec. we find that 'dusty red galaxies' and'optically passive spirals' in a901/2 are largely the same phenomenon, and thatthey form stars at a substantial rate, which is only 4x lower than that in bluespirals at fixed mass. this star formation is more obscured than in bluegalaxies and its optical signatures are weak. they appear predominantly in thestellar mass range of log m*/msol=[10,11] where they constitute over half ofthe star-forming galaxies in the cluster; they are thus a vital ingredient forunderstanding the overall picture of star formation quenching in clusters. wefind that the mean specific sfr of star-forming galaxies in the cluster isclearly lower than in the field, in contrast to the specific sfr properties ofblue galaxies alone, which appear similar in cluster and field. such a rich redspiral population is best explained if quenching is a slow process andmorphological transformation is delayed even more. at log m*/msol&lt;10, suchgalaxies are rare, suggesting that their quenching is fast and accompanied bymorphological change. we note, that edge-on spirals play a minor role; despitebeing dust-reddened they form only a small fraction of spirals independent ofenvironment.
