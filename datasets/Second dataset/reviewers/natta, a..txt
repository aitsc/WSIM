0911.3653	revealing the sub-au asymmetries of the inner dust rim in the disk  around the herbig ae star r cra	models predict that in the innermost au of the disk around herbig ae/be star,the dust disk forms a "puffed-up" inner rim, which should result in a stronglyasymmetric brightness distribution for disks seen under intermediateinclination. using the vlti/amber long-baseline interferometer, we obtained 24near-infrared (h- and k-band) spectro-interferometric observations on theherbig ae star r cra. in the derived visibility function, we detect thesignatures of an extended (25 mas) and a compact component (5.8 mas), with thecompact component contributing about 2/3 of the total flux. the brightnessdistribution is highly asymmetric, as indicated by the strong closure phases(up to 40 deg) and the detected position angle dependence of the visibilitiesand closure phases. to interpret these asymmetries, we employ geometric as wellas physical models, including a binary model, a skewed ring model, and apuffed-up inner rim model with a vertical or curved rim shape. our curvedpuffed-up rim model can reasonably well reproduce the interferometricobservables and the sed simultaneously and suggests a luminosity of 29 l_sunand the presence of relatively large (&gt; 1.2 micron) silicate dust grains.perpendicular to the disk, two bow shock-like structures appear in theassociated reflection nebula ngc 6729, suggesting that the resolved sub-au sizedisk is the driving engine of a large-scale outflow. detecting, for the firsttime, strong non-localized asymmetries in the inner regions of a herbig aedisk, our study supports the existence of a puffed-up inner rim in yso disks.

0911.4363	strong near-infrared emission in the sub-au disk of the herbig ae star  hd163296: evidence for refractory dust?	we present new long-baseline spectro-interferometric observations of theherbigae star hd163296 obtained in the h and k bands with the amber instrumentat vlti. the observations cover a range of spatial resolutions between 3 and 12milli-arcseconds, with a spectral resolution of ~30. with a total of 1481visibilities and 432 closure phases, they result in the best (u,v) coverageachieved on a young star so far. the circumstellar material is resolved at thesub-au spatial scale and closure phase measurements indicate a small butsignificant deviation from point-symmetry. we discuss the results assuming thatthe near-infrared excess in hd163296 is dominated by the emission of acircumstellar disk. a successful fit to the spectral energy distribution,near-infrared visibilities and closure phases is found with a model where adominant contribution to the h and k band emissions arises from an opticallythin, smooth and point-symmetric region extending from about 0.1 to 0.45 au. atthe latter distance from the star, silicates condense, the disk becomesoptically thick and develops a puffed-up rim, whose skewed emission can accountfor the non-zero closure phases. we discuss the nature of the inner diskemission and tentatively rule out dense molecular gas as well as optically thinatomic or ionized gas as its possible origin. we propose instead that the inneremission traces the presence of very refractory grains in a partially clearedregion, extending at least to 0.5 au. if so, we may be observing the disk ofhd163296 just before it reaches the transition disk phase. however, we notethat the nature of the refractory grains or even the possibility for any grainto survive at the very high temperatures we require (~2100-2300 k at 0.1 aufrom the star) is unclear and should be investigated further.

0912.3356	dust properties of protoplanetary disks in the taurus-auriga star  forming region from millimeter wavelengths	we present the most sensitive 3 mm-survey to date of protoplanetary diskscarried in the taurus-auriga star forming region (average rms of about 0.3mjy), using the iram pdbi. with our high detection rate of 17/19, we providethe first detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for 12 sources. thisenables us to study statistically the mm sed slopes and dust properties offaint disks and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform analysis method.with these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter andmillimeter wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21isolated disks around t tauri stars in the taurus-auriga star forming region.together with the information about the disks spatial extension from sub/mm-mminterferometric studies, we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energydistribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths, usingtwo-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that takesproperly into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth. wefind evidence for the presence in the disk midplane of dust particles that havegrown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of oursample, confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects.this indicates that the dust coagulation from ism dust to mm-sized grains is avery fast process in protoplanetary disks, that appears to occur before a youngstellar object enters the class ii evolutionary stage. also, the amount ofthese large grains in the disk outer regions is stationary throughout all theclass ii evolutionary stage, indicating that mechanisms slowing down the dustinward migration are playing an important role in the taurus-aurigaprotoplanetary disks.

1007.0682	the 2008 outburst in the young stellar system zcma: i. evidence of an  enhanced bipolar wind on the au-scale	accretion is a fundamental process in star formation. although the timeevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modellingstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate theformation of the protostar. observing young stellar objects during theseelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteadyaccretion. zcma is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embeddedherbig be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a fu orionis star. theherbig be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburstdetected so far. we aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studyingthe emission region of the hi brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer ofaccretion/ejection processes on the au-scale in young stars. using theamber/vlti instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performedspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gasemitting across the brackett gamma emission line, during and after theoutburst. from the visibilities and differential phases, we derivecharacteristic sizes for the brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometricmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. we find that theline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistentwith the signature of either a keplerian disk or infall of matter. they are,instead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk holeinside the dust sublimation radius. the disappearance of the brackett gammaemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to aperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along theline of sight. based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of theoutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring inex ors and fu ors.

1009.2697	new constraints on dust grain size and distribution in cq tau	grain growth in circumstellar disks is expected to be the first step towardsthe formation of planetary systems. there is now evidence for grain growth inseveral disks around young stars. radially resolved images of grain growth incircumstellar disks are believed to be a powerful tool to constrain the dustevolution models and the initial stage for the formation of planets. in thispaper we attempt to provide these constraints for the disk surrounding theyoung star cq tau. this system was already suggested from previous studies tohost a population of grains grown to large sizes. we present new high angularresolution (0.3-0.9 arcsec) observations at wavelengths from 850um to 3.6cmobtained at the sma, iram-pdbi and nrao-vla interferometers. we perform acombined analysis of the spectral energy distribution and of thehigh-resolution images at different wavelengths using a model to describe thedust thermal emission from the circumstellar disk. we include a prescriptionfor the gas emission from the inner regions of the system. we detect thepresence of evolved dust by constraining the disk averaged dust opacitycoefficient beta (computed between 1.3 and 7mm) to be 0.6+/-0.1. this confirmsthe earlier suggestions that the disk contains dust grains grown to significantsizes and puts this on firmer grounds by tightly constraining the gascontamination to the observed fluxes at mm-cm wavelengths. we report someevidence of radial variations in dust properties, but current resolution andsensitivity are still too low for definitive results.

1010.1677	the (sub-)millimeter sed of protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the  orion nebula cluster	we present the sub-mm/mm sed for a sample of eight young circumstellar disksin the outer regions of the orion nebula cluster. new observations were carriedout at 2.9 mm with the carma array and for one disk, 216-0939, at 3.3 and 6.8mm with atca. by combining these new millimeter data with literaturemeasurements at sub-millimeter wavelengths we investigate grain growth andmeasure the dust mass in protoplanetary disks in the orion nebula cluster.these data provide evidence for dust grain growth to at least millimeter-sizesfor the first time in a high-mass star forming region. the obtained range insub-mm/mm spectral index, namely 1.5-3.2, indicates that for disks in theoutskirts of the orion nebula cluster (projected distance from the clustercenter between about 0.4 pc and 1.5 pc) grain growth to mm sizes occurs in thesame manner as disks in regions where only low-mass stars form. finally, in oursample three disks are more massive than about $0.05\,m_\odot$, confirming thatmassive disks are present in the outer regions of the orion nebula.

0704.2332	survival of the mm-cm size grain population observed in protoplanetary  disks	millimeter interferometry provides evidence for the presence of mm to cm size"pebbles" in the outer parts of disks around pre-main-sequence stars. theobservations suggest that large grains are produced relatively early in diskevolution (&lt; 1 myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of time (5 to10 myr). simple theoretical estimates of the radial drift time of solidparticles, however, imply that they would drift inward over a time scale ofless than 0.1 myr. in this paper, we address this conflict between theory andobservation, using more detailed theoretical models, including the effects ofsedimentation, collective drag forces and turbulent viscosity. we find that,although these effects slow down the radial drift of the dust particles, thisreduction is not sufficient to explain the observationally determined longsurvival time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary disks. however, if forsome reason the gas to dust ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factorof 20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance through photoevaporation ofthe gas), then the radial drift time scales become sufficiently large to be inagreement with observations.

1202.1802	the effect of local optically thick regions in the long-wave emission of  young circumstellar disks	multi-wavelength observations of protoplanetary disks in the sub-millimetercontinuum have measured spectral indices values which are significantly lowerthan what is found in the diffuse interstellar medium. under the assumptionthat mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have beengenerally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles inthe disk outer regions. in this work we investigate the effect of possiblelocal optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary diskswithout mm/cm-sized grains. a significant local increase of the optical depthin the disk can be caused by the concentration of solid particles, as predictedto result from a variety of proposed physical mechanisms. we calculate thefilling factors and implied overdensities these optically thick regions wouldneed to significantly affect the millimeter fluxes of disks, and we discusstheir plausibility. we find that optically thick regions characterized byrelatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young diskswithout requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles. however, these opticallythick regions require dust overdensities much larger than what predicted by anyof the physical processes proposed in the literature to drive the concentrationof solids. we find that only for the most massive disks it is possible andplausible to imagine that the presence of optically thick regions in the diskis responsible for the low measured values of the mm spectral index. for themajority of the disk population, optically thin emission from a population oflarge mm-sized grains remains the most plausible explanation. the results ofthis analysis further strengthen the scenario for which the measured lowspectral indices of protoplanetary disks at mm wavelengths are due to thepresence of large mm/cm-sized pebbles in the disk outer regions.

1304.6638	explaining millimeter-sized particles in brown dwarf disks	planets have been detected around a variety of stars, including low-massobjects, such as brown dwarfs. however, such extreme cases are challenging forplanet formation models. recent sub-millimeter observations of disks aroundbrown dwarf measured low spectral indices of the continuum emission thatsuggest that dust grains grow to mm-sizes even in these very low massenvironments. to understand the first steps of planet formation in scaled-downversions of t-tauri disks, we investigate the physical conditions that cantheoretically explain the growth from interstellar dust to millimeter-sizedgrains in disks around brown dwarf. we modeled the evolution of dust particlesunder conditions of low-mass disks around brown dwarfs. we used coagulation,fragmentation and disk-structure models to simulate the evolution of dust, withzero and non-zero radial drift. for the non-zero radial drift, we consideredstrong inhomogeneities in the gas surface density profile that mimic long-livedpressure bumps in the disk. we studied different scenarios that could lead toan agreement between theoretical models and the spectral slope found bymillimeter observations. we find that fragmentation is less likely and rapidinward drift is more significant for particles in brown dwarf disks than int-tauri disks. we present different scenarios that can nevertheless explainmillimeter-sized grains. as an example, a model that combines the followingparameters can fit the millimeter fluxes measured for brown dwarf disks: strongpressure inhomogeneities of $\sim$ 40% of amplitude, a small radial extent$\sim$ 15 au, a moderate turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}}= 10^{-3}$,and average fragmentation velocities for ices $v_f = 10 m s^{-1}$.

1310.2069	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: iv -- accretion in  low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects in lupus	we present x-shooter/vlt observations of a sample of 36 accreting low-massstellar and sub-stellar objects (ysos) in the lupus star forming region,spanning a range in mass from ~0.03 to ~1.2msun, but mostly with 0.1msun &lt;mstar &lt; 0.5msun. our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship betweenexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, toinvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of thecentral object. the accretion luminosity (lacc), and from it the accretion rate(macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the uv to thenear-ir, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. the flux andluminosity (ll) of a large number of emission lines of h, he, caii, etc.,observed simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. theluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with lacc. we provide empiricalrelationships between lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which havea lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. ourmeasurements extend the pab and brg relationships to lacc values about twoorders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies. we confirmthat different methodologies to measure lacc and macc yield significantlydifferent results: ha line profile modelling may underestimate macc by 0.6 to0.8dex with respect to macc derived from continuum-excess measures. suchdifferences may explain the likely spurious bi-modal relationships between maccand other ysos properties reported in the literature. we derive macc in therange 2e-12 -- 4e-8 msun/yr and conclude that macc is proportional tomstar^1.8(+/-0.2), with a dispersion lower by a factor of about 2 than inprevious studies. a number of properties indicate that the physical conditionsof the accreting gas are similar over more than 5 orders of magnitude in macc.

1402.5778	millimetre spectral indices of transition disks and their relation to  the cavity radius	transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner depleted dust cavitiesand excellent candidates to investigate the dust evolution under the existenceof a pressure bump. a pressure bump at the outer edge of the cavity allows dustgrains from the outer regions to stop their rapid inward migration towards thestar and efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. dynamical interactions withplanet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearingof the inner disk. we look for evidence of the presence of millimetre dustparticles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index with new andavailable photometric data. we investigate the influence of the size of thedust depleted cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. wepresent the 3mm photometric observations carried out with pdbi of fourtransition disks: lkha330, uxtaua, lrll31, and lrll67. we use available valuesof their fluxes at 345ghz to calculate their spectral index, as well as thespectral index for a sample of twenty transition disks. we compare theobservations with two kind of models. in the first set of models, we considercoagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity is formed bya massive planet located at different positions. the second set of modelsassumes disks with truncated inner parts at different radius and with power-lawdust size distributions, where the maximum size of grains is calculatedconsidering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions. we show thatthe integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks than for regularprotoplanetary disks. for transition disks, the probability that the measuredspectral index is positively correlated with the cavity radius is 95%. highangular resolution imaging of transition disks is needed to distinguish betweenthe dust trapping scenario and the truncated disk case.

1406.5630	x-shooter spectroscopy of young stellar objects: v - slow winds in t  tauri stars	disks around t tauri stars are known to lose mass, as best shown by theprofiles of forbidden emission lines of low ionization species. at least twoseparate kinematic components have been identified, one characterised byvelocity shifts of tens to hundreds km/s (hvc) and one with much lower velocityof few km/s (lvc). the hvc are convincingly associated to the emission of jets,but the origin of the lvc is still unknown. in this paper we analyze theforbidden line spectrum of a sample of 44 mostly low mass young stars in lupusand $\sigma$-ori observed with the x-shooter eso spectrometer. we detectforbidden line emission of [oi], [oii], [sii], [ni], and [nii], andcharacterize the line profiles as lvc, blue-shifted hvc and red-shifted hvc. wefocus our study on the lvc. we show that there is a good correlation betweenline luminosity and both l$_{star}$ and the accretion luminosity (or themass-accretion rate) over a large interval of values (l$_{star}$ $\sim 10^{-2}- 1$ l$_\odot$; l$_{acc}$ $\sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}$ l$_\odot$; $\dot m_{acc}$$\sim 10^{-11} - 10^{-7}$ m$_\odot$/yr). the lines show the presence of a slowwind ($v_{peak}&lt;20$ km/s), dense ($n_h&gt;10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), warm (t$\sim5000-10000$ k), mostly neutral. we estimate the mass of the emitting gas andprovide a value for the maximum volume it occupies. both quantities increasesteeply with the stellar mass, from $\sim 10^{-12}$ m$_\odot$ and $\sim 0.01$au$^3$ for m$_{star}$$\sim 0.1$ m$_\odot$, to $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}$m$_\odot$ and $\sim 1$ au$^3$ for m$_{star}$$\sim 1$ m$_\odot$, respectively.these results provide quite stringent constraints to wind models in low massyoung stars, that need to be explored further.

1505.04046	x-shooter study of accretion in $\rho$-ophiucus: very low-mass stars and  brown dwarfs	we present new vlt/x-shooter optical and nir spectra of a sample of 17candidate young low-mass stars and bds in the rho-ophiucus cluster. we derivedspt and av for all the targets, and then we determined their physicalparameters. all the objects but one have m*&lt;0.6 msun, and 8 have mass below orclose to the hydrogen-burning limit. using the intensity of various emissionlines present in their spectra, we determined the lacc and macc for all theobjects. when compared with previous works targeting the same sample, we findthat, in general, these objects are not as strongly accreting as previouslyreported, and we suggest that the reason is our more accurate estimate of thephotospheric parameters. we also compare our findings with recent works inother slightly older star-forming regions to investigate possible differencesin the accretion properties, but we find that the accretion properties for ourtargets have the same dependence on the stellar and substellar parameters as inthe other regions. this leads us to conclude that we do not find evidence for adifferent dependence of macc with m* when comparing low-mass stars and bds.moreover, we find a similar small (1 dex) scatter in the macc-m* relation as insome of our recent works in other star-forming regions, and no significantdifferences in macc due to different ages or properties of the regions. thelatter result suffers, however, from low statistics and sample selection biasesin the current studies. the small scatter in the macc-m* correlation confirmsthat macc in the literature based on uncertain photospheric parameters andsingle accretion indicators, such as the ha width, can lead to a scatter thatis unphysically large. our studies show that only broadband spectroscopicsurveys coupled with a detailed analysis of the photospheric and accretionproperties allows us to properly study the evolution of disk accretion rates.

1512.05679	a multi-wavelength analysis for interferometric (sub-)mm observations of  protoplanetary disks: radial constraints on the dust properties and the disk  structure	theoretical models of grain growth predict dust properties to change as afunction of protoplanetary disk radius, mass, age and other physicalconditions. we lay down the methodology for a multi-wavelength analysis of(sub-)mm and cm continuum interferometric observations to constrainself-consistently the disk structure and the radial variation of the dustproperties. the computational architecture is massively parallel and highlymodular. the analysis is based on the simultaneous fit in the uv-plane ofobservations at several wavelengths with a model for the disk thermal emissionand for the dust opacity. the observed flux density at the differentwavelengths is fitted by posing constraints on the disk structure and on theradial variation of the grain size distribution. we apply the analysis toobservations of three protoplanetary disks (as 209, ft tau, dr tau) for which acombination of spatially resolved observations in the range ~0.88mm to ~10mm isavailable (from sma, carma, and vla), finding evidence of a decreasing maximumdust grain size (a_max) with radius. we derive large a_max values up to 1 cm inthe inner disk between 15 and 30 au and smaller grains with a_max~1 mm in theouter disk (r &gt; 80au). in this paper we develop a multi-wavelength analysisthat will allow this missing quantity to be constrained for statisticallyrelevant samples of disks and to investigate possible correlations with disk orstellar parameters.

0807.1119	the origin of hydrogen line emission for five herbig ae/be stars  spatially resolved by vlti/amber spectro-interferometry	to trace the accretion and outflow processes around ysos, diagnostic spectrallines such as the brg 2.166 micron line are widely used, although due to a lackof spatial resolution, the origin of the line emission is still unclear.employing the au-scale spatial resolution which can be achieved with infraredlong-baseline interferometry, we aim to distinguish between theoretical modelswhich associate the brg line emission with mass infall or mass outflowprocesses. using the vlti/amber instrument, we spatially and spectrally(r=1500) resolved the inner environment of five herbig ae/be stars (hd163296,hd104237, hd98922, mwc297, v921sco) in the brg emission line as well as in theadjacent continuum. all objects (except mwc297) show an increase of visibilitywithin the brg emission line, indicating that the brg-emitting region in theseobjects is more compact than the dust sublimation radius. for hd98922, ourquantitative analysis reveals that the line-emitting region is compact enoughto be consistent with the magnetospheric accretion scenario. for hd163296,hd104237, mwc297, and v921sco we identify a stellar wind or a disk wind as themost likely line-emitting mechanism. we search for general trends and find thatthe size of the brg-emitting region does not seem to depend on the basicstellar parameters, but correlates with the h-alpha line profile shape. we findevidence for at least two distinct brg line-formation mechanisms. stars with ap-cygni h-alpha line profile and a high mass-accretion rate seem to showparticularly compact brg-emitting regions (r_brg/r_cont&lt;0.2), while stars witha double-peaked or single-peaked h-alpha-line profile show a significantly moreextended brg-emitting region (0.6&lt;r_brg/r_cont&lt;1.4), possibly tracing a stellarwind or a disk wind.

astro-ph;0102473	constraints on properties of the protoplanetary disks around ux ori and  cq tau	we present very large array observations of the intermediate masspre-main-sequence stars ux ori and cq tau at 7mm, 3.6cm, and 6cm. these starsare members of the ux ori variability class, where the origin of opticalvariability is thought to derive from inhomogeneities in circumstellar disks.both stars are detected at 7mm but not at longer wavelengths, which confirmsthat the millimeter emission is dominated by dust.  the ux ori system exhibits a remarkably flat spectral index in the millimeterrange, with alpha_mm 2 (f_nu nu^alpha_mm). two different disk models canreproduce this property: i) a physically small disk with optically thickemission, truncated at a radius about 30 au, or ii) a massive (~0.3-1 msun)disk mainly composed of dust particles grown to radii of 10cm (``pebbles'').the observations do not spatially resolve the 7mm emission. we discussimplications of these two models and suggest observational tests that willdiscriminate between them.  the cq tau system exhibits a spectral index in the millimeter range ofalpha_mm 2.6, consistent with values commonly found for disks aroundpre-main-sequence stars. the observations marginally resolve the 7mm emissionas an elongated structure with full width at half maximum of 2.4"x1.1" (240x110au at 100pc distance). the size and inclination of ~63 degrees (implied bycircular symmetry) are consistent with flared disk models previously suggestedto explain the optical colors and polarization properties.

astro-ph;0106470	passive irradiated circumstellar disks with an inner hole	a model for irradiated dust disks around herbig ae stars is proposed. themodel is based on the flaring disk model of chiang &amp; goldreich (1997), but withthe central regions of the disk removed. the inner rim of the disk is puffed upand is much hotter than the rest of the disk, because it is directly exposed tothe stellar flux. if located at the dust evaporation radius, its reemitted fluxproduces a conspicuous bump in the sed which peaks at 2-3 micron. we proposethat this emission is the explanation for the near-infrared bump observed inthe seds of herbig ae stars. we study for which stellar parameters this bumpwould be observable, and find that it is the case for herbig ae stellarparameters but not for t-tauri stars, confirming what is found from theobservations. we also study the effects of the shadow cast by the inner rimover the rest of the flaring disk. the shadowed region can be quite large, andunder some circumstances the entire disk may lie in the shadow. this shadowedregion will be much cooler than an unshadowed flaring disk, since its onlyheating sources are radial radiative diffusion and possible indirect sources ofirradiation. under certain special circumstances the shadowing effect cansuppress, or even completely eliminate, the 10 micron emission feature from thespectrum, which might explain the anomalous seds of some isolated herbig aestars in the sample of meeus et al. (2001). at much larger radii the diskemerges from the shadow, and continues as a flaring disk towards the outeredge. the complete model, including structure of the inner edge, shadowedregion and the flared outer part, is described in detail in this paper, and weshow examples of the general behavior of the model for varying parameters.

astro-ph;0204281	vertical structure models of t tauri and herbig ae/be disks	in this paper we present detailed models of the vertical structure(temperature and density) of passive irradiated circumstellar disks around ttauri and herbig ae/be stars. in contrast to earlier work, we use fullfrequency- and angle-dependent radiative transfer instead of the usual momentequations. we find that this improvement of the radiative transfer has stronginfluence on the resulting vertical structure of the disk, with differences intemperature as large as 70 %. however, the spectral energy distribution (sed)is only mildly affected by this change. in fact, the sed compares reasonablywell with that of improved versions of the chiang &amp; goldreich (cg) model. thisshows that the latter is a reasonable model for the sed, in spite of itssimplicity. it also shows that from the sed alone, little can be learned aboutthe vertical structure of a passive circumstellar disk. the molecular lineemission from these disks is more sensitive to the vertical temperature anddensity structure, and we show as an example how the intensity and profiles ofvarious co lines depend on the adopted disk model. the models presented in thispaper can also serve as the basis of theoretical studies of e.g. dustcoagulation and settling in disks.

astro-ph;0304437	an analysis of two-layer models for circumstellar disks	the two-layer disk models of chiang &amp; goldreich (1997, henceforth cg) and itsderivatives are popular among astronomers because of their simplicity and theclear predictions they make for the seds of t tauri stars and herbig ae/bestars. moreover, they can be computed quickly, which is a great advantage whenfitting observations using automated procedures. in this paper we wish toassess the accuracy and reliability of 2-layer models, by comparing them todetailed vertical structure models with accurate 1+1d radiative transfer. wefocus on the shape of the sed, and the predicted height and "flaring index" ofthe disk. we first consider models where scattering is set to zero. we findthat 2-layer models overestimate significantly the near-infrared flux, and wesuggest a simple way of correcting this effect, at least in part. at longerwavelengths, the sed of two-layer models often show a two-bump structure, whichis absent in 1+1d models. nevertheless, overall agreement is reasonably good,and the differences are in most cases within 30%. at (sub)-mm wavelengths thedifferences may even be less. the shape of the disk, as measured by itspressure and surface scale height and by the flaring angle are also wellreproduced by two-layer models. when scattering is included in the 1+1d models,the differences become larger, especially in the near-infrared. we suggestsimple ways to include scattering in two-layer models and discuss theirreliability. we do not compare the two-layer models to full 2-d/3-d models, sothe conclusions remain valid only within the annulus-by-annulus approximation.

astro-ph;0305451	the effect of scattering on the structure and sed of protoplanetary  disks	in this paper we investigate how the inclusion of scattering of the stellarradiation into a passive flaring disk model affects its structure and spectralenergy distribution, and whether neglecting it could significantly decrease themodel reliability. in order to address these questions we construct a detailed1+1d vertical structure model in which the scattering properties of the dustcan be varied. models are presented with and without dust scattering, and fordifferent albedos and phase functions. it is found that scattering has theeffect of reducing the disk temperature at all heights, so that the disk"shrinks", i.e., the the density at all intermediate heights decreases.however, this effect in most cases is more than compensated by the increase ofthe total extinction (absorption + scattering) cross section, so that thesurface scale height increases, and images in scattered light will see aslightly thicker disk. the integrated infrared emission decreases as the albedoincreases, because an increasing part of the flux captured by the disk isreflected away instead of absorbed and reprocessed. the reduction of theinfrared thermal emission of the disk is stronger at short wavelengths (nearinfrared) and practically negligible at millimeter wavelengths. for relativelylow albedo (alb &lt;~ 0.5), or for strongly forward-peaked scattering (g roughly&gt;0.8), the infrared flux reduction is relatively small.

astro-ph;0311624	a search for evolved dust in herbig ae stars	we present observations of six isolated, pre-main-sequence, intermediate massstars selected for shallow spectra at submillimeter wavelengths at 1.3, 2.6,7.0, and 36 millimeters from the iram pdbi and the vla. we analyze the newobservations of these stars (hd34282, hd35187, hd142666, hd143006, hd150193,hd163296) together with similar observations of three additional stars from theliterature (cq tau, ux ori, tw hya), in the context of self-consistentirradiated disk models. our aim is to constrain the wavelength dependence ofthe dust opacity and the total dust mass in the disks. the shallow wavelengthdependence of the opacity is confirmed and for a few stars extended tosignificantly longer wavelengths. for any plausible dust properties, thisrequires grain growth from interstellar sizes to maximum sizes of at least afew millimeters, and very likely to several centimeters or more. for four ofthe stars (hd34282, hd163296, cq tau, tw hya), the millimeter emission has beenspatially resolved, and the large disk radii ($&gt;100$ au) rule out that highoptical depths play a role. the mass of dust that has been processed into largegrains is substantial, and in some cases implies a disk mass comparable to themass of the central star.

astro-ph;0402614	dynamics of the circumstellar gas in the herbig ae stars bf orionis, sv  cephei, ww vulpeculae and xy persei	we present high resolution (lambda / delta_lambda = 49000) echelle spectra ofthe intermediate mass, pre-main sequence stars bf ori, sv cep, ww wul and xyper. the spectra cover the range 3800-5900 angstroms and monitor the stars ontime scales of months and days. all spectra show a large number of balmer andmetallic lines with variable blueshifted and redshifted absorption featuressuperimposed to the photospheric stellar spectra. synthetic kurucz models areused to estimate rotational velocities, effective temperatures and gravities ofthe stars. the best photospheric models are subtracted from each observedspectrum to determine the variable absorption features due to the circumstellargas; those features are characterized in terms of their velocity, v, dispersionvelocity, delta v, and residual absorption, r_max. the absorption componentsdetected in each spectrum can be grouped by their similar radial velocities andare interpreted as the signature of the dynamical evolution of gaseous clumpswith, in most cases, solar-like chemical composition. this infalling andoutflowing gas has similar properties to the circumstellar gas observed in uxori, emphasizing the need for detailed theoretical models, probably in theframework of the magnetospheric accretion scenario, to understand the complexenvironment in herbig ae (hae) stars. ww vul is unusual because, in addition toinfalling and outflowing gas with properties similar to those observed in theother stars, it shows also transient absorption features in metallic lines withno obvious counterparts in the hydrogen lines. this could, in principle,suggest the presence of cs gas clouds with enhanced metallicity around ww vul.the existence of such a metal-rich gas component, however, needs to beconfirmed by further observations and a more quantitative analysis.

astro-ph;0406106	accretion in brown dwarfs: an infrared view	this paper presents a study of the accretion properties of 19 very low massobjects (mstar .01-0.1 msun) in the regions chamaeleon i and rho-oph for 8objects we obtained high resolution halpha profiles and determined massaccretion rate macc and accretion luminosity lacc. pabeta is detected inemission in 7 of the 10 rho-oph objects, but only in one in cha i. usingobjects for which we have both a determination of lacc from halpha and a pabetadetection, we show that the correlation between the pabeta luminosity andluminosity lacc, found by muzerolle et al. (1998) for t tauri stars in taurus,extends to objects with mass approx 0.03 msun; l(pab) can be used to measurelacc also in the substellar regime. the results were less conclusive forbrgamma, which was detected only in 2 objects, neither of which had an halphaestimate of macc. using the relation between l(pab) and lacc we determined theaccretion rate for all the objects in our sample (including those with nohalpha spectrum), more than doubling the number of substellar objects withknown macc. when plotted as a function of the mass of the central objecttogether with data from the literature, our results confirm the trend of lowermacc for lower mstar, although with a large spread. some of the spread isprobably due to an age effect; our very young objects in rho-oph have onaverage an accretion rate at least one order of magnitude higher than objectsof similar mass in older regions. as a side product, we found that the width ofhalpha measured at 10% peak intensity is not only a qualitative indicator ofaccretion, but can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate of macc over alarge mass range, from t tauri stars to brown dwarfs. finally, we found thatsome of our objects show evidence of mass-loss.

astro-ph;0510350	disk and wind interaction in the young stellar object mwc 297 spatially  resolved with vlti/amber	the young stellar object mwc 297 has been observed with the vltinterferometer equipped with the amber instrument. mwc 297 has been spatiallyresolved in the continuum with a visibility of 0.50 as well as in the br gammaemission line where the visibility decrease to a lower value of 0.33. thischange in the visibility with the wavelength can be interpreted by the presenceof an optically thick disk responsible for the visibility in the continuum andof a stellar wind traced by br gamma and whose apparent size is 40% larger. wevalidate this interpretation by building a model of the stellar environmentthat combines a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk modelconsisting of gas and dust, and a latitude-dependent stellar wind outflowingabove the disk surface. the continuum emission and visibilities obtained fromthis model are fully consistent with the interferometric amber data. they agreealso with existing optical, near-infrared spectra and other broad-bandnear-infrared interferometric visibilities. a picture emerges in which mwc 297is surrounded by an equatorial flat disk that is possibly still accreting andan outflowing wind which has a much higher velocity in the polar region than atthe equator.

astro-ph;0602041	dust in proto-planetary disks: properties and evolution	we review the properties of dust in protoplanetary disks around opticallyvisible pre-main sequence stars obtained with a variety of observationaltechniques, from measurements of scattered light at visual and infraredwavelengths to mid-infrared spectroscopy and millimeter interferometry. ageneral result is that grains in disks are on average much larger than in thediffuse interstellar medium (ism). in many disks, there is evidence that alarge mass of dust is in grains with millimeter and centimeter sizes, moresimilar to "sand and pebbles" than to grains. smaller grains (withmicron-sizes) exist closer to the disk surface, which also contains muchsmaller particles, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. there is someevidence of a vertical stratification, with smaller grains closer to thesurface. another difference with ism is the higher fraction of crystallinerelative to amorphous silicates found in disk surfaces. there is a largescatter in dust properties among different sources, but no evidence ofcorrelation with the stellar properties, for samples that include objects fromintermediate to solar mass stars and brown dwarfs. there is also no apparentcorrelation with the age of the central object, over a range roughly between 1and 10 myr. this suggests a scenario where significant grain processing mayoccur very early in the disk evolution, possibly when it is accreting matterfrom the parental molecular core. further evolution may occur, but notnecessarily rapidly, since we have evidence that large amounts of grains, frommicron to centimeter size, can survive for periods as long as 10 myr.

astro-ph;0602618	accretion in the rho-oph pre-main sequence stars	the aim of this paper is to provide a measurement of the mass accretion ratein a large, complete sample of objects in the core of the star forming regionrho-oph. the sample includes most of the objects (104 out of 111) with evidenceof a circumstellar disk from mid-infrared photometry; it covers a stellar massrange from about 0.03 to 3 msun and it is complete to a limiting mass of ~0.05msun. we used j and k-band spectra to derive the mass accretion rate of eachobject from the intensity of the hydrogen recombination lines, pab or brg. forcomparison, we also obtained similar spectra of 35 diskless objects. theresults show that emission in these lines is only seen in stars with disks, andcan be used as an indicator of accretion. however, the converse does not hold,as about 50% of our disk objects do not have detectable line emission. themeasured accretion rates show a strong correlation with the mass of the centralobject (macc ~ mstar^1.8+-0.2) and a large spread, of two orders of magnitudeat least, for any interval of mstar. a comparison with existing data for taurusshows that the objects in the two regions have similar behaviour, at least forobjects more massive than ~0.1msun. the implications of these results arebriefly discussed.

astro-ph;0609032	accretion rates in herbig ae stars	accretion rates from disks around pre-main sequence stars are of importancefor our understanding of planetary formation and disk evolution. we provide inthis paper estimates of the mass accretion rates in the disks around a largesample of herbig ae stars. we obtained medium resolution 2 micron spectra andused the results to compute values of macc from the measured luminosity of thebr_gamma emission line, using a well established correlation betweenl(br_gamma) and the accretion luminosity lacc. we find that 80% of the stars,all of which have evidence of an associated circumstellar disk, are accretingmatter, with rates 3x10^{-9} &lt; macc} &lt; 10^{-6} msun/yr; for 7 objects, 6 ofwhich are located on the zams in the hr diagram, we do not detect any lineemission. few hae stars (25%) have macc&gt;10^{-7} msun/yr. in most hae stars theaccretion rate is sufficiently low that the gas in the inner disk, inside thedust evaporation radius, is optically thin and does not prevent the formationof a puffed-up rim, where dust is directly exposed to the stellar radiation.when compared to the macc values found for lower-mass stars in the star formingregions taurus and ophiuchus, hae stars have on average higher accretion ratesthan solar-mass stars; however, there is a lack of very strong accretors amongthem, probably due to the fact that they are on average older.

astro-ph;0609291	accretion in rho-ophiuchi brown dwarfs: infrared hydrogen line ratios	mass accretion rate determinations are fundamental for an understanding ofthe evolution of pre-main sequence star circumstellar disks. magnetosphericaccretion models are used to derive values of the mass accretion rates inobjects of very different properties, from brown dwarfs to intermediate-massstars; we test the validity of these models in the brown dwarf regime, wherethe stellar mass and luminosity, as well as the mass accretion rate, are muchlower than in t tauri stars. we have measured simultaneously two infraredhydrogen lines, pab and brg, in a sample of 16 objects in the star-formingregion rho-oph. the sample inc ludes 7 very low mass objects and brown dwarfsand 9 t tauri stars. brown dwarfs where both lines are detected have a ratiopab/brg of ~2. larger values, &gt;=3.5, are only found among the t tauri stars.the low line ratios in brown dwarfs indicate that the lines cannot originate inthe column of gas accreting from the disk onto the star along the magneticfield lines, and we suggest that they form instead in the shocked photosphere,heated to temperatures of ~3500 k. if so, in analogy to veiling estimates in ttauri stars, the hydrogen infrared line fluxes may provide a reliable measureof the accretion rate in brown dwarfs.

astro-ph;0703112	discovery of a bipolar outflow from 2massw j1207334-393254, a 24 jupiter  mass brown dwarf	the 24 m jupiter mass brown dwarf 2mass1207-3932 has for some time been knownto show clear signs of classical t tauri-like accretion. through analysis ofits oxygen forbidden emission we have discovered that it is driving a bipolaroutflow. blue and red-shifted components to the [oi] 6300 forbidden emissionline are seen at velocities of - 8 km/s and +4 km/s. spectro-astrometryrecovers the position of both components relative to the bd, at ~ 0.08arcseconds(in opposing directions). a position velocity diagram of the lineregion supports the spectro-astrometric results. the h-alpha and hei 6678 lineswere also analysed. these line regions are not offset with respect to thecontinuum ruling out the presence of spectro-astrometric artifacts andunderlining the validity of the [oi] 6300 results. the low radial velocity ofthe outflow, and relatively large offsets, are consistent with 2mass1207-3932having a near edge-on disk, as proposed by scholz et al. 2mass1207-3932 is nowthe smallest mass galactic object known to drive an outflow. the age of the twhydrae association (~ 8 myr) also makes this one of the oldest objects with aresolved jet. this discovery not only highlights the robustness of the outflowmechanism over an enormous range of masses but also suggests that it may evenbe feasible for young giant planets with accretion disks to drive outflows.

astro-ph;9710051	near infrared spectra of the orion bar	we have used the longsp spectrometer on the 1.5-m tirgo telescope to obtainlong slit spectra in the j, h, and k wavelength bands towards two positionsalong the orion bar. these data have been supplemented with images made usingthe arnica camera mounted on tirgo as well as with an eso ntt observationcarried out by dr a. moorwood. we detect a variety of transitions of hydrogen,helium, oi, feii, feiii, and h_2 . from our molecular hydrogen data, weconclude that densities are moderate (3-6 10^4 cm^-3) in the layer responsiblefor the molecular hydrogen emission and give no evidence for the presence ofdense neutral clumps. we also find that the molecular hydrogen bar is likely tobe tilted by ~10 degrees relative to the line of sight. we discuss the relativemerits of several models of the structure of the bar and conclude that it maybe split into two structures separated by 0.2-0.3 parsec along the line ofsight. it also seems likely to us that in both structures, density increasesalong a line perpendicular to the ionization front which penetrates into theneutral gas.  we have used the 1.317um oi line to estimate the fuv radiation field incidentat the ionization front and find values of 1-3x10^4 greater than the averageinterstellar field. from [feii] line measurements, we conclude that theelectron density in the ionized layer associated with the ionization front isof order 10^4 cm^-3. finally, our analysis of the helium and hydrogenrecombination lines implies essential coincidence of the helium and hydrogenstromgren spheres.

astro-ph;9811210	the onset of cluster formation around herbig ae/be stars	the large body of near infrared observations presented in testi et al. (1997;1998) are analysed with the aim of characterizing the young stellar clusterssurrounding herbig ae/be stars. the results confirm the tendency of early bestars to be surrounded by dense clusters of lower mass "companions", while aestars are never found to be associated with conspicuous groups. the transitionbetween the different environments appears to occur smoothly from ae to bestars without a sharp threshold.  no correlation of the richness of the stellar groups detected is found withthe galactic position or the age of the central herbig ae/be star.  the stellar volume densities estimated for the groups surroundingpre-main-sequence stars of intermediate mass show the transition from the lowdensity aggregates of t tauri stars and the dense clusters around massivestars.  only the most massive stars (10-20msun) are found to be associated with dense(10^3 pc^-3) stellar clusters. this is exactly the mass regime at which theconventional accretion scenario for isolated star formation faces theoreticalproblems. thus our findings strongly supports the idea that the formation ofhigh-mass stars is influenced by dynamical interaction in a young clusterenvironment.
