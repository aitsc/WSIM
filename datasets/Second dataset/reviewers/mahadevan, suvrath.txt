0909.2259	direct detection of planets orbiting large angular diameter stars:  sensitivity of an internally-occulting space-based coronagraph	high-contrast imaging observations of large angular diameter stars enablecomplementary science questions to be addressed compared to the baseline goalsof proposed missions like the terrestrial planet finder-coronagraph, newworld's observer, and others. such targets however present a practical problemin that finite stellar size results in unwanted starlight reaching thedetector, which degrades contrast. in this paper, we quantify the sensitivity,in terms of contrast, of an internally-occulting, space-based coronagraph as afunction of stellar angular diameter, from unresolved dwarfs to the largestevolved stars. our calculations show that an assortment of band-limited imagemasks can accommodate a diverse set of observations to help maximize missionscientific return. we discuss two applications based on the results: thespectro-photometric study of planets already discovered with the radialvelocity technique to orbit evolved stars, which we elucidate with the exampleof pollux b, and the direct detection of planets orbiting our closest neighbor,alpha centauri, whose primary component is on the main-sequence but subtends anappreciable angle on the sky. it is recommended that similar trade studies beperformed with other promising internal, external, and hybrid occulter designsfor comparison, as there is relevance to a host of interesting topics inplanetary science and related fields.

1005.5564	theory of dispersed fixed-delay interferometry for radial velocity  exoplanet searches	the dispersed fixed-delay interferometer (dfdi) represents a new instrumentconcept for high-precision radial velocity (rv) surveys for extrasolar planets.a combination of michelson interferometer and medium-resolution spectrograph,it has the potential for performing multi-object surveys, where most previousrv techniques have been limited to observing only one target at a time. becauseof the large sample of extrasolar planets needed to better understand planetaryformation, evolution, and prevalence, this new technique represents a logicalnext step in instrumentation for rv extrasolar planet searches, and has beenproven with the single-object exoplanet tracker (et) at kitt peak nationalobservatory, and the multi-object w. m. keck/marvels exoplanet tracker atapache point observatory. the development of the et instruments hasnecessitated fleshing out a detailed understanding of the physical principlesof the dfdi technique. here we summarize the fundamental theoretical materialneeded to understand the technique and provide an overview of the physicsunderlying the instrument's working. we also derive some useful analyticalformulae that can be used to estimate the level of various sources of errorgeneric to the technique, such as photon shot noise when using a fiducialreference spectrum, contamination by secondary spectra (e.g., crowded sources,spectroscopic binaries, or moonlight contamination), residual interferometercomb, and reference cross-talk error. following this, we show that the use of atraditional gas absorption fiducial reference with a dfdi can incur significantsystematic errors that must be taken into account at the precision levelsrequired to detect extrasolar planets.

1006.1627	discovery of a low-mass companion to a metal-rich f star with the  marvels pilot project	we report the discovery of a low-mass companion orbiting the metal-rich, mainsequence f star tyc 2949-00557-1 during the marvels (multi-object apo radialvelocity exoplanet large-area survey) pilot project. the host star has aneffective temperature t_eff = 6135 +/- 40 k, log(g) = 4.4 +/- 0.1 and [fe/h] =0.32 +/- 0.01, indicating a mass of m = 1.25 +/- 0.09 m_\odot and r = 1.15 +/-0.15 r_\odot. the companion has an orbital period of 5.69449 +/- 0.00023 daysand straddles the hydrogen burning limit with a minimum mass of 64 m_j, and maythus be an example of the rare class of brown dwarfs orbiting at distancescomparable to those of "hot jupiters." we present relative photometry thatdemonstrates the host star is photometrically stable at the few millimagnitudelevel on time scales of hours to years, and rules out transits for a companionof radius greater than 0.8 r_j at the 95% confidence level. tidal analysis ofthe system suggests that the star and companion are likely in a doublesynchronous state where both rotational and orbital synchronization have beenachieved. this is the first low-mass companion detected with a multi-object,dispersed, fixed-delay interferometer.

1109.5166	a search for the transit of hd 168443b: improved orbital parameters and  photometry	the discovery of transiting planets around bright stars holds the potentialto greatly enhance our understanding of planetary atmospheres. in this work wepresent the search for transits of hd 168443b, a massive planet orbiting thebright star hd 168443 v=6.92 with a period of 58.11 days. the high eccentricityof the planetary orbit e=0.53 significantly enhances the a-priori transitprobability beyond that expected for a circular orbit, making hd 168443 acandidate for our ongoing transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey(terms). using additional radial velocities from keck-hires, we refined theorbital parameters of this multi-planet system and derived a new transitephemeris for hd 168443b. the reduced uncertainties in the transit window makea photometric transit search practicable. photometric observations acquiredduring predicted transit windows were obtained on three nights. ctio 1.0 mphotometry acquired on 2010 september 7 had the required precision to detect atransit but fell just outside of our final transit window. nightly photometryfrom the t8 0.8 m automated photometric telescope (apt) at fairbornobservatory, acquired over a span of 109 nights, demonstrates that hd 168443 isconstant on a time scale of weeks. higher-cadence photometry on 2011 april 28and june 25 shows no evidence of a transit. we are able to rule out anon-grazing transit of hd 168443b.

(2011), which isderived from high-resolution fourier transform spectrometer measurements. thesetwo independent calibrations allowed us to easily identify emission lines inthe hollow cathode lamp that do not correspond to known (classified) lines ofeither uranium or neon, and to compare the achievable precision of each source.our frequency comb precision was limited by modal noise and detector effects,while the u/ne precision was limited primarily by the signal-to-noise ratio(s/n) of the observed emission lines and our ability to model blended lines.the standard deviation in the dispersion solution residuals from thes/n-limited u/ne hollow cathode lamp were 50% larger than the standarddeviation of the dispersion solution residuals from the modal-noise-limitedlaser frequency comb. we advocate the use of u/ne lamps for precisioncalibration of near-infrared spectrographs, and this h-band atlas makes theselamps significantly easier to use for wavelength calibration.

1210.4736	the metallicity of the cm draconis system	the cm draconis system comprises two eclipsing mid-m dwarfs of nearly equalmass in a 1.27-day orbit. this well-studied eclipsing binary has often beenused for benchmark tests of stellar models, since its components are amongstthe lowest mass stars with well-measured masses and radii (~ 1% relativeprecision). however, as with many other low-mass stars, non-magnetic modelshave been unable to match the observed radii and effective temperatures for cmdra at the 5-10% level. to date, the uncertain metallicity of the system hascomplicated comparison of theoretical isochrones with observations. in thisletter, we use data from the spex instrument on the nasa infrared telescopefacility (irtf) to measure the metallicity of the system during primary andsecondary eclipses, as well as out of eclipse, based on an empiricalmetallicity calibration in the h and k near-infrared (nir) bands. we derive a[fe/h] = -0.30 +- 0.12 that is consistent across all orbital phases. thedetermination of [fe/h] for this system constrains a key dimension of parameterspace when attempting to reconcile model isochrone predictions andobservations.

1301.6674	habitable zones around main-sequence stars: new estimates	identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (hzs) of other starsis one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity and transit exoplanetsurveys and proposed future space missions. most current estimates of theboundaries of the hz are based on 1-d, cloud-free, climate model calculationsby kasting et al.(1993). the inner edge of the hz in kasting et al.(1993) modelwas determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by themaximum greenhouse provided by a co2 atmosphere. a conservative estimate forthe width of the hz from this model in our solar system is 0.95-1.67 au.  here, an updated 1-d radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is usedto obtain new estimates for hz widths around f, g, k and m stars. new h2o andco2 absorption coefficients, derived from the hitran 2008 and hitemp 2010line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model.according to the new model, the water loss (inner hz) and maximum greenhouse(outer hz) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 au and 1.70 au,respectively, suggesting that the present earth lies near the inner edge.additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperaturesbetween 2600 k and 7200 k, and the results are presented in parametric form,making them easy to apply to actual stars. the new model indicates that, nearthe inner edge of the hz, there is no clear distinction between runawaygreenhouse and water loss limits for stars with t_{eff} ~&lt; 5000 k which hasimplications for ongoing planet searches around k and m stars. to assess thepotential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose usingstellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. ourmodel does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual hzboundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.

1306.3157	a cautionary tale: marvels brown dwarf candidate reveals itself to be a  very long period, highly eccentric spectroscopic stellar binary	we report the discovery of a highly eccentric, double-lined spectroscopicbinary star system (tyc 3010-1494-1), comprising two solar-type stars that wehad initially identified as a single star with a brown dwarf companion. at themoderate resolving power of the marvels spectrograph and the spectrographs usedfor subsequent radial-velocity (rv) measurements (r ~ &lt;30,000), this particularstellar binary mimics a single-lined binary with an rv signal that would beinduced by a brown dwarf companion (msin(i)~50 m_jup) to a solar-type primary.at least three properties of this system allow it to masquerade as a singlestar with a very low-mass companion: its large eccentricity (e~0.8), itsrelatively long period (p~238 days), and the approximately perpendicularorientation of the semi-major axis with respect to the line of sight (omega~189degrees). as a result of these properties, for ~95% of the orbit the two setsof stellar spectral lines are completely blended, and the rv measurements basedon centroiding on the apparently single-lined spectrum is very well fit by anorbit solution indicative of a brown dwarf companion on a more circular orbit(e~0.3). only during the ~5% of the orbit near periastron passage does thetrue, double-lined nature and large rv amplitude of ~15 km/s reveal itself. thediscovery of this binary system is an important lesson for rv surveys searchingfor substellar companions; at a given resolution and observing cadence, asurvey will be susceptible to these kinds of astrophysical false positives fora range of orbital parameters. finally, for surveys like marvels that lack theresolution for a useful line bisector analysis, it is imperative to monitor thepeak of the cross-correlation function for suspicious changes in width orshape, so that such false positives can be flagged during the candidate vettingprocess.

1403.1577	suppression of fiber modal noise induced radial velocity errors for  bright emission-line calibration sources	modal noise in optical fibers imposes limits on the signal to noise andvelocity precision achievable with the next generation of astronomicalspectrographs. this is an increasingly pressing problem for precision radialvelocity (rv) spectrographs in the near-infrared (nir) and optical that requireboth high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise.many of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission linecalibration sources like laser frequency combs and fabry-perot etalons toachieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. these highprecision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherentsources. coupling light from single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads toonly a very low number of modes being excited, thereby exacerbating the modalnoise measured by the spectrograph. we present a commercial off-the-shelf(cots) solution that significantly mitigates modal noise at all optical and nirwavelengths, and which can be applied to spectrograph calibration systems. oursolution uses an integrating sphere in conjunction with a diffuser that ismoved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally superior tomost tested forms of mechanical fiber agitation. we demonstrate a high level ofmodal noise reduction with a narrow bandwidth 1550 nm laser. our relativelyinexpensive solution immediately enables spectrographs to take advantage of theinnate precision of bright state-of-the art calibration sources by removing amajor source of systematic noise.

1502.05035	the apogee spectroscopic survey of kepler planet hosts: feasibility,  efficiency, and first results	the kepler mission has yielded a large number of planet candidates from amongthe kepler objects of interest (kois), but spectroscopic follow-up of theserelatively faint stars is a serious bottleneck in confirming and characterizingthese systems. we present motivation and survey design for an ongoing projectwith the sdss-iii multiplexed apogee near-infrared spectrograph to monitorhundreds of koi host stars. we report some of our first results usingrepresentative targets from our sample, which include current planet candidatesthat we find to be false positives, as well as candidates listed as falsepositives that we do not find to be spectroscopic binaries. with this survey,koi hosts are observed over ~20 epochs at a radial velocity precision of100-200 m/s. these observations can easily identify a majority of falsepositives caused by physically-associated stellar or substellar binaries, andin many cases, fully characterize their orbits. we demonstrate that apogee iscapable of achieving rv precision at the 100-200 m/s level over long timebaselines, and that apogee's multiplexing capability makes it substantiallymore efficient at identifying false positives due to binaries than othersingle-object spectrographs working to confirm kois as planets. these apogeervs enable ancillary science projects, such as studies of fundamental stellarastrophysics or intrinsically rare substellar companions. the coadded apogeespectra can be used to derive stellar properties (t_eff, log(g)) and chemicalabundances of over a dozen elements to probe correlations of planet propertieswith individual elemental abundances.

1503.01776	m dwarf luminosity, radius, and $\alpha$-enrichment from $i$-band  spectral features	despite the ubiquity of m dwarfs and their growing importance to studies ofexoplanets, galactic evolution, and stellar structure, methods for preciselymeasuring their fundamental stellar properties remain elusive. existingtechniques for measuring m dwarf luminosity, mass, radius, or composition arecalibrated over a limited range of stellar parameters or require expensiveobservations. we find a strong correlation between the $k_s$-band luminosity($m_k$), the observed strength of the $i$-band sodium doublet absorptionfeature, and [fe/h] in m dwarfs without strong h$\alpha$ emission. we show thatthe strength of this feature, coupled with [fe/h] and spectral type, can beused to derive m dwarf $m_k$ and radius without requiring parallax.additionally, we find promising evidence that the strengths of the $i$-bandsodium doublet and the nearby $i$-band calcium triplet may jointly indicate$\alpha$-element enrichment. the use of these $i$-band features requires onlymoderate-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy to provide valuable informationabout the potential habitability of exoplanets around m dwarfs, and surfacegravity and distance for m dwarfs throughout the galaxy. this technique hasimmediate applicability for both target selection and candidate planet hostsystem characterization for exoplanet missions such as \textit{tess} and\textit{k2}.

1505.04708	target selection for the sdss-iii marvels survey	we present the target selection process for the multi-object apo radialvelocity exoplanets large-area survey (marvels), which is part of the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) iii. marvels is a medium-resolution ($r \sim 11000$)multi-fiber spectrograph capable of obtaining radial velocities for 60 objectsat a time in order to find brown dwarfs and giant planets. the survey wasconfigured to target dwarf stars with effective temperatures approximatelybetween $4500$ and $6250 \, \mbox{k}$. for the first 2 years marvels relied onlow-resolution spectroscopic pre-observations to estimate the effectivetemperature and $\log(g)$ for candidate stars and then selected suitable dwarfstars from this pool. ultimately, the pre-observation spectra provedineffective at filtering out giant stars; many giants were incorrectlyclassified as dwarfs, resulting in a giant contamination rate of $\sim$30\% forthe first phase of the marvels survey. thereafter, the survey instead applied areduced proper motion cut to eliminate giants and used the infrared flux methodto estimate effective temperatures, using only extant photometric andproper-motion catalog information. the target selection method introduced heremay be useful for other surveys that need to rely on extant catalog data forselection of specific stellar populations.

1505.07463	an efficient, compact, and versatile fiber double scrambler for high  precision radial velocity instruments	we present the design and test results of a compact optical fiberdouble-scrambler for high-resolution doppler radial velocity instruments. thisdevice consists of a single optic: a high-index $n$$\sim$2 ball lens thatexchanges the near and far fields between two fibers. when used in conjunctionwith octagonal fibers, this device yields very high scrambling gains andgreatly desensitizes the fiber output from any input illumination variations,thereby stabilizing the instrument profile of the spectrograph and improvingthe doppler measurement precision. the system is also highly insensitive toinput pupil variations, isolating the spectrograph from telescope illuminationvariations and seeing changes. by selecting the appropriate glass and lensdiameter the highest efficiency is achieved when the fibers are practically incontact with the lens surface, greatly simplifying the alignment process whencompared to classical double-scrambler systems. this prototype double-scramblerhas demonstrated significant performance gains over previous systems, achievingscrambling gains in excess of 10,000 with a throughput of $\sim$87% usinguncoated polymicro octagonal fibers. adding a circular fiber to the fiber trainfurther increases the scrambling gain to $&gt;$20,000, limited by laboratorymeasurement error. while this fiber system is designed for the habitable-zoneplanet finder spectrograph, it is more generally applicable to otherinstruments in the visible and near-infrared. given the simplicity and lowcost, this fiber scrambler could also easily be multiplexed for largemulti-object instruments.

1509.01565	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 886 nearby m dwarfs	we present a catalog of near-infrared (nir) spectra and associatedmeasurements for 886 nearby m dwarfs. the spectra were obtained with thenasa-infrared telescope facility spex spectrograph during a two-year observingcampaign; they have high signal-to-noise ratios (snr $&gt;100-150$), span 0.8-2.4$\mu$m and have $r\sim2000$. our catalog of measured values contains usefult$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and composition-sensitive features, empirical stellarparameter measurements, and kinematic, photometric, and astrometric propertiescompiled from the literature. we focus on measures of m dwarf abundances([fe/h] and [m/h]), capitalizing on the precision of recently publishedempirical nir spectroscopic calibrations. we explore systematic differencesbetween different abundance calibrations, and to other similar m dwarfcatalogs. we confirm that the m dwarf abundances we measure show the expectedinverse dependence with kinematic, activity, and color-based age indicators.finally, we provide updated [fe/h] and [m/h] for 16 m dwarf planet hosts. thiscatalog represents the largest published compilation of nir spectra andassociated parameters for m dwarfs. it provides a rich and uniform resource forthe nearby m dwarfs, and will be especially valuable for measuring habitablezone locations and comparative abundances of the m dwarf planet hosts that willbe uncovered by upcoming exoplanet surveys.

1511.02856	'modal-noise' in single-mode fibers: a cautionary note for high  precision radial velocity instruments	exploring the use of single-mode fibers (smfs) in high precision dopplerspectrometers has become increasingly attractive since the advent ofdiffraction-limited adaptive optics systems on large-aperture telescopes.spectrometers fed with these fibers can be made significantly smaller thantypical 'seeing-limited' instruments, greatly reducing cost and overallcomplexity. importantly, classical mode interference and speckle issuesassociated with multi-mode fibers, also known as 'modal noise', are mitigatedwhen using smfs, which also provide perfect radial and azimuthal imagescrambling. however, these fibers do support multiple polarization modes, anissue that is generally ignored for larger-core fibers given the large numberof propagation modes. since diffraction gratings used in most high resolutionastronomical instruments have dispersive properties that are sensitive toincident polarization changes, any birefringence variations in the fiber cancause variations in the efficiency profile, degrading illumination stability.here we present a cautionary note outlining how the polarization properties ofsmfs can affect the radial velocity measurement precision of high resolutionspectrographs. this work is immediately relevant to the rapidly expanding fieldof diffraction-limited, extreme precision rv spectrographs that are currentlybeing designed and built by a number of groups.

astro-ph;0212250	all sky doppler extrasolar planet surveys with a multi-object dispersed  fixed-delay interferometer	we propose to use a high throughput and high precision multi-object dispersedfixed-delay interferometer for all sky doppler surveys for extrasolar planets.  this instrument, a combination of a fixed-delay interferometer with amoderate resolution spectrometer,is completely different from current echellespectrometers. doppler rv is measured through monitoring interference fringeshifts of stellar absorption lines over a broad band. coupling thismulti-object instrument with a wide field telescope (a few degree, such assloan and wiyn) and uv, visible and near-ir detectors will allow tosimultaneously obtain hundreds of stellar fringing spectra for searching forplanets. the rv survey speed can be increased by more than 2 orders ofmagnitude over that for the echelles.  a prototype dispersed fixed-delay interferometer has been observed at thehobby-eberly 9m and palomar 5m telescopes in 2001 and demonstrated photo noiselimited doppler precision with aldebaran. our recent observations at the kpno2.1m telescope in 2002 demonstrate a short term doppler precision of ~ 3 m/swith eta cas (v = 3.5), a rv stable star and also obtained a rv curve for 51peg. (v = 5.5), confirming previous planet detection with an independent rvtechnique. the total measured detection efficiency including the sky, telescopeand fiber transmission losses, the instrument and iodine transmission lossesand detector quantum efficiency is 3.4% under 1.5 arcsec seeing conditions,which is comparable to all of the echelle spectrometers for planet detection.
