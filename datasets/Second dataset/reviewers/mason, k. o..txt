1004.2448	paper ii: calibration of the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope	the ultraviolet/optical telescope (uvot) is one of three instruments onboardthe swift observatory. the photometric calibration has been published, and thispaper follows up with details on other aspects of the calibration including ameasurement of the point spread function with an assessment of the orbitalvariation and the effect on photometry. a correction for large scale variationsin sensitivity over the field of view is described, as well as a model of thecoincidence loss which is used to assess the coincidence correction in extendedregions. we have provided a correction for the detector distortion and measuredthe resulting internal astrometric accuracy of the uvot, also giving theabsolute accuracy with respect to the international celestial reference system.we have compiled statistics on the background count rates, and discuss thesources of the background, including instrumental scattered light. in each casewe describe any impact on uvot measurements, whether any correction is appliedin the standard pipeline data processing or whether further steps arerecommended.

0710.0402	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey v. optical identification of the  xmm-newton medium sensitivity survey (xms)	we present the xmm-newton medium sensitivity survey (xms), including a totalof 318 x-ray sources found among the serendipitous content of 25 xmm-newtontarget fields. the xms comprises four largely overlapping source samplesselected at soft (0.5-2 kev), intermediate (0.5-4.5 kev), hard (2-10 kev) andultra-hard (4.5-7.5 kev) bands, the first three of them being flux-limited. wereport on the optical identification of the xms samples, complete to 85-95%. atthe intermediate flux levels sampled by the xms we find that the x-ray sky islargely dominated by active galactic nuclei. the fraction of stars in softx-ray selected samples is below 10%, and only a few per cent for hard selectedsamples. we find that the fraction of optically obscured objects in the agnpopulation stays constant at around 15-20% for soft and intermediate bandselected x-ray sources, over 2 decades of flux. the fraction of obscuredobjects amongst the agn population is larger (~35-45%) in the hard orultra-hard selected samples, and constant across a similarly wide flux range.the distribution in x-ray-to-optical flux ratio is a strong function of theselection band, with a larger fraction of sources with high values in hardselected samples. sources with x-ray-to-optical flux ratios in excess of 10 aredominated by obscured agn, but with a significant contribution from unobscuredagn.

1207.5182	the xmm-newton serendipitous ultraviolet source survey catalogue	the xmm-newton serendipitous ultraviolet source survey (xmm-suss) is acatalogue of ultraviolet (uv) sources detected serendipitously by the opticalmonitor (xmm-om) on-board the xmm-newton observatory. the catalogue containsultraviolet-detected sources collected from 2,417 xmm-om observations in 1-6broad band uv and optical filters, made between 24 february 2000 and 29 march2007. the primary contents of the catalogue are source positions, magnitudesand fluxes in 1 to 6 passbands, and these are accompanied by profilediagnostics and variability statistics. the xmm-suss is populated by 753,578 uvsource detections above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold limit which relateto 624,049 unique objects. taking account of substantial overlaps betweenobservations, the net sky area covered is 29-54 square degrees, depending on uvfilter. the magnitude distributions peak at 20.2, 20.9 and 21.2 in uvw2, uvm2and uvw1 respectively. more than 10 per cent of sources have been visited morethan once using the same filter during xmm-newton operation, and &gt; 20 per centof sources are observed more than once per filter during an individual visit.consequently, the scope for science based on temporal source variability ontimescales of hours to years is broad. by comparison with other astrophysicalcatalogues we test the accuracy of the source measurements and define thenature of the serendipitous uv xmm-om source sample. the distributions ofsource colours in the uv and optical filters are shown together with theexpected loci of stars and galaxies, and indicate that sources which aredetected in multiple uv bands are predominantly star-forming galaxies and starsof type g or earlier.

1501.02433	the swift-uvot ultraviolet and visible grism calibration	we present the calibration of the swift uvot grisms, of which there are two,providing low-resolution field spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and opticalbands respectively. the uv grism covers the range 1700-5000 angstrom with aspectral resolution of 75 at 2600 angstrom for source magnitudes of u=10-16mag, while the visible grism covers the range 2850-6600 angstrom with aspectral resolution of 100 at 4000 angstrom for source magnitudes of b=12-17mag. this calibration extends over all detector positions, for all modes usedduring operations. the wavelength accuracy (1-sigma) is 9 angstrom in the uvgrism clocked mode, 17 angstrom in the uv grism nominal mode and 22 angstrom inthe visible grism. the range below 2740 angstrom in the uv grism and 5200angstrom in the visible grism never suffers from overlapping by higher spectralorders. the flux calibration of the grisms includes a correction we developedfor coincidence loss in the detector. the error in the coincidence losscorrection is less than 20%. the position of the spectrum on the detector onlyaffects the effective area (sensitivity) by a few percent in the nominal modes,but varies substantially in the clocked modes. the error in the effective areais from 9% in the uv grism clocked mode to 15% in the visible grism clockedmode .

astro-ph;0010483	starburst activity in a rosat narrow emission-line galaxy	we present multiwaveband photometric and optical spectropolarimetricobservations of the r=15.9 narrow emission line galaxy r117_a which lies on theedge of the error circle of the rosat x-ray source r117 (from mchardy et al1998). the overall spectral energy distribution of the galaxy is well modelledby a combination of a normal spiral galaxy and a moderate-strength burst ofstar formation. the far infra-red and radio emission is extended along themajor axis of the galaxy, indicating an extended starburst.  on positional grounds, the galaxy is a good candidate for the identificationof r117 and the observed x-ray flux is very close to what would be expectedfrom a starburst of the observed far infra-red and radio fluxes. although anobscured high redshift qso cannot be entirely ruled out as contributing somefraction of the x-ray flux, we find no candidates to k=20.8 within the x-rayerrorbox and so conclude that r117_a is responsible for a large fraction, ifnot all, of the x-ray emission from r117.  searches for indicators of an obscured agn in r117_a have so far provennegative; deep spectropolarimetric observations show no signs of broad lines toa limit of one per cent and, for the observed far infra-red and radio emission,we would expect a ten times greater x-ray flux if the overall emission werepowered by an agn. we therefore conclude that the x-ray emission from r117 isdominated by starburst emission from the galaxy r117_a.

astro-ph;0011242	the variable xmm-newton spectrum of markarian 766	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 766 was observed for 60 ks withthe xmm-newton observatory. the source shows a complex x-ray spectrum. the 2-10kev spectrum can be adequately represented by a power law and broad fe kaemission. between 0.7 and 2 kev the spectrum is harder and exhibits a fluxdeficit with respect to the extrapolated medium energy slope. below 0.7 kev,however, there is a strong excess of emission. the rgs spectrum shows anedge-like feature at 0.7 kev; the energy of this feature is inconsistent withthat expected for an ovii edge from a warm absorber. markarian 766 varies by afactor of ~ 2 in overall count rate in the epic and rgs instruments on atimescale of a few thousand seconds, while no significant flux changes areobserved in the ultraviolet with the om. the x-ray variability is spectrallydependent with the largest amplitude variability occurring in the 0.4-2 kevband. the spectral variability can be explained by a change in flux and slopeof the medium energy continuum emission, superimposed on a less variable (orconstant) low energy emission component.

astro-ph;0011244	the central region of m31 observed with xmm-newton (i. group properties  and diffuse emission)	we present the results of a study based on an xmm-newton performanceverification observation of the central 30 arcmin of the nearby spiral galaxym31. in the 34-ks european photon imaging camera (epic) exposure, we detect 116sources down to a limiting luminosity of 6 x 10^35 erg/s (0.3--12 kev, d = 760kpc). the luminosity distribution of the sources detected with xmm-newtonflattens at luminosities below ~ 2.5 x 10^37 erg/s. we make use of hardnessratios for the detected sources in order to distinguish between classes ofobjects such as super-soft sources and intrinsically hard or highly absorbedsources. we demonstrate that the spectrum of the unresolved emission in thebulge of m31 contains a soft excess which can be fitted with a ~ 0.35-kevoptically-thin thermal-plasma component clearly distinct from the compositepoint-source spectrum. we suggest that this may represent diffuse gas in thecentre of m31, and we illustrate its extent in a wavelet-deconvolved image.

astro-ph;0204075	the signature of supernova ejecta measured in the x-ray afterglow of  gamma-ray burst 011211	since their identification with cosmological distances, gamma-ray bursts(grbs) have been recognised as the most energetic phenomena in the universe,with an isotropic burst energy as high as 10^54 ergs. however, the progenitorsresponsible for the bursts remain elusive, favoured models ranging from aneutron star binary merger, to the collapse of a massive star. crucial to ourunderstanding of the origins of grbs is the study of the afterglow emission,where spectroscopy can reveal details of the environment of the burst. here wereport on an xmm-newton observation of the x-ray afterglow of grb 011211. thex-ray spectrum reveals evidence for emission lines of magnesium, silicon,sulphur, argon, calcium, and possibly nickel, arising in enriched material withan outflow velocity of order 0.1c. this is the first direct measurement ofoutflowing matter in a gamma ray burst. the observations strongly favour modelswhere a supernova explosion from a massive stellar progenitor precedes theburst event and is responsible for the outflowing matter.

0808.2414	properties of x-ray selected broad absorption line quasars	broad absorption line quasars (commonly termed balqsos) contain the mostdramatic examples of agn-driven winds. the high absorbing columns in thesewinds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that balqsos are generally x-ray faint. this highx-ray absorption means that almost all balqsos have been discovered throughoptical surveys, and so what little we know about their x-ray properties isderived from very bright optically-selected sources. a small number of x-rayselected balqsos (xbalqsos) have, however, recently been found in deep x-raysurvey fields. in this paper we investigate the x-ray and rest-frame uvproperties of five xbalqsos for which we have obtained xmm-newton epic x-rayspectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. we find that, although thexbalqsos have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal qsos, their medianalpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample ofoptically selected balqsos (obalqsos). we rule out the possibility that thehigher x-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. wefind that the amount of x-ray and uv absorption due to the wind in xbalqsos issimilar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption inobalqsos, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption.we conclude that these xbalqsos have intrinsically higher x-ray to optical fluxratios than the obalqso sample with which we compare them.

astro-ph;0209145	the x-ray spectrum of the seyfert i galaxy mrk 766: dusty warm absorber  or relativistic emission lines?	competing models for broad spectral features in the soft x-ray spectrum ofthe seyfert i galaxy mrk766 are tested against data from a 130 ks xmm-newtonobservation. a model including relativistically broadened ly-alpha emissionlines of oviii, nvii and cvi is a better fit to 0.3-2 kev xmm rgs data than adusty warm absorber. moreover, the measured depth of neutral iron absorptionlines in the spectrum is inconsistent with the magnitude of the iron edgerequired to produce the continuum break at 17-18angstroms in the dusty warmabsorber model. the relativistic emission line model can reproduce thebroad-band (0.1-12 kev) xmm-epic data with the addition of a fourth line torepresent emission from ionized iron at 6.7 kev and an excess due to reflectionat energies above the iron line. the profile of the 6.7 kev iron line isconsistent with that measured for the low energy lines. there is evidence inthe rgs data at the 3sigma level for spectral features that vary with sourceflux. the covering fraction of warm absorber gas is estimated to be ~12%. ironin the warm absorber is found to be overabundant with respect to cno comparedto solar values.

astro-ph;0301027	x-ray emission line gas in the liner galaxy m81	we present the soft x-ray spectrum of the liner galaxy m81 derived from along observation with the xmm rgs. the spectrum is dominated by continuumemission from the active nucleus, but also contains emission lines from fe l,and h-like and he-like n, o, and ne. the emission lines are significantlybroader than the rgs point-source spectral resolution; in the cross dispersiondirection the emission lines are detected adjacent to, as well as coincidentwith, the active nucleus. this implies that they originate in a region of a fewarc-minutes spatial extent (1 arc-minute ~ 1 kpc in m81). the flux ratios ofthe ovii triplet suggest that collisional processes are responsible for theline emission. a good fit to the whole rgs spectrum is obtained using a modelconsisting of an absorbed power law from the active nucleus and a 3 temperatureoptically thin thermal plasma. two of the thermal plasma components havetemperatures of 0.18+-0.04 kev and 0.64+-0.04 kev, characteristic of the hotinterstellar medium produced by supernovae; the combined luminosity of theplasma at these two temperatures accounts for all the unresolved bulge x-rayemission seen in the chandra observation by tennant et al. (2001). the thirdcomponent has a higher temperature (~1.7 kev), and we argue that this, alongwith some of the 0.64 kev emission, comes from x-ray binaries in the bulge ofm81.

astro-ph;0302553	a medium deep chandra and subaru survey of the 13hr xmm/rosat deep  survey area	we present the results of a chandra acis-i survey of a high latitude regionat 13h +38 which was earlier observed with rosat (mchardy et al. 1998) andwhich has recently been observed by xmm-newton for 200ksec. xmm-newton willprovide good quality x-ray spectra for over 200 sources with fluxes around theknee of the logn/logs, which are responsible for the bulk of the x-raybackground (xrb). the main aim of the chandra observations is to providearcsecond, or better, positions, and hence reliable identifications, for thexmm-newton sources. the acis-i observations were arranged in a mosaic of four30ksec pointings, covering almost all of the 15' radius xmm-newton/rosat field.we detect 214 chandra sources above 5 sigma significance, to a limiting flux of\~1.3e-15 erg/cm2/s (0.5-7 kev). optical counterparts are derived from a subarusuprimecam image reaching to r~27. the very large majority of the chandrasources have an optical counterpart, with the distribution peaking at 23&lt;r&lt;24,although 14 have no counterpart to r=27. the fraction of x-ray sources with noidentification brighter than r=27 is similar to that found in deeper chandrasurveys. the majority of the identifications are with galaxies. as found inother chandra surveys, there is a very wide range of optical magnitude forgiven x-ray flux, implying a range of emission mechanisms, and many sourceshave high l_x/l_opt ratios, implying absorption at moderate redshift.comparison with the earlier rosat survey shows that the accuracy of the rosatpositions agrees very well with the predictions from simulations in mchardy etal. (1998) and that the large majority of the identifications were correct(abridged).

astro-ph;0307419	xmm-newton rgs spectroscopy of lmc x-3	we present soft x-ray spectroscopy of the black hole binary lmc x-3 from thexmm-newton reflection grating spectrometer. the observations span the fullrange of spectral states seen in lmc x-3. the spectra are completely dominatedby continuum emission, and the neutral absorbing column measured from the o iedge (nh = 3.8 +0.8 -0.7 10^20 cm^-2) is consistent with the galacticinterstellar column density towards lmc x-3. we find no evidence forvariability of the neutral absorbing column. we also constrain the ionizedcolumn density using the upper limits to the equivalent width of the o ii - oviii k-shell resonance lines: we find that the equivalent hydrogen columndensity of gas in which o is partially ionized is &lt; 8 10^20 cm^-2. from thisupper limit we can rule out a line driven stellar wind as the power source forthe x-ray emission of lmc x-3 except when it is faint. at wavelengths longwardof the peak emission the spectral shape is well described by amulti-temperature disk-blackbody spectrum; the powerlaw component whichdominates at shorter wavelengths does not continue longward of thedisk-blackbody peak. this implies that the multi-temperature disk-blackbodycomponent supplies the seed photons which are compton upscattered in the hotcorona, consistent with the standard paradigm for black hole x-ray binaryspectral states.

astro-ph;0310701	complex x-ray spectral behaviour of ngc 4051 in the low flux state	the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 was observed in one of itsprolonged low-lux states by xmm-newton in november 2002. here we present theresults of an analysis of epic-pn data obtained during the observation. withinthe low state, the source shows complex spectral variability which cannoteasily be explained by any simple model. however, by making a `flux-flux' plotwhich combines the low state data with data obtained during a normal fluxstate, we demonstrate that the extremely hard spectrum observed above 2 kevresults from a continuation of the spectral variability seen in the normalstate, which is caused by spectral pivoting of the power-law continuum. thepivoting power-law appears to be attached to a comptonised thermal component ofvariable flux (blackbody temperature kt~0.1 kev, consistent with the smallblack hole mass in ngc 4051) which dominates the soft x-ray band in the lowstate, and is probably the source of seed photons for comptonisation.additional constant thermal and reflection components, together with absorptionby ionised gas, seem to be required to complete the picture and explain thecomplex x-ray spectral variability seen in the low state of ngc 4051.

astro-ph;0407523	xmm-newton observations of the eclipsing polar ep dra	we present xmm-newton observations of the eclipsing polar ep dra which covernearly 3 binary orbital cycles. the x-ray and uv data show evidence for aprominent dip before the eclipse which is due to the accretion stream obscuringthe accretion region. the dip ingress is rapid in hard x-rays suggesting thereis a highly collimated core of absorption. we find that a different level ofabsorption column density is required to match the observed count rates indifferent energy bands. we propose that this is due to the fact that differentabsorption components should be used to model the reprocessed x-rays, theshocked x-ray component and the uv emission and explore the affect that thishas on the resulting fits to the spectrum. further, there is evidence thatabsorption starts to obscure the softer x-rays shortly after the onset of thebright phase. this suggests that material is threaded by an unusually widerange of magnetic field lines, consistent with the suggestion of bridge et al.we find that the period is slightly greater than that determined by schwope &amp;mengel.

astro-ph;0408160	xmm-newton observations of warm absorbers in pg quasars	we present xmm-newton epic observations of warm absorbers in the quasars pg1114+445 and pg 1309+355, both of which exhibit evidence for absorption by warmmaterial in the line-of-sight. we find the absorption in pg 1114+445 to be intwo phases, a `hot' phase with a log ionisation parameter xi of 2.57, and a`cooler' phase with log xi of 0.83; an unresolved transition array (uta) ofm-shell iron is observed in the cooler phase. the absorption in this quasar issimilar to that observed in the seyfert 1 ngc 3783. the absorption in pg1309+355 consists of a single phase, with log xi of 1.87. the absorbing gaslies at distances of 10^{18} - 10^{22} cm from the continuum radiation sourcesin these agn, which suggests that it could originate in a wind emanating from amolecular torus. we derive distances assuming that these x-ray warm absorbershave the same velocity as the uv warm absorbers observed in these quasars. thedistances to the warm absorbers from the central continuum source scaleapproximately with the square root of the agn ionising luminosity, a resultconsistent with the warm absorber originating as a torus wind. the kineticluminosities of these outflowing absorbers represent insignificant fractions (&lt;10^{-3}) of the energy budgets of the agn.

astro-ph;0504503	constraints on the distribution of absorption in the x-ray selected agn  population found in the 13h xmm-newton/chandra deep field	we present an analysis of the x-ray properties of sources detected in the 13hxmm-newton deep (200ks) field. in order to constrain the absorbed agnpopulation, we use extensive monte carlo simulations to directly compare thex-ray colours of observed sources with those predicted by several modeldistributions. we have tested the simplest form of the agn unified scheme,whereby the intrinsic xlf of absorbed agn is set to be the same as that oftheir unabsorbed brethren, coupled with various model distributions ofabsorption. the best fitting of these models sets the fraction of agn withabsorbing column nh, proportional to (lognh)^8. we have also tested twoextensions to the unified scheme: an evolving absorption scenario, and aluminosity dependent model distribution. both of these provide poorer matchesto the observed x-ray colour distributions than the best fitting simple unifiedmodel. we find that a luminosity dependent density evolution xlf reproducespoorly the 0.5-2 kev source counts seen in the 13h field. field to fieldvariations could be the cause of this disparity. computing the simulated x-raycolours with a simple absorbed power-law + reflection spectral model is foundto over-predict, by a factor of two, the fraction of hard sources that arecompletely absorbed below 0.5 kev, implying that an additional source ofsoft-band flux must be present for a number of the absorbed sources. finally,we show that around 40% of the 13h sample are expected to be agn with nh&gt;10^22cm^-2.

astro-ph;0506453	prompt and afterglow early x-ray phases in the comoving frame. evidence  for universal properties?	we analyze the swift xrt light curves and spectra of the gamma-ray bursts(grbs) for which the redshift has been measured. the sample consists of sevengrbs. the soft x-ray light curves of all these grbs are separated into at leasttwo morphological classes: 1) those starting off with a very steep light curvedecay and 2) those showing a rather mild initial decay. this initial decay isfollowed by a flattening and by a further steepening. during these transitionsthe soft x-ray spectrum of these grbs remains constant within the observationalerrors (except for one case, grb050319). for the first time we are able toexploit the early light curve of grb afterglows in the comoving frame. besidesthe temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglowemitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after thetrigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at aclose link between the two. averaging over the bursts that have a rather wellsampled light curve and starting immediately after the prompt phase, the energyemitted in the soft x-rays is about 3% of the energy emitted during the promptphase, except for grb050315, where the soft x-ray emission is as high as 14% ofthe prompt emission.

astro-ph;0507515	swift panchromatic observations of the bright gamma-ray burst grb050525a	the bright gamma-ray burst grb050525a has been detected with the swiftobservatory, providing unique multiwavelength coverage from the very earliestphases of the burst. the x-ray and optical/uv afterglow decay light curves bothexhibit a steeper slope ~0.15 days after the burst, indicative of a jet break.this jet break time combined with the total gamma-ray energy of the burstconstrains the opening angle of the jet to be 3.2 degrees. we derive anempirical `time-lag' redshift from the bat data of z_hat = 0.69 +/- 0.02, ingood agreement with the spectroscopic redshift of 0.61.  prior to the jet break, the x-ray data can be modelled by a simple power lawwith index alpha = -1.2. however after 300 s the x-ray flux brightens by about30% compared to the power-law fit. the optical/uv data have a more complexdecay, with evidence of a rapidly falling reverse shock component thatdominates in the first minute or so, giving way to a flatter forward shockcomponent at later times.  the multiwavelength x-ray/uv/optical spectrum of the afterglow shows evidencefor migration of the electron cooling frequency through the optical rangewithin 25000 s. the measured temporal decay and spectral indices in the x-rayand optical/uv regimes compare favourably with the standard fireball model forgamma-ray bursts assuming expansion into a constant density interstellarmedium.

astro-ph;0509060	swift-uvot detection of grb 050318	we present observations of grb 050318 by the ultra-violet and opticaltelescope (uvot) on-board the swift observatory. the data are the firstdetections of a gamma ray burst (grb) afterglow decay by the uvot instrument,launched specifically to open a new window on these transient sources. weshowcase uvots ability to provide multi-color photometry and the advantages ofcombining uvot data with simultaneous and contemporaneous observations from thehigh-energy detectors on the swift spacecraft. multiple filters covering1,800-6,000 angstroms reveal a red source with spectral slope steeper than thesimultaneous x-ray continuum. spectral fits indicate that the uvot colors areconsistent with dust extinction by systems at z = 1.2037 and z = 1.4436,redshifts where absorption systems have been pre-identified. however, the datacan be most-easily reproduced with models containing a foreground system ofneutral gas redshifted by z = 2.8 +/- 0.3. for both of the above scenarios,spectral and decay slopes are, for the most part, consistent with fireballexpansion into a uniform medium, provided a cooling break occurs between theenergy ranges of the uvot and swifts x-ray instrumentation.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0510566	swift and optical observations of grb 050401	we present the results of the analysis of gamma-ray and x-ray data of grb050401 taken with the swift satellite, together with a series of ground-basedfollow-up observations. the swift x-ray light curve shows a clear break atabout 4900 seconds after the grb. the decay indices before and after the breakare consistent with a scenario of continuous injection of radiation from the'central engine' of the grb to the fireball. alternatively, this behaviourcould result if ejecta are released with a range of lorentz factors with theslower shells catching up the faster at the afterglow shock position. the twoscenarios are observationally indistinguishable. the grb 050401 afterglow isquite bright in the x-ray band but weak in the optical, with an optical tox-ray flux ratio similar to those of 'dark bursts'. we detect a significantamount of absorption in the x-ray spectrum, with n_h = (1.7 +/- 0.2) x 10^22cm^-2 at a redshift of z=2.9, which is typical of a dense circumbust medium.such high column density implies an unrealistic optical extinction of 30magnitudes if we adopt the galactic extinction law, which would not consistentwith optical detection of the afterglow. this suggests that the extinction lawis different from the galactic one.

astro-ph;0510775	the 2005 outburst of gro j1655-40: spectral evolution of the rise, as  observed by swift	we present swift observations of the black hole x-ray transient, groj1655-40, during the recent outburst. with its multiwavelength capabilities andflexible scheduling, swift is extremely well-suited for monitoring the spectralevolution of such an event. gro j1655-40 was observed on 20 occasions and datawere obtained by all instruments for the majority of epochs. x-ray spectroscopyrevealed spectral shapes consistent with the ``canonical'' low/hard, high/softand very high states at various epochs. the soft x-ray source (0.3-10 kev) rosefrom quiescence and entered the low/hard state, when an iron emission line wasdetected. the soft x-ray source then softened and decayed, before beginning aslow rebrightening and then spending $\sim 3$ weeks in the very high state. thehard x-rays (14-150 kev) behaved similarly but their peaks preceded those ofthe soft x-rays by up to a few days; in addition, the average hard x-ray fluxremained approximately constant during the slow soft x-ray rebrightening,increasing suddenly as the source entered the very high state. theseobservations indicate (and confirm previous suggestions) that the low/hardstate is key to improving our understanding of the outburst trigger andmechanism. the optical/ultraviolet lightcurve behaved very differently fromthat of the x-rays; this might suggest that the soft x-ray lightcurve isactually a composite of the two known spectral components, one graduallyincreasing with the optical/ultraviolet emission (accretion disc) and the otherfollowing the behaviour of the hard x-rays (jet and/or corona).

astro-ph;0510776	multiwavelength xmm-newton observations of the laor et al. sample of pg  quasars	we present xmm-newton/epic spectra for the laor et al. sample of palomargreen quasars. we find that a power-law provides a reasonable fit to the 2-5kev region of the spectra. excess soft x-ray emission below 2 kev is presentfor all objects, with the exception of those known to contain a warm absorber.a single power-law is, however, a poor fit to the 0.3-10.0 kev spectrum andinstead we find that a simple model, consisting of a broken power-law (plus aniron line), provides a reasonable fit in most cases. the equivalent width ofthe emission line is constrained in just twelve objects but with low (&lt;2 sigma)significance in most cases. for the sources whose spectra are well-fit by thebroken power-law model, we find that various optical and x-ray line andcontinuum parameters are well-correlated; in particular, the power-law photonindex is well-correlated with the fwhm of the hbeta line and the photon indicesof the low and high energy components of the broken power-law arewell-correlated with each other. these results suggest that the 0.3-10 kevx-ray emission shares a common (presumably non-thermal) origin, as opposed tosuggestions that the soft excess is directly produced by thermal disc emissionor via an additional spectral component. we present xmm-newton/om data which wecombine with the x-ray spectra so as to produce broad-band spectral energydistributions, free from uncertainties due to long-term variability innon-simultaneous data. fitting these optical-uv spectra with a comptonized discmodel indicates that the soft x-ray excess is independent of the accretiondisc, confirming our interpretation of the tight correlation between the hardand soft x-ray spectra.

astro-ph;0511322	first results from the swift uvot	we review some of the initial data from the uvot telescope on the swiftobservatory. statistics based on about six months of data suggest a dark burstfraction of about 50% when combining both uvot and ground-based observations.there is evidence that some bursts have a large gamma-ray efficiency, which maybe due to strong magnetic fields in their ejecta. the bright grb050525a showsbehaviour broadly consistent with expectations from the simple fireball modelfor bursts, including evidence for a reverse shock component in the uvot data,and an achromatic break in decay slope indicative of a jet break. other burstsobserved with swift have a shallow decay initially which is difficult toreconcile with the simple model. replenishment of the forward shock energy bycontinued ejection of material from the central engine, or initial injection ofmaterial with a range of velocities, offers a potential explanation. in thecase of the xrf050406 an initially rising optical afterglow flux followed by ashallow decay may be due to observation of a structured jet from a significantoff-axis angle.

astro-ph;0601182	swift-uvot observations of the x-ray flash 050406	we present swift-uvot data on the optical afterglow of the x-ray flash of2005 april 6 (xrf 050406) from 88s to \sim 10^5s after the initial promptgamma-ray emission. our observations in the v, b and u bands are the earliestthat have been taken of an xrf optical counterpart. combining the early -timeoptical temporal and spectral properties with \gamma- and simultaneous x-raydata taken with the bat and xrt telescopes on-board swift, we are able toconstrain possible origins of the xrf. the prompt emission had a fred profile(fast-rise, exponential decay) with a duration of t_90 = 5.7\pm 0.2s, puttingit at the short end of the long-burst duration distribution. the absence ofphotoelectric absorption red-ward of 4000 \aa in the uv/optical spectrumprovides a firm upper limit of z\leq 3.1 on the redshift, thus excluding a highredshift as the sole reason for the soft spectrum. the optical light curve isconsistent with a power-law decay with slope alpha = -0.75\pm 0.26(f_{\nu}\propto t^{\alpha}), and a maximum occurring in the first 200s afterthe initial gamma-ray emission. the softness of the prompt emission is welldescribed by an off-axis structured jet model, which is able to account for theearly peak flux and shallow decay observed in the optical and x-ray bands.

astro-ph;0604316	optical, infrared, and ultraviolet observations of the x-ray flash grb  050416a	we present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometry of the afterglow ofthe x-ray flash xrf 050416a taken between approximately 100 seconds and 36 daysafter the burst. we find an intrinsic spectral slope between 1930 and 22,200angstrom of beta = -1.14 +/- 0.20 and a decay rate of alpha = -0.86 +/- 0.15.there is no evidence for a change in the decay rate between approximately 0.7and 4.7 days after the burst. our data implies that there is no spectral breakbetween the optical and x-ray bands between 0.7 and 4.7 days after the burst,and is consistent with the cooling break being redward of the k_s band (22,200angstrom) at 0.7 days. the combined ultraviolet/optical/infrared spectralenergy distribution shows no evidence for a significant amount of extinction inthe host galaxy along the line of sight to xrf 050416a. our data suggest thatthe extragalactic extinction along the line of sight to the burst is onlyapproximately a_v = 0.2 mag, which is significantly less than the extinctionexpected from the hydrogen column density inferred from $x$-ray observations ofxrf 050416a assuming a dust-to-gas ratio similar to what is found for the milkyway. the observed extinction, however, is consistent with the dust-to-gas ratioseen in the small magellanic cloud. we suggest that xrf 050416a may have atwo-component jet similar to what has been proposed for grb 030329. if this isthe case the lack of an observed jet break between 0.7 and 42 days is anillusion due to emission from the wide jet dominating the afterglow afterapproximately 1.5 days.

astro-ph;0610570	swift observations of grb050904: the most distant cosmic explosion ever  observed	swift discovered the high redshift (z=6.29) grb050904 with the burst alerttelescope (bat) and began observing with its narrow field instruments 161 safter the burst onset. this gamma-ray burst is the most distant cosmicexplosion ever observed. because of its high redshift, the x-ray telescope(xrt) and bat simultaneous observations provide 4 orders of magnitude ofspectral coverage (0.2-150 kev; 1.4-1090 kev in the source rest frame) at avery early source-frame time (22 s). grb050904 was a long, multi-peaked, brightgrb with strong variability during its entire evolution. the light curveobserved by the xrt is characterized by the presence of a long flaring activitylasting up to 1-2 hours after the burst onset in the burst rest frame, with noevidence of a smooth power-law decay following the prompt emission as seen inother grbs. however, the bat tail extrapolated to the xrt band joins the xrtearly light curve and the overall behavior resembles that of a very long grbprompt. the spectral energy distribution softens with time, with the photonindex decreasing from -1.2 during the bat observation to -1.9 at the end of thexrt observation. the dips of the late x-ray flares may be consistent with anunderlying x-ray emission arising from the forward shock and with theproperties of the optical afterglow reported by tagliaferri et al. (2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.

astro-ph;0611081	extreme properties of grb061007: a highly energetic or a highly  collimated burst?	grb061007 is the brightest gamma-ray burst (grb) to be detected by swift andis accompanied by an exceptionally luminous afterglow that had a v-bandmagnitude &lt;11.1 at 80s after the prompt emission. from the start of the swiftobservations the afterglow decayed as a power law with a slope of\alpha_x=1.66+/-0.01 in the x-ray and \alpha_{opt}=1.64+/-0.01 in theuv/optical, up to the point that it was no longer detected above background inthe optical or x-ray bands. the brightness of this grb and the similarity inthe decay rate of the x-ray, optical and gamma-ray emission from 100s after thetrigger distinguish this burst from others and present a challenge to thefireball model. the lack of a cooling or jet break in the afterglow up to\~10^5s constrains any model that can produce the large luminosity observed ingrb061007, which we found to require either an excessively large kinetic energyor highly collimated outflow. analysis of the multi-wavelength spectral andhigh-resolution temporal data taken with swift suggest an early time jet-breakto be a more plausible scenario. this must have occurred within 80s of theprompt emission, which places an upper limit on the jet opening angle of\theta_j=0.8deg. such a highly collimated outflow resolves the energy budgetproblem presented in a spherical emission model, reducing the isotropicequivalent energy of this burst to e_{\gamma}^{corr}=10^{50} ergs; consistentwith other grbs.

astro-ph;0702122	dust and gas in the local environments of gamma-ray bursts	using a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows detected by both the x-rayand the uv/optical telescopes (xrt and uvot) on swift, we modelled the spectralenergy distributions (seds) to determine gas column densities and dustextinction in the grb local environment. in six out of seven cases we find anx-ray absorber associated with the grb host galaxy with column density(assuming solar abundances) ranging from (0.8 - 7.7)x10^{21}cm^{-2}. wedetermine the rest-frame visual extinction a_v using the smc, lmc and galacticextinction curves to model the dust in the grb host galaxy, and this rangesfrom a_v = 0.12\pm 0.04 to a_v = 0.65^{+0.08}_{-0.07}. the afterglow seds weretypically best fit by a model with an smc extinction curve. in only one casewas the grb afterglow better modelled by a galactic extinction curve, which hasa prominent absorption feature at 2175angstrom. we investigate the selectioneffects present in our sample and how these might distort the true distributionof a_v in grb host galaxies. we estimate that grbs with no afterglow detectedblueward of 5500angstrom have average rest-frame visual extinctions almosteight times those observed in the optically bright population of grbs. this mayhelp account for the ~1/3 of grbs observed by swift that have no afterglowdetected by uvot.

astro-ph;9508042	the deficit of distant galaxy clusters in the rixos x-ray survey	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems andtherefore provide an important way of studying the formation and evolution ofthe large scale structure of the universe. cluster evolution can be inferredfrom observations of the x-ray emission of the gas in distant clusters, butinterpreting these data is not straightforward. in a simplified view, clustersgrow from perturbations in the matter distribution: their intracluster gas iscompressed and shock-heated by the gravitational collapse$^{1}$. the resultingx-ray emission is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in thechanging gravitational potential. however, if processes such as radiativecooling or pre-collapse heating of the gas are important, then the x-rayevolution will be strongly influenced by the thermal history of the gas. herewe present the first results from a faint flux-limited sample of x-ray selectedclusters compiled as part of the rosat international x-ray and optical survey(rixos). very few distant clusters have been identified. most importantly,their redshift distribution appears to be inconsistent with simple models basedon the evolution of the gravitational potential. our results suggest thatradiative cooling or non-gravitational heating of the intracluster gas mustplay an important role in the evolution of clusters.

astro-ph;9602118	the luminosity function evolution of soft x--ray selected agn in the  rixos survey	a sample of 198 soft x--ray selected active galactic nuclei (agn) from therosat international x--ray optical survey (rixos), is used to investigate thex--ray luminosity function and its evolution. rixos, with a flux limit of 3e-14erg s-1 cm-2 (0.5 to 2.0 kev), samples a broad range in redshift over 20 deg^2of sky, and is almost completely identified; it is used in combination with theeinstein extended medium sensitivity survey (emss), to give a total sample ofover 600 agn. we find the evolution of agn with redshift to be consistent withpure luminosity evolution (ple) models in which the rate of evolution slowsmarkedly or stops at high redshifts z&gt;1.8. we find that this result is notaffected by the inclusion, or exclusion, of narrow emission line galaxies atlow redshift in the rixos and emss samples, and is insensitive to uncertaintiesin the conversion between flux values measured with rosat and einstein. weconfirm, using a model independent ve/va test, that our survey is consistentwith no evolution at high redshifts.

astro-ph;9603024	optical and x-ray properties of the rixos agn: i - the continua	we present measurements of the optical and x-ray continua of 108 agn (seyfert1s and quasars) from the rosat international x-ray/optical survey (rixos). thesample covers a wide range in redshift (0&lt;z&lt;3.3), in x-ray spectral slope (-1.5&lt;ax&lt;2.6) and in optical-to-x-ray ratio (0.4$&lt;aox&lt;1.5). a correlation is foundbetween ax and aox; similar correlations have recently been reported in otherx-ray and optical samples. we also identify previously unreported relationshipsbetween the optical slope (aopt) and ax (particularly at high redshifts) andbetween aopt and aox. these trends show that the overall optical-to-x-ray continuum changes from convex to concave as ax hardens, demonstrating a strong behavioural link between the optical/uv big blue bump (bbb) and the soft x-ray excess, which is consistent with them being part of the same spectral component.by constructing models of the optical-to-x-ray continuum, we demonstrate thatthe observed correlations are consistent with an intrinsic spectrum which is absorbed through different amounts of cold gas and dust. the intrinsic spectrumis the sum of an optical-to-soft x-ray `big bump' component and an ax=1 powerlaw; the column density of the cold gas ranges from 0 to ~4e21 cm-2 and thedust-to-gas ratio is assumed to be galactic. the `big bump' may be representedby a t~1e6 k thermal bremsstrahlung or an accretion disk with a surrounding hotcorona. the scatter in the data can accommodate a wide range in big bump temperature (or black hole mass) and strength. a source for the absorbing gas may bethe dusty, molecular torus which lies beyond the broad line-emitting regions,although with a much lower column density than observed in seyfert 2 galaxies.alternatively, it may be the bulge of a spiral host galaxy or an ellipticalhost galaxy.

astro-ph;9609069	double-peaked balmer line emission in the radio-quiet agn rx j1042+1212	we present optical and x-ray spectra of a radio-quiet x-ray selected agn, rxj1042+1212 ($z$=0.271). the halpha and hbeta emission lines are very broad(with full widths at half maximum of ~10000 km s-1) and have double-peakedprofiles. such features are rarely observed in agn in general but are even moreunusual in radio-quiet objects. the analysis of the rosat pspc data reveals anon-varying, unabsorbed spectrum with an energy spectral index, alphax=1.2 andlittle or no emission from a soft x-ray excess. the slope of the opticalspectrum is similar, alphaopt=1.0, and is consistent with an extrapolation ofthe x-ray spectrum, suggesting that the same power-law continuum may dominatethroughout and that the big blue bump component is relatively weak. we look fora link between these various properties and investigate models of double-peakedbalmer line emission in agn. an accretion disc origin is unlikely in rxj1042+1212 as this model predicts that lines emitted by a disc should have anet gravitational redshift (both halpha and hbeta have a net blueshift).emission from two broad line regions, each gravitationally bound to onecomponent of a supermassive black hole binary, is a possibility if the twocomponents are similar in size and nature. alternatively, the lines (or atleast the narrow peaks of the lines) may be produced by a double-sided jet orbipolar flow.

astro-ph;9610124	x-ray qso evolution from a very deep rosat survey	in the deepest optically identified x-ray survey yet performed, we haveidentified 32 x-ray selected qsos to a flux limit of 2x10^{-15} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} (0.5-2 kev). the survey, performed with the rosat pspc, has 89%spectroscopic completeness. the qso log(n)-log(s) relation is found to have abreak to a flat slope at faint fluxes. the surface density of qsos at thesurvey limit is 230+/-40 per square degree, the largest so far of any qsosurvey. we have used this survey to measure the qso x-ray luminosity functionat low luminosities (lx&lt;10^{44.5} erg s^{-1}) and high redshifts (1&lt;z&lt;2.5). thehighest redshift qso in the survey has z=3.4. combined with the qsos from theeinstein emss at bright fluxes, we find pure luminosity evolution of the formlx proportional to (1+z)^{3.0(+0.2,-0.3)} is an adequate description of theevolution of the x-ray luminosity function at low redshifts. a redshift cutoffin the evolution is required at z=1.4 ^{+0.4}_{-0.17} (for qo=0.5). we discussthe form of this evolution, its dependence on the model assumed and the errorson the derived parameters. we show that most previous x-ray surveys, includingthe emss, are consistent with a power law luminosity evolution index of 3.0.the contribution of qsos to the 1-2 kev cosmic x-ray background is found to bebetween 31% and 51%.

astro-ph;9703163	the origin of the cosmic soft x-ray background: optical identification  of an extremely deep rosat survey	we present the results of the deepest optically identified x-ray survey yetmade. the x-ray survey was made with the rosat pspc and reaches a flux limit of1.6x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.5--2.0 kev). above a flux limit of 2x10^-15 ergcm^-2 s^-1 we define a complete sample of 70 sources of which 59 areidentified. some (5) other sources have tentative identifications and in afurther 4 the x-ray error-boxes are blank to r=23 mag. at the brighter fluxlevels (&gt;= 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1) we confirm the results of previous less deepx-ray surveys with 84% of the sources begin qsos. at fainter fluxes, however,the survey is dominated by a population of galaxies with narrow opticalemission lines (nelgs). in addition, a number of groups and clusters ofgalaxies are found at intermediate fluxes. most of these are poor systems oflow x-ray luminosity and are generally found at redshifts of &gt; 0.3. theirnumbers are consistent with a zero evolutionary scenario, in contrast to thesituation for high luminosity clusters at the same redshift. we discuss thesignificance of these results to the determination of the cosmic soft x-raybackground (xrb) and show that at 2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, we have resolvedmore than 50% of the background. we also briefly consider the probableimportance of nelg objects to the residual background and look at some of theproperties of these unusual objects.

astro-ph;9708199	optical and x-ray properties of the rixos agn: ii - emission lines	we present the optical and uv emission line properties of 160 x-ray selectedagn taken from the rixos survey (including halpha, hbeta, [oiii]5007, mgii2798and ciii]1909). this sample is believed to contain a mixture of absorbed andunabsorbed objects, with column densities up to 4e21 cm-2. although thedistribution of the [oiii] ew for the rixos agn is typical of opticallyselected samples, the balmer line ews are relatively low. this is consistentwith the presence of a dust absorber between the broad and narrow line regions(eg. a molecular torus), and intrinsically weak optical line emission. we findbaldwin effects in ciii] and mgii, and a positive response of the mgii line toits ionizing continuum. there is a strong correlation between the ew and fwhmof mgii, which may be similar to that seen in other samples for hbeta. wedemonstrate that this is consistent with models which suggest two line-emittingzones, a `very broad line region' (vblr) and an `intermediate line region'(ilr). the correlation between ew and fwhm in mgii may be a physicalcharacteristic of the ilr or it may reflect a geometric dependence. we found nocorrelation between the hbeta fwhm and the slope of the x-ray spectrum, howeverthis may be due to the effects of dust absorption which suppresses the broadhbeta component, masking any relationship. the halpha fwhm does tend to benarrow when alpha_x is soft, and broadens as alpha_x hardens, although theformal probability for this correlation is low (91 per cent). if thedistribution of alpha_x in the rixos sample reflects the level of intrinsicabsorption in these agn, the data suggest a possible link between the velocityof the balmer line-emitting region and the amount of absorbing material beyond.

astro-ph;9711009	the uv spectrum of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy, rej1034+396	we present uv spectroscopy of re1034+396, taken with the faint objectspectrograph on the hubble space telescope. with a spectral resolution of ~1-2afwhm and a typical s/n of ~15 per diode, this is one of the first detailed uvspectra of an object in the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) class. the spectrumprobes the physics and kinematics of the high-ionization and coronal line gas,and the strength and form of the big blue bump component in the uv. we detectmany emission lines, including lyman alpha, civ1549, heii1640, ciii]1909 andmgii2798. we also identify a feature at 2647a (in the rest-frame) withhighly-ionized iron [fexi]2649; a line of the same species ([fexi]7892) hasalso been seen in the optical spectrum. the velocity widths of the uv lines arerelatively narrow (fwhm&lt;2000 km/s) and similar to those of the optical lines,which suggests that all line emission in rej1034+396, ie. including that ofhigh- and low-ionization species and the forbidden lines, may be dominated byan intermediate-velocity (fwhm~1000 km/s), intermediate-density (log ne~7.5cm-3) region of gas. the slope of the uv continuum (alpha~0.9) is soft (ie.red) relative to quasars and the uv-to-soft x-ray flux ratio is unusually lowimplying that the big blue bump component is very weak in the uv. the presentepoch uv to soft x-ray continuum is consistent with earlier data, demonstratingthat this extreme big blue bump component is also very stable, unlike manyother nls1s which show extreme patterns of variability.

astro-ph;9804314	clustering of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei	a total of 235 active galactic nuclei (agn) from two different soft x-raysurveys (the rosat deep survey -drs- and the rosat international x-ray opticalsurvey -rixos-) with redshifts between 0 and 3.5 are used to study theclustering of x-ray selected agn and its evolution. a 2 sigma significantdetection of clustering of such objects is found on scales &lt;40-80/h mpc in therixos sample, while no clustering is detected on any scales in the drs sample.assuming a single power law model for the spatial correlation function (scf),quantitative limits on the agn clustering have been obtained: a comovingcorrelation length 1.5&lt;~ r_0 &lt;~ 3.3/h mpc is implied for comoving evolution,while 1.9 &lt;~ r_0 &lt;~ 4.8 for stable clustering and 2.2 &lt;~ r_0 &lt;~ 5.5 for linearevolution. these values are consistent with the correlation lengths andevolutions obtained for galaxy samples, but imply smaller amplitude or fasterevolution than recent uv and optically selected agn samples. we also constrainthe ratio of bias parameters between x-ray selected agn and iras galaxies to be  &lt;~1.7 on scales &lt;~ 10/h mpc, a significantly smaller value than is inferredfrom local large-scale dynamical studies.

astro-ph;9902238	soft x-ray spectral variations of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy  markarian 766	the x-ray variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 766 isstudied using 9 rosat pspc datasets. the spectrum is well described by a powerlaw combined with a blackbody (kt~ 70 ev) soft excess. examination of fluxratio changes and variability amplitude in 3 x-ray bands, shows that the powerlaw component varies continuously on time-scales of ~5000s and is steeper whenit is brighter. in contrast, variability of the soft excess is not detected.spectral modeling of 31 spectra from different observations and at a range ofcount rates is also consistent with a picture in which the power law is steeperwhen it is brighter, and in which the soft excess component does not vary. thepower law variability can be explained if the power law is produced by variablethermal or non-thermal comptonization of soft photons. this behaviour issimilar to that of galactic black hole candidates in the low state. the x-rayand multiwavelength properties of markarian 766 are shown to be very similar tothose of other narrow line seyfert 1s. this may mean that the rapid x-rayvariability seen in other narrow line seyfert 1s may also not originate intheir strong soft excess components.

astro-ph;9905188	x-ray spectra of the rixos source sample	we present results of an extensive study of the x-ray spectral properties ofsources detected in the rixos survey, that is nearly complete down to a fluxlimit of 3e-14 cgs (0.5-2 kev). we show that for x-ray surveys containingsources with low count rate spectral slopes estimated using simple hardnessratios in the rosat band can be biased. instead we analyse three-colour x-raydata using statistical techniques appropriate to the poisson regime whichremoves the effects of this bias. we have then applied this technique to therixos survey to study the spectral properties of the sample. for the agn wefind an average energy index of 1.05+-0.05 with no evidence for spectralevolution with redshift. individual agn are shown to have a range of propertiesincluding soft x-ray excesses and intrinsic absorption. narrow emission linegalaxies also seem to fit to a power-law spectrum, which may indicate anon-thermal origin for their x-ray emission. we infer that most of the clustersin the sample have a bremsstrahlung temperature &gt;3 kev, although some showevidence for a cooling flow. the stars deviate strongly from a power-law modelbut fit to a thermal model. finally, we have analysed the whole rixos samplecontaining 1762 sources. we find that the mean spectral slope of the sourceshardens at lower fluxes in agreement with results from other samples. however,a study of the individual sources demonstrates that the hardening of the meanis caused by the appearance of a population of very hard sources at the lowestfluxes. this has implications for the nature of the soft x-ray background.

0706.0669	the two-component afterglow of swift grb 050802	this paper investigates grb 050802, one of the best examples of a it swiftgamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the x-ray lightcurve, while theoptical counterpart decays as a single power-law. this burst has an opticallybright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectralrange of the uvot on-board swift. observations began with the xrt and uvottelescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. thex-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. theoptical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_o = 0.82 +/- 0.03throughout the observation. the x-ray data on their own are consistent with thebreak at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. modelling the opticalto x-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow cannot be produced by the same component as the x-ray emission at late times,ruling out a single component afterglow. we therefore considered two-componentjet models and find that the x-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by amodel in which both components are energy injected for the duration of theobserved afterglow and the x-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in thenarrow component. this bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide forinterpreting the surprising finding of swift that bursts seldom displayachromatic jet breaks.
