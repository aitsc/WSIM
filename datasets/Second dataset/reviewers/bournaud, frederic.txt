0903.0999	molecular gas in tidal dwarf galaxies: exploring the conditions for star  formation	tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs), produced from material expelled in galacticinteractions, are well--suited to test the laws of star formation (sf) due totheir simple structure, high metallicity -- making co a reliable tracer of themolecular gas content -- and recent sf. here, we study the conditions for theonset of sf and for the rate at which sf proceeds once above a threshold in asmall sample of tdgs. we use data for the gas (atomic and molecular) surfacedensity and sf rate per area to test the laws of sf found for spiral and dwarfgalaxies in this more extreme environment. we find in general a good agreementwith the schmidt law found for the total gas and for the molecular gas but notethat higher resolution co observations are necessary to clarify some possiblediscrepancies. we find, down to a scale of $\sim$1 kpc, in general a goodagreement between the peaks of sf and of the molecular gas, but also find insome objects surprisingly large quantities of molecular gas at places where nosf is occuring. a high column density of molecular gas is therefore not asufficient condition for the onset of sf. we find that the kinematicalproperties of the gas are also relevant: in two objects our observations showedthat sf only occured in regions with a narrow line width.

0905.4669	morphological quenching of star formation: making early-type galaxies  red	we point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation inearly-type galaxies. it automatically links the color of a galaxy with itsmorphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gassupply. given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gasdisks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation tobound clumps. this can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, forinstance by mergers. we present the concept of morphological quenching (mq)using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its naturaloccurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique.we show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficientto stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxyred and dead while gas accretion continues. the turbulence necessary for diskstability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in theabsence of bound star-forming clumps. while gas stripping processes are limitedto dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like agn feedback,virial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos moremassive than 10^12 mo, the mq can explain the appearance of red ellipticalseven in less massive halos and in the field. the dense gas disks observed insome of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereasred galaxies with quenched gas disks are expected to be more frequent at highredshift.

0907.3271	high-redshift clumpy discs and bulges in cosmological simulations	we analyze the first cosmological simulations that recover the fragmentationof high-redshift galactic discs driven by cold streams. the fragmentation isrecovered owing to an amr resolution better than 70 pc with cooling below 10^4k. we study three typical star-forming galaxies in haloes of approx. 5 10^11msun at z=2.3, when they were not undergoing a major merger. the steady gassupply by cold streams leads to gravitationally unstable, turbulent discs,which fragment into giant clumps and transient features on a dynamicaltimescale. the disc clumps are not associated with dark-matter haloes. theclumpy discs are self-regulated by gravity in a marginaly unstable state. clumpmigration and angular-momentum transfer on an orbital timescale help the growthof a central bulge with a mass comparable to the disc. the continuous gas inputkeeps the system of clumpy disc and bulge in a near "steady state", for severalgyr. the average star-formation rate, much of which occurs in the clumps,follows the gas accretion rate of approx. 45 msun/yr. the simulated galaxiesresemble in many ways the observed star-forming galaxies at high redshift.their properties are consistent with the simple theoretical framework presentedin dekel, sari &amp; ceverino (2009). in particular, a two-component analysisreveals that the simulated discs are indeed marginally unstable, and the timeevolution confirms the robustness of the clumpy configuration in a cosmologicalsteady state. by z=1 the simulated systems are stabilized by a dominant stellarspheroid, demonstrating the process of "morphological quenching" of starformation (martig et al. 2009) . we demonstrate that the disc fragmentation isnot a numerical artifact once the jeans length is kept larger than 7 resolutionelements, i.e. beyond the standard truelove criterion.

0910.3677	the thick disks of spiral galaxies as relics from gas-rich, turbulent,  clumpy disks at high redshift	the formation of thick stellar disks in spiral galaxies is studied.simulations of gas-rich young galaxies show formation of internal clumps bygravitational instabilities, clump coalescence into a bulge, and diskthickening by strong stellar scattering. the bulge and thick disks of moderngalaxies may form this way. simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too,but there is an important difference. thick disks made by internal processeshave a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks madeby mergers flare. the difference arises because in the first case,perpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to thedisk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of thisdensity. in the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of thecolumn density and the low density regions get thicker; the resulting flaringis inconsistent with observations. late-stage gas accretion and thin diskgrowth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks formedby internal evolution. these results reinforce the idea that disk galaxiesaccrete most of their mass smoothly and acquire their structure by internalprocesses, in particular through turbulent and clumpy phases at high redshift.

0911.0891	formation of late-type spiral galaxies: gas return from stellar  populations regulates disk destruction and bulge growth	spiral galaxies have most of their stellar mass in a large rotating disk, andonly a modest fraction in a central spheroidal bulge. this poses a majorchallenge for cosmological models of galaxy formation. galaxies form at thecentre of dark matter halos through a combination of hierarchical merging andgas accretion along cold streams, and should rapidly grow their bulge throughmergers and instabilities. cosmological simulations predict galaxies to havemost of their mass in the central bulge, and therefore an angular momentum muchbelow the observed level, except in dwarf galaxies. we propose that thecontinuous return of fresh gas by stellar populations over cosmic times couldsolve this issue. a population of stars formed at a given instant typicallyreturns half of its initial mass in the form of gas over 10 billion years, andthe process is not dominated by rapid supernovae explosions but by thelong-term mass-loss from low- and intermediate-mass stars. using simulations ofgalaxy formation, we show that this recycling of gas can strongly affect thestructural evolution of massive galaxies, potentially solving the bulgefraction issue: we find that the bulge-to-disk ratio of a massive galaxy can bedivided by a factor of 3. the continuous recycling of baryons through starformation and stellar mass loss helps the growth of disks and their survival tointeractions and mergers. instead of forming only early-type,spheroid-dominated galaxies (s0 and ellipticals), the standard cosmologicalmodel can then successfully account for massive late-type, disk-dominatedspiral galaxies (sb-sc).

0707.3991	tidal debris posing as dark galaxies	debris sent into the intergalactic medium during tidal collisions can tell usabout several fundamental properties of galaxies, in particular their missingmass, both in the form of cosmological dark matter and so-called lost baryons.high velocity encounters, which are common in clusters of galaxies, are able toproduce faint tidal debris that may appear as star-less, free floating hiclouds. these may be mistaken for dark galaxies, a putative class of gaseous,dark matter dominated, objects which for some reason never managed to formstars. virgohi21 is by far the most spectacular and most discussed dark galaxycandidate so far detected in hi surveys. we show here that it is most likelymade out of material expelled 750 myr ago from the nearby spiral galaxy ngc4254 during its fly--by at about 1000 km/s by a massive intruder. our numericalmodel of the collision is able to reproduce the main characteristics of thesystem: in particular the absence of stars, and its prominent velocitygradient. originally attributed to the gas being in rotation within a massivedark matter halo, we find it instead to be consistent with a combination ofsimple streaming motion plus projection effects (duc &amp; bournaud, 2007). wediscuss several ways to identify a tidal origin in a dark galaxy candidate andillustrate the method using another hi system in virgo, vcc 2062, which is mostlikely a tidal dwarf galaxy (duc et al., 2007). now, whereas tidal debrisshould not contain any dark matter from the halo of their parent galaxies, itmay exhibit missing mass in the form of dark baryons, unaccounted for byclassical observations, as recently found in the collisional ring of ngc 5291(bournaud et al., 2007) and probably in the tdg vcc 2062. these "lost baryons"must originally have been located in the disks of their parent galaxies.

1005.4208	a collisional origin for the leo ring	extended hi structures around galaxies are of prime importance to probegalaxy formation scenarios. the giant hi ring in the leo group is one of thelargest and most intriguing hi structures in the nearby universe. whether itconsists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any opticalcounterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearbygalaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.we present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtainedwith megacam on the cfht. they reveal optical counterparts to several hi and uvcondensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likelycorrespond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. analyzingthe spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we foundit to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. wethen use simulations to test the hypothesis that the leo ring results from ahead-on collision between leo group members ngc 3384 and m96. according to ourmodel which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observationalproperties of the system, the leo ring is consistent with being a collisionalring. it is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-upof pre-enriched collisional debris.

1006.4757	the driving mechanism of starbursts in galaxy mergers	we present hydrodynamic simulations of a major merger of disk galaxies, andstudy the ism dynamics and star formation properties. high spatial and massresolutions of 12pc and 4x10^4 m_sol allow to resolve cold and turbulent gasclouds embedded in a warmer diffuse phase. we compare to lower resolutionmodels, where the multiphase ism is not resolved and is modeled as a relativelyhomogeneous and stable medium. while merger-driven bursts of star formation aregenerally attributed to large-scale gas inflows towards the nuclear regions, weshow that once a realistic ism is resolved, the dominant process is actuallygas fragmentation into massive and dense clouds and rapid star formationtherein. as a consequence, star formation is more efficient by a factor of upto 10 and is also somewhat more extended, while the gas density probabilitydistribution function (pdf) rapidly evolves towards very high densities. wethus propose that the actual mechanism of starburst triggering in galaxycollisions can only be captured at high spatial resolution and when the coolingof gas is modeled down to less than 10^3 k. not only does our model reproducethe properties of the antennae system, but it also explains the ``starburstmode'' revealed recently in high-redshift mergers compared to quiescent disks.

1006.4782	hydrodynamics of high-redshift galaxy collisions: from gas-rich disks to  dispersion-dominated mergers and compact spheroids	disk galaxies at high redshift (z~2) are characterized by high fractions ofcold gas, strong turbulence, and giant star-forming clumps. major mergers ofdisk galaxies at high redshift should then generally involve such turbulentclumpy disks. merger simulations, however, model the ism as a stable,homogeneous, and thermally pressurized medium. we present the first mergersimulations with high fractions of cold, turbulent, and clumpy gas. we discussthe major new features of these models compared to models where the gas isartificially stabilized and warmed. gas turbulence, which is already strong inhigh-redshift disks, is further enhanced in mergers. some phases aredispersion-dominated, with most of the gas kinetic energy in the form ofvelocity dispersion and very chaotic velocity fields, unlike merger modelsusing a thermally stabilized gas. these mergers can reach very high starformation rates, and have multi-component gas spectra consistent withsubmillimeter galaxies. major mergers with high fractions of cold turbulent gasare also characterized by highly dissipative gas collapse to the center ofmass, with the stellar component following in a global contraction. the finalgalaxies are early-type with relatively small radii and high sersic indices,like high-redshift compact spheroids. the mass fraction in a disk componentthat survives or re-forms after a merger is severely reduced compared to modelswith stabilized gas, and the formation of a massive disk component wouldrequire significant accretion of external baryons afterwards. mergers thusappear to destroy extended disks even when the gas fraction is high, and thislends further support to smooth infall as the main formation mechanism formassive disk galaxies.

1007.2566	ism properties in hydrodynamic galaxy simulations: turbulence cascades,  cloud formation, role of gravity and feedback	we study the properties of ism substructure and turbulence in hydrodynamic(amr) galaxy simulations with resolutions up to 0.8 pc and 5x10^3 msun. weanalyse the power spectrum of the density distribution, and various componentsof the velocity field. we show that the disk thickness is about the averagejeans scale length, and is mainly regulated by gravitational instabilities.from this scale of energy injection, a turbulence cascade towards small-scaleis observed, with almost isotropic small-scale motions. on scales larger thanthe disk thickness, density waves are observed, but there is also a full rangeof substructures with chaotic and strongly non-isotropic gas velocitydispersions. the power spectrum of vorticity in an lmc-sized model suggeststhat an inverse cascade of turbulence might be present, although energy inputover a wide range of scales in the coupled gaseous+stellar fluid could alsoexplain this quasi-2d regime on scales larger than the disk scale height.similar regimes of gas turbulence are also found in massive high-redshift diskswith high gas fractions. disk properties and ism turbulence appear to be mainlyregulated by gravitational processes, both on large scales and inside denseclouds. star formation feedback is however essential to maintain the ism in asteady state by balancing a systematic gas dissipation into dense and smallclumps. our galaxy simulations employ a thermal model based on a barotropicequation of state (eos) aimed at modelling the equilibrium of gas betweenvarious heating and cooling processes. denser gas is typically colder in thisapproach, which is shown to correctly reproduce the density structures of astar-forming, turbulent, unstable and cloudy ism down to scales of a fewparsecs.

1008.1044	the large magellanic cloud: a power spectral analysis of spitzer images	we present a power spectral analysis of spitzer images of the largemagellanic cloud. the power spectra of the fir emission show two differentpower laws. at larger scales (kpc) the slope is ~ -1.6, while at smaller ones(tens to few hundreds of parsecs) the slope is steeper, with a value ~ -2.9.the break occurs at a scale around 100-200 pc. we interpret this break as thescale height of the dust disk of the lmc. we perform high resolutionsimulations with and without stellar feedback. our amr hydrodynamic simulationsof model galaxies using the lmc mass and rotation curve, confirm that they havesimilar two-component power-laws for projected density and that the break doesindeed occur at the disk thickness. power spectral analysis of velocitiesbetrays a single power law for in-plane components. the vertical component ofthe velocity shows a flat behavior for large structures and a power law similarto the in-plane velocities at small scales. the motions are highly anisotropicat large scales, with in-plane velocities being much more important thanvertical ones. in contrast, at small scales, the motions become more isotropic.

1009.0142	galaxy formation hydrodynamics: from cosmic flows to star-forming clouds	major progress has been made over the last few years in understandinghydrodynamical processes on cosmological scales, in particular how galaxies gettheir baryons. there is increasing recognition that a large part of the baryonsaccrete smoothly onto galaxies, and that internal evolution processes play amajor role in shaping galaxies - mergers are not necessarily the dominantprocess. however, predictions from the various assembly mechanisms are still inlarge disagreement with the observed properties of galaxies in the nearbyuniverse. small-scale processes have a major impact on the global evolution ofgalaxies over a hubble time and the usual sub-grid models account for them in afar too uncertain way. understanding when, where and at which rate galaxiesformed their stars becomes crucial to understand the formation of galaxypopulations. i discuss recent improvements and current limitations in"resolved" modelling of star formation, aiming at explicitely capturingstar-forming instabilities, in cosmological and galaxy-sized simulations. suchmodels need to develop three-dimensional turbulence in the ism, which requiresparsec-scale resolution at redshift zero.

1012.5227	star formation in galaxy mergers: ism turbulence, dense gas excess, and  scaling relations for disks and starbusts	galaxy interactions and mergers play a significant, but still debated andpoorly understood role in the star formation history of galaxies. numerical andtheoretical models cannot yet explain the main properties of merger-inducedstarbursts, including their intensity and their spatial extent. usually, themechanism invoked in merger-induced starbursts is a global inflow of gastowards the central kpc, resulting in a nuclear starburst. we show here, usinghigh-resolution amr simulations and comparing to observations of the gascomponent in mergers, that the triggering of starbursts also results fromincreased ism turbulence and velocity dispersions in interacting systems. thisforms cold gas that are denser and more massive than in quiescent diskgalaxies. the fraction of dense cold gas largely increases, modifying theglobal density distribution of these systems, and efficient star formationresults. because the starbursting activity is not just from a global compactingof the gas to higher average surface densities, but also from higher turbulenceand fragmentation into massive and dense clouds, merging systems can enter adifferent regime of star formation compared to quiescent disk galaxies. this isin quantitative agreement with recent observations suggesting that diskgalaxies and starbursting systems are not the low-activity end andhigh-activity end of a single regime, but actually follow different scalingrelations for their star formation.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4195	the impact of ism turbulence, clustered star formation and feedback on  galaxy mass assembly through cold flows and mergers	two of the dominant channels for galaxy mass assembly are cold flows (coldgas supplied via the filaments of the cosmic web) and mergers. how theseprocesses combine in a cosmological setting, at both low and high redshift, toproduce the whole zoo of galaxies we observe is largely unknown. indeed thereis still much to understand about the detailed physics of each process inisolation. while these formation channels have been studied usinghydrodynamical simulations, here we study their impact on gas properties andstar formation (sf) with some of the first simulations that capture themultiphase, cloudy nature of the interstellar medium (ism), by virtue of theirhigh spatial resolution (and corresponding low temperature threshold). in thisregime, we examine the competition between cold flows and asupernovae(sne)-driven outflow in a very high-redshift galaxy (z {\approx} 9)and study the evolution of equal-mass galaxy mergers at low and high redshift,focusing on the induced sf. we find that sne-driven outflows cannot reduce thecold accretion at z {\approx} 9 and that sf is actually enhanced due to theensuing metal enrichment. we demonstrate how several recent observationalresults on galaxy populations (e.g. enhanced hcn/co ratios in ulirgs, aseparate kennicutt schmidt (ks) sequence for starbursts and the population ofcompact early type galaxies (etgs) at high redshift) can be explained withmechanisms captured in galaxy merger simulations, provided that the multiphasenature of the ism is resolved.

0709.3439	multiple minor mergers: formation of elliptical galaxies and constraints  for the growth of spiral disks	multiple, sequential mergers are unavoidable in the hierarchical build-uppicture of galaxies, in particular for the minor mergers that are frequent andhighly likely to have occured several times for most present-day galaxies.however, the effect of repeated minor mergers on galactic structure andevolution has not been studied systematically so far. we present a numericalstudy of multiple, subsequent, minor galaxy mergers, with various mass ratiosranging from 4:1 to 50:1. the n-body simulations include gas dynamics and starformation. we study the morphological and kinematical properties of theremnants, and show that several so-called "minor" mergers can lead to theformation of elliptical-like galaxies that have global morphological andkinematical properties similar to that observed in real elliptical galaxies.the properties of these systems are compared with those of elliptical galaxiesproduced by the standard scenario of one single major merger. we thus show thatrepeated minor mergers can theoretically form elliptical galaxies without majormergers, and can be more frequent than major mergers, in particular at moderateredshift. this process must then have formed some elliptical galaxies seentoday, and could in particular explain the high boxiness of massiveellipticals, and some fundamental relations observed in ellipticals. inaddition, because repeated minor mergers, even at high mass ratios, destroydisks into spheroids, these results indicate that spiral galaxies cannot havegrown only by a succession of minor mergers.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1106.5587	rotational support of giant clumps in high-z disc galaxies	we address the internal support against total free-fall collapse of the giantclumps that form by violent gravitational instability in high-z disc galaxies.guidance is provided by an analytic model, where the proto-clumps are cut froma rotating disc and collapse to equilibrium while preserving angular momentum.this model predicts prograde clump rotation. this is confirmed in hydro-amrzoom-in simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. in most high-zclumps, the centrifugal force dominates the support, r=vrot^2/vcirc^2 &gt; 0.5,where vrot is the rotation velocity and vcirc is the circular velocity. theclump spin indeed tends to be in the sense of the global disc angular momentum,but substantial tilts are frequent. most clumps are in jeans equilibrium, withthe rest of the support provided by turbulence. simulations of isolatedgas-rich discs that resolve the clump substructure reveal that the cosmologicalsimulations may overestimate r by ~30%, but the dominance of rotational supportat high-z is not a resolution artifact. in turn, isolated gas-poor discsimulations produce at z=0 smaller gaseous non-rotating transient clouds,indicating that the difference in rotational support is associated with thefraction of cold baryons in the disc. in our current cosmological simulations,the clump rotation velocity is typically vrot~100 km/s, but when beam smearingof \geq 0.1 arcsec is imposed, the rotation signal is reduced to a smallgradient of \leq 30 km/s/kpc across the clump. the velocity dispersion in thesimulated clumps is comparable to the disc dispersion so it is expected toleave only a marginal signal. retrograde minor-merging galaxies could lead tomassive clumps that do not show rotation.testable predictions of the scenarioas simulated are that the mean stellar age of the clumps, and the stellarfraction, are declining linearly with distance from the disc center.

1107.1483	black hole growth and agn obscuration by instability-driven inflows in  high-redshift disk galaxies fed by cold streams	disk galaxies at high redshift have been predicted to maintain high gassurface densities due to continuous feeding by intense cold streams leading toviolent gravitational instability, transient features and giant clumps.gravitational torques between the perturbations drive angular momentum out andmass in, and the inflow provides the energy for keeping strong turbulence. weuse analytic estimates of the inflow for a self-regulated unstable disk at atoomre stability parameter q~1, and isolated galaxy simulations capable ofresolving the nuclear inflow down to the central parsec. we predict an averageinflow rate ~10 msun/yr through the disk of a 10^11 msun galaxy, withconditions representative of z~2 stream-fed disks. the inflow rate scales withdisk mass and (1+z)^{3/2}. it includes clump migration and inflow of thesmoother component, valid even if clumps disrupt. this inflow grows the bulge,while only a fraction ~ 10^-3 of it needs to accrete onto a central black hole(bh), in order to obey the observed bh-bulge relation. a galaxy of 10^11 msunat z~2 is expected to host a bh of ~10^8 msun, accreting on average withmoderate sub-eddington luminosity l_x ~ 10^42-43 erg/s, accompanied by brighterepisodes when dense clumps coalesce. we note that in rare massive galaxies atz~6, the same process may feed 10^9 msun bh at the eddington rate. high centralgas column densities can severely obscure agn in high-redshift disks, possiblyhindering their detection in deep x-ray surveys.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1109.2588	candels: constraining the agn-merger connection with host morphologies  at z~2	using hst/wfc3 imaging taken as part of the cosmic assembly near-infrareddeep extragalactic legacy survey (candels), we examine the role that majorgalaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nuclei (agn) activity at z~2.our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (lx ~ 1e42-1e44 erg/s) agn at1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 that are selected using the 4 msec chandra observations in thechandra deep field south, the deepest x-ray observations to date. employingvisual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies ofthe agn host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216non-active galaxies at the same redshift. we find that most of the agn residein disk galaxies (51.4%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids(27.8%). roughly 16.7% of the agn hosts have highly disturbed morphologies andappear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts(55.6%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. these fractions arestatistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that showsimilar morphological disturbances. these results suggest that the hosts ofmoderate-luminosity agn are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing mergeror interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z~2. the highdisk fraction observed among the agn hosts also appears to be at odds withpredictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant agn fuelingmode at z~2, even at moderate x-ray luminosities. although we cannot rule outthat minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presenceof a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests thatsecular processes play a greater role in fueling agn activity at z~2 thanpreviously thought.

1110.4057	goods-herschel and candels: the morphologies of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies at z~2	using deep 100-160 micron observations in goods-s from the goods-h survey,combined with hst/wfc3 nir imaging from candels, we present the firstmorphological analysis of a complete, fir selected sample of 52 ulirgs at z~2.we also make use of a comparison sample of galaxies without herschel detectionsbut with the same z and magnitude distribution. our visual classifications ofthese two samples indicate that the fraction of objects with disk and spheroidmorphologies is roughly the same but that there are significantly more mergers,interactions, and irregular galaxies among the ulirgs. the combination of diskand irregular/interacting morphologies suggests that early stage interactionsand minor mergers could play an important role in ulirgs at z~2. we comparethese fractions with those of a z~1 sample across a wide luminosity range andfind that the fraction of disks decreases systematically with l_ir while thefraction of mergers and interactions increases, as has been observed locally.at comparable luminosities, the fraction of ulirgs with various morphologicalclassifications is similar at z~2 and z~1. we investigate the position of theulirgs, along with 70 lirgs, on the specific star formation rate versusredshift plane, and find 52 systems to be starbursts (lie more than a factor of3 above the main sequence relation). the morphologies of starbursts aredominated by interacting and merging systems (50%). if irregular disks areincluded as potential minor mergers, then we find that up to 73% of starburstsare involved in a merger or interaction at some level. although the finalcoalescence of a major merger may not be required for the high luminosities ofulirgs at z~2 as is the case locally, the large fraction of interactions at allstages and potential minor mergers suggest that the high star formation ratesof ulirgs are still largely externally triggered at z~2.

1111.0987	an observed link between active galactic nuclei and violent disk  instabilities in high-redshift galaxies	we provide evidence for a correlation between the presence of giant clumpsand the occurrence of active galactic nuclei (agn) in disk galaxies. giantclumps of 10^8-9 msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-richgalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feedsupermassive black holes (bh). we use emission line diagnostics to compare asample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disksat redshift z~0.7. the majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a highprobability of containing agn. their [oiii] emission line is strongly excited,inconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [neiii] excitation isalso higher. stable disks rarely have such properties. stacking ultra sensitivechandra observations (4 ms) reveals an x-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, whichcannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of agn. theclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical ofgas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the mainsequence of star formation. this suggests that our findings apply to thephysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z&gt;1. using theobserved [oiii] and x-ray luminosities, we conservatively estimate that agnhosted by clumpy disks have typical bolometric luminosities of the order of afew 10^43 erg/s, bh growth rates ~10^-2 msun/yr, and that these agn aresubstantially obscured in x-rays. this moderate-luminosity mode could besufficient to provide a large fraction of today's bh mass over a couple of gyrgiven that our observations suggest a high duty cycle (&gt;10%), accretion burstswith higher luminosities being possible over shorter phases. the observedevolution of disk instabilities with mass and redshift could explain thesimultaneous downsizing of star formation and of bh growth.

0710.3867	tidal debris from high-velocity collisions as fake dark galaxies: a  numerical model of virgohi21	high speed collisions, although current in clusters of galaxies, have longbeen neglected, as they are believed to cause little damages to galaxies,except when they are repeated, a process called harassment. in fact, they areable to produce faint but extended gaseous tails. such low-mass, starless,tidal debris may become detached and appear as free floating clouds in the verydeep hi surveys that are currently being carried out. we show in this paperthat these debris possess the same apparent properties as the so-called "darkgalaxies", objects originally detected in hi, with no optical counterpart, andpresumably dark matter dominated. we present a numerical model of the prototypeof such dark galaxies - virgohi21 -, that is able to reproduce its maincharacteristics: the one-sided tail linking it to the spiral galaxy ngc 4254,the absence of stars, and above all the reversal of the velocity gradient alongthe tail originally attributed to rotation motions caused by a massive darkmatter halo and which we find to be consistent with simple streaming motionsplus projection effects. according to our numerical simulations, this tidaldebris was expelled 750 myr ago during a fly-by at 1100 km/s of ngc 4254 by amassive companion which should now lie at a projected distance of about 400kpc. a candidate for the intruder is discussed. the existence of galaxies thathave never been able to form stars had already been challenged based ontheoretical and observational grounds. tidal collisions, in particular thoseoccurring at high speed, provide a much more simple explanation for the originof such putative dark galaxies.

1201.1079	a diversity of progenitors and histories for isolated spiral galaxies	we analyze a suite of 33 cosmological simulations of the evolution of milkyway-mass galaxies in low-density environments. our sample spans a broad rangeof hubble types at z=0, from nearly bulgeless disks to bulge-dominatedgalaxies. despite the fact that a large fraction of the bulge is typically inplace by z=1, we find no significant correlation between the morphology at z=1and at z=0. the z=1 progenitors of disk galaxies span a range of morphologies,including smooth disks, unstable disks, interacting galaxies andbulge-dominated systems. by z=0.5, spiral arms and bars are largely in placeand the progenitor morphology is correlated with the final morphology. we nextfocus on late-type galaxies with a bulge-to-total ratio b/t&lt;0.3 at z=0. theseshow a correlation between b/t at z=0 and the mass ratio of the largest mergerat z&lt;2, as well as with the gas accretion rate at z&gt;1. we find that thegalaxies with the lowest b/t tend to have a quiet baryon input history, with nomajor mergers at z&lt;2, and with a low and constant gas accretion rate that keepsa stable angular-momentum direction. more violent merger or gas accretionhistories lead to galaxies with more prominent bulges. most disk galaxies havea bulge sersic index n&lt;2. the galaxies with the highest bulge sersic index tendto have histories of intense gas accretion and disk instability rather thanactive mergers.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1209.4902	goods-herschel: impact of active galactic nuclei and star formation  activity on infrared spectral energy distributions at high redshift	we explore the effects of active galactic nuclei (agn) and star formationactivity on the infrared (0.3-1000 microns) spectral energy distributions ofluminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.5 to 4.0. we have compiled a large sampleof 151 galaxies selected at 24 microns (s24 &gt; 100 ujy) in the goods-n and ecdfsfields for which we have deep spitzer irs spectroscopy, allowing us todecompose the mid-ir spectrum into contributions from star formation and agnactivity. a significant portion (~25%) of our sample is dominated by an agn inthe mid-ir. based on the mid-ir classification, we divide our full sample intofour sub-samples: z~1 star-forming (sf) sources; z~2 sf sources; agn with clear9.7 micron silicate absorption; and agn with featureless mid-ir spectra. fromour large spectroscopic sample and wealth of multi-wavelength data, includingdeep herschel imaging at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns, we use 95galaxies with complete spectral coverage to create a composite spectral energydistribution (sed) for each sub-sample. we then fit a two-temperature componentmodified blackbody to the seds. we find that the ir seds have similar cold dusttemperatures, regardless of the mid-ir power source, but display a markeddifference in the warmer dust temperatures. we calculate the average effectivetemperature of the dust in each sub-sample and find a significant (~20 k)difference between the sf and agn systems. we compare our composite seds tolocal templates and find that local templates do not accurately reproduce themid-ir features and dust temperatures of our high redshift systems. highredshift ir luminous galaxies contain significantly more cool dust than theirlocal counterparts. we find that a full suite of photometry spanning the irpeak is necessary to accurately account for the dominant dust temperaturecomponents in high redshift ir luminous galaxies.

1210.4345	probing the star-formation modes in merging galaxies	merging systems at low redshift provide the unique opportunity to study theprocesses related to star formation in a variety of environments thatpresumably resemble those seen at higher redshifts. previous studies of distantstarbursting galaxies suggest that stars are born in turbulent gas, with ahigher efficiency than in mw-like spirals. we have investigated in detail theturbulent-driven regime of star-formation in nearby colliding galaxiescombining high resolution vla b array hi maps and uv galex observations. withthese data, we could check predictions of our state-of-the-art simulations ofmergers, such as the global sharp increase of the fraction of dense gas, astraced by the sfr, with respect to the diffuse gas traced by hi during themerging stage, following the increased velocity dispersion of the gas. wepresent here initial results obtained studying the sfr-hi relation at 4.5 kpcresolution. we determined sfr/hi mass ratios that are higher in the externalregions of mergers than in the outskirts of isolated spirals, though bothenvironments are hi dominated. sfr/hi increases towards the central regionsfollowing the decrease of the atomic gas fraction and possibly the increasedstar-formation efficiency. these results need to be checked with a largersample of systems and on smaller spatial scales. this is the goal of theon-going chaotic things project that ultimately will allow us to determine whystarbursting galaxies deviate from the kennicutt-schmidt relation between sfrdensity and gas surface density.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1306.2641	beyond the nuclear starburst? clustered star formation in major mergers	recent simulation work has successfully captured the formation of the starclusters that have been observed in merging galaxies. these studies, however,tend to focus on studying extreme starbursts, such as the antennae galaxies. weaim to establish whether there is something special occurring in these extremesystems or whether the mechanism for cluster formation is present in allmergers to a greater or lesser degree. we undertake a general study ofmerger-induced star formation in a sample of 5 pc resolution adaptive meshrefinement simulations of low redshift equal-mass mergers with randomly-chosenorbital parameters. we find that there is an enhanced mass fraction of verydense gas that appears as the gas density probability density function evolvesduring the merger. this finding has implications for the interpretation of someobservations; a larger mass fraction of dense gas could account for theenhanced hcn/co ratios seen in ulirgs and predicts that alpha_co is lower inmergers, as for a given mass of h_2, co emission will increase in a denserenvironment. we also find that as the star formation rate increases, there is acorrelated peak in the velocity dispersion of the gas, which we attribute toincreasing turbulence driven by the interaction itself. star formation tends tobe clumpy: in some cases there is extended clumpy star formation, but even whenstar formation is concentrated within the inner kpc (i.e. what may beconsidered a nuclear starburst) it still often has a clumpy, rather than asmooth, distribution. we find no strong evidence for a clear bimodality in thekennicutt-schmidt relation for the average mergers simulated here. instead,they are typically somewhat offset above the predicted quiescent relationduring their starbursts.

1307.7136	the long lives of giant clumps and the birth of outflows in gas-rich  galaxies at high redshift	star-forming disk galaxies at high redshift are often subject to violent diskinstability, characterized by giant clumps whose fate is yet to be understood.the main question is whether the clumps disrupt within their dynamicaltimescale (&lt;50myr), like molecular clouds in today's galaxies, or whether theysurvive stellar feedback for more than a disk orbital time (~300myr) in whichcase they can migrate inward and help building the central bulge. we present3.5-7pc resolution amr simulations of high-redshift disks includingphoto-ionization, radiation pressure, and supernovae feedback (renaud et al.2013, and perret et al., this astro-ph issue). our modeling of radiationpressure determines the mass loading and initial velocity of winds from basicphysical principles. we find that the giant clumps produce steady outflow ratescomparable to and sometimes somewhat larger than their star formation rate,with velocities largely sufficient to escape galaxy. the clumps also lose mass,especially old stars, by tidal stripping, and the stellar populations containedin the clumps hence remain relatively young (&lt;=200myr), as observed. the clumpssurvive gaseous outflows and stellar loss, because they are wandering ingas-rich turbulent disks from which they can re-accrete gas at high ratescompensating for outflows and tidal stripping, overall keeping realistic andself-regulated gaseous and stellar masses. our simulations produce gaseousoutflows with velocities, densities and mass loading consistent withobservations, and at the same time suggest that the giant clumps survive forhundreds of myr and complete their migration to the center of high-redshiftgalaxies, without rapid dispersion and reformation of clumps.

1402.1680	the role of turbulence in star formation laws and thresholds	the schmidt-kennicutt relation links the surface densities of gas to the starformation rate in galaxies. the physical origin of this relation, and inparticular its break, i.e. the transition between an inefficient regime at lowgas surface densities and a main regime at higher densities, remains debated.here, we study the physical origin of the star formation relations and breaksin several low-redshift galaxies, from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals. weuse numerical simulations representative of the milky way, the large and thesmall magellanic clouds with parsec up to subparsec resolution, and whichreproduce the observed star formation relations and the relative variations ofthe star formation thresholds. we analyze the role of interstellar turbulence,gas cooling, and geometry in drawing these relations, at 100 pc scale. wesuggest in particular that the existence of a break in the schmidt- kennicuttrelation could be linked to the transition from subsonic to supersonicturbulence and is independent of self-shielding effects. this transition beingconnected to the gas thermal properties and thus to the metallicity, the breakis shifted toward high surface densities in metal-poor galaxies, as observed indwarf galaxies. our results suggest that together with the collapse of cloudsunder self-gravity, turbulence (injected at galactic scale) can induce thecompression of gas and regulate star formation.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1412.3819	black hole growth and agn feedback under clumpy accretion	high-resolution simulations of supermassive black holes in isolated galaxieshave suggested the importance of short (~10 myr) episodes of rapid accretioncaused by interactions between the black hole and massive dense clouds withinthe host. accretion of such clouds could potentially provide the dominantsource for black hole growth in high-z galaxies, but it remains unresolved incosmological simulations. using a stochastic subgrid model calibrated byhigh-resolution isolated galaxy simulations, we investigate the impact thatvariability in black hole accretion rates has on black hole growth and theevolution of the host galaxy. we find this clumpy accretion to more efficientlyfuel high-redshift black hole growth. this increased mass allows for more rapidaccretion even in the absence of high-density clumps, compounding the effectand resulting in substantially faster overall black hole growth. this increasedgrowth allows the black hole to efficiently evacuate gas from the centralregion of the galaxy, driving strong winds up to ~2500 km/s, producing outflows~10x stronger than the smooth accretion case, suppressing the inflow of gasonto the host galaxy, and suppressing the star formation within the galaxy byas much as a factor of two. this suggests that the proper incorporation ofvariability is a key factor in the co-evolution between black holes and theirhosts.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1503.06220	a physical approach to the identification of high-z mergers:  morphological classification in the stellar mass domain	at z&gt;1, the distinction between merging and 'normal' star-forming galaxiesbased on single band morphology is often hampered by the presence of largeclumps which result in a disturbed, merger-like appearance even in rotationallysupported disks. in this paper we discuss how a classification based oncanonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar massmaps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification ofclumpy but not merging galaxies. we calibrate the mass-based selection ofmergers using the mirage hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated andmerging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}m_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3. thesesimulations are processed to reproduce the typical depth and spatial resolutionof observed hudf data. we test our approach on a sample of real z~2 galaxieswith kinematic classification into disks or mergers and on ~100 galaxies in thehudf field with photometric/spectroscopic redshift between 1.5$\leqslant z\leqslant$3 and $m&gt;10^{9.4}m_{sun}$. we find that a combination of theasymmetry $a_{mass}$ and $m_{20, mass}$ indices measured on the stellar massmaps can efficiently identify real (major) mergers with $\lesssim$20%contamination from clumpy disks in the merger sample. this mass-basedclassification cannot be reproduced in star-forming galaxies by $h-$bandmeasurements alone, which instead result in a contamination from clumpygalaxies that can be as high as 50%. moreover, we find that the mass-basedclassification always results in a lower contamination from clumpy galaxiesthan an $h-$band classification, regardless of the depth of the imaging used(e.g., candels vs. hudf).

1503.07660	bulge growth through disk instabilities in high-redshift galaxies	the role of disk instabilities, such as bars and spiral arms, and theassociated resonances, in growing bulges in the inner regions of disk galaxieshave long been studied in the low-redshift nearby universe. there it has longbeen probed observationally, in particular through peanut-shaped bulges. thissecular growth of bulges in modern disk galaxies is driven by weak,non-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudo-bulges at slow ratesand with long star-formation timescales. disk instabilities at high redshift(z&gt;1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (10^10 to a few 10^11 msun of stars)are very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. high-redshiftdisks are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 10^8-10^9msun of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxymorphologies. the clumps and other features associated to the violentinstability drive disk evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms,on short timescales. the giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into thebulge in a few 10^8 yr. the instability in the very turbulent media drivesintense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region. thick disks andsupermassive black holes can grow concurrently as a result of the violentinstability. this chapter reviews the properties of high-redshift diskinstabilities, the evolution of giant clumps and other features associated tothe instability, and the resulting growth of bulges and associated sub-galacticcomponents.

1510.07695	non-linear violent disc instability with high toomre's q in  high-redshift clumpy disc galaxies	we utilize zoom-in cosmological simulations to study the nature of violentdisc instability (vdi) in clumpy galaxies at high redshift, $z=1$--$5$. oursimulated galaxies are not in the ideal state assumed in toomre instability, oflinear fluctuations in an isolated, uniform, rotating disk. there, instabilityis characterised by a $q$ parameter below unity, and lower when the disk isthick. instead, the high-redshift discs are highly perturbed. over long periodsthey consist of non-linear perturbations, compact massive clumps and extendedstructures, with new clumps forming in inter-clump regions. this is while thegalaxy is subject to frequent external perturbances. we compute the local,two-component $q$ parameter for gas and stars, smoothed on a $\sim1~{\rm kpc}$scale to capture clumps of $10^{8-9}~{\rm m}_\odot$. the $q&lt;1$ regions areconfined to collapsed clumps due to the high surface density there, while theinter-clump regions show $q$ significantly higher than unity. tracing theclumps back to their relatively smooth lagrangian patches, we find that $q$prior to clump formation typically ranges from unity to a few. this is unlikethe expectations from standard toomre instability. we discuss possiblemechanisms for high-$q$ clump formation, e.g. rapid turbulence decay leading tosmall clumps that grow by mergers, non-axisymmetric instability, or clumpformation induced by non-linear perturbations in the disk. alternatively, thehigh-$q$ non-linear vdi may be stimulated by the external perturbations such asmergers and counter-rotating streams. the high $q$ may represent excessivecompressive modes of turbulence, possibly induced by tidal interactions.

1511.05574	a formation scenario for the disk of satellites: accretion of satellites  during mergers	the disk of satellites (dos) observed in the andromeda galaxy is a thin andextended group of satellites, nearly perpendicular to the disk plane, thatshare a common direction of rotation about the centre of andromeda. although ados is also observed in the milky way galaxy, the prevalance of such structuresin more distant galaxies remains controversial. explanations for the formationof such doss vary widely from filamentary infall, or flattening due to thepotential field from large scale structure, to galaxy interactions in a mondianparadigm. here we present an alternative scenario -- during a merger, a galaxymay bring its own satellite population when merging with another galaxy. wedemonstrate how, under the correct circumstances, during the coalescence of thetwo galaxies, the satellite population can be spread into an extended,flattened structure, with a common direction of rotation about the mergerremnant. we investigate the key parameters of the interaction, and thesatellite population, that are required to form a dos in this scenario.

0807.1693	numerical simulations of galaxy evolution in cosmological context	large volume cosmological simulations succeed in reproducing the large-scalestructure of the universe. however, they lack resolution and may not take intoaccount all relevant physical processes to test if the detail properties ofgalaxies can be explained by the cdm paradigm. on the other hand, galaxy-scalesimulations could resolve this in a robust way but do not usually include arealistic cosmological context.  to study galaxy evolution in cosmological context, we use a new method thatconsists in coupling cosmological simulations and galactic scale simulations.for this, we record merger and gas accretion histories from cosmologicalsimulations and re-simulate at very high resolution the evolution of baryonsand dark matter within the virial radius of a target galaxy. this allows us forexample to better take into account gas evolution and associated starformation, to finely study the internal evolution of galaxies and their disksin a realistic cosmological context.  we aim at obtaining a statistical view on galaxy evolution from z = 2 to 0,and we present here the first results of the study: we mainly stress theimportance of taking into account gas accretion along filaments to understandgalaxy evolution.

0808.0716	bulge formation by the coalescence of giant clumps in primordial disk  galaxies	gas-rich disks in the early universe are highly turbulent and have giantstar-forming clumps. models suggest the clumps form by gravitationalinstabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then theyinteract, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge.here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. they areall thick, slowly rotating, and have a high sersic index, like classicalbulges. their rapid formation should also give them relatively highalpha-element abundances. we consider fourteen low-resolution models and fourhigh-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. all models havean active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk, three of the models have apre-existing bulge and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. all show thesame basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumpsare quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. the coalescence ofmassive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in termsof orbital mixing. it differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark mattercomponent, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. normal supernova feedbackhas little effect because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightlybound clumps. a variety of indirect observations support the model, includingclumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relativelylittle dark matter.

astro-ph;0408524	a top-down scenario for the formation of massive tidal dwarf galaxies	among those objects formed out of collisional debris during galaxy mergers,the prominent gaseous accumulations observed near the tip of some long tidaltails are the most likely to survive long enough to form genuine recycledgalaxies. using simple numerical models, bournaud, duc &amp; masset (2003) claimedthat tidal objects as massive as 10^9 msun could only form, in thesesimulations, within extended dark matter (dm) haloes. we present here a new setof simulations of galaxy collisions to further investigate the structure oftidal tails. first of all, we checked that massive objects are still producedin full n-body codes that include feedback and a large number of particles.using a simpler n-body code with rigid haloes, we noticed that dissipation andself-gravity in the tails, although important, are not the key factors.exploiting toy models, we found that, for truncated dm haloes, material isstretched along the tail, while, within extended haloes, the tidal field canefficiently carry away from the disk a large fraction of the gas, whilemaintaining its surface density to a high value. this creates a densityenhancement near the tip of the tail. only later-on, self-gravity takes over;the gas clouds collapse and start forming stars. thus, such objects werefundamentally formed following a kinematical process, according to a top-downscenario, contrary to the less massive super star clusters that are alsopresent around mergers. this conclusion leads us to introduce a restrictivedefinition for tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs) and their progenitors, consideringonly the most massive ones, initially mostly made of gas, that were able topile up in the tidal tails. more simulations will be necessary to preciselydetermine the fate of these proto--tdgs and estimate their number.
