0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0905.1577	spitzer quasar and ulirg evolution study (quest). iv. comparison of 1-jy  ultraluminous infrared galaxies with palomar-green quasars	we report the results from a comprehensive study of 74 ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs) and 34 palomar-green (pg) quasars within z ~ 0.3$ observedwith the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). the contribution of nuclearactivity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using sixindependent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent resultswithin ~ +/-10-15% on average. the average derived agn contribution in ulirgsis ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among "cool" (f_25/f_60 =&lt; 0.2) opticallyclassified hii-like and liner ulirgs to ~50 and ~75% among warm seyfert 2 andseyfert 1 ulirgs, respectively. this number exceeds ~80% in pg qsos. ulirgsfall in one of three distinct agn classes: (1) objects with small extinctionsand large pah equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systemswith large extinctions and modest pah equivalent widths have larger agncontributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ulirgs withboth small extinctions and small pah equivalent widths host agn that are atleast as powerful as the starbursts. the agn contributions in class 2 ulirgsare more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule outthe possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type ofulirgs. a morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), ingeneral agreement with the standard ulirg - qso evolution scenario andsuggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages ofmerger evolution. however, the scatter in this sequence, implies that blackhole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strongchaotic/random component, as in local agn.

0906.3157	a deep hst h-band imaging survey of massive gas-rich mergers. ii. the  quest pg qsos	we report the results from a deep hst nicmos h-band imaging survey of 28 z &lt;0.3 qsos from the palomar-green (pg) sample. this program is part of quest(quasar / ulirg evolution study) and complements a similar set of data on 26highly-nucleated ulirgs presented in paper i. our analysis indicates that thefraction of qsos with elliptical hosts is higher among qsos with undetectedfar-infrared (fir) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. thehosts of fir-faint qsos show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-inducedmorphological anomalies and larger qso-to-host luminosity ratios on averagethan the hosts of fir-bright qsos, consistent with late-merger evolution fromfir-bright to fir-faint qsos. the spheroid sizes and total host luminosities ofthe radio-quiet pg qsos in our sample are statistically indistinguishable fromthe ulirg hosts presented in paper i, while those of radio-loud pg qsos aresystematically larger and more luminous. ulirgs and pg qsos with ellipticalhosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactivespheroids. we confirm the systematic trend noted in paper i for objects withsmall (&lt; 2 kpc) spheroids to be up to ~1 mag. brighter than inactive spheroids.the host colors and wavelength dependence of their sizes support the idea thatthese deviations are due at least in part to non-nuclear star formation.however, the amplitudes of these deviations does not depend on host r-h colors.taken at face value (i.e., no correction for extinction or the presence of ayoung stellar population), the h-band spheroid-host luminosities imply bhmasses ~5 -- 200 x 10^7 m_sun and sub-eddington mass accretion rates for bothqsos and ulirgs. these results are compared with published bh mass estimatesderived from other methods.

0906.4110	a backward evolution model for infrared surveys: the role of agn- and  color-l_tir distributions	empirical "backward" galaxy evolution models for infrared bright galaxies areconstrained using multi-band infrared surveys. we developed a new monte-carloalgorithm for this task, implementing luminosity dependent distributionfunctions for the galaxies' infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) andfor the agn contribution, allowing for evolution of these quantities. theadopted seds take into account the contributions of both starbursts and agn tothe infrared emission, for the first time in a coherent treatment rather thaninvoking separate agn and star-forming populations. in the first part of thepaper we consider the quantification of the agn contribution for local universegalaxies, as a function of total infrared luminosity. it is made using a largesample of lirgs and ulirgs for which mid-infrared spectra are available in thespitzer archive. in the second part we present the model. our best-fit modeladopts very strong luminosity evolution, $l=l_0(1+z)^{3.4}$, up to $z=2.3$, anddensity evolution, $\rho=\rho_0(1+z)^2$, up to $z=1$, for the population ofinfrared galaxies. at higher $z$, the evolution rates drop as $(1+z)^{-1}$ and$(1+z)^{-1.5}$ respectively. to reproduce mid-infrared to submillimeter numbercounts and redshift distributions, it is necessary to introduce both anevolution in the agn contribution and an evolution in theluminosity-temperature relation. our models are in plausible agreement withcurrent photometry-based estimates of the typical agn contribution as afunction of mid-infrared flux, and well placed to be compared to upcomingspitzer spectroscopic results. as an example of future applications, we use ourbest-fitting model to make predictions for surveys with herschel.

0908.0280	enhanced star formation in narrow line seyfert 1 agn revealed by spitzer	we present new low resolution spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sampleof 20 rosat selected local narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s). we detectstrong agn continuum in all and clear pah emission in 70% of the sources. the6.2 micron pah luminosity spans three orders of magnitudes, from ~10^(39) erg/sto ~10^(42) erg/s providing strong evidence for intense ongoing star formationin the circumnuclear regions of these sources. using the irs/spitzer archive wegather a large number of additional nls1s and their broad line counterparts(bls1s) and constructed nls1 and bls1 sub-samples to compare them in variousways. the comparison shows a clear separation according to fwhm(h_beta) suchthat objects with narrower broad h_beta lines are the strongest pah emitters.we test this division in various ways trying to remove biases due to luminosityand aperture size. specifically, we find that star formation activity aroundnls1 agn is larger than around bls1 of the same agn luminosity. the aboveresult seems to hold over the entire range of distance and luminosity. moreoverthe star formation rate is higher in low black hole mass and high l/l_eddsystems indicating that black hole growth and star formation are occurringsimultaneously.

0704.1559	dust covering factor, silicate emission and star formation in luminous  qsos	we present spitzer irs low resolution, mid-ir spectra of a sample of 25 highluminosity qsos at 2&lt;z&lt;3.5. when combined with archival irs observations oflocal, low luminosity type-i agns, the sample spans five orders of magnitude inluminosity. we find that the continuum dust thermal emission atlambda(rest)=6.7um is correlated with the optical luminosity, following thenon-linear relation l(6.7um) propto l(5100a)^0.82. we also find an anticorrelation between the ratio l(6.7um)/l(5100a) and the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity. these effects are interpreted as a decreasing covering factor ofthe circumnuclear dust as a function of luminosity. such a result is inagreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed agns as a function ofluminosity recently found in various surveys. we clearly detect the silicateemission feature in the average spectrum, but also in four individual objects.these are the silicate emission in the most luminous objects obtained so far.when combined with the silicate emission observed in local, low luminositytype-i agns, we find that the silicate emission strength is correlated withluminosity.  the silicate strength of all type-i agns also follows a positive correlationwith the black hole mass and with the accretion rate. the polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission features, expected from starburst activity, are notdetected in the average spectrum of luminous, high-z qsos. the upper limitinferred from the average spectrum points to a ratio between pah luminosity andqso optical luminosity significantly lower than observed in lower luminosityagns, implying that the correlation between star formation rate and agn powersaturates at high luminosities.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

(2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3317	clouds, filaments and protostars: the herschel hi-gal milky way	we present the first results from the science demonstration phase for thehi-gal survey, the herschel key-project that will map the inner galactic planeof the milky way in 5 bands. we outline our data reduction strategy and presentsome science highlights on the two observed 2{\deg} x 2{\deg} tilesapproximately centered at l=30{\deg} and l=59{\deg}. the two regions areextremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows awidespread organization in filaments. source seds can be built for hundreds ofobjects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a goodfraction of them where the distance could be estimated. the compact sources(which we will call 'cores' in the following) are found for the most part to beassociated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averagedcolumn density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when athreshold around a_v of about 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l=59{\deg}field; a a_v value between 5 and 10 is found for the l=30{\deg} field, likelydue to the relatively larger distances of the sources. this outlines anexciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, whichlater fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level.in spite of core l/m ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, wefind core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. our results are ingood agreement with recent mhd numerical simulations of filaments forming fromlarge-scale converging flows.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.3846	a first glimpse into the far-ir properties of high-z uv-selected  galaxies: herschel/pacs observations of z~3 lbgs	we present first insights into the far-ir properties for a sample of irac andmips-24um detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 3, as derived fromobservations in the northern field of the great observatories origins survey(goods-n) carried out with the pacs instrument on board the herschel spaceobservatory. although none of our galaxies are detected by herschel, we employa stacking technique to construct, for the first time, the average spectralenergy distribution of infrared luminous lbgs from uv to radio wavelengths. wederive a median ir luminosity of l_{ir} = 1.6 x 10^12 lo, placing thepopulation in the class of ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs).complementing our study with existing multi-wavelength data, we put constraintson the dust temperature of the population and find that for their l_{ir},mips-lbgs are warmer than submm-luminous galaxies while they fall in the locusof the l_{ir}-t_{d} relation of the local ulirgs. this, along with estimatesbased on the average sed, explains the marginal detection of lbgs in currentsub-mm surveys and suggests that these latter studies introduce a bias towardsthe detection of colder ulirgs in the high-z universe, while missing high-zulirgs with warmer dust.

1008.1753	herschel fir counterparts of selected ly-alpha emitters at z~2.2. fast  evolution since z~3 or missed obscured agns?	ly-alpha emitters (laes) are seen everywhere in the redshift domain fromlocal to z~7. far-infrared (fir) counterparts of laes at different epochs couldprovide direct clues on dust content, extinction, and spectral energydistribution (sed) for these galaxies. we search for fir counterparts of laesthat are optically detected in the goods-north field at redshift z~2.2 usingdata from the herschel space telescope with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs). the lae candidates were isolated via color-magnitudediagram using the medium-band photometry from the alhambra survey, ancillarydata on goods-north, and stellar population models. according to the fitting ofthese spectral synthesis models and fir/optical diagnostics, most of them seemto be obscured galaxies whose spectra are agn-dominated. from the analysis ofthe optical data, we have observed a fraction of agn or composite over sourcetotal number of ~0.75 in the lae population at z~2.2, which is marginallyconsistent with the fraction previously observed at z=2.25 and even at lowredshift (0.2&lt;z&lt;0.45), but significantly different from the one observed atredshift ~3, which could be compatible either with a scenario of rapid changein the agn fraction between the epochs involved or with a non detection ofobscured agn in other z=2-3 lae samples due to lack of deep fir observations.we found three robust fir (pacs) counterparts at z~2.2 in goods-north. thisdemonstrates the possibility of finding dust emission in laes even at higherredshifts.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1012.1891	mid-infrared spectral diagnostics of luminous infrared galaxies	we present a statistical analysis of the mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 248luminous infrared (ir) galaxies (lirgs) which comprise the great observatoriesall-sky lirg survey (goals) observed with the infrared spectrograph (irs)on-board the spitzer space telescope. the goals sample enables a directmeasurement of the relative contributions of star-formation and active galacticnuclei (agn) to the total ir emission from a large sample of local lirgs. theagn contribution to the mir emission (f-agn) is estimated by employing severaldiagnostics based on the properties of the [nev], [oiv] and [neii] finestructure gas emission lines, the 6.2 microns pah and the shape of the mircontinuum. we find that 18% of all lirgs contain an agn and that in 10% of allsources the agn contributes more than 50% of the total ir luminosity. summingup the total ir luminosity contributed by agn in all our sources suggests thatagn supply ~12% of the total energy emitted by lirgs. the average spectrum ofsources with an agn looks similar to the average spectrum of sources without anagn, but it has lower pah emission and a flatter mir continuum. agn dominatedlirgs have higher ir luminosities, warmer mir colors and are found ininteracting systems more often than pure starbursts lirgs. however we find nolinear correlations between these properties and f-agn. we used the irac colorsof lirgs to confirm that finding agn on the basis of their mir colors may miss~40% of agn dominated (u)lirgs

1101.0628	far-infrared line deficits in galaxies with extreme lfir/mh2 ratios	we report initial results from the far-infrared fine structure lineobservations of a sample of 44 local starbursts, seyfert galaxies and infraredluminous galaxies obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board herschel. weshow that the ratio between the far-infrared luminosity and the molecular gasmass, lfir/mh2, is a much better proxy for the relative brightness of thefar-infrared lines than lfir alone. galaxies with high lfir/mh2 ratios tend tohave weaker fine structure lines relative to their far-infrared continuum thangalaxies with lfir/mh2 &lt; 80 lsun/msun. a deficit of the [c ii] 158 micron linerelative to lfir was previously found with the iso satellite, but now we showfor the first time that this is a general aspect of all far-infrared finestructure lines, regardless of their origin in the ionized or neutral phase ofthe interstellar medium. the lfir/mh2 value where these line deficits start tomanifest is similar to the limit that separates between the two modes of starformation recently found in galaxies on the basis of studies of their gas-starformation relations. our finding that the properties of the interstellar mediumare also significantly different in these regimes provides independent supportfor the different star forming relations in normal disk galaxies and majormerger systems. we use the spectral synthesis code cloudy to model the emissionof the lines. the expected increase of the ionization parameter with lfir/mh2can simultaneously explain the line deficits in the [c ii], [n ii] and [o i]lines.

1102.1974	arp220: extinction and merger-induced star formation	we analyse new spatially resolved integral field spectroscopic h- and k-banddata at a resolution of 0.3arcsec (100pc) and re-analyse interferometricco(2-1) line observations of the prototypical merging system arp220. we findthat the majority of the k-band luminosity is due to a 10myr old starburst,with a significant contribution from an underlying ca 1gyr old stellarpopulation, and a small contribution from stars less than 8myr old. thecalzetti (2000) reddening law provides the best fit to photometric datapointsspanning 0.45um -- 2.12um. furthermore, estimates of the bolometric luminosityfrom iras fluxes in conjunction with our stellar population analysis indicatethat we observe less than 10% of the emitted k-band light. the stellar andco(2-1) kinematic centre of the western nucleus coincides with the compact hotdust emission, indicating that the latter marks the centre of the gravitationalpotential. in the eastern nucleus, the co(2-1) data are well matched by a modelin which the gas orbits around the peak of the dust emission. this, and thesimilarity of the k-band tracer kinematics, shows that despite the irregularmorphology, the eastern nucleus is also a kinematically coherent structure.comparison of the extinction map and ew_co and ew_br-gamma maps indicates thatthe lower half of the eastern nucleus is significantly more extincted than theupper half, suggesting that the lower half is buried in the larger-scale gasdisk.

1105.1731	massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in ulirgs observed by  herschel-pacs	mass outflows driven by stars and active galactic nuclei are a key element inmany current models of galaxy evolution. they may produce the observed blackhole-galaxy mass relation and regulate and quench both star formation in thehost galaxy and black hole accretion. however, observational evidence of suchfeedback processes through outflows of the bulk of the star forming moleculargas is still scarce. here we report the detection of massive molecularoutflows, traced by the hydroxyl molecule (oh), in far-infrared spectra ofulirgs obtained with herschel-pacs as part of the shining key project. in someof these objects the (terminal) outflow velocities exceed 1000 km/s, and theiroutflow rates (up to ~1200 m_sol/yr) are several times larger than their starformation rates. we compare the outflow signatures in different types of ulirgsand in starburst galaxies to address the issue of the energy source (agn orstarburst) of these outflows. we report preliminary evidence that ulirgs with ahigher agn luminosity (and higher agn contribution to l_ir) have higherterminal velocities and shorter gas depletion time scales. the outflows in theobserved ulirgs are able to expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres ofthese objects within ~1e6-1e8 years.

1105.4093	the pep survey: clustering of infrared-selected galaxies and structure  formation at z~2 in the goods south	abridged-this paper presents the first direct estimate of the 3d clusteringproperties of far-infrared sources up to z~3. this has been possible thanks tothe pacs evolutionary probe (pep) survey of the goods south field performedwith the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite. an analysis of thetwo-point correlation function over the whole redshift range spanned by thedata reports for the correlation length, r_0~6.3 mpc and r_0~6.7 mpc,respectively at 100um and 160um, corresponding to dark matter halo massesm&gt;~10^{12.4} m_sun. objects at z~2 instead seem to be more strongly clustered,with r_0~19 mpc and r_0~17 mpc in the two considered pacs channels. thisdramatic increase of the correlation length between z~1 and z~2 is connectedwith the presence of a wide, m&gt;~10^{14} m_sun, filamentary structure whichincludes more than 50% of the sources detected at z~2. an investigation of theproperties of such sources indicates the possibility for boosted star-formingactivity in those which reside within the overdense environment with respect ofmore isolated galaxies found in the same redshift range. lastly, we alsopresent our results on the evolution of the relationship between luminous anddark matter in star-forming galaxies between z~1 and z~2. we find that theincrease of (average) stellar mass in galaxies &lt;m*&gt; between z~1 and z~2 isabout a factor 10 lower than that of the dark matter haloes hosting suchobjects (&lt;m*&gt;[z~1]/&lt;m*&gt;[z~2] ~ 0.4 vs m_{halo}[z~1]/m_{halo}[z~2] ~ 0.04). ourfindings agree with the evolutionary picture of downsizing whereby massivegalaxies at z~2 were more actively forming stars than their z~1 counterparts,while at the same time contained a lower fraction of their mass in the form ofluminous matter.

1106.1186	the impact of evolving infrared spectral energy distributions of  galaxies on star formation rate estimates	we combine herschel-pacs data from the pep program with spitzer 24 um and 16um photometry and ultra deep irs mid-infrared spectra, to measure the mid- tofar-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) of 0.7&lt;z&lt;2.5 normal starforming galaxies around the main sequence (the redshift-dependent relation ofstar formation rate and stellar mass). our deep data confirm from individualfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated ifbased on 24 um fluxes and sed templates that are calibrated via local trendswith luminosity. galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nulnu(8) to 8-1000um infrared luminosity (lir) tend to lie along lines of constant offset fromthe main sequence. we explore the relation between sed shape and offset inspecific star formation rate (ssfr) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.main sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nulnu(8)/lir regardless of lirand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nulnu(8)/lir decreases with increasing offsetabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. weprovide a redshift-independent calibration of sed templates in the range of8--60 um as a function of log(ssfr) offset from the main sequence. redshiftdependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.ultra deep irs spectra match these sed trends well and verify that they aremostly due to a change in ratio of pah to lir rather than continua of hiddenagn. alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nulnu(8)/lir on lir. samenulnu(8)/lir is reached at increasingly higher lir at higher redshift, withshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(lir) at redshifts z~1 andz~2. corresponding sed template calibrations are provided for use if no stellarmasses are in hand. for most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also hostan agn, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component.

1107.2570	the star formation reference survey. i. survey description and basic  data	star formation is arguably the most important physical process in the cosmos.it is a fundamental driver of galaxy evolution and the ultimate source of mostof the energy emitted by galaxies. a correct interpretation of star formationrate (sfr) measures is therefore essential to our understanding of galaxyformation and evolution. unfortunately, however, no single sfr estimator isuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerousgalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yieldsignificant detections with most standard sfr measures, and until now therehave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span allthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. to address this needin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. this project, the star formationreference survey (sfrs), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearbygalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, sfr, andspecific sfr. furthermore, because the sfrs is blind with respect to agnfraction and environment it serves as a means to assess the influence of thesefactors on sfr. our panchromatic global flux measurements (including galexfuv+nuv, sdss ugriz, 2mass jhks, spitzer 3-8{\mu}m, and others) furnish uniformsfr measures and the context in which their reliability can be assessed. thispaper describes the sfrs survey strategy, defines the sample, and presents themulti-band photometry collected to date.

1108.3122	fir measurements of ly-$\alpha$ emitters at z$\lesssim$1.0: dust  attenuation from pacs-\emph{herschel}	one remaining open question regarding the physical properties of ly$\alpha$emitters (laes) is their dust content and its evolution with redshift. thevariety of results is large and with those reported by now is difficult toestablish clear relations between dust, other fundamental parameters ofgalaxies (star-formation rate, metallicity or age) and redshift. in thisletter, we report \emph{herschel} pacs-100$\mu$m, pacs-160$\mu$m and\emph{spitzer} mips-24$\mu$m detections of a sample of spectroscopicallygalex-selected laes at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0. five out of ten and one out oftwo laes are detected in, at least, one pacs band at z$\sim$0.3 and $\sim$1.0,respectively. these measurements have a great importance given that they allowus to quantify, for the first time, the dust content of laes from direct firobservations. mips-24$\mu$m detections allow us to determine ir properties ofthe pacs-undetected laes. we obtain that mid-ir/fir detected star-forming (sf)laes at z$\sim$0.3 have dust content within 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$$\lesssim$2.0, with a median value of a$_{1200\textrm{\aa}}$$\sim$1.1. thisrange broadens out to 0.75$\lesssim$ $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$2.5 whenconsidering those laes at z$\sim$1.0. only one sf lae is undetected both inmips-24$\mu$m and pacs, with $a_{1200\aa}$ $\lesssim$0.75. these results seemto be larger than those reported for high-redshift laes and, therefore,although an evolutionary trend is not clearly seen, it could point out thatlow-redshift laes are dustier than high-redshift ones. however, the diversemethods used could introduce a systematic offset in the results.

1201.4394	enhanced star formation rates in agn hosts with respect to inactive  galaxies from pep-herschel observations	we compare the average star formation (sf) activity in x-ray selected agnhosts with mass-matched control inactive galaxies,including star forming andquiescent sources, at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5. recent observations carried out by pacs, the60-210um herschel photometric camera, in goods-s, goods-n and cosmos allow usto unbiasedly estimate the far-ir luminosity, and hence the sf properties, ofthe two samples. accurate agn host stellar masses are measured by decomposingtheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components. we find a higheraverage sf activity in agn hosts with respect to non-agns. the level of sfenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low x-ray luminosities(lx&lt;~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at &gt;10sigma) for bright agns.however, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, agn hosts are broadlyconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. we investigate the relativefar-ir luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find ahigher fraction of pacs detected, hence normal and highly star forming systemsamong agn hosts. although different interpretations are possible, we explainour findings as a consequence of a twofold agn growth path: faint agns evolvethrough secular processes, with instantaneous agn accretion not tightly linkedto the current total sf in the host, while luminous agns co-evolve with theirhosts through periods of enhanced agn activity and sf, possibly through majormergers. while an increased sf with respect to non-agns of similar mass isexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest sf offsets measured in low-lxagn hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and sf historiesin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous sfand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)mechanisms. far-ir luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.

1202.0761	a herschel view of the far-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies	we study a sample of 61 submillimetre galaxies (smgs) selected fromground-based surveys, with known spectroscopic redshifts and observed withherschel as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key programmes. we use the broadfar-infrared wavelength coverage (100-600um) provided by the combination ofpacs and spire observations. using a power-law temperature distribution modelto derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dustemissivity spectral index for smgs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. our results unveil thediversity of the smg population. some smgs exhibit extreme infraredluminosities of ~10^13 lsun and relatively warm dust components, while othersare fainter (~10^12 lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. theextreme infrared luminosities of some smgs (lir&gt;10^12.7 lsun, 26/61 systems)imply sfrs of &gt;500msun yr^-1. such high sfrs are difficult to reconcile with asecular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-drivenstage in the evolution of these galaxies. another observational argument infavour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than thatof smgs of lower luminosities (~40k as opposed to ~25k), consistent withobservations of local ulirgs triggered by major mergers and with results fromhydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfercalculations. luminous smgs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxiesin the stellar mass-sfr plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburstevents with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. onthe other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity smgs havecold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of starformation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.[abridged]

1202.0997	pacs-herschel fir detections of lyman-alpha emitters at 2.0&lt;z&lt;3.5	in this work we analyze the physical properties of a sample of 56spectroscopically selected star-forming (sf) ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies at2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 using both a spectral energy distribution (sed)fitting procedure from rest-frame uv to mid-ir and direct 160$\mu$mobservations taken with the photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs)instrument onboard \emph{herschel space observatory}. we define laes as thosely$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths(ly$\alpha$ ew$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\aa, the typical threshold innarrow-band searches. ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with ly$\alpha$ew$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-laes. as a result of an individual sed fittingfor each object, we find that the studied sample of laes contains galaxies withages mostly below 100myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, sfrs, andstellar masses. the heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen inthe morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. inthis way, we find that laes at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. furthermore,the main difference between laes and non-laes is their dust attenuation,because laes are not as dusty as non-laes. on the fir side, four galaxies ofthe sample (two laes and two non-laes) have pacs-fir counterparts. their totalir luminosity place all of them in the ulirg regime and are all dusty objects,with a$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. this is an indication from direct firmeasurements that dust and ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. thispopulation of red and dusty laes is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting anevolution with redshift of the ir nature of galaxies selected via theirly$\alpha$ emission.

1202.5746	herschel-pacs observations of far-ir co line emission in ngc 1068:  highly excited molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk	we report the detection of far-ir co rotational emission from theprototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. using herschel-pacs, we have detected11 transitions in the j_upper=14-30 (e_upper/k_b = 580-2565 k) range, all ofwhich are consistent with arising from within the central 10" (700 pc). thedetected transitions are modeled as arising from 2 different components: amoderate excitation (me) component close to the galaxy systemic velocity, and ahigh excitation (he) component that is blueshifted by ~80 km s^{-1}. we employa large velocity gradient (lvg) model and derive n_h2~10^{5.6} cm^{-3},t_kin~170 k, and m_h2~10^{6.7} m_sun for the me component, and n_h2~10^{6.4}cm^{-3}, t_kin~570 k, and m_h2~10^{5.6} m_sun for the he component, althoughfor both components the uncertainties in the density and mass are plus/minus(0.6-0.9) dex. we compare the co line profiles with those of other moleculartracers observed at higher spatial and spectral resolution, and find that theme transitions are consistent with these lines arising in the ~200 pc diameterring of material traced by h_2 1-0 s(1) observations. the blueshift of the helines may also be consistent with the bluest regions of this h_2 ring, but abetter kinematic match is found with a clump of infalling gas ~40 pc north ofthe agn. we discuss the prospects of placing the he component near the agn, andconclude that while the moderate thermal pressure precludes an association withthe ~1 pc radius h_2o maser disk, the he component could potentially be locatedonly a few parsecs more distant from the agn, and might then provide then_h~10^{25} cm^{-2} column obscuring the nuclear hard x-rays. finally, we alsoreport sensitive upper limits extending up to j_upper=50, which placeconstraints on a previous model prediction for the co emission from the x-rayobscuring torus.

1203.6069	the mean star formation rate of x-ray selected active galaxies and its  evolution from z=2.5: results from pep-herschel	(abridged) we study relationships between the sfr and the nuclear propertiesof x-ray selected agns out to z=2.5, using far-ir data in three extragalacticdeep fields as part of the pacs evolutionary probe (pep) program. guided bystudies of intrinsic infra-red agn seds, we show that the majority of the firemission in agns is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation. we uncovercharacteristic redshift-dependent trends between the mean fir luminosity(l_fir) and accretion luminosity (l_agn) of agns. at low agn luminosities,accretion and sfr are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenariowhere most low-luminosity agns are primarily fueled by secular processes intheir host galaxies. at high agn luminosities, a significant correlation isobserved between l_fir and l_agn, but only among agns at low and moderateredshifts (z&lt;1). we interpret this as a signature of the increasing importanceof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes(smbhs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high agn luminosities.however, we also find that the enhancement of sfr in luminous agns weakens ordisappears at high redshifts (z&gt;1). this suggests that the role of mergers insmbh-galaxy co-evolution is less important at these epochs. at all redshifts,we find essentially no relationship between l_fir and nuclear obscurationacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting thatvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring x-raysin active galaxies. we explain our results within a scenario in which twodifferent modes of smbh fueling operate among low- and high-luminosity agns. wepostulate, guided by emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshiftgalaxies, that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity agnsevolves with redshift.

1204.0782	physical properties of lyman-alpha emitters at $z\sim 0.3$ from  uv-to-fir measurements	the analysis of the physical properties of low-redshift ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) can provide clues in the study of their high-redshift analogues. at $z\sim 0.3$, laes are bright enough to be detected over almost the entireelectromagnetic spectrum and it is possible to carry out a more precise andcomplete study than at higher redshifts. in this study, we examine the uv andir emission, dust attenuation, sfr and morphology of a sample of 23galex-discovered star-forming (sf) laes at $z \sim 0.3$ with direct uv (galex),optical (acs) and fir (pacs and mips) data. using the same uv and ir limitingluminosities, we find that laes at $z\sim 0.3$ tend to be less dusty, haveslightly higher total sfrs, have bluer uv continuum slopes, and are muchsmaller than other galaxies that do not exhibit ly$\alpha$ emission in theirspectrum (non-laes). these results suggest that at $z \sim 0.3$ ly$\alpha$photons tend to escape from small galaxies with low dust attenuation. regardingtheir morphology, laes belong to irr/merger classes, unlike non-laes. size andmorphology represent the most noticeable difference between laes and non-laesat $z \sim 0.3$. furthermore, the comparison of our results with those obtainedat higher redshifts indicates that either the ly$\alpha$ technique picks updifferent kind of galaxies at different redshifts or that the physicalproperties of laes are evolving with redshift.

1204.2904	evidence of strong quasar feedback in the early universe	most theoretical models invoke quasar driven outflows to quench starformation in massive galaxies, this feedback mechanism is required to accountfor the population of old and passive galaxies observed in the local universe.the discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z=2, implies that suchquasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on,close to the reionization epoch. we have observed the [cii]158um transition insdssj114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasarsknown. we detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massiveoutflow. this is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likelytracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early universe.the outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that theoutflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedbackmodels. the inferred outflow rate, dm/dt &gt; 3500 msun/yr, is the highest everfound. at this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, andtherefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

1204.5881	the physics and the structure of the quasar-driven outflow in mrk 231	massive agn-driven outflows are invoked by agn-galaxy co-evolutionary modelsto suppress both star formation and black hole accretion. massive molecularoutflows have recently been revealed in some agn hosts. however, the physicalproperties and structure of these agn-driven molecular outflows are stillpoorly constrained. here we present new iram pdbi observations of mrk231, theclosest quasar known, targeting both the co(1-0) and co(2-1) transitions. wedetect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflowwith velocities up to 800 km/s. the wings are spatially resolved at highsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extendson the kpc scale. the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings isconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broadwing is less excited than the core. the latter result suggests that quasardriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gasexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in mrk231.however, we note that within the central 700 pc the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio ofthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,suggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region. we also find thatthe average size of the outflow anticorrelates with the critical density of thetransition used as a wind tracer. this indicates that, although diffuse anddense clumps coexist in the outflowing gas, dense outflowing clouds haveshorter lifetime and that they evaporate into the diffuse component along theoutflow or, more simply, that diffuse clouds are more efficiently acceleratedto larger distances by radiation pressure.

1208.3248	investigation of dual active nuclei, outflows, shock-heated gas, and  young star clusters in markarian 266	results of observations with the spitzer, hubble, galex, chandra, andxmm-newton space telescopes are presented for the luminous infrared galaxy(lirg) merger mrk 266. the sw (seyfert 2) and ne (liner) nuclei reside ingalaxies with hubble types sbb (pec) and s0/a (pec), respectively. bothgalaxies have l &gt; l*, and they are inferred to each contain a ~2.5x10^8 m_sunblack hole. mrk 266 sw is likely the primary source of a bright fe k-alpha linedetected from the system, consistent with the reflection-dominated x-rayspectrum of a heavily obscured agn. optical knots embedded in an arc withaligned radio continuum radiation, combined with luminous h_2 line emission,provide evidence for a radiative bow shock in an agn-driven outflow surroundingthe ne nucleus. soft x-ray emission modeled as shock-heated plasma isco-spatial with radio continuum emission between the galaxies. mid-irdiagnostics indicate roughly equal contributions of agn and starburst radiationpowering the bolometric luminosity. approximately 120 star clusters have beendetected, with most having estimated ages &lt; 50 myr. detection of 24 micronemission extending ~34 arcsec (20 kpc) north of the galaxies is interpreted as~2x10^7 m_sun of dust entrained in an outflowing superwind; at opticalwavelengths this region is resolved into a fragmented morphology indicative ofrayleigh-taylor instabilities in an expanding shell of ionized gas. mrk 266demonstrates that the dust "blow-out" phase can begin in a lirg well before thegalaxies fully coalesce during a subsequent ulirg phase, and rapid gasconsumption in luminous dual agns (kpc scale separations) early in the mergerprocess may explain the paucity of detected binary qsos (sub-pc scale orbits)in large surveys. an evolutionary sequence is proposed representing aprogression from dual to binary agns, accompanied by an increase in observedl_x/l_ir ratios by 10^4 or more.

[oiii] is dominated byextended emission from the high-excitation diffuse ionized gas; it is thebrightest far-infrared line, ~4 times brighter than [cii]. the extent of the[oiii] emission suggests that the medium is rather fragmented, allowing far-uvphotons to permeate into the ism to scales of &gt;30pc. furthermore, by comparing[cii] with [nii], we find that 95% of [cii] arises in pdrs, except toward thestellar cluster for which as much as 15% could arise in the ionized gas. wefind a remarkable correlation between [cii]+[oi] and pah emission, with [cii]dominating the cooling in diffuse pdrs and [oi] dominating in the densest pdrs.the combination of [cii] and [oi] provides a proxy for the total gas cooling inpdrs. our results suggest that pah emission describes better the pdr gasheating as compared to the total infrared emission.

1211.0841	ngc6240: extended co structures and their association with shocked gas	we present deep co observations of ngc6240 performed with the iram plateau debure interferometer (pdbi). ngc6240 is the prototypical example of a majorgalaxy merger in progress, caught at an early stage, with an extended,strongly-disturbed butterfly-like morphology and the presence of a heavilyobscured active nucleus in the core of each progenitor galaxy. the co lineshows a skewed profile with very broad and asymmetric wings detected out tovelocities of -600 km/s and +800 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.the pdbi maps reveal the existence of two prominent structures of blueshiftedco emission. one extends eastward, i.e. approximately perpendicular to the lineconnecting the galactic nuclei, over scales of ~7 kpc and shows velocities upto -400 km/s. the other extends southwestward out to ~7 kpc from the nuclearregion, and has a velocity of -100 km/s with respect to the systemic one.interestingly, redshifted emission with velocities 400 to 800 km/s is detectedaround the two nuclei, extending in the east-west direction, and partlyoverlapping with the eastern blue-shifted structure, although tracing a morecompact region of size ~1.7 kpc. the overlap between the southwestern co bloband the dust lanes seen in hst images, which are interpreted as tidal tails,indicates that the molecular gas is deeply affected by galaxy interactions. theeastern blueshifted co emission is co-spatial with an halpha filament that isassociated with strong h2 and soft x-ray emission. the analysis of chandrax-ray data provides strong evidence for shocked gas at the position of thehalpha emission. its association with outflowing molecular gas supports ascenario where the molecular gas is compressed into a shock wave thatpropagates eastward from the nuclei. if this is an outflow, the agn are likelythe driving force.

1211.5770	the far-infrared, uv and molecular gas relation in galaxies up to z=2.5	we use the infrared excess (irx) fir/uv luminosity ratio to study therelation between the effective uv attenuation (a_irx) and the uv spectral slope(beta) in a sample of 450 1&lt;z&lt;2.5 galaxies. the fir data is from very deepherschel observations in the goods fields that allow us to detect galaxies withsfrs typical of galaxies with log(m)&gt;9.3. thus, we are able to study galaxieson and even below the main sfr-stellar mass relation (main sequence). we findthat main sequence galaxies form a tight sequence in the irx--beta plane, whichhas a flatter slope than commonly used relations. this slope favors a smc-likeuv extinction curve, though the interpretation is model dependent. the scatterin the irx-beta plane, correlates with the position of the galaxies in thesfr-m plane. using a smaller sample of galaxies with co gas masses, we studythe relation between the uv attenuation and the molecular gas content. we finda very tight relation between the scatter in the irx-beta plane and thespecific attenuation (s_a), a quantity that represents the attenuationcontributed by the molecular gas mass per young star. s_a is sensitive to boththe geometrical arrangement of stars and dust, and to the compactness of thestar forming regions. we use this empirical relation to derive a method forestimating molecular gas masses using only widely available integratedrest-frame uv and fir photometry. the method produces gas masses with anaccuracy between 0.12-0.16 dex in samples of normal galaxies between z~0 andz~1.5. major mergers and sub-millimeter galaxies follow a different s_arelation.

1304.7110	the herschel-pep survey: evidence for downsizing in the hosts of dusty  star-forming systems	by making use of herschel-pep observations of the cosmos and extended grothstrip fields, we have estimated the dependence of the clustering properties offir-selected sources on their 100um fluxes. our analysis shows a tendency forthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(s100um &gt;8 mjy)~4.3mpc and r0(s100um &gt;5 mjy)~5.8 mpc. these values convert into minimum halomasses mmin~10^{11.6} msun for sources brighter than 8 mjy and mmin~10^{12.4}msun for s100um &gt; 5 mjy galaxies. we show such an increase of the clusteringstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are verystrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of thetotal counts at s100um &gt; 2 mjy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. byremoving such a contribution, we find that z &lt;~ 1 fir galaxies haveapproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.the above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence oncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies betweenz~0 and z~2.5. in order to remove any bias in the selection process, theadopted sample only includes galaxies observed at the same rest-framewavelength, lambda~60 um, which have comparable luminosities and thereforestar-formation rates (sfr&gt;~100 msun/yr). our analysis shows that the sameamount of (intense) star forming activity takes place in extremely differentenvironments at the different cosmological epochs. for z&lt;~1 the hosts of suchstar forming systems are small, mmin~10^{11} msun, isolated galaxies. high(z~2) redshift star formation instead seems to uniquely take place in extremelymassive/cluster-like halos, mmin~10^{13.5} msun, which are associated with thehighest peaks of the density fluctuation field at those epochs.

1306.1121	lyman break and uv-selected galaxies at z ~ 1: ii. pacs-100um/160um fir  detections	we report the pacs-100um/160um detections of a sample of 42 galex-selectedand fir-detected lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z ~ 1 located in the cosmosfield and analyze their ultra-violet (uv) to far-infrared (fir) properties. thedetection of these lbgs in the fir indicates that they have a dust content highenough so that its emission can be directly detected. according to a spectralenergy distribution (sed) fitting with stellar population templates to theiruv-to-near-ir observed photometry, pacs-detected lbgs tend to be bigger, moremassive, dustier, redder in the uv continuum, and uv-brighter thanpacs-undetected lbgs. pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 are mostly disk-like galaxiesand are located over the green-valley and red sequence of the color-magnitudediagram of galaxies at their redshift. by using their uv and ir emission, wefind that pacs-detected lbgs tend to be less dusty and have slightly highertotal star-formation rates (sfrs) than other pacs-detected uv-selected galaxieswithin their same redshift range. as a consequence of the selection effect dueto the depth of the fir observations employed, all our pacs-detected lbgs arelirgs. however, none of them are in the ulirg regime, where the firobservations are complete. the finding of ulirgs-lbgs at higher redshiftssuggests an evolution of the fir emission of lbgs with cosmic time. in anirx-$\beta$ diagram, pacs-detected lbgs at z ~ 1 tend to be located around therelation for local starburst similarly to other uv-selected pacs-detectedgalaxies at their same redshift. consequently, the dust-correction factorsobtained with their uv continuum slope allow to determine their total sfr,unlike at higher redshifts. however, the dust attenuation derived from uv tonir sed fitting overestimates the total sfr for most of our pacs-detected lbgsin age-dependent way: the overestimation factor is higher in younger galaxies.

1307.1048	high resolution mapping of co(1-0) in ngc6240	we present high spatial resolution co(1-0) mapping of the luminous infraredgalaxy ngc6240 obtained with the iram - plateau de bure interferometer. thissource is a well-known early-stage merging system hosting two agn. we find abroad co(1-0) line profile, with maximum velocity 800 km/s and fwzi=1400 km/s,and displaying several kinematic components, revealing the complexity of thegas dynamics in this system. we detect a blueshifted co emission with velocityin the range -200 and -500 km/s, peaked around the southern agn, at the sameposition where the h2 outflow is located, and with a mass loss rate of ~500msun/yr. we interpret this blueshifted component as a outflow, originating fromthe southern nucleus. the spatial and spectral match strongly suggests that theco outflow is connected to the h2 superwind located around the southernnucleus, and to the large scale co outflow, with similar velocities, extendedon scales of 10 kpc. the large mass loading factor (dm/dt /sfr ~ 10) of themolecular gas suggests that the outflow is likely driven by both sna winds andthe radiation of the southern agn. we discovered a nuclear, redshifted coemission peaking in the mid point of the two nuclei, as it is the case for theco emission at the systemic velocity. the large velocity dispersion, whichreaches its maximum (~500 km/s) in the mid point between the two nuclei,suggests that the gas might be highly turbulent in this region, although thepresence of an unresolved rotation component cannot be ruled out.

1308.3139	fast molecular outflows in luminous galaxy mergers: evidence for quasar  feedback from herschel	we report the results from a systematic search for molecular (oh-119 um)outflows with herschel-pacs in a sample of 43 nearby (z &lt; 0.3) galaxy mergers,mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) and qsos. we find that thecharacter of the oh feature (strength of the absorption relative to theemission) correlates with that of the 9.7-um silicate feature, a measure ofobscuration in ulirgs. unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based onthe detection of oh absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshiftedthan -50 km/sec, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 oh-detected targets, suggestinga wide-angle (~145 degrees) outflow geometry. conversely, unambiguous evidencefor molecular inflows, based on the detection of oh absorption profiles withmedian velocities more redshifted than +50 km/sec, is seen in only 4 objects,suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. terminaloutflow velocities of ~-1000 km/sec are measured in several objects, but medianoutflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s^{-1}. while the outflow velocitiesshow no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, theyare distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large agn fractions andluminosities [log (l_agn / l_sun) &gt; 11.8 +/- 0.3]. the quasars in these systemsplay a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. in contrast, the mostagn dominated systems, where oh is seen purely in emission, show relativelymodest oh line widths, despite their large agn luminosities, perhaps indicatingthat molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through theobscuring material.

1309.7005	herschel observations and a model for iras 08572+3915: a candidate for  the most luminous infrared galaxy in the local (z &lt; 0.2) universe	we present herschel photometry and spectroscopy, carried out as part of theherschel ulirg survey (herus), and a model for the infrared to submillimetreemission of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy iras 08572+3915. this sourceshows one of the deepest known silicate absorption features and no polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission. the model suggests that this object ispowered by an active galactic nucleus (agn) with a fairly smooth torus viewedalmost edge-on and a very young starburst. according to our model the agncontributes about 90% of the total luminosity of 1.1 x 10^13 lo, which is abouta factor of five higher than previous estimates. the large correction of theluminosity is due to the anisotropy of the emission of the best fit torus.similar corrections may be necessary for other local and high-z analogs. thiscorrection implies that iras 08572+3915 at a redshift of 0.05835 may be thenearest hyperluminous infrared galaxy and probably the most luminous infraredgalaxy in the local (z &lt; 0.2) universe. iras 08572+3915 shows a low ratio of[cii] to ir luminosity (log l_[cii]/l_{ir} &lt; -3.8) and a [oi]63um to [cii]158umline ratio of about 1 that supports the model presented in this letter.

1310.3074	the mrk 231 molecular outflow as seen in oh	we report on the herschel/pacs observations of oh in mrk 231, with detectionsin 9 doublets observed within the pacs range, and present radiative transfermodels for the outflowing oh. signatures of outflowing gas are found in up to 6oh doublets with different excitation requirements. at least two outflowingcomponents are identified, one with oh radiatively excited, and the other withlow excitation, presumably spatially extended. particularly prominent, the bluewing of the absorption detected in the in-ladder 2pi_{3/2} j=9/2-7/2 oh doubletat 65 um, with e_lower=290 k, indicates that the excited outflowing gas isgenerated in a compact and warm (circum)nuclear region. because the excited,outflowing oh gas in mrk 231 is associated with the warm, far-ir continuumsource, it is likely more compact (diameter of 200-300 pc) than that probed byco and hcn. nevertheless, its mass-outflow rate per unit of solid angle asinferred from oh is similar to that previously derived from co,&gt;~70x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1} sr^{-1}, where x_{oh} is the ohabundance relative to h nuclei. in spherical symmetry, this would correspond to&gt;~850x(2.5x10^{-6}/x_{oh}) msun yr^{-1}, though significant collimation isinferred from the line profiles. the momentum flux of the excited componentattains ~15 l_{agn}/c, with an oh column density of (1.5-3)x10^{17} cm^-2 and amechanical luminosity of ~10^{11} lsun. the detection of very excited ohpeaking at central velocities indicates the presence of a nuclear reservoir ofgas rich in oh, plausibly the 130-pc scale circumnuclear torus previouslydetected in oh megamaser emission, that may be feeding the outflow. anexceptional ^{18}oh enhancement, with oh/^{18}oh&lt;~30 at both central andblueshifted velocities, is likely the result of interstellar-medium processingby recent starburst/sne activity.

0801.4637	extended silicate dust emission in pg qsos	this paper addresses the origin of the silicate emission observed in pg qsos,based on observations with the spitzer space telescope. scenarios based on theunified model suggest that silicate emission in agn arises mainly from theilluminated faces of the clouds in the torus at temperatures near sublimation.however, detections of silicate emission in type 2 qsos, and the estimated cooldust temperatures, argue for a more extended emission region.to investigatethis issue we present the mid-infrared spectra of 23 qsos. these spectra, andespecially the silicate emission features at ~10 and ~18 mu can be fitted usingdusty narrow line region (nlr) models and a combination of black bodies. thebolometric luminosities of the qsos allow us to derive the radial distances andcovering factors for the silicate-emitting dust. the inferred radii are 100-200times larger than the dust sublimation radius, much larger than the expecteddimensions of the inner torus. our qso mid-ir spectra are consistent with thebulk of the silicate dust emission arising from the dust in the innermost partsof the nlr.

1311.2595	massive molecular outflows and evidence for agn feedback from co  observations	we study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gasand investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. we present new iram pdbico(1-0) observations of local ulirgs and qso hosts: clear signature of massiveand energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in theco(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates ofseveral 100 msun/yr. we combine these new observations with data from theliterature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflowswithin an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. we find thatstarburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their sfr, oreven higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed beeffective in removing cold gas from galaxies. nevertheless, our results suggestthat the presence of an agn can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, whichis found to increase with the l_agn/l_bol ratio. the gas depletion time-scalesdue to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosityof an agn in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years instarburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hostingpowerful agns. in quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow aremuch shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. we estimatethe outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful agns, itcorresponds to about 5% of the agn luminosity, as expected by models of agnfeedback. moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 l_agn/c are commonamong the agn-dominated sources in our sample. for "pure" starburst galaxiesour data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostlymomentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

1311.2956	the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the sfr$-m_{\ast}$  plane up to $z$$\,\thicksim\,$$2$	[abridged] we study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in thesfr-m* plane up to z~2 using observations from the herschel space observatory.starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (sfrs),stellar masses (m*) and redshift estimates, we grid the sfr-m* parameter spacein several redshift ranges and estimate the mean tdust of each sfr-m*-z bin.dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities ofour sfr-m*-z bins. at all redshifts, tdust increases with infrared luminosities(lir), specific sfrs (ssfr; i.e., sfr/m*) and distances with respect to themain sequence (ms) of the sfr-m* plane (i.e.,d_ssfr_ms=log[ssfr(galaxy)/ssfr_ms(m*,z)]). the tdust-ssfr and tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelations are statistically more significant than the tdust-lir one. whilethe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, theirnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. we convert these results into a recipeto derive tdust from sfr, m* and z. the existence of a strong tdust-d_ssfr_mscorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content ofgalaxies. (i) the slope of the tdust-d__ssfr_ms correlation can be explained bythe increase of the star-formation efficiency (sfe; sfr/mgas) with d_ssfr_ms asfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) at fixed d_ssfr_ms, the constanttdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in sfr and m* can be explainedby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions withcomparable sfe enclosed in them. (iii) at high redshift, the normalizationtowards hotter temperature of the tdust-d_ssfr_ms correlation can be explainedby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the sfeof ms galaxies. all these results support the hypothesis that the conditionsprevailing in the star-forming regions of ms and far-above-ms galaxies aredifferent.

1501.04738	the gravity metrology system: narrow-angle astrometry via phase-shifting  interferometry	the vlti instrument gravity will provide very powerful astrometry bycombining the light from four telescopes for two objects simultaneously. itwill measure the angular separation between the two astronomical objects to aprecision of 10 microarcseconds. this corresponds to a differential opticalpath difference (dopd) between the targets of few nanometers and the pathswithin the interferometer have to be maintained stable to that level. for thispurpose, the novel metrology system of gravity will monitor the internal dopdsby means of phase-shifting interferometry. we present the four-stepphase-shifting concept of the metrology with emphasis on the method used forcalibrating the phase shifts. the latter is based on a phase-step insensitivealgorithm which unambiguously extracts phases in contrast to other methods thatare strongly limited by non-linearities of the phase-shifting device. the mainconstraint of this algorithm is to introduce a robust ellipse fitting routine.via this approach we are able to measure phase shifts in the laboratory with atypical accuracy of lambda/2000 or 1 nanometer of the metrology wavelength.

1504.01104	obscuration in agns: near-infrared luminosity relations and dust colors	we combine two approaches to isolate the agn luminosity at near-infraredwavelengths and relate the near-ir pure agn luminosity to other tracers of theagn. using integral-field spectroscopic data of an archival sample of 51 localagns, we estimate the fraction of non-stellar light by comparing the nuclearequivalent width of the stellar 2.3 micron co absorption feature with theintrinsic value for each galaxy. we compare this fraction to that derived froma spectral decomposition of the integrated light in the central arc second andfind them to be consistent with each other. using our estimates of the near-iragn light, we find a strong correlation with presumably isotropic agn tracers.we show that a significant offset exists between type 1 and type 2 sources inthe sense that type 1 sources are 7 (10) times brighter in the near-ir at logl_mir = 42.5 (log l_x = 42.5). these offsets only becomes clear when treatinginfrared type 1 sources as type 1 agns.  all agns have very red near-to-mid-ir dust colors. this, as well as the rangeof observed near-ir temperatures, can be explained with a simple model withonly two free parameters: the obscuration to the hot dust and the ratio betweenthe warm and hot dust areas. we find obscurations of a_v (hot) = 5 - 15 mag forinfrared type 1 sources and a_v (hot) = 15 - 35 mag for type 2 sources. theratio of hot dust to warm dust areas of about 1000 is nicely consistent withthe ratio of radii of the respective regions as found by infraredinterferometry.

1505.00536	insights on the dusty torus and neutral torus from optical and x-ray  obscuration in a complete volume limited hard x-ray agn sample	we describe a complete volume limited sample of nearby active galaxiesselected by their 14-195kev luminosity, and outline its rationale for studyingthe mechanisms regulating gas inflow and outflow. we describe also acomplementary sample of inactive galaxies, selected to match the agn hostgalaxy properties. the active sample appears to have no bias in terms of agntype, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is twoorders of magnitude greater for the seyfert 2s. in the luminosity range spannedby the sample, log l_{14-195kev} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscuredand x-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65%. the similarity of these fractions tomore distant spectroscopic agn samples, although over a limited luminosityrange, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. oursample confirms that x-ray unabsorbed seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not morethan a few percent of the seyfert 2 population. at higher luminosities, theoptically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dustsublimation radius), but the x-ray absorbed fraction changes little. we arguethat the cold x-ray absorption in these seyfert 1s can be accounted for byneutral gas in clouds that also contribute to the broad line region (blr)emission; and suggest that a geometrically thick neutral gas torus co-existswith the blr and bridges the gap to the dusty torus.

1508.07165	a deep herschel/pacs observation of co(40-39) in ngc 1068: a search for  the molecular torus	emission from high-j co lines in galaxies has long been proposed as a tracerof x-ray dominated regions (xdrs) produced by agn. of particular interest isthe question of whether the obscuring torus, which is required by agnunification models, can be observed via high-j co cooling lines. here we reporton the analysis of a deep herschel-pacs observation of an extremely high j cotransition (40-39) in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. the line was not detected,with a derived 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $2 \times10^{-17}\,\text{w}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. we apply an xdr model in order toinvestigate whether the upper limit constrains the properties of a moleculartorus in ngc 1068. the xdr model predicts the co spectral line energydistributions for various gas densities and illuminating x-ray fluxes. in ourmodel, the co(40-39) upper limit is matched by gas with densities $\sim10^{6}-10^{7}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$, located at $1.6-5\,\text{pc}$ from the agn,with column densities of at least $10^{25}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. at such highcolumn densities, however, dust absorbs most of the co(40-39) line emission at$\lambda = 65.69\, \mu$m. therefore, even if ngc 1068 has a molecular toruswhich radiates in the co(40-39) line, the dust can attenuate the line emissionto below the pacs detection limit. the upper limit is thus consistent with theexistence of a molecular torus in ngc 1068. in general, we expect that theco(40-39) is observable in only a few agn nuclei (if at all), because of therequired high gas column density, and absorption by dust.

astro-ph;0002008	iso-sws spectroscopy of ngc 1068	we present iso-sws spectroscopy of ngc 1068 for the wavelength range 2.4 to45um, detecting a total of 36 emission lines. most of the observed transitionsare fine structure and recombination lines originating in the narrow lineregion. we compare the line profiles of optical lines and reddening-insensitiveinfrared lines to constrain the dynamical structure and extinction propertiesof the nlr. the considerable differences found are most likely explained by twoeffects. (1) the spatial structure of the nlr is a combination of a highlyionized outflow cone and lower excitation extended emission. (2) parts of thenlr, mainly in the receding part at velocities above systemic, are subject toextinction that is significantly suppressing optical emission. line asymmetriesand net blueshifts remain, however, even for infrared fine structure linessuffering very little obscuration. this may be either due to an intrinsicasymmetry of the nlr, or due to a very high column density obscuring componentwhich is hiding part of the nlr even from infrared view. mid-infrared emissionof molecular hydrogen in ngc 1068 arises in a dense molecular medium attemperatures of a few hundred kelvin that is most likely closely related to thewarm and dense components seen in the near-infrared h2 transitions, and inmillimeter wave tracers of molecular gas. any emission of the putative pc-scalemolecular torus is likely overwhelmed by this larger scale emission.

astro-ph;0207378	mrk 1014: an agn dominated ulirg at x-rays	in this paper we report on an xmm-newton observation of the ultraluminousinfrared qso mrk 1014. the x-ray observation reveals a power-law dominated(photon index of about 2.2) spectrum with a slight excess in the soft energyrange. agn and starburst emission models fit the soft excess emission equallywell, however, the most plausible explanation is an agn component as thestarburst model parameter, temperature and luminosity, appear physicallyunrealistic. the mean luminosity of mrk 1014 is about 2 times 10^44 erg s^-1.we have also observed excess emission at energies greater than 5 kev. thisfeature could be attributed to a broadened and redshifted iron complex, butdeeper observations are required to constrain its origin. the light curve showssmall scale variability over the 11 ks observation. there is no evidence ofintrinsic absorption in mrk 1014. the x-ray observations support the notion ofan agn dominated central engine. we establish the need for a longer observationto constrain more precisely the nature of the x-ray components.

astro-ph;0209475	infrared spectroscopy around 4micron of seyfert 2 galaxies: obscured  broad line regions and coronal lines	the state of the matter that is obscuring a small circumnuclear region in agncan be probed by observations of its broad emission lines. infrared lines areparticularly useful since they penetrate significant columns of obscuringmatter, the properties of which can be constrained by comparing infrared andx-ray obscuration. we report on new 4um spectroscopy of a sample of 12 seyfert2 galaxies, probing for broad components to the brackett alpha 4.05um line.broad components are observed in 3 to 4 objects. all objects with a broadcomponent exhibit relatively low x-ray obscuring columns, and our results areconsistent with a galactic ratio of 4um obscuration to the blr and x-raycolumn. in combination with observations of a non-galactic ratio of visualobscuration of blrs and x-ray obscuring column in seyferts, and interpreted ina unified agn scheme, this result can be reconciled with two interpretations.either the properties of dust near the agn are modified towards larger grains,for example through coagulation, in a way that significantly flattens theoptical/ir extinction curve, or the ratio of dust obscuration to x-ray columnvaries for different viewing angles with respect to the axis of symmetry of theputative torus. our spectra also provide a survey of emission in the [siix]3.94um coronal line, finding variation by an order of magnitude in its ratio tobr alpha. the first extragalactic detection of the [cavii] 4.09um and [cav]4.16um coronal lines is reported in the spectrum of the circinus galaxy.

astro-ph;0610772	mid-infrared diagnostics of liners	we report results from the first mid-infrared spectroscopic study of acomprehensive sample of 33 liners, observed with the spitzer space telescope.we compare the properties of two different liner populations: infrared-faintliners, with liner emission arising mostly in compact nuclear regions, andinfrared-luminous liners, which often show spatially extended (non-agn) lineremission. we show that these two populations can be easily distinguished bytheir mid-infrared spectra in three different ways: (i) their mid-ir spectralenergy distributions (seds), (ii) the emission features of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pahs), and (iii) various combinations of ir fine-structure lineratios. ir-luminous liners show mid-ir seds typical of starburst galaxies,while the mid-ir seds of ir-faint liners are much bluer. pah flux ratios aresignificantly different in the two groups. fine structure emission lines fromhighly excited gas, such as [o iv], are detected in both populations,suggesting the presence of an additional agn also in a large fraction ofir-bright liners, which contributes little to the combined mid-ir light. thetwo liner groups occupy different regions of mid-infrared emission-lineexcitation diagrams. the positions of the various liner types in our diagnosticdiagrams provide important clues regarding the power source of each liner type.most of these mid-infrared diagnostics can be applied at low spectralresolution, making agn- and starburst-excited liners distinguishable also athigh redshifts.

astro-ph;0701816	a mid-infrared spectroscopic study of submillimeter galaxies: luminous  starbursts at high redshift	we present rest frame mid-infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 13submillimeter galaxies, obtained using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on boardthe spitzer space telescope. the sample includes exclusively bright objectsfrom blank fields and cluster lens assisted surveys that have accurateinterferometric positions. we find that the majority of spectra are well fittedby a starburst template or by the superposition of pah emission features and aweak mid-infrared continuum, the latter a tracer of active galactic nuclei(including compton-thick ones). we obtain mid-infrared spectroscopic redshiftsfor all nine sources detected with irs. for three of them the redshifts werepreviously unknown. the median value of the redshift distribution is z~2.8 ifwe assume that the four irs non-detections are at high redshift. the median forthe irs detections alone is z~2.7. placing the irs non-detections at similarredshift would require rest frame mid-ir obscuration larger than is seen inlocal ulirgs. the rest frame mid-infrared spectra and mid- to far-infraredspectral energy distributions are consistent with those of local ultraluminousinfrared galaxies, but scaled-up further in luminosity. the mid-infraredspectra support the scenario that submillimeter galaxies are sites of extremestar formation, rather than x-ray-obscured agn, and represent a critical phasein the formation of massive galaxies.

astro-ph;9711255	what powers ultra-luminous iras galaxies?	we present an iso sws and isophot-s, mid-infrared spectroscopic survey of 15ultra-luminous iras galaxies. we combine the survey results with a detailedcase study, based on near-ir and mm imaging spectroscopy, of one of the samplegalaxies (ugc 5101). we compare the near- and mid-ir characteristics of theseultra-luminous galaxies to iso and literature data of thirty starburst andactive galactic nuclei (agn), template galaxies. we find that  1) 70-80% of the ultra-luminous iras galaxies in our sample are predominantlypowered by recently formed massive stars. 20-30% are powered by a central agn.these conclusions are based on a new infrared 'diagnostic diagram' involvingthe ratio of high to low excitation mid-ir emission lines on the one hand, andon the strength of the 7.7um pah feature on the other hand.  2) at least half of the sources probably have simultaneously an activenucleus and starburst activity in a 1-2 kpc diameter circum-nuclear disk/ring.  3) the mid-infrared emitting regions are highly obscured. after correctionfor these extinctions, we estimate that the star forming regions in ulirgs haveages between 10^7 and 10^8 years, similar to but somewhat larger than thosefound in lower luminosity starburst galaxies.  4) in the sample we have studied there is no obvious trend for the agncomponent to dominate in the most compact, and thus most advanced mergers.instead, at any given time during the merger evolution, the time dependentcompression of the circum-nuclear interstellar gas, the accretion rate onto thecentral black hole and the associated radiation efficiency may determinewhether star formation or agn activity dominates the luminosity of the system.

astro-ph;9809090	infrared spectroscopy of ngc 4151: iso observations and nlr line  profiles	we present iso-sws and isophot-s spectroscopy of the seyfert galaxy ngc 4151.we detect a total of 17 fine structure emission lines emitted by a wide rangeof low- and high-excitation ions, two rotational lines of molecular hydrogen,and the br beta hi line.  we find that the mid-ir fine structure line profiles display blue asymmetrieswhich are very similar to those observed in the optical lines produced in thenarrow line region. because the mid-infrared lines are much less sensitive toextinction than are the optical lines this similarity places strong constraintson scenarios which have been invoked to explain the optical line asymmetries.for example, we are able to rule out the simplest radial-motion-plus-dustscenarios for the production of the line asymmetries. our preferred model isthat of a central, geometrically thin but optically thick, obscuring screen ofsub-arcsecond extension, enclosing a total hydrogen gas mass of &gt;~5e6 msun.this mass may be molecular.  the weakness of `pah' emission features in the low resolution spectrum isevidence that star formation plays a minor role in the circumnuclear region ofngc 4151. in a companion paper (alexander et al., accepted by apj), we use therich set of mid-infrared lines to determine the obscured photoionizingcontinuum produced by the active galactic nucleus.

astro-ph;9901254	infrared spectroscopy of young supernova remnants heavily interacting  with the interstellar medium	iso spectral observations of the supernova remnant rcw103 are presented. thisobject is the prototype of relatively young remnants with fast shocksinteracting with dense interstellar medium. the spectrum is dominated byprominent lines of [neii], [siii], [feii] and other low excitation specieswhich provide, for the first time, a simple and reliable estimate of the gasabundances of refractory (si, fe, ni) and non-refractory (ne, p, s, cl, ar)species. apart from nickel, all the derived abundances are close to solar,confirming that the shock has destroyed all dust grains. like the opticalnickel lines, [niii] 6.64micron yields ni abundances a factor ~10 solar whichwe propose results from a large underestimation of the computed ni+ collisionstrengths. the observed intensities and velocity widths of ionic lines arecompatible with emission from the post-shock region alone with only a verysmall (if any) contribution from the photoionized precursor. this result doesnot agree with shock models which predict that the precursor should emitpowerful line emission, especially from highly ionized species. the possibleconsequence of this on the modelling of seyfert spectra is briefly discussed.
