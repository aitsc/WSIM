0902.2324	the kinematics of late type stars in the solar cylinder studied with  sdss data	we study the velocity distribution of milky way disk stars in akiloparsec-sized region around the sun, based on ~ 2 million m-type stars fromdr7 of sdss, which have newly re-calibrated absolute proper motions fromcombining sdss positions with the usno-b catalogue. we estimate photometricdistances to all stars, accurate to ~ 20 %, and combine them with the propermotions to derive tangential velocities for this kinematically unbiased sampleof stars. based on a statistical de-projection method we then derive thevertical profiles (to heights of z = 800 pc above the disk plane) for the firstand second moments of the three dimensional stellar velocity distribution. wefind that &lt;w&gt; = -7 +/- 1 km/s and &lt;u&gt; = -9 +/- 1 km/s, independent of heightabove the mid-plane, reflecting the sun's motion with respect to the localstandard of rest. in contrast, &lt;v&gt; changes distinctly from -20 +/- 2 km/s inthe mid-plane to &lt;v&gt; = -32 km/s at z = 800 pc, reflecting an asymmetric driftof the stellar mean velocity that increases with height. all three componentsof the m-star velocity dispersion show a strong linear rise away from themid-plane, most notably \sigma_{zz}, which grows from 18 km/s (z = 0) to 40km/s (at z = 800 pc). we determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid,and find a significant vertex deviation of 20 to 25 degrees, which decreasesonly slightly to heights of z = 800 pc. away from the mid-plane, our sampleexhibits a remarkably large tilt of the velocity ellipsoid towards the galacticplane, which reaches 20 deg. at z = 800 pc and which is not easily explained.finally, we determine the ratio \sigma^2_{\phi\phi}/\sigma^2_{rr} near themid-plane, which in the epicyclic approximation implies an almost perfectlyflat rotation curve at the solar radius.

0903.0183	what is driving the hi velocity dispersion?	we explore what dominant physical mechanism sets the kinetic energy containedin neutral, atomic (hi) gas. we compare the hi line widths predicted fromturbulence driven by supernova (sn) explosions and magneto-rotationalinstability (mri) to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. we usehigh-quality maps of the hi mass surface density and line width, obtained bythe things survey. we show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radialdecline in the hi line width, which appears to be a generic property of hidisks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of hi. at agalactocentric radius of r25 there is a characteristic value of the hi velocitydispersion of $10\pm2$ \kms. inside this radius, galaxies show hi line widthsabove the thermal value expected from a warm hi component, implying thatturbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width.therefore, we compare maps of hi kinetic energy to maps of the star formationrate (sfr) and to predictions for energy generated by mri. we find a positivecorrelation between kinetic energy of hi and sfr. for a given turbulencedissipation timescale we can estimate the energy input required to maintain theobserved kinetic energy. the sn rate implied by the observed recent sfr issufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the sn feedbackefficiency is at least \epsilon_sn\simeq0.1. beyond r25, this efficiency wouldhave to increase to unrealistic values, $\epsilon&gt;1$, suggesting thatmechanical energy from young stars does not supply most energy in outer disks.on the other hand, both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by mri canproduce the velocity dispersions and kinetic energies that we observe in thisregime.

(2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0706.2687	the luminosity function of the milky way satellites	we quantify the detectability of stellar milky way satellites in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) data release 5. we show that the effective searchvolumes for the recently discovered sdss--satellites depend strongly on theirluminosity, with their maximum distance, $d_{max}$, substantially smaller thanthe milky way halo's virial radius. calculating the maximum accessible volume,$v_{max}$, for all faint detected satellites, allows the calculation of theluminosity function for milky way satellite galaxies, accounting quantitativelyfor their detectability. we find that the number density of satellite galaxiescontinues to rise towards low luminosities, but may flatten at $m_v \sim -5$;within the uncertainties, the luminosity function can be described by a singlepower law $dn/dm_{v}= 10 \times 10^{0.1 (m_v+5)}$, spanning luminosities from$m_v=-2$ all the way to the luminosity of the large magellanic cloud. comparingthese results to several semi-analytic galaxy formation models, we find thattheir predictions differ significantly from the data: either the shape of theluminosity function, or the surface brightness distributions of the models, donot match.

(1999) at a significance level of 12.0.in addition, we find at least two new genuine halo streams, judged by theirkinematics and [fe/h], at significance levels of 2.9 and 4.8, respectively. forone stream the stars even show coherence in configuration space, matching aspatial overdensity of stars found by juric et al. (2008) at (r,z) \approx(9.5,0.8) kpc. our results demonstrate the practical power of our search methodto detect substructure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars withoutmaking a-priori assumptions about the detailed form of the gravitationalpotential.

(1) we explore three commonly used methods forselecting disk galaxies. we find 625, 485, and 353 disk galaxies, respectively,via visual classification, a single component s'ersic cut (n &lt;= 2.5), and ablue-cloud cut. in cluster environments, the latter two methods miss 31% and51%, respectively, of visually-identified disks. (2) for moderately inclineddisks, the three methods of disk selection yield a similar global optical barfraction (f_bar-opt) of 34% +10%/-3%, 31% +10%/-3%, and 30% +10%/-3%,respectively. (3) f_bar-opt rises in brighter galaxies and those which appearto have no significant bulge component. within a given absolute magnitude bin,f_bar-opt is higher in visually-selected disk galaxies that have no bulge asopposed to those with bulges. for a given morphological class, f_bar-opt risesat higher luminosities. (4) for bright early-types, as well as faint late-typesystems with no evident bulge, the optical bar fraction in the abell 901/2clusters is comparable within a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 to that of field galaxiesat lower redshifts (5) between the core and the virial radius of the cluster atintermediate environmental densities, the optical bar fraction does not appearto depend strongly on the local environment density and varies at most by afactor of ~1.3. we discuss the implications of our results for the evolution ofbars and disks in dense environments.

0907.0435	nir spectroscopy of sdss j0303-0019: a low luminosity, high eddington  ratio quasar at z~6	we present sensitive near--infrared vlt isaac spectroscopic observations ofthe z=6.08 quasar sdss j030331.40-001912.9. this qso is more than a magnitudefainter than other qsos at z~6 for which nir spectroscopy has been obtained todate and is therefore presumably more representative of the qso population atthe end of cosmic reionization. combining rest--frame uv continuum luminositywith the width measurements of the mg ii and c iv lines, we derive a black holemass of 2(+1.0/-0.5) x 10^8 solar masses, the lowest mass observed for z~6 qsosto date, and derive an eddington ratio of 1.6(+0.4/-0.6), amongst the highestvalue derived for qsos at any redshift. the spitzer 24 micron non--detection ofthis qso does not leave space for a significant hot dust component in itsoptical/near--infrared sed, in common with one other faint qso at z=6, but incontrast to more than twenty more z=6 qsos and all known lower redshift qsoswith sufficiently deep multi-wavelength photometry. we conclude that we havefound evidence for differences in the intrinsic properties of at least one z~6qso as compared to the lower--redshift population.

0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

0911.0005	observational constraints on the co-evolution of supermassive black  holes and galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) and black hole accretion rate (bhar) functionsare measured to be proportional to each other at z &lt; ~3. this closecorrespondence between sf and bha would naturally yield a bh mass-galaxy masscorrelation, whereas a bh mass-bulge mass correlation is observed. to explorethis apparent contradiction we study the sf in spheroid-dominated galaxiesbetween z=1 and the present day. we use 903 galaxies from the combo-17 surveywith m* &gt;2x10^10m_sun, ultraviolet and infrared-derived sfrs from spitzer andgalex, and morphologies from gems hst/acs imaging. using stacking techniques,we find that &lt;25% of all sf occurs in spheroid-dominated galaxies (sersic indexn&gt;2.5), while the bhar that we would expect if the global scalings held isthree times higher. this rules out the simplest picture of co-evolution, inwhich sf and bha trace each other at all times. these results could beexplained if sf and bha occur in the same events, but offset in time, forexample at different stages of a merger event. however, one would then expectto see the corresponding star formation activity in early-stage mergers, inconflict with observations. we conclude that the major episodes of sf and bhaoccur in different events, with the bulk of sf happening in isolated disks andmost bha occurring in major mergers. the apparent global co-evolution resultsfrom the regulation of the bh growth by the potential well of the galacticspheroid, which includes a major contribution from disrupted disk stars.

0911.2231	an observational estimate for the mean secular evolution rate in spiral  galaxies	we have observationally quantified the effect of gravitational torques onstars in disk galaxies due to the stellar distribution itself and exploredwhether these torques are efficient at transporting angular momentum within ahubble time. we derive instantaneous torque maps for a sample of 24 spiralgalaxies, based on stellar mass maps that were derived using the pixel-by-pixelmass-to-light estimator by zibetti, rix and charlot. in conjunction with anestimate of the rotation velocity, the mass maps allow us to determine thetorque-induced instantaneous angular momentum flow across different radii,resulting from the overall stellar distributions for each galaxy in the sample.by stacking the sample, which effectively replaces a time average by anensemble average, we find that the torques due to the stellar disk act totransport angular momentum outward over much of the disk (within 3 disk scalelengths). the strength of the ensemble-averaged gravitational torques withinone disk scale length have a timescale of ~ 4 gyr for angular momentumredistribution. this study is the first to observationally determine thestrength of torque-driven angular momentum flow of stars for a sample of spiralgalaxies, providing an important empirical constraint on secular evolution.(abridged)

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1006.2137	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: a  photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies	[abridged] we derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-irphotometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies(smgs) selected at 870um by laboca observations in the ecdfs. the medianphotometric redshift of identified smgs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile rangeis z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z&gt;3) smgs. we derive asimple redshift estimator for smgs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which isaccurate to delta_z~0.4 for smgs at z&lt;4. a statistical analysis of sourcesaround unidentified smgs identifies a population of likely counterparts with aredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% ofthe unidentified smgs. this confirms that the bulk of the undetected smgs arecoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-ir. we conclude that ~15% of allthe smgs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z&gt;3 and hence ~30%of all smgs have z&gt;3. we estimate that the full s_870um&gt;4mjy smg population hasa median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. in contrast to previous suggestions we find nosignificant correlation between s_870um and redshift. the median stellar massof the smgs derived from sed fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10msun and theinterquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10msun, although we caution that uncertaintyin the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in thesestellar masses. the median characteristic dust temperature of smgs is35.9\pm1.4k and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3k. the infrared luminosityfunction shows that smgs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-ir luminosities andluminosity density than those at z=1-2. this is mirrored in the evolution ofthe star-formation rate density (sfrd) for smgs which peaks at z~2. the maximumcontribution of bright smgs to the global sfrd (~5% for smgs with s_870um&gt;4mjy;~50% for smgs with s_870um&gt;1mjy) also occurs at z~2.

0709.0209	resolving the complex structure of the dust torus in the active nucleus  of the circinus galaxy	to test the dust torus model for active galactic nuclei directly, we studythe extent and morphology of the nuclear dust distribution in the circinusgalaxy using high resolution interferometric observations in the mid-infraredwith the midi instrument at the very large telescope interferometer. we findthat the dust distribution in the nucleus of circinus can be explained by twocomponents, a dense and warm disk-like component of 0.4 pc size and a slightlycooler, geometrically thick torus component with a size of 2.0 pc. the diskcomponent is oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow andseems to show the silicate feature at 10 micron in emission. it coincides witha nuclear maser disk in orientation and size. from the energy needed to heatthe dust, we infer a luminosity of the accretion disk corresponding to 20% ofthe eddington luminosity of the nuclear black hole. we find that theinterferometric data are inconsistent with a simple, smooth and axisymmetricdust emission. the irregular behaviour of the visibilities and the shallowdecrease of the dust temperature with radius provide strong evidence for aclumpy or filamentary dust structure. we see no evidence for dust reprocessing,as the silicate absorption profile is consistent with that of standard galacticdust. we argue that the collimation of the ionising radiation must originate inthe geometrically thick torus component. our findings confirm the presence of ageometrically thick, torus-like dust distribution in the nucleus of circinus,as required in unified schemes of seyfert galaxies. several aspects of our datarequire that this torus is irregular, or "clumpy".

1011.2764	the simple survey: observations, reduction, and catalog	we present the spitzer irac/musyc public legacy survey in the extendedcdf-south (simple), which consists of deep irac observations covering the~1,600 arcmin^2 area surrounding goods-s. the limiting magnitudes of the simpleirac mosaics typically are 23.8, 23.6, 21.9, and 21.7, at 3.6 um, 4.5 um, 5.8um, and 8.0 um, respectively (5-sigma total point source magnitudes in ab). thesimple irac images are combined with the 10'x15' goods irac mosaics in thecenter. we give detailed descriptions of the observations, data reduction, andproperties of the final images, as well as the detection and photometry methodsused to build a catalog. using published optical and near-infrared data fromthe multiwavelength survey by yale-chile (musyc), we construct an irac-selectedcatalog, containing photometry in ubvriz'jhk, [3.6 um], [4.5 um], [5.8 um], and[8.0 um]. the catalog contains 43,782 sources with s/n &gt; 5 at 3.6 um, 19,993 ofwhich have 13-band photometry. we compare this catalog to the publiclyavailable musyc and fireworks catalogs and discuss the differences. using ahigh signal-to-noise sub-sample of 3,391 sources with ([3.6] + [4.5])/2 &lt; 21.2,we investigate the star formation rate history of massive galaxies out to z ~1.8. we find that at z ~ 1.8 at least 30% +/-7% of the most massive galaxies(mstar &gt; 10^11 msol) are passively evolving, in agreement with earlier resultsfrom surveys covering less area.

1101.3221	infrared narrow-band tomography of the local starburst ngc 1569 with  lbt/lucifer	we used the near-ir imager/spectrograph lucifer mounted on the largebinocular telescope (lbt) to image, with sub-arcsec seeing, the local dwarfstarburst ngc 1569 in the jhk bands and hei 1.08 micron, [feii] 1.64 micron andbrgamma narrow-band filters. we obtained high-quality spatial maps of hei,[feii] and brgamma emission across the galaxy, and used them together withhst/acs images of ngc 1569 in the halpha filter to derive the two-dimensionalspatial map of the dust extinction and surface star formation rate density. weshow that dust extinction is rather patchy and, on average, higher in thenorth-west (nw) portion of the galaxy [e_g(b-v) = 0.71 mag] than in thesouth-east [e_g(b-v) = 0.57 mag]. similarly, the surface density of starformation rate peaks in the nw region of ngc 1569, reaching a value of about 4x 10^-6 m_sun yr^-1 pc^-2. the total star formation rate as estimated from theintegrated, dereddened halpha luminosity is about 0.4 m_sun yr^-1, and thetotal supernova rate from the integrated, dereddened [feii] luminosity is about0.005 yr^-1 (assuming a distance of 3.36 mpc). the azimuthally averaged[feii]/brgamma flux ratio is larger at the edges of the central, gas-deficientcavities (encompassing the super star clusters a and b) and in the galaxyoutskirts. if we interpret this line ratio as the ratio between the averagepast star formation (as traced by supernovae) and on-going activity(represented by ob stars able to ionize the interstellar medium), it would thenindicate that star formation has been quenched within the central cavities andlately triggered in a ring around them. the number of ionizing hydrogen andhelium photons as computed from the integrated, dereddened halpha and heiluminosities suggests that the latest burst of star formation occurred about 4myr ago and produced new stars with a total mass of ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun.[abridged]

1101.4023	the displaced dusty ism of ngc 3077: tidal stripping in the m 81 triplet	we present the detection of extended (~30 kpc^2) dust emission in the tidal\hi\ arm near ngc 3077 (member of the m\,81 triplet) using spire on boardherschel. dust emission in the tidal arm is typically detected where the \hi\column densities are &gt;10^21 cm^-2. the spire band ratios show that the dust inthe tidal arm is significantly colder (~13 k) than in ngc 3077 itself (~31 k),consistent with the lower radiation field in the tidal arm. the total dust massin the tidal arm is ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun (assuming beta=2), i.e. substantiallylarger than the dust mass associated with ngc 3077 (~2 x 10^5 m_sun). wheredust is detected, the dust-to-gas ratio is 6+/-3 x 10^-3, consistent within theuncertainties with what is found in ngc 3077 and nearby spiral galaxies withgalactic metallicities. the faint hii regions in the tidal arm can not beresponsible for the detected enriched material and are not the main source ofthe dust heating in the tidal arm. we conclude that the interstellar medium(atomic hi, molecules and dust) in this tidal feature was pre-enriched andstripped off ngc 3077 during its recent interaction (~3 x 10^8 yr ago) with m82 and m 81. this implies that interaction can efficiently remove heavyelements and enriched material (dust, molecular gas) from galaxies. asinteractions were more frequent at large lookback times, it is conceivable thatthey could substantially contribute (along with galactic outflows) to theenrichment of the intergalactic medium.

0709.1877	the central parsecs of centaurus a: high excitation gas, a molecular  disk, and the mass of the black hole	we present two-dimensional gas-kinematic maps of the central region incentaurus a. the adaptive optics (ao) assisted sinfoni data from the vlt have aresolution of 0.12" in k-band. the ionized gas species (br_gamma, [feii],[sivi]) show a rotational pattern that is increasingly overlaid bynon-rotational motion for higher excitation lines in direction of cen a's radiojet. the emission lines of molecular hydrogen (h_2) show regular rotation andno distortion due to the jet. the molecular gas seems to be well settled in thegravitational potential of the stars and the central supermassive black holeand we thus use it as a tracer to model the mass in the central +/-1.5". theseare the first ao integral-field observations on the nucleus of cen a, enablingus to study the regularity of the rotation around the black hole, well insidethe radius of influence, and to determine the inclination angle of the gas diskin a robust way. the gas kinematics are best modeled through a tilted-ringmodel that describes the warped gas disk; its mean inclination angle is ~34degand the mean position angle of the major axis is ~155deg. the best-fit blackhole mass is m_bh~4.5x10^7 msolar, based on a "kinematically hot" disk modelwhere the velocity dispersion is included through the jeans equation. thisblack hole mass estimate is somewhat lower than, but consistent with the massvalues previously derived from ionized gas kinematics. it is also consistentwith the stellar dynamical measurement from the same ao observations, which wepresent in a separate paper. it brings cen a in agreement with the m_bh-sigmarelation.

1305.3999	complete infrared spectral energy distributions of mm detected quasars  at z&gt;5	we present herschel far-infrared (fir) photometry of eleven quasars atredshift z&gt;5 that have previously been detected at 1.2mm. we perform fullspectral energy distribution (sed) fits over the wavelength range lambda_rest~0.1-400mu for those objects with good herschel detections. these fits revealthe need for an additional far-infrared (fir) component besides the emissionfrom a dusty agn-powered torus. this additional fir component has temperaturesof t_fir ~ 40-60k with luminosities of l_(8-1000mu) ~ 10^13 l_sun (accountingfor 25-60% of the bolometric fir luminosity). if the fir dust emission is dueto star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solarmasses per year. we show that at long wavelengths (lambda_rest &gt; 50mu) thecontribution of the agn-powered torus emission is negligible. this explains howprevious fir studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single componentfits to (ground-based) observations at lambda_obs &gt; 350mu reached t_fir andl_fir values similar to our complete sed fits. stacking the herschel data offour individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal inthe pacs bands but not in spire. the average sed of sources with individualherschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared emissionwhen compared to common agn templates. the comparison between two average seds(sources with and without individual herschel detections) matched in theuv/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the mir emissionmay correlate with the strength of the fir emission.

0801.1232	the milky way's circular velocity curve to 60 kpc and an estimate of the  dark matter halo mass from kinematics of ~2400 sdss blue horizontal branch  stars	we derive new constraints on the mass of the milky way's dark matter halo,based on a set of halo stars from sdss as kinematic tracers. our samplecomprises 2401 rigorously selected blue horizontal-branch (bhb) halo starsdrawn from sdss dr-6. to interpret these distributions, we compare them tomatched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxyformation simulations designed to resemble the milky way, which we presume tohave an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. we then determine whichvalue of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$ brings the observed distribution into agreement withthe corresponding distributions from the simulations. this procedure results inan estimate of the milky way's circular velocity curve to $\sim 60$ kpc, whichis found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of $\rm 220 km s^{-1}$at the sun's location, and implies m$(&lt;60 \rm kpc) = 4.0\pm 0.7\times10^{11}$m$_\odot$. the radial dependence of $\rm v_{cir}(r)$, derived instatistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectationsfrom an nfw dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components atits center. if we assume an nfw halo profile of characteristic concentrationholds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the milkyway's dark matter halo, m$_{\rm vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times10^{12}$m$_\odot$, which is lower than many previous estimates. this estimateimplies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the milkyway's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our galaxy. a valuefor m$_{\rm vir}$ of only $\sim 1\times10^{12}$m$_\odot$ also (re-)opens thequestion of whether all of the milky way's satellite galaxies are on boundorbits.

1403.3393	a large catalog of accurate distances to molecular clouds from ps1  photometry	distance measurements to molecular clouds are important, but are often madeseparately for each cloud of interest, employing very different different dataand techniques. we present a large, homogeneous catalog of distances tomolecular clouds, most of which are of unprecedented accuracy. we determinedistances using optical photometry of stars along lines of sight toward theseclouds, obtained from panstarrs-1. we simultaneously infer the reddenings anddistances to these stars, tracking the full probability distribution functionusing a technique presented in green et al. (2014). we fit these star-by-starmeasurements using a simple dust screen model to find the distance to eachcloud. we thus estimate the distances to almost all of the clouds in themagnani et al. (1985) catalog, as well as many other well-studied clouds,including orion, perseus, taurus, cepheus, polaris, california, and monocerosr2, avoiding only the inner galaxy. typical statistical uncertainties in thedistances are 5%, though the systematic uncertainty stemming from the qualityof our stellar models is about 10%. the resulting catalog is the largestcatalog of accurate, directly-measured distances to molecular clouds. ourdistance estimates are generally consistent with available distance estimatesfrom the literature, though in some cases the literature estimates are off by afactor of more than two.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1407.1835	stacking the invisibles: a guided search for low-luminosity milky way  satellites	almost every known low-luminosity milky way dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellitegalaxy contains at least one rr lyrae star. assuming that a fraction of distant(60 &lt; d_{helio} &lt; 100 kpc) galactic halo rr lyrae stars are members of yet tobe discovered low-luminosity dsph galaxies, we perform a {\em guided} searchfor these low-luminosity dsph galaxies. in order to detect the presence of dsphgalaxies, we combine stars selected from more than 123 sightlines centered onrr lyrae stars identified by the palomar transient factory. we find that thismethod is sensitive enough to detect the presence of segue 1-like galaxies(m_v= -1.5^{+0.6}_{-0.8}, r_h=30 pc) even if only ~20 sightlines were occupiedby such dsph galaxies. yet, when our method is applied to the sdss dr10 imagingcatalog, no signal is detected. an application of our method to sightlinesoccupied by pairs of close (&lt;200 pc) horizontal branch stars, also did notyield a detection. thus, we place upper limits on the number of low-luminositydsph galaxies with half-light radii from 30 pc to 120 pc, and in the probedvolume of the halo. stronger constraints on the luminosity function may beobtained by applying our method to sightlines centered on rr lyrae starsselected from the pan-starrs1 survey, and eventually, from lsst. in theappendix, we present spectroscopic observations of an rrab star in thebo\"{o}tes 3 dsph and a light curve of an rrab star near the bo\"{o}tes 2 dsph.

1512.00469	evidence of fanning in the ophiuchus stream	the ophiuchus stellar stream presents a dynamical puzzle: its old stellarpopulations ($\sim 12$ gyr) cannot be reconciled with (1) its orbit in a simplemodel for the milky way potential and (2) its short angular extent, both ofwhich imply that the observed stream formed within the last $&lt;1$ gyr. recenttheoretical work has shown that streams on chaotic orbits may abruptly fan outnear their apparent ends; stars in these fans are dispersed in both positionand velocity and may be difficult to associate with the stream. here we presentthe first evidence of such stream-fanning in the ophiuchus stream, traced byfour blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars beyond the apparent end of the stream.these stars stand out from the background by their high velocities ($v_{\rmlos} &gt; 230$ km s$^{-1}$) against $\sim 40$ other stars: their velocities arecomparable to those of the stream, but would be exceptional if they wereunrelated halo stars. their positions and velocities are, however, inconsistentwith simple extrapolation of the observed cold, high-density portion of thestream. these observations suggest that stream-fanning may be a real,observable effect and, therefore, that ophiuchus may be on a chaotic orbit.they also show that the ophiuchus stream is more extended and hence dynamicallyolder than previously thought, easing the stellar population vs. dynamical agetension.

astro-ph;0009132	the kinematics of 3:1-merger remnants and the formation of  low-luminosity elliptical galaxies	we test the formation of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies throughcollisionless mergers of unequal-mass disk galaxies. the kinematic propertiesof a small survey of simulated merger end-products with initial disk massratios of 3:1 is compared to a sample of seven low-luminosity galaxies observedby rix et al. that were chosen photometrically to be "ellipticals". in thispaper, we go beyond a comparison in terms of global properties (using onenumber to characterize a model or a galaxy e.g. &lt;a4&gt;, ellipticity at some fixedradius or central velocity dispersion) and examine the detailed kinematics asfunction of galactocentric distance. the merger remnants are ``observed''through a slit along the major and minor axis, using a pixel binning and slitwidth similar to the one used during the spectroscopic observations. we comparethe rotational support (v/sigma) of the merger remnants, the normalizedrotation on the minor axis and the major axis gauss-hermite moments h3, to thatof the observed galaxies. the n-body remnants are very flattened when viewededge-on (&lt;epsilon&gt; = 0.6) and should be inclined before making a faircomparison with the rix et al. data set (which has &lt;epsilon&gt; = 0.3). when themerger remnants are appropriately inclined, their v/sigma profiles rise slowerthan the observed ones. note that even when the remnants are viewed edge-on,the v/sigma profiles do not match the observations. the detailed comparison ofthe observations with purely collisionless 3:1-merger remnants suggests thatthis kind of dissipationless merger is not likely to be the dominant formationchannel for low-luminosity elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0011505	b1359+154: a six image lens produced by a z=1 compact group of galaxies	hst v and i-band observations show that the gravitational lens b1359+154consists of six images of a single z_s=3.235 radio source and its star-forminghost galaxy, produced by a compact group of galaxies at z_l = 1. vlbaobservations at 1.7 ghz strongly support this conclusion, showing six compactcores with similar low-frequency radio spectra. b1359+154 is the first exampleof galaxy-scale gravitational lensing in which more than four images areobserved of the same background source. the configuration is due to the uniquelensing mass distribution: three primary lens galaxies lying on the vertices ofa triangle separated by 0.7 arcsec (4/h kpc), inside the 1.7 arcsec diametereinstein ring defined by the radio images. the gravitational potential hasadditional extrema within this triangle, creating a pair of central images thatsupplement the ``standard'' four-image geometry of the outer components. simplemass models consisting of three lens galaxies constrained by hst and vlbaastrometry naturally reproduce the observed image positions but must befinely-tuned to fit the flux densities.

astro-ph;0101230	a survey for large separation lensed first quasars	little is known about the statistics of gravitationally lensed quasars atlarge (7''-30'') image separations, which probe masses on the scale of galaxyclusters. we have carried out a survey for gravitationally-lensed objects,among sources in the first 20cm radio survey that have unresolved opticalcounterparts in the digitizations of the palomar observatory sky survey. fromthe statistics of ongoing surveys that search for quasars among first sources,we estimate that there are about 9100 quasars in this source sample, makingthis one of the largest lensing surveys to date. using broad-band imaging, wehave isolated all objects with double radio components separated by 5''-30'',that have unresolved optical counterparts with similar bvi colours. ourcriteria for similar colours conservatively allow for observational error andfor colour variations due to time delays between lensed images. spectroscopy ofthese candidates shows that none of the pairs are lensed quasars. this sets anupper limit (95% confidence) on the lensing fraction in this survey of3.3x10^-4, assuming 9100 quasars. although the source redshift distribution ispoorly known, a rough calculation of the expected lensing frequency and thedetection efficiencies and biases suggests that simple theoretical expectationsare of the same order of magnitude as our observational upper limit. ourprocedure is novel in that our exhaustive search for lensed objects does notrequire prior identification of the quasars in the sample as such.characterization of the first-selected quasar population will enable using ourresult to constrain quantitatively the mass properties of clusters.

(2)galaxies resembling present-day sa- to sbc-colours show a co-moving numberdensity and contribution to j_r that does not vary much with redshift.

astro-ph;0301360	observing the dark matter density profile of isolated galaxies	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we probe the halo massdistribution by studying the velocities of satellites orbiting isolatedgalaxies. in a subsample that covers 2500 sq. degrees on the sky, we detectabout 3000 satellites with absolute blue magnitudes going down to m_b = -14;most of the satellites have m_b=-16 to -18, comparable to the magnitudes of m32and the magellanic clouds. after a careful, model-independent removal ofinterlopers, we find that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellitesdeclines with distance to the primary. for an l* galaxy the r.m.s.line-of-sight velocity changes from ~120 km/s at 20 kpc to ~60 km/s at 350 kpc.this decline agrees remarkably well with theoretical expectations, as allmodern cosmological models predict that the density of dark matter in theperipheral parts of galaxies declines as rho_dm propto r^{-3}. thus, for thefirst time we find direct observational evidence of the density declinepredicted by cosmological models; we also note that this result contradictsalternative theories of gravity such as mond. we also find that the velocitydispersion of satellites within 100 kpc scales with the absolute magnitude ofthe central galaxy as sigma propto l^{0.3}; this is very close to thetully-fisher relation for normal spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0303165	detection of strong clustering of red k-selected galaxies at 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4  in the hubble deep field south	the clustering properties of faint k&lt;24 galaxies are measured in ultradeep j,h and k near-ir images of the hubble deep field south (hdf-s), obtained withisaac at the vlt. a relatively large clustering amplitude is found up to k=24,at a level comparable to the measurements at k~19. the redshift distribution ofk&lt;24 galaxies extends to z_phot~4-5, and ~40% of the galaxies are atz_phot&gt;2.at the highest redshifts, 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4, galaxies selected in the restframe optical (k-band) appear more clustered than those selected in the restframe uv (i.e. lyman break galaxies, lbgs). galaxy clustering depends on thej-k color at 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4. k-selected galaxies with j-k&gt;1.7 reach r_0~8 h^-1 mpccomoving. this is a factor of 3--4 higher than the correlation length of lbgswith similar number densities, down to v_606&lt;27, and is also larger than thecorrelation length of galaxies with blue j-k&lt;1.7 colors. hence at z about 3 acolor-density relation is observed which is similar to that observed locally.fluctuations in the amplitude of clustering due to cosmic variance may affectour estimates derived from the small hdf-s field, but these are unlikely tochange our main conclusions. the galaxies with red j-k&gt;1.7 colors at 2&lt;z_phot&lt;4are likely older and more massive galaxies, on average, than lbgs. they werepresumably formed in the highest density perturbations at early epochs.semi-analytical hierarchical models do predict the existence of stronglyclustered populations at z~3, but with at least a factor of 10 lower numberdensity than the one measured. the overall properties of this stronglyclustered population consistently suggest that they are the progenitors, orbuilding blocks, of local massive early-type galaxies and z~1 eros, close totheir major epochs of formation.

astro-ph;0312427	a gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple images separated by 14.62  arcseconds	gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution ofdark matter in the universe. the cold-dark-matter model of the formation oflarge-scale structures predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensedby concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would besplit by over 7 arcsec. numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasarshave, however, been unsuccessful. all of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known,including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that canbe explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter.although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known,quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of theresulting lens systems. here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, sdssj1004+4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominatedby dark matter. our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectationsbased on the cold-dark-matter model.

astro-ph;0404527	the influence of redshift information on galaxy-galaxy lensing  measurements	we investigate how galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements depend on the knowledgeof redshifts for lens and source galaxies. galaxy-galaxy lensing allows one tostudy dark matter halos of galaxies statistically using weak gravitationallensing. redshift information is required to reliably distinguish foregroundlens galaxies from background source galaxies and to convert the measured shearinto constraints on the lens model. without spectroscopy or multi-colourinformation, redshifts can be drawn from independently estimated probabilitydistributions. the combo-17 survey provides redshifts for both lens and sourcegalaxies. it thus offers the unique possibility to do this investigation withobservational data. we find that it is of great importance to know theredshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties oftheir dark matter halos. whether the redshifts are derived from $ubvri$ or thelarger number of filters available in combo-17 is not very important. incontrast, knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurementsonly very little over the use of statistical source redshift distributions aslong as the source redshift distribution is known accurately.

astro-ph;0408267	evolution and impact of bars over the last eight billion years: early  results from gems	bars drive the dynamical evolution of disk galaxies by redistributing massand angular momentum, and they are ubiquitous in present-day spirals. earlystudies of the hubble deep field reported a dramatic decline in the rest-frameoptical bar fraction f_opt to below 5% at redshifts z&gt;0.7, implying that disksat these epochs are fundamentally different from present-day spirals. the gemsbar project, based on ~8300 galaxies with hst-based morphologies and accurateredshifts over the range 0.2-1.1, aims at constraining the evolution and impactof bars over the last 8 gyr. we present early results indicating that f_optremains nearly constant at ~30% over the range z=0.2-1.1,corresponding tolookback times of ~2.5-8 gyr. the bars detected at z&gt;0.6 are primarily strongwith ellipticities of 0.4-0.8. remarkably, the bar fraction and range of barsizes observed at z&gt;0.6 appear to be comparable to the values measured in thelocal universe for bars of corresponding strengths. implications for barevolution models are discussed.

astro-ph;0408382	bar evolution over the last eight billion years: a constant fraction of  strong bars in gems	one third of present-day spirals host optically visible strong bars thatdrive their dynamical evolution. however, the fundamental question of how barsevolve over cosmological times has yet to be addressed, and even the frequencyof bars at intermediate redshifts remains controversial. we investigate thefrequency of bars out to z~1.0 drawing on a sample of 1590 galaxies from thegems survey, which provides morphologies from hst acs two-color images, andhighly accurate redshifts from the combo-17 survey. we identify spiral galaxiesusing the sersic index, concentration parameter, and rest-frame color. wecharacterize bars and disks by fitting ellipses to f606w and f850lp images,taking advantage of the two bands to minimize bandpass shifting. we excludehighly inclined (i&gt;60 deg) galaxies to ensure reliable morphologicalclassifications, and apply completeness cuts of m_v &lt;= -19.3 and -20.6. morethan 40% of the bars that we detect have semi major axes a&lt;0.5" and would beeasily missed in earlier surveys without the small psf of acs. the bars that wecan reliably detect are fairly strong (with ellipticities e&gt;=0.4) and have a inthe range ~1.2-13 kpc. we find that the optical fraction of such strong barsremains at ~(30% +- 6%) from the present-day out to look-back times of 2-6 gyr(z~0.2-0.7) and 6-8 gyr (z~0.7-1.0); it certainly shows no sign of a drasticdecline at z&gt;0.7. our findings of a large and similar bar fraction at thesethree epochs favor scenarios in which cold gravitationally unstable disks arealready in place by z~1, and where on average bars have a long lifetime (wellabove 2 gyr). the distributions of structural bar properties in the two slicesare, however, not statistically identical and therefore allow for thepossibility that the bar strengths and sizes may evolve over time.

astro-ph;0409216	masses of star clusters in the nuclei of bulge-less spiral galaxies	in the last decade star clusters have been found in the centers of spiralgalaxies across all hubble types. we here present a spectroscopic study of theexceptionally bright (10^6 - 10^8 lsun) but compact (re ~ 5 pc) nuclear starclusters in very late type spirals with uves at the vlt. we find the velocitydispersions of the nine clusters in our sample to range from 13 to 34 km/s.using photometric data from the hst/wfpc2 and spherically symmetric dynamicalmodels we determine masses between 8*10^5 and 6*10^7 msun. the mass to lightratios range from 0.2 to 1.5 in the i band. this indicates a young mean age formost clusters, in agreement with previous studies. given their high masses andsmall sizes we find that nuclear clusters are among the objects with thehighest mean surface density known (up to 10^5 msun pc^-2). from theirdynamical properties we infer that, rather than small bulges, the closeststructural kin of nuclear clusters appear to be massive compact star clusters.this includes such different objects as globular clusters, "super starclusters", ultra compact dwarf galaxies and the nuclei of dwarf ellipticalgalaxies. it is a challenge to explain why, despite the wildly differentcurrent environments, all different types of massive star clusters share verysimilar and structural properties. a possible explanation links ucds andmassive globular clusters to nuclear star clusters through stripping ofnucleated dwarf galaxies in a merger event. the extreme properties of this typeof clusters would then be a consequence of their location in the centers oftheir respective host galaxies.

astro-ph;0412570	the fundamental plane of cluster ellipticals at z = 1.25	using deep hst acs imaging and vlt fors2 spectra, we determined the velocitydispersions, effective radii and surface brightnesses for four early-typegalaxies in the $z=1.237$ cluster \cl. all four galaxies are massive, $&gt;10^{11} m_{\sun}$. these four galaxies, combined with three from \lynx at$z=1.276$, establish the fundamental plane of massive early-type clustergalaxies at $\bar{z}=1.25$. the offset of the fundamental plane shows that theluminosity evolution in rest-frame $b$ is $\delta \ln m/l_b = (-0.98 \pm 0.06)z$ for galaxies with $m &gt; 10^{11.5} m_{\sun}$. to reproduce the observedmass-to-light ratio ($m/l$) evolution, we determine the characteristic age ofthe stars in these $m &gt; 10^{11.5} m_{\sun}$ galaxies to be $3.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$gyrs, {\em i.e.} $z_{*}=3.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$. including selection effects causedby morphological bias (the ``progenitor bias''), we estimate an age of$2.1^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ gyrs, or $z_{*} = 2.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ for the ellipticalgalaxy population. massive cluster early-type galaxies appear to have a largefraction of stars that formed early in the history of the universe. however,there is a large scatter in the derived $m/l$ values, which is confirmed by thespread in the galaxies' colors. two lower mass galaxies in our $\bar{z}=1.25$sample have much lower $m/l$ values, implying significant star-formation closeto the epoch of observation. thus, even in the centers of massive clusters,there appears to have been significant star formation in some massive, $m\simeq 10^{11} m_{\sun}$, galaxies at $z\simeq 1.5$.

astro-ph;0412615	weak lensing measurements of dark matter halos of galaxies from combo-17	we present a measurement of mass estimates for dark matter halos aroundgalaxies from the combo-17 survey using weak gravitational lensing. combo-17 isparticularly useful for this kind of investigation because it coversobservations in 17 optical filters from which accurate photometric redshiftsand spectral classification for objects with $r&lt;24$ are derived. this allows usto select lens and source galaxies from their redshifts and to thus avoid anyuncertainties from estimates of the source redshift distribution. we studygalaxy lenses at redshifts $z_\mathrm{d}=0.2-0.7$ by fitting the normalizationof either singular isothermal spheres (sis) or navarro-frenk-white (nfw)profiles to the whole lens sample; we then consider halos around blue and redsubsamples separately. we also constrain the scaling of halo mass with light.for the nfw model, we find virial masses$m_\mathrm{vir}^*=3.9^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$ (1-$\sigma$)for blue and $m_\mathrm{vir}^*=7.1^{+7.1}_{-3.8}\times 10^{11}h^{-1}m_{\sun}$for red galaxies of $l_\star=10^{10}h^{-2}l_{\sun}$, respectively. the derivedmass-to-light scaling relations suggest that the mass-to-light ratio mightdecrease with increasing luminosity for blue galaxies but increase withincreasing luminosity for red galaxies. however, these differences between blueand red galaxies are only marginally significant and both subsamples areconsistent with having the same mass-to-light ratio at all luminosities.finally, we compare our results to those obtained from the red-sequence clustersurvey (rcs) and the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). taking differences in theactual modelling into account, we find very good agreement with these surveys.

astro-ph;0502228	mass-to-light ratios of field early-type galaxies at z~1 from ultra-deep  spectroscopy: evidence for mass-dependent evolution	we present an analysis of the fundamental plane for a sample of 27 fieldearly-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.15. the galaxies in thissample have high s/n spectra obtained at the vlt and high resolution imagingfrom the acs. we find that the mean evolution in m/l of our sample is $delta ln(m/l_b) = -1.74+/-0.16z$, with a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter. this value canbe too low by 0.3 due to selection effects, resulting in $delta ln (m/l_b) =-1.43+/-0.16z$. the strong correlation between m/l and rest-frame colorindicates that the observed scatter is not due to measurement errors, but dueto intrinsic differences between the stellar populations of the galaxies. thispace of evolution is much faster than the evolution of cluster galaxies.however, we find that the measured m/l evolution strongly depends on galaxymass. for galaxies with masses $m&gt;2 x 10^11 msol$, we find no significantdifference between the evolution of field and cluster galaxies: $delta ln(m/l_b) = -1.20+/-0.18z for field galaxies and $delta ln (m/l_b) =-1.12+/-0.06z$ for cluster galaxies. the relation between the measured m/levolution and mass is partially due to selection effects. however, even whentaking selection effects into account, we still find a relation between m/levolution and mass, which is most likely caused by a lower mean age and alarger intrinsic scatter for low mass galaxies. results from lensing early-typegalaxies, which are mass-selected, show a very similar trend with mass. this,combined with our findings, provides evidence for down-sizing. previous studiesof the rate of evolution of field early-type galaxies found a large range ofmutually exclusive values. we show that these differences are largely caused bythe differences between fitting methods.

astro-ph;0611245	nicmos imaging of drgs in the hdf-s: a relation between star-formation  and size at z ~ 2.5	we present deep, high angular-resolution hst/nicmos imaging in the hubbledeep field south (hdf-s), focusing on a subset of 14 distant red galaxies(drgs) at z ~ 2.5 galaxies that have been pre-selected to have j-k &gt; 2.3. wefind a clear trend between the rest-frame optical sizes of these sources andtheir luminosity-weighted stellar ages as inferred from their broad-bandspectral energy distributions (seds). galaxies whose seds are consistent withbeing dusty and actively star forming generally show extended morphologies inthe nicmos images (r_e &gt;~ 2 kpc), while the 5 sources which are not vigorouslyforming stars are extremely compact (r_e &lt;~ 1 kpc). this trend suggests adirect link between the mean ages of the stars and the size and density of thegalaxies and supports the conjecture that early events quench star-formationand leave compact remnants. furthermore, the compact galaxies have stellarsurface mass densities which exceed those of local galaxies by more than anorder of magnitude. the existence of such massive dense galaxies presents aproblem for models of early-type galaxy formation and evolution. larger samplesof drgs and higher spatial resolution imaging will allow us to determine theuniversality of the results presented here for a small sample.

astro-ph;0701154	discovery of an unusual dwarf galaxy in the outskirts of the milky way	in this letter, we announce the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy, leo t, inthe local group. it was found as a stellar overdensity in the sloan digital skysurvey data release 5 (sdss dr5). the color-magnitude diagram of leo t showstwo well-defined features, which we interpret as a red giant branch and asequence of young, massive stars. as judged from fits to the color-magnitudediagram, it lies at a distance of about 420 kpc and has an intermediate-agestellar population with a metallicity of [fe/h]= -1.6, together with a youngpopulation of blue stars of age of 200 myr. there is a compact cloud of neutralhydrogen with mass roughly 10^5 solar masses and radial velocity 35 km/scoincident with the object visible in the hipass channel maps. leo t is thesmallest, lowest luminosity galaxy found to date with recent star-formation. itappears to be a transition object similar to, but much lower luminosity than,the phoenix dwarf.

astro-ph;9605204	internal kinematics of distant field galaxies: i. emission line widths  for a complete sample of faint blue galaxies at &lt;z&gt;=0.25	we present measurements of the oii(3727) emission line width for a completesample of 24 blue field galaxies (21.25&lt;b&lt;22, b-r&lt;1.2) at &lt;z&gt;=0.25, obtainedwith the autofib fibre spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. mostemission lines are spectrally resolved, yet all have dispersions sigma&lt;100km/s.five of the 24 sample members have oii doublet line flux ratios which imply gasdensities in excess of 100 cm^-3. the line emission in these galaxies may bedominated by an active nucleus and the galaxies have been eliminated from thesubsequent analysis. the remaining 19 linewidths are too large by a factor oftwo (7sigma significance) to be attributed to turbulent motions within anindividual star forming region, and therefore most likely reflect the orbitalmotion of ionized gas in the galaxy. we use fabry--perot observations of nearbygalaxies to construct simulated datasets that mimic our observational setup atz=0.25; these allow us to compute the expected distribution of (observable)linewidths sigma_v for a galaxy of a given ``true'' (optical) rotation speedv_c. these simulations include the effects of random viewing angles, clumpyline emission, finite fibre aperture, and internal dust extinction on theemission line profile. we assume a linewidth--luminosity--colour relation: ln[v_c(m_b,b-r) ] = ln[v_c(-19,1)] - eta*(m_b+10) + zeta*[(b-r)-1] and determinethe range of parameters consistent with our data. we find a mean rotation speedof v_c(-19,1)=66+-8km/s (68% confidence limits) for the distant galaxies withm_b=-19 and b-r=1, with a magnitude dependence for v_c of eta=0.07+-0.08, and acolour dependence of zeta =0.28+-0.25. through comparison with several localsamples we show that this value of v_c(-19,1) is significantly lower than theoptical rotation speed of present-day galaxies with the same absolute magnitude

astro-ph;9803207	an infrared einstein ring in the gravitational lens pg 1115+080	hubble space telescope observations of the gravitational lens pg 1115+080 inthe infrared show the known z =0.310 lens galaxy and reveal the z = 1.722quasar host galaxy. the main lens galaxy g is a nearly circular (ellipticity &lt;0.07) elliptical galaxy with a de vaucouleurs profile and an effective radiusof r_e = 0.59 +/- 0.06 arcsec (1.7 +/- 0.2 h^{-1} kpc for omega = 1 and h =h_0/100 km/s/mpc). g is part of a group of galaxies that is a requiredcomponent of all successful lens models. the new quasar and lens positions (3milliarcsecond errors) yield constraints for these models that arestatistically degenerate, but several conclusions are firmly established. (1)the principal lens galaxy is an elliptical galaxy with normal structuralproperties, lying close to the fundamental plane for its redshift. (2) thepotential of the main lens galaxy is nearly round, even when not constrained bythe small ellipticity of the light of this galaxy. (3) all models involving twomass distributions place the group component near the luminosity-weightedcentroid of the brightest nearby group members. (4) all models predict a timedelay ratio r_{abc} = 1.3. (5) our lens models predict h_0 = 44 +/- 4 km/s/mpcif the lens galaxy contains dark matter and has a flat rotation curve, and h_0= 65 +/- 5 km/s/mpc if it has a constant mass-to-light ratio. (6) any dark haloof the main lens galaxy must be truncated near 1.5 arcsec (4 h^{-1} kpc) beforethe inferred ho rises above 60 km/s/mpc. (7) the quasar host galaxy is lensedinto an einstein ring connecting the four quasar images, whose shape isreproduced by the models. improved nicmos imaging of the ring could be used tobreak the degeneracy of the lens models.

astro-ph;9809371	the infrared einstein ring in the gravitational lens mg1131+0456 and the  death of the dusty lens hypothesis	we have obtained and modeled new nicmos images of the lens systemmg1131+0456, which show that its lens galaxy is an h=18.6 mag, transparent,early-type galaxy at a redshift of about z_l = 0.85; it has a major axiseffective radius r_e=0.68+/-0.05 arcsec, projected axis ratio b/a=0.77+/-0.02,and major axis pa=60+/-2 degrees. the lens is the brightest member of a groupof seven galaxies with similar r-i and i-h colors, and the two closest groupmembers produce sufficient tidal perturbations to explain the ring morphology.the host galaxy of the mg1131+0456 source is a z_s &gt; 2 ero (``extremely redobject'') which is lensed into optical and infrared rings of dramaticallydifferent morphologies. these differences imply a strongly wavelength-dependentsource morphology that could be explained by embedding the host in a larger,dusty disk. at 1.6 micron (h), the ring is spectacularly luminous, with a totalobserved flux of h=17.4 mag and a de-magnified flux of 19.3 mag, correspondingto a 1-2l_* galaxy at the probable source redshift of z_s &gt; 2. thus, it isprimarily the stellar emission of the radio source host galaxy that producesthe overall colors of two of the reddest radio lenses, mg1131+0456 andb~1938+666, aided by the suppression of optical agn emission by dust in thesource galaxy. the dusty lens hypothesis -- that many massive early-typegalaxies with 0.2 &lt; z_l &lt; 1.0 have large, uniform dust opacities -- is ruledout.

astro-ph;9810287	a statistical study of rest-frame optical emission properties in  luminous quasars at 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5	we have obtained h-band spectra of 32 luminous quasars at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5 with themultiple mirror telescope. the sample contains 15 radio-loud quasars (rlqs) and17 radio-quiet quasars (rqqs). we have measured emission line properties fromthe rest-frame wavelength range of approximately 4500-5500 angstroms, byfitting the data with composite model spectra. our analysis includes comparisonof rlqs versus rqqs, as well as comparison between the broad-absorption-linequasar (balqso) and non-broad-absorption-line quasar (nonbalqso) subsets of therqq sample. in addition, we calculated the complete correlation matrix of themeasured properties. we combined our high redshift sample with the sample of 87low redshift quasars from boroson &amp; green (1992) to determine the luminosityand redshift dependences of the measured emission properties. our main resultsare: (1) the rlq sample has significantly stronger [o iii]5007 emission thanthe rqq sample. (2) the rlq sample has significantly narrower (in fwhm) hbetabroad component line profiles than the rqq sample. (3) at the sensitivity ofour observations, there are no statistically significant (&gt;95%) differencesbetween the rest-frame optical emission line properties of the balqso andnonbalqso subsamples. this result is consistent with the view that all rqqshave broad-absorption-line clouds with a small (~10-20%) covering factor andthat differences between the two types are merely a function of viewing angleand covering factor. (4) we report a previously unknown luminosity and/orredshift dependence of the narrow-line-region velocity width over the range0&lt;z&lt;2.5, such that emission line widths increase with increasing luminosity.furthermore, we find a ``baldwin effect'' for the [o iii]5007 line in therqq-only sample over this same range in redshifts.

astro-ph;9903216	the kinematics and the origin of ionized gas in ngc 4036	we present the kinematics and photometry of the stars and of the ionized gasnear the centre of the s0 galaxy ngc4036. dynamical models based on the jeansequation have been constructed from the stellar data to determine thegravitational potential in which the ionized gas is expected to orbit. inside10'', the observed gas rotation curve falls well short of the predictedcircular velocity. over a comparable radial region the observed gas velocitydispersion is far higher than the one expected from thermal motions or smallscale turbulence, corroborating that the gas cannot be following thestreamlines of nearly closed orbits. we explore several avenues to understandthe dynamical state of the gas: (1) we treat the gas as a collisionlessensemble of cloudlets and apply the jeans equation to it; this modeling showsthat inside 4'' the gas velocity dispersion is just high enough to explainquantitatively the absence of rotation. (2) alternatively, we explore whetherthe gas may arise from the `just shed' mass-loss envelopes of the bulge stars,in which case their kinematics should simply mimic that of the stars. he latterapproach matches the data better than (1), but still fails to explain the lowvelocity dispersion and slow rotation velocity of the gas for 5''&lt;r&lt;10''. (3)finally, we explore, whether drag forces on the ionized gas may aid inexplaining its peculiar kinematics. while all these approaches provide a muchbetter description of the data than cold gas on closed orbits, we do not yethave a definitive model to describe the observed gas kinematics at all radii.

astro-ph;9904054	red and blue shifted broad lines in luminous quasars	we have observed a sample of 22 luminous quasars, in the range 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5, at1.6 microns with the near-infrared (nir) spectrograph fspec on the multiplemirror telescope. our sample contains 13 radio-loud and 9 radio-quiet objects.we have measured the systemic redshifts z_(sys) directly from the strong [oiii]5007 line emitted from the narrow-line-region. from the same spectra, wehave found that the non-resonance broad h$\beta$ lines have a systematic meanredward shift of 520+/-80 km/s with respect to systemic. such a shift was notfound in our identical analysis of the low-redshift sample of boroson &amp; green.the amplitude of this redshift is comparable to half the expected gravitationalredshift and transverse doppler effects, and is consistent with a correlationbetween redshift differences and quasar luminosity. from data in theliterature, we confirm that the high-ionization rest-frame ultraviolet broadlines are blueshifted ~550-1050 km/s from systemic, and that these velocityshifts systematically increase with ionization potential. our results allow usto quantify the known bias in estimating the ionizing flux from theinter-galactic-medium j_(igm) via the proximity effect. using redshiftmeasurements commonly determined from strong broad line species, like ly\alphaor civ1549, results in an over-estimation of j_(igm) by factors of ~1.9-2.3.similarly, corresponding lower limits on the density of baryon omega_b will beover-estimated by factors of ~1.4-1.5. however, the low-ionization mgii2798broad line is within ~50 km/s of systemic, and thus would be the line of choicefor determining the true redshift of 1.0&lt;z&lt;2.2 quasars without nirspectroscopy, and z&gt;3.1 objects using nir spectroscopy.

astro-ph;9909018	the fundamental plane of gravitational lens galaxies and the evolution  of early-type galaxies in low density environments	most gravitational lenses are early-type galaxies in relatively low densityenvironments -- a ``field'' rather than a ``cluster'' population. we show thatfield early-type galaxies with 0 &lt; z &lt; 1, as represented by the lens galaxies,lie on the same fundamental plane as those in rich clusters at similarredshifts. we then use the fundamental plane to measure the combinedevolutionary and k-corrections for early-type galaxies in the v, i and h bands.only for passively evolving stellar populations formed at z &gt; 2 (h_0=65 km/smpc, omega_0=0.3, lambda_0=0.7) can the lens galaxies be matched to the localfundamental plane. the high formation epoch and the lack of significantdifferences between the field and cluster populations contradict many currentmodels of the formation history of early-type galaxies. lens galaxy colors andthe fundamental plane provide good photometric redshift estimates with anempirical accuracy of -0.03 +/- 0.11 for the 17 lenses with known redshifts. amass model dominated by dark matter is more consistent with the data thaneither an isotropic or radially anisotropic constant m/l mass model, and aradially anisotropic model is better than an isotropic model.

0706.0019	the discovery of two extremely low luminosity milky way globular  clusters	we report the discovery of two extremely low luminosity globular clusters inthe milky way halo. these objects were detected in the sloan digital sky surveydata release 5 and confirmed with deeper imaging at the calar alto observatory.the clusters, koposov 1 and koposov 2, are located at $\sim 40-50$ kpc andappear to have old stellar populations and luminosities of only $m_v \sim -1$mag. their observed sizes of $\sim 3$ pc are well within the expected tidallimit of $\sim$10 pc at that distance. together with palomar 1, am 4 andwhiting 1, these new clusters are the lowest luminosity globulars orbiting themilky way, with koposov 2 the most extreme. koposov 1 appears to lie close todistant branch of the sagittarius stream. the half-mass relaxation times ofkoposov 1 and 2 are only $\sim 70$ and $\sim 55$ myr respectively (2 orders ofmagnitude shorter than the age of the stellar populations), so it would seemthat they have undergone drastic mass segregation. since they do not appear tobe very concentrated, their evaporation timescales may be as low as $\sim 0.1t_{\rm hubble}$. these discoveries show that the structural parameter space ofglobular clusters in the milky way halo is not yet fully explored. they alsoadd, through their short remaining survival times, significant direct evidencefor a once much larger population of globular clusters.

0810.2391	geometrically derived timescales for star formation in spiral galaxies	we estimate a characteristic timescale for star formation in the spiral armsof disk galaxies, going from atomic hydrogen (hi) to dust-enshrouded massivestars. drawing on high-resolution hi data from the hi nearby galaxy survey and24$\mu$m images from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey we measure theaverage angular offset between the hi and 24$\mu$m emissivity peaks as afunction of radius, for a sample of 14 nearby disk galaxies. we model theseoffsets assuming an instantaneous kinematic pattern speed, $\omega_p$, and atimescale, t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), for the characteristic time span between the dense\hi phase and the formation of massive stars that heat the surrounding dust.fitting for $\omega_p$ and t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), we find that the radial dependenceof the observed angular offset (of the \hi and 24$\mu$m emission) is consistentwith this simple prescription; the resulting corotation radii of the spiralpatterns are typically $r_{cor}\simeq 2.7 r_{s}$, consistent with independentestimates. the resulting values of t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m) for the sample are in therange 1--4 myr. we have explored the possible impact of non-circular gasmotions on the estimate of t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m) and have found it to besubstantially less than a factor of 2. this implies that a short timescale forthe most intense phase of the ensuing star formation in spiral arms, andimplies a considerable fraction of molecular clouds exist only for a few myrbefore forming stars. however, our analysis does not preclude that somemolecular clouds persist considerably longer. if much of the star formation inspiral arms occurs within this short interval t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), then starformation must be inefficient, in order to avoid the short-term depletion ofthe gas reservoir.
