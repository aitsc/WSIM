0902.2779	formation, survival, and detectability of planets beyond 100 au	direct imaging searches have begun to detect planetary and brown dwarfcompanions and to place constraints on the presence of giant planets at largeseparations from their host star. this work helps to motivate such planetsearches by predicting a population of young giant planets that could bedetectable by direct imaging campaigns. both the classical core accretion andthe gravitational instability model for planet formation are hard-pressed toform long-period planets in situ. here, we show that dynamical instabilitiesamong planetary systems that originally formed multiple giant planets muchcloser to the host star could produce a population of giant planets at large(~100 au - 100000 au) separations. we estimate the limits within which theseplanets may survive, quantify the efficiency of gravitational scattering intoboth stable and unstable wide orbits, and demonstrate that population analysesmust take into account the age of the system. we predict that planet scatteringcreates a population of detectable giant planets on wide orbits that decreasesin number on timescales of ~10 myr. we demonstrate that several members of suchpopulations should be detectable with current technology, quantify theprospects for future instruments, and suggest how they could place interestingconstraints on planet formation models.

0904.3336	type ii migration of planets on eccentric orbits	the observed extrasolar planets possess both large masses (with a median msin i of 1.65 mj) and a wide range in orbital eccentricity (0 &lt; e &lt; 0.94). asplanets are thought to form in circumstellar disks, one important question inplanet formation is determining whether, and to what degree, a gaseous diskaffects an eccentric planet's orbit. recent studies have probed the interactionbetween a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and theinteraction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, butlittle is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gasgiant. such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is stillpresent, or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability. wefill this gap with simulations of eccentric, massive (gap-forming) planets indisks using the hydrodynamical code fargo. although the long-term orbitalevolution of the planet depends on disk properties, including the boundaryconditions used, the disk always acts to damp eccentricity when the planet isreleased into the disk. this eccentricity damping takes place on a timescale of40 years, 15 times faster than the migration timescale.

0907.5193	benefits of ground-based photometric follow-up for transiting extrasolar  planets discovered with kepler and corot	currently, over forty transiting planets have been discovered by ground-basedphotometric surveys, and space-based missions like kepler and corot areexpected to detect hundreds more. follow-up photometric observations from theground will play an important role in constraining both orbital and physicalparameters for newly discovered planets, especially those with small radii (r_pless than approximately 4 earth radii) and/or intermediate to long orbitalperiods (p greater than approximately 30 days). here, we simulate transit lightcurves from kepler-like photometry and ground-based observations in thenear-infrared (nir) to determine how jointly modeling space-based andground-based light curves can improve measurements of the transit duration andplanet-star radius ratio. we find that adding observations of at least oneground-based transit to space-based observations can significantly improve theaccuracy for measuring the transit duration and planet-star radius ratio ofsmall planets (r_p less than approximately 4 earth radii) in long-period (~1year) orbits, largely thanks to the reduced effect of limb darkening in thenir. we also demonstrate that multiple ground-based observations are needed togain a substantial improvement in the measurement accuracy for small planetswith short orbital periods (~3 days). finally, we consider the role that higherground-based precisions will play in constraining parameter measurements fortypical kepler targets. our results can help inform the priorities of transitfollow-up programs (including both primary and secondary transit of planetsdiscovered with kepler and corot), leading to improved constraints for transitdurations, planet sizes, and orbital eccentricities.

0907.5205	the transit ingress and the tilted orbit of the extraordinarily  eccentric exoplanet hd 80606b	we present the results of a transcontinental campaign to observe the 2009june 5 transit of the exoplanet hd 80606b. we report the first detection of thetransit ingress, revealing the transit duration to be 11.64 +/- 0.25 hr andallowing more robust determinations of the system parameters. keck spectraobtained at midtransit exhibit an anomalous blueshift, giving definitiveevidence that the stellar spin axis and planetary orbital axis are misaligned.the keck data show that the projected spin-orbit angle is between 32-87 degwith 68.3% confidence and between 14-142 deg with 99.73% confidence. thus theorbit of this planet is not only highly eccentric (e=0.93), but is also tiltedaway from the equatorial plane of its parent star. a large tilt had beenpredicted, based on the idea that the planet's eccentric orbit was caused bythe kozai mechanism. independently of the theory, it is noteworthy that all 3exoplanetary systems with known spin-orbit misalignments have massive planetson eccentric orbits, suggesting that those systems migrate differently thanlower-mass planets on circular orbits.

0909.2662	the formation mechanism of gas giants on wide orbits	the recent discoveries of massive planets on ultra-wide orbits of hr 8799(marois et al. 2008) and fomalhaut (kalas et al. 2008) present a new challengefor planet formation theorists. our goal is to figure out which of three giantplanet formation mechanisms--core accretion (with or without migration),scattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability--could beresponsible for fomalhaut b, hr 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discoveredin the future. this paper presents the results of numerical experimentscomparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possiblemechanism in model a star, g star and m star disks.  first, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores formingbeyond 35 au cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorableconditions one can construct. second, a set of n-body simulations demonstratesthat planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems suchas hr 8799. finally, a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showingthat global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks. weconclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes greaterthan 35 au form by gravitational instability in the disk. we recommend thatobservers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age,controlling for planet dimming with time. if planet detection rate is found tobe independent of stellar age, it would confirm our prediction thatgravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planetson wide orbits. we also predict that the occurrence ratio of long-period toshort-period gas giants should be highest for m dwarfs due to the inefficiencyof core accretion and the expected small fragment mass in their disks.

1003.2418	transit timing variations for inclined and retrograde exoplanetary  systems	we perform numerical calculations of the expected transit timing variations(ttvs) induced on a hot-jupiter by an earth-mass perturber. motivated by therecent discoveries of retrograde transiting planets, we concentrate on aninvestigation of the effect of varying relative planetary inclinations, up toand including completely retrograde systems. we find that planets in low order(e.g. 2:1) mean-motion resonances (mmrs) retain approximately constant ttvamplitudes for $0&lt;\,^{\circ}i&lt;170\,^{\circ}$, only reducing in amplitude for $i&gt; 170\,^{\circ}$. systems in higher order mmrs (e.g. 5:1) increase in ttvamplitude as inclinations increase towards $45\,^{\circ}$, becomingapproximately constant for $45 &lt; i &lt; 135$, and then declining for $i &gt;135\,^{\circ}$. planets away from resonance slowly decrease in ttv amplitude asinclinations increase from 0 to 180, where-as planets adjacent to resonancescan exhibit a huge range of variability in ttv amplitude as a function of botheccentricity and inclination. for highly retrograde systems ($135\,^{\circ} &lt; i\leq 180\,^{\circ}$), ttv signals will be undetectable across almost theentirety of parameter space, with the exceptions occurring when the perturberhas high eccentricity or is very close to a mmr. this high inclination decreasein ttv amplitude (on and away from resonance) is important for the analysis ofthe known retrograde and multi-planet transiting systems, as inclinationeffects need to be considered if ttvs are to be used to exclude the presence ofany putative planetary companions: absence of evidence is not evidence ofabsence.

1007.4552	retired a stars and their companions vi. a pair of interacting exoplanet  pairs around the subgiants 24 sextanis and hd200964	we report radial velocity measurements of the g-type subgiants 24 sextanis(=hd90043) and hd200964. both are massive, evolved stars that exhibit periodicvariations due to the presence of a pair of jovian planets. photometricmonitoring with the t12 0.80m apt at fairborn observatory demonstrates bothstars to be constant in brightness to &lt;= 0.002 mag, thus strengthening theplanetary interpretation of the radial velocity variations. 24 sex b,c haveorbital periods of 453.8 days and 883~days, corresponding to semimajor axes1.333 au and 2.08 au, and minimum masses (msini) 1.99 mjup and 0.86 mjup,assuming a stellar mass 1.54 msun. hd200964 b,c have orbital periods of 613.8days and 825 days, corresponding to semimajor axes 1.601 au and 1.95 au, andminimum masses 1.85 mjup and 0.90 mjup, assuming m* = 1.44 msun. we also carryout dynamical simulations to properly account for gravitational interactionsbetween the planets. most, if not all, of the dynamically stable solutionsinclude crossing orbits, suggesting that each system is locked in a mean motionresonance that prevents close encounters and provides long-term stability. theplanets in the 24 sex system likely have a period ratio near 2:1, while thehd200964 system is even more tightly packed with a period ratio close to 4:3.however, we caution that further radial velocity observations and more detaileddynamical modelling will be required to provide definitive and unique orbitalsolutions for both cases, and to determine whether the two systems are trulyresonant.

1008.4152	observational biases in determining extrasolar planet eccentricities in  single-planet systems	we investigate potential biases in the measurements of exoplanet orbitalparameters obtained from radial velocity observations for single-planetsystems. we create a mock catalog of radial velocity data, choosing inputplanet masses, periods, and observing patterns from actual radial velocitysurveys and varying input eccentricities. we apply markov chain monte carlo(mcmc) simulations and compare the resulting orbital parameters to the inputvalues. we find that a combination of the effective signal-to-noise ratio ofthe data, the maximal gap in phase coverage, and the total number of periodscovered by observations is a good predictor of the quality of derived orbitparameters. as eccentricity is positive definite, we find that eccentricitiesof planets on nearly circular orbits are preferentially overestimated, withtypical bias of 1-2 times the median eccentricity uncertainty in a survey(e.g., 0.04 in the butler et al. 2006 catalog). when performing populationanalysis, we recommend using the mode of the marginalized posterioreccentricity distribution to minimize potential biases. while the butler et al.(2006) catalog reports eccentricities below 0.05 for just 17% of single-planetsystems, we estimate that the true fraction of e &lt; 0.05 orbits is aboutf(0.05)=38\pm 9%. for planets with p &gt; 10 days, we find f(0.05)=28\pm 8% versus10% from butler et al.

1008.4393	modeling kepler transit light curves as false positives: rejection of  blend scenarios for kepler-9, and validation of kepler-9d, a super-earth-size  planet in a multiple system	light curves from the kepler mission contain valuable information on thenature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. to assist inexploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,we describe a procedure (blender) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"rather than a planet orbiting a star. a blend may consist of a background orforeground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuatedby the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometricaperture. we apply blender to the case of kepler-9, a target harboring twopreviously confirmed saturn-size planets (kepler-9b and kepler-9c) showingtransit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-dayperiod suggesting the presence of a super-earth-size planet. using blendertogether with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to ruleout all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validationof their planetary nature. for the shallower signal we rule out a largefraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. the false alarmrate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknownfrequency of small-size planets. based on several realistic estimates of thisfrequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is dueto a super-earth-size planet (kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than afalse positive. the radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) r(earth), andcurrent spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish itsmass.

1011.1466	quantifying the challenges of detecting unseen planetary companions with  transit timing variations	both ground and space-based transit observatories are poised to significantlyincrease the number of known transiting planets and the number of preciselymeasured transit times. the variation in a planet's transit times may be usedto infer the presence of additional planets. deducing the masses and orbitalparameters of such planets from transit time variations (ttvs) alone is a richand increasingly relevant dynamical problem. in this work, we evaluate theextent of the degeneracies in this process, systematically explore thedependence of ttv signals on several parameters and provide phase space plotsthat could aid observers in planning future observations. our explorations arefocused on a likely-to-be prevalent situation: a known transiting short-periodneptune or jupiter-sized planet and a suspected external low-mass perturber ona nearly-coplanar orbit. through approximately 10^7 n-body simulations, wedemonstrate how ttv signal amplitudes may vary by orders of magnitude due toslight variations in any one orbital parameter (0.001 au in semimajor axis,0.005 in eccentricity, or a few degrees in orbital angles), and quantify thenumber of consecutive transit observations necessary in order to obtain areasonable opportunity to characterize the unseen planet (approximately greateror equal to 50 observations). planets in or near period commensurabilities ofthe form p:q, where p &lt; 21 and q &lt; 4, produce distinct ttv signatures,regardless of whether the planets are actually locked in a mean motionresonance. we distinguish these systems from the secular systems in ourexplorations. additionally, we find that computing the autocorrelation functionof a ttv signal can provide a useful diagnostic for identifying possible orbitsfor additional planets and suggest that this method could aid integration ofttv signals in future studies of particular exosystems.

1012.0584	how planet-planet scattering can create high-inclination as well as  long-period orbits	recent observations have revealed two new classes of planetary orbits.rossiter- mclaughlin (rm) measurements have revealed hot jupiters inhigh-obliquity orbits. in addition, direct-imaging has discovered giant planetsat large (~ 100 au) separations via direct-imaging technique. simple-mindeddisk-migration scenarios are inconsistent with the high-inclination (and evenretrograde) orbits as seen in recent rm measurements. furthermore, forminggiant planets at large semi-major axis (a) may be challenging in thecore-accretion paradigm. we perform many n-body simulations to explore the twoabove-mentioned orbital architectures. planet-planet scattering in amulti-planet system can naturally excite orbital inclinations. planets can alsoget scattered to large distances. large-a planetary orbits created fromplanet-planet scattering are expected to have high eccentricities (e).theoretical models predict that the observed long-period planets, such asfomalhaut-b have moderate e \approx 0.3. interestingly, these are also insystems with disks. we find that if a massive-enough outer disk is present, ascattered planet may be circularized at large a via dynamical friction from thedisk and repeated scattering of the disk particles.

1102.0544	transit timing observations from kepler: i. statistical analysis of the  first four months	the architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraintson models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation oforbital eccentricities and inclinations. nasa's kepler mission has identified1235 transiting planet candidates (borcuki et al 2011). the method of transittiming variations (ttvs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetarysystems (holman et al. 2010; lissauer et al. 2011a). we perform a transittiming analysis of the kepler planet candidates. we find that at least ~12% ofplanet candidates currently suitable for ttv analysis show evidence suggestiveof ttvs, representing at least ~65 ttv candidates. in all cases, the time spanof observations must increase for ttvs to provide strong constraints on planetmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multipletransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). wefind that the fraction of planet candidates showing ttvs in this data set doesnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates perstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with asingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. weanticipate that kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems withmultiple transiting planet candidates via ttvs. thus, ttvs will provide apowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbitaldynamics of low-mass planets. if kepler observations were extended to at leastsix years, then ttvs would provide much more precise constraints on thedynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitiveto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-typestars.

1102.0547	the distribution of transit durations for kepler planet candidates and  implications for their orbital eccentricities	doppler planet searches have discovered that giant planets follow orbits witha wide range of orbital eccentricities, revolutionizing theories of planetformation. the discovery of hundreds of exoplanet candidates by nasa's keplermission enables astronomers to characterize the eccentricity distribution ofsmall exoplanets. measuring the eccentricity of individual planets is onlypractical in favorable cases that are amenable to complementary techniques(e.g., radial velocities, transit timing variations, occultation photometry).yet even in the absence of individual eccentricities, it is possible to studythe distribution of eccentricities based on the distribution of transitdurations (relative to the maximum transit duration for a circular orbit). weanalyze the transit duration distribution of kepler planet candidates. we findthat for host stars with t_eff &gt; 5100 k we cannot invert this to infer theeccentricity distribution at this time due to uncertainties and possiblesystematics in the host star densities. with this limitation in mind, wecompare the observed transit duration distribution with models to rule outextreme distributions. if we assume a rayleigh eccentricity distribution forkepler planet candidates, then we find best-fits with a mean eccentricity of0.1-0.25 for host stars with t_eff &lt; 5100 k. we compare the transit durationdistribution for different subsets of kepler planet candidates and discusstentative trends with planetary radius and multiplicity. high-precisionspectroscopic follow-up observations for a large sample of host stars will berequired to confirm which trends are real and which are the results ofsystematic errors in stellar radii. finally, we identify planet candidates thatmust be eccentric or have a significantly underestimated stellar radius.

1102.0555	the atmospheres of the hot-jupiters kepler-5b and kepler-6b observed  during occultations with warm-spitzer and kepler	this paper reports the detection and the measurements of occultations of thetwo transiting hot giant exoplanets kepler-5b and kepler-6b by their parentstars. the observations are obtained in the near infrared with spitzer spacetelescope and at optical wavelengths by combining more than a year of keplerphotometry. the investigation consists of constraining the eccentricities ofthese systems and of obtaining broad band emergent spectra for individualplanets. for both targets, the occultations are detected at 3 sigma level ateach wavelength with mid-occultation times consistent with circular orbits. thebrightness temperatures of these planets are deduced from the infraredobservations and reach t=1930+/-100k and t=1660+/-120k for kepler-5b andkepler-6b respectively. we measure optical geometric albedos a_g in the keplerbandpass and find a_g=0.12+/-0.04 for kepler-5b and a_g=0.11+/-0.04 forkepler-6b leading to an upper limit for the bond albedo of a_b &lt; 0.17 in bothcases. the observations for both planets are best described by models for whichmost of the incident energy is redistributed on the dayside, with only lessthan 10% of the absorbed stellar flux redistributed to the night side of theseplanets. the data for kepler-5b favor a model without a temperature inversion,whereas for kepler-6b they do not allow distinguishing between models with andwithout inversion.

1102.0605	kepler's first rocky planet: kepler-10b	nasa's kepler mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency ofearth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of sun-like stars. the missionreached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rockyplanet, kepler-10b. two distinct sets of transit events were detected: 1) a 152+/- 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 +/- 0.024 hours with ephemerist[bjd]=2454964.57375+n*0.837495 days and 2) a 376 +/- 9 ppm dimming lasting6.86 +/- 0.07 hours with ephemeris t[bjd]=2454971.6761+n*45.29485 days.statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established theviability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-upobservations. forty precision doppler measurements were used to confirm thatthe short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. the parent staris bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. photometry was collected at1-minute cadence for &gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsationfrequencies. modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of thefundamental stellar properties. kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 +/- 4.5gyr) but otherwise sun-like main sequence star with teff=5627 +/- 44 k,mstar=0.895 +/- 0.060 msun, and rstar=1.056 +/- 0.021 rsun. physical modelssimultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision dopplermeasurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of kepler-10b thatspeak to its rocky composition: mpl=4.56 +/- 1.29 mearth, rpl=1.416 +/- 0.036rearth, and density=8.8 +/- 2.9 gcc. kepler-10b is the smallest transitingexoplanet discovered to date.

1103.0199	an analysis of jitter and transit timing variations in the hat-p-13  system	if the two planets in the hat-p-13 system are coplanar, the orbital statesprovide a probe of the internal planetary structure. previous analyses ofradial velocity and transit timing data of the system suggested that theobservational constraints on the orbital states were rather small. we reanalyzethe available data, treating the jitter as an unknown mcmc parameter, and findthat a wide range of jitter values are plausible, hence the system parametersare less well constrained than previously suggested. for slightly increasedlevels of jitter ($\sim 4.5\,m\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planetcan be in the range $0&lt;e_{inner}&lt;0.07$, the period and eccentricity of theouter planet can be $440&lt;p_{outer}&lt;470$ days and $0.55&lt;e_{outer}&lt;0.85$respectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\eta$, of the planetscan take essentially any value $-180^{\circ}&lt;\eta&lt;+180^{\circ}$. it istherefore difficult to determine whether $e_{inner}$ and $\eta$ have evolved toa fixed-point state or a limit cycle, or to use $e_{inner}$ to probe theinternal planetary structure. we perform various transit timing variation (ttv)analyses, demonstrating that current constraints merely restrict$e_{outer}&lt;0.85$, and rule out relative planetary inclinations within $\sim2^{\circ}$ of $i_{rel}=90^{\circ}$, but that future observations couldsignificantly tighten the restriction on both these parameters. we demonstratethat ttv profiles can readily distinguish the theoretically favoredinclinations of $i_{rel}=0^{\circ}\,&amp;\,45^{\circ}$, provided that sufficientlyprecise and frequent transit timing observations of hat-p-13b can be made closeto the pericenter passage of hat-p-13c. we note the relatively high probabilitythat hat-p-13c transits and suggest observational dates and strategies.

1103.3896	a first comparison of kepler planet candidates in single and multiple  systems	in this letter we present an overview of the rich population of systems withmultiple candidate transiting planets found in the first four months of keplerdata. the census of multiples includes 115 targets that show 2 candidateplanets, 45 with 3, 8 with 4, and 1 each with 5 and 6, for a total of 170systems with 408 candidates. when compared to the 827 systems with only onecandidate, the multiples account for 17 percent of the total number of systems,and a third of all the planet candidates. we compare the characteristics ofcandidates found in multiples with those found in singles. false positives dueto eclipsing binaries are much less common for the multiples, as expected.singles and multiples are both dominated by planets smaller than neptune; 69+2/-3 percent for singles and 86 +2/-5 percent for multiples. this result, thatsystems with multiple transiting planets are less likely to include atransiting giant planet, suggests that close-in giant planets tend to disruptthe orbital inclinations of small planets in flat systems, or maybe even toprevent the formation of such systems in the first place.

1107.3180	radio interferometric planet search ii: constraints on sub-jupiter-mass  companions to gj 896a	we present results from the radio interferometric planet (ripl) search forcompan- ions to the nearby star gj 896a. we present 11 observations over 4.9years. fitting astrometric parameters to the data reveals a residual withpeak-to-peak amplitude of ~ 3 mas in right ascension. this residual is well-fitby an acceleration term of 0.458 \pm 0.032 mas/y^2. the parallax is fit to anaccuracy of 0.2 mas and the proper motion terms are fit to accuracies of 0.01mas/y. after fitting astrometric and acceleration terms residuals are 0.26 masin each coordinate, demonstrating that stellar jitter does not limit theability to carry out radio astrometric planet detection and characterization.the acceleration term originates in part from the companion gj 896b but theamplitude of the acceleration in declination is not accurately predicted by theorbital model. the acceleration sets a mass upper limit of 0.15 mj at asemi-major axis of 2 au for a planetary companion to gj 896a. for semi-majoraxes between 0.3 and 2 au upper limits are determined by the maximum angularseparation; the upper limits scale from the minimum value in proportion to theinverse of the radius. upper limits at larger radii are set by the accelerationand scale as the radius squared. an improved solution for the stellar binarysystem could improve the exoplanet mass sensitivity by an order of magnitude.

1107.5750	the hot-jupiter kepler-17b: discovery, obliquity from stroboscopic  starspots, and atmospheric characterization	this paper reports the discovery and characterization of the transiting hotgiant exoplanet kepler-17b. the planet has an orbital period of 1.486 days, andradial velocity measurements from the hobby-eberly telescope (het) show adoppler signal of 420+/-15 m.s-1. from a transit-based estimate of the hoststar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effectivetemperature t_eff=5630+/-100 k from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellarhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 m_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 r_jup.we estimate the planet mass and radius to be mp=2.450+/-0.114 m_jup andrp=1.312+/-0.018 r_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. the host star isactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. thecontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89days, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio producesstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. the temporal pattern of thesespot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star'sobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. we detected planetary occultations ofkepler-17b with both the kepler and spitzer space telescopes. we use theseobservations to constrain the eccentricity, e, and find that it is consistentwith a circular orbit (e&lt;0.0011). the brightness temperatures of the planet theinfrared bandpasses are t_3.6um=1880+/-100 k and t4.5um=1770+/-150 k. wemeasure the optical geometric albedo a_g in the kepler bandpass and find a_g =0.10+/-0.02. the observations are best described by atmospheric models forwhich most of the incident energy is re-radiated away from the day side.

1108.1811	on the eccentricity distribution of short-period single-planet systems	we apply standard markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) analysis techniques for 50short- period, single-planet systems discovered with radial velocity technique.we develop a new method for accessing the significance of a non-zero orbitaleccentricity, namely {\gamma} analysis, which combines frequentist bootstrapapproach with bayesian analysis of each simulated data set. we find theeccentricity estimations from {\gamma} analysis are generally consistent withresults from both standard mcmc analysis and previous references. the {\gamma}method is particular useful for assessing the significance of smalleccentricities. our results suggest that the current sample size isinsufficient to draw robust conclusions about the roles of tidal interactionand perturbations in shaping the eccentricity distribution of short-periodsingle-planet systems. we use a bayesian population analysis to show that amixture of analytical distributions is a good approximation of the underlyingeccentricity distribution. for short-period planets, we find the most probablevalues of parameters in the analytical functions given the observedeccentricities. these analytical functions can be used in theoreticalinvestigations or as priors for the eccentricity distribution when analyzingshort-period planets. as the measurement precision improves and sample sizeincreases, the method can be applied to more complex parametrizations for theunderlying distribution of eccentricity for extrasolar planetary systems.

1109.1561	the kepler-19 system: a transiting 2.2 r_earth planet and a second  planet detected via transit timing variations	we present the discovery of the kepler-19 planetary system, which we firstidentified from a 9.3-day periodic transit signal in the kepler photometry.from high-resolution spectroscopy of the star, we find a stellar effectivetemperature teff=5541 \pm 60 k, a metallicity [fe/h]=-0.13 \pm 0.06, and asurface gravity log(g)=4.59 \pm 0.10. we combine the estimate of teff and[fe/h] with an estimate of the stellar density derived from the photometriclight curve to deduce a stellar mass of m_star = 0.936 \pm 0.040 m_sun and astellar radius of r_star = 0.850 \pm 0.018 r_sun. we rule out the possibilitythat the transits result from an astrophysical false positive by firstidentifying the subset of stellar blends that reproduce the precise shape ofthe light curve. we conclude that the planetary scenario is more than threeorders of magnitude more likely than a blend. the blend scenario isindependently disfavored by the achromaticity of the transit: we measure atransit depth with spitzer at 4.5 {\mu}m of 547+113-110 ppm, consistent withthe depth measured in the kepler optical bandpass of 567\pm6 ppm. we determinea physical radius of the planet kepler-19b of r_p = 2.209 \pm 0.048 r_earth.from radial-velocity observations of the star, we find an upper limit on theplanet mass of 20.3 m_earth, corresponding to a maximum density of 10.4 gcm^-3. we report a significant sinusoidal deviation of the transit times from apredicted linear ephemeris, which we conclude is due to an additionalperturbing body in the system. we cannot uniquely determine the orbitalparameters of the perturber, as various dynamical mechanisms match theamplitude, period, and shape of the transit timing signal and satisfy the hoststar's radial velocity limits. however, the perturber in these mechanisms hasperiod &lt;160 days and mass &lt;6 m_jup, confirming its planetary nature askepler-19c.

1109.1611	discovery and atmospheric characterization of giant planet kepler-12b:  an inflated radius outlier	we report the discovery of planet kepler-12b (koi-20), which at 1.695\pm0.030rj is among the handful of planets with super-inflated radii above 1.65 rj.orbiting its slightly evolved g0 host with a 4.438-day period, this0.431\pm0.041 mj planet is the least-irradiated within thislargest-planet-radius group, which has important implications for planetaryphysics. the planet's inflated radius and low mass lead to a very low densityof 0.111\pm0.010 g cm-3. we detect the occultation of the planet at asignificance of 3.7{\sigma} in the kepler bandpass. this yields a geometricalbedo of 0.14\pm0.04; the planetary flux is due to a combination of scatteredlight and emitted thermal flux. we use multiple observations with warm spitzerto detect the occultation at 7{\sigma} and 4{\sigma} in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\mu}mbandpasses, respectively. the occultation photometry timing is consistent witha circular orbit, at e &lt; 0.01 (1{\sigma}), and e &lt; 0.09 (3{\sigma}). theoccultation detections across the three bands favor an atmospheric model withno dayside temperature inversion. the kepler occultation detection providessignificant leverage, but conclusions regarding temperature structure arepreliminary, given our ignorance of opacity sources at optical wavelengths inhot jupiter atmospheres. if kepler-12b and hd 209458b, which intercept similarincident stellar fluxes, have the same heavy element masses, the interiorenergy source needed to explain the large radius of kepler-12b is three timeslarger than that of hd 209458b. this may suggest that more than oneradius-inflation mechanism is at work for kepler-12b, or that it is lessheavy-element rich than other transiting planets.

1201.5424	almost all of kepler's multiple planet candidates are planets	we present a statistical analysis that demonstrates that the overwhelmingmajority of kepler candidate multiple transiting systems (multis) indeedrepresent true, physically-associated transiting planets. binary stars providethe primary source of false positives among kepler planet candidates, implyingthat false positives should be nearly randomly-distributed among keplertargets. in contrast, true transiting planets would appear clustered around asmaller number of kepler targets if detectable planets tend to come in systemsand/or if the orbital planes of planets encircling the same star arecorrelated. there are more than one hundred times as many kepler planetcandidates in multi-candidate systems as would be predicted from a randomdistribution of candidates, implying that the vast majority are true planets.most of these multis are multiple planet systems orbiting the kepler targetstar, but there are likely cases where (a) the planetary system orbits afainter star, and the planets are thus significantly larger than has beenestimated, or (b) the planets orbit different stars within a binary/multiplestar system. we use the low overall false positive rate among kepler multis,together with analysis of kepler spacecraft and ground-based data, to validatethe closely-packed kepler-33 planetary system, which orbits a star that hasevolved somewhat off of the main sequence. kepler-33 hosts five transitingplanets with periods ranging from 5.67 to 41 days.

1202.5852	planetary candidates observed by kepler, iii: analysis of the first 16  months of data	new transiting planet candidates are identified in sixteen months (may 2009 -september 2010) of data from the kepler spacecraft. nearly five thousandperiodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumentalfalse positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the totalcount up to over 2,300. improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing tohigher catalog reliability. most notable is the noise-weighted robust averagingof multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysiswhich identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. twenty-two months ofphotometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the newcandidates. ephemerides (transit epoch, t_0, and orbital period, p) aretabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius(rp/r*), reduced semi-major axis (d/r*), and impact parameter (b). the largestfractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% forcandidates smaller than 2re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2re) andthose at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbitsversus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). the gains are larger thanexpected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (quarter 1--quarter 5) to sixteen months (quarter 1 -- quarter 6). this demonstrates thebenefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. the fraction ofall host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and thepaucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. theprogression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each newcatalog release suggests that earth-size planets in the habitable zone areforthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.

1202.6328	architecture of kepler's multi-transiting systems: ii. new  investigations with twice as many candidates	we report on the orbital architectures of kepler systems having multipleplanet candidates identified in the analysis of data from the first sixquarters of kepler data and reported by batalha et al. (2013). these data show899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide apowerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. usinga generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets inthese candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on hill-unstableorbits, indicating ~96% of the candidate planetary systems are correctlyinterpreted as true systems. we find that planet pairs show little statisticalpreference to be near mean-motion resonances. we identify an asymmetry in thedistribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lyingnarrow of resonance. finally, based upon the transit duration ratios ofadjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to havea smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. this findingsuggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planesis in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probedby these observations.

1204.0974	traditional formation scenarios fail to explain 4:3 mean motion  resonances	at least two multi-planetary systems in a 4:3 mean motion resonance have beenfound by radial velocity surveys. these planets are gas giants and the systemsare only stable when protected by a resonance. additionally the kepler missionhas detected at least 4 strong candidate planetary systems with a period ratioclose to 4:3.  this paper investigates traditional dynamical scenarios for the formation ofthese systems. we systematically study migration scenarios with both n-body andhydro-dynamic simulations. we investigate scenarios involving the in-situformation of two planets in resonance. we look at the results from finely tunedplanet-planet scattering simulations with gas disk damping. finally, weinvestigate a formation scenario involving isolation-mass embryos.  although the combined planet-planet scattering and damping scenario seemspromising, none of the above scenarios is successful in forming enough systemsin 4:3 resonance with planetary masses similar to the observed ones. this is anegative result but it has important implications for planet formation.previous studies were successful in forming 2:1 and 3:2 resonances. this isgenerally believed to be evidence of planet migration. we highlight the maindifferences between those studies and our failure in forming a 4:3 resonance.we also speculate on more exotic and complicated ideas. these results willguide future investigators toward exploring the above scenarios and alternativemechanisms in a more general framework.

1204.3955	the transiting circumbinary planets kepler-34 and kepler-35	most sun-like stars in the galaxy reside in gravitationally-bound pairs ofstars called "binary stars". while long anticipated, the existence of a"circumbinary planet" orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitivelyestablished until the discovery of kepler-16. incontrovertible evidence wasprovided by the miniature eclipses ("transits") of the stars by the planet.however, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets andtheir range of orbital and physical properties. here we present two additionaltransiting circumbinary planets, kepler-34 and kepler-35. each is a low-densitygas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars.kepler-34 orbits two sun-like stars every 289 days, while kepler-35 orbits apair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the sun's mass) every 131 days. due tothe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodicvariations in incident stellar radiation. the observed rate of circumbinaryplanets implies &gt; ~1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearlycoplanar orbits, yielding a galactic population of at least several million.

1204.5187	interactions between moderate- and long-period giant planets: scattering  experiments for systems in isolation and with stellar flybys	the chance that a planetary system will interact with another member of itshost star's nascent cluster would be greatly increased if gas giant planetsform in situ on wide orbits. in this paper, we explore the outcomes ofplanet-planet scattering for a distribution of multiplanet systems that allhave one of the planets on an initial orbit of 100 au. the scatteringexperiments are run with and without stellar flybys. we convolve the outcomeswith distributions for protoplanetary disk and stellar cluster sizes togeneralize the results where possible. we find that the frequencies of largemutual inclinations and high eccentricities are sensitive to the number ofplanets in a system, but not strongly to stellar flybys. however, flybys doplay a role in changing the low and moderate portions of the mutual inclinationdistributions, and erase dynamically cold initial conditions on average.wide-orbit planets can be mixed throughout the planetary system, and in somecases, can potentially become hot jupiters, which we demonstrate usingscattering experiments that include a tidal damping model. if planets form onwide orbits in situ, then there will be discernible differences in the propermotion distributions of a sample of wide-orbit planets compared with a purescattering formation mechanism. stellar flybys can enhance the frequency ofejections in planetary systems, but auto-ionization is likely to remain thedominant source of free-floating planets.

1207.2481	constraining the false positive rate for kepler planet candidates with  multi-color photometry from the gtc	using the osiris instrument installed on the 10.4-m gran telescopio canarias(gtc) we acquired multi-color transit photometry of four small (rp &lt; 5 r_earth)short-period (p &lt; 6 days) planet candidates recently identified by the keplerspace mission. these observations are part of a program to constrain the falsepositive rate for small, short-period kepler planet candidates. since planetarytransits should be largely achromatic when observed at different wavelengths(excluding the small color changes due to stellar limb darkening), we use theobserved transit color to identify candidates as either false positives (e.g.,a blend with a stellar eclipsing binary either in the background/foreground orbound to the target star) or validated planets. our results include theidentification of koi 225.01 and koi 1187.01 as false positives and thetentative validation of koi 420.01 and koi 526.01 as planets. the probabilityof identifying two false positives out of a sample of four targets is less than1%, assuming an overall false positive rate for kepler planet candidates of 10%(as estimated by morton &amp; johnson 2011). therefore, these results suggest ahigher false positive rate for the small, short-period kepler planet candidatesthan has been theoretically predicted by other studies which consider thekepler planet candidate sample as a whole. furthermore, our results areconsistent with a recent doppler study of short-period giant kepler planetcandidates (santerne et al. 2012). we also investigate how the false positiverate for our sample varies with different planetary and stellar properties. ourresults suggest that the false positive rate varies significantly with orbitalperiod and is largest at the shortest orbital periods (p &lt; 3 days), where thereis a corresponding rise in the number of detached eclipsing binary stars...(truncated)

1207.3545	planets in open clusters detectable by kepler	while hundreds of planets have been discovered around field stars, only a feware known in star clusters. to explain the lack of short-period giant planetsin globular clusters (gc), such as 47 tucane and \omega\ centauri, it has beensuggested that their low metallicities may have prevented planet formation.alternatively, the high rates of close stellar encounters in these clusters mayhave influenced the formation and subsequent evolution of planetary systems.how common are planets in clusters around normal main-sequence stars? here weconsider whether this question can be addressed using data from the keplermission. the kepler field of view contains 4 low-density (relative to gcs) openclusters where the metallicities are about solar (or even higher) and stellarencounters are much less frequent than in typical gcs. we provide detailed$n$-body models and show that most planets in kepler-detectable orbits are notsignificantly perturbed by stellar encounters in these open clusters. we focuson the most massive cluster, ngc 6791, which has super-solar metallicity, andfind that if planets formed in this cluster at the same frequency as observedin the field, kepler could detect 1 -- 20 transiting planets depending on theplanet-size distribution and the duration of data collection. due to the largedistance to ngc 6791 kepler will have to search relatively faint ($k_p&lt;20$)stars for the full extended mission to achieve such a yield.

1207.5804	alignment of the stellar spin with the orbits of a three-planet system	the sun's equator and the planets' orbital planes are nearly aligned, whichis presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseousdisk. for exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is notguaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may bemisaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magneticinteractions or torques from neighbouring stars. indeed, isolated 'hotjupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. here we report ananalysis of transits of planets over starspots on the sun-like star kepler-30,and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellarequator. furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a fewdegrees. this configuration is similar to that of our solar system, andcontrasts with the isolated hot jupiters. the orderly alignment seen in thekepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems thatexperienced disruptive dynamical interactions. should this be corroborated byobservations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-diskmisalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities ofhot jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin ofhot jupiters.

1301.6147	a search for exozodiacal clouds with kepler	planets embedded within dust disks may drive the formation of large scaleclumpy dust structures by trapping dust into resonant orbits. detection andsubsequent modeling of the dust structures would help constrain the mass andorbit of the planet and the disk architecture, give clues to the history of theplanetary system, and provide a statistical estimate of disk asymmetry forfuture exoearth-imaging missions. here we present the first search for theseresonant structures in the inner regions of planetary systems by analyzing thelight curves of hot jupiter planetary candidates identified by the keplermission. we detect only one candidate disk structure associated with koi 838.01at the 3-sigma confidence level, but subsequent radial velocity measurementsreveal that koi 838.01 is a grazing eclipsing binary and the candidate diskstructure is a false positive. using our null result, we place an upper limiton the frequency of dense exozodi structures created by hot jupiters. we findthat at the 90% confidence level, less than 21% of kepler hot jupiters createresonant dust clumps that lead and trail the planet by ~90 degrees with opticaldepths &gt;~5*10^-6, which corresponds to the resonant structure expected for alone hot jupiter perturbing a dynamically cold dust disk 50 times as dense asthe zodiacal cloud.

1303.0255	measuring transit signal recovery in the kepler pipeline i: individual  events	the kepler mission was designed to measure the frequency of earth-sizeplanets in the habitable zone of sun-like stars. a crucial component forrecovering the underlying planet population from a sample of detected planetsis understanding the completeness of that sample - what fraction of the planetsthat could have been discovered in a given data set were actually detected.here we outline the information required to determine the sample completeness,and describe an experiment to address a specific aspect of that question, whichis the issue of transit signal recovery. we investigate the extent to which thekepler pipeline preserves individual transit signals by injecting simulatedtransits into the pixel-level data, processing the modified pixels through thepipeline, and comparing the measured transit signal-to-noise ratio (snr) tothat expected without perturbation by the pipeline. we inject simulated transitsignals across the full focal plane for a set of observations of length 89days. on average, we find that the snr of the injected signal is recovered atms = 0.9973(+/-0.0012)xbs-0.0151(+/-0.0049), where ms is the measured snr andbs is the baseline, or expected, snr. the 1{\sigma} width of the distributionaround this correlation is +/-2.64%. we discuss the pipeline processes thatcause the measured snr to deviate significantly from the baseline snr; theseare primarily the handling of data adjacent to spacecraft re-pointings and theremoval of harmonics prior to the measurement of the snr. finally we outlinethe further work required to characterise the completeness of the keplerpipeline.

1309.1177	a habitable zone census via transit timing and the imperative for  continuing to observe the kepler field	we propose a scientific program to complete a census of planets,characterizing their masses, orbital properties, and dynamical histories usingcontinued observations of the kepler field of view with the kepler spacecraftin a two reaction wheel mission. even with a significantly reduced photometricprecision, extending time-domain observations of this field is uniquely capableof pursuing several critical science goals: 1) measuring the architectures ofplanetary systems by identifying non-transiting planets interleaved among knowntransiting planets, 2) establishing the mass-radius relationship for planets inthe important transition region between small, gas-rich sub-neptune planets andlarge, rocky super-earths, and 3) uncovering dynamical evidence of theformation and evolution of the inner regions of planetary systems. to meetthese objectives, the unique multi-object observing capabilities of kepler willbe used in a set of concurrent campaigns with specific motivations. thesecampaigns focus largely on the ability to interpret transit timing variations(ttvs) that result from dynamical interactions among planets in a system andinclude: 1) observations of systems that exhibit large ttvs and areparticularly rich in dynamical information, 2) observations of systems whereadditional transit times will yield mass measurements of the constituentplanets, 3) observations of systems where the ttv signal evolves over very longtimescales, and 4) observations of systems with long-period planet candidateswhere additional transits will remove orbital period ambiguities caused by gapsin the original kepler data.

1311.5229	run dmc: an efficient, parallel code for analyzing radial velocity  observations using n-body integrations and differential evolution markov  chain monte carlo	in the 20+ years of doppler observations of stars, scientists have uncovereda diverse population of extrasolar multi-planet systems. a common technique forcharacterizing the orbital elements of these planets is markov chain montecarlo (mcmc), using a keplerian model with random walk proposals and pairedwith the metropolis-hastings algorithm. for approximately a couple of dozenplanetary systems with doppler observations, there are strong planet-planetinteractions due to the system being in or near a mean-motion resonance (mmr).an n-body model is often required to accurately describe these systems. furthercomputational difficulties arise from exploring a high-dimensional parameterspace ($\sim$7 x number of planets) that can have complex parametercorrelations. to surmount these challenges, we introduce a differentialevolution mcmc (demcmc) applied to radial velocity data while incorporatingself-consistent n-body integrations. our radial velocity using n-body demcmc(run dmc) algorithm improves upon the random walk proposal distribution of thetraditional mcmc by using an ensemble of markov chains to adaptively improvethe proposal distribution. we describe the methodology behind the algorithm,along with results of tests for accuracy and performance. we find that mostalgorithm parameters have a modest effect on the rate of convergence. however,the size of the ensemble can have a strong effect on performance. we show thatthe optimal choice depends on the number of planets in a system, as well as thecomputer architecture used and the resulting extent of parallelization. whilethe exact choices of optimal algorithm parameters will inevitably vary due tothe details of individual planetary systems, we offer recommendations forchoosing the demcmc algorithm's algorithmic parameters that result in excellentperformance for a wide variety of planetary systems.

0802.1836	identifying the rotation rate and the presence of dynamic weather on  extrasolar earth-like planets from photometric observations	with the recent discoveries of hundreds of extrasolar planets, the search forplanets like earth and life in the universe, is quickly gaining momentum. inthe future, large space observatories could directly detect the light scatteredfrom rocky planets, but they would not be able to spatially resolve a planet'ssurface. using reflectance models and real cloud data from satelliteobservations, here we show that, despite earth's dynamic weather patterns, thelight scattered by the earth to a hypothetical distant observer as a functionof time contains sufficient information to accurately measure earth's rotationperiod. this is because ocean currents and continents result in relativelystable averaged global cloud patterns. the accuracy of these measurements willvary with the viewing geometry and other observational constraints. if therotation period can be measured with accuracy, data spanning several monthscould be coherently combined to obtain spectroscopic information aboutindividual regions of the planetary surface. moreover, deviations from aperiodic signal can be used to infer the presence of relatively short-livestructures in its atmosphere (i.e., clouds). this could provide a usefultechnique for recognizing exoplanets that have active weather systems, changingon a timescale comparable to their rotation. such variability is likely to berelated to the atmospheric temperature and pressure being near a phasetransition and could support the possibility of liquid water on the planet'ssurface.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1406.0521	planetesimal interactions can explain the mysterious period ratios of  small near-resonant planets	an intriguing trend among \kepler's multi-planet systems is an overabundanceof planet pairs with period ratios just wide of a mean motion resonance (mmr)and a dearth of systems just narrow of them. traditional planet formationmodels are at odds with these observations. they are also in contrast with theperiod ratios of radial-velocity-discovered multi-planet systems which tend topile up at 2:1 mmr. we propose that gas-disk migration traps planets in a mmr.after gas dispersal, orbits of these trapped planets are altered throughinteraction with a residual planetesimal disk. we study the effects ofplanetesimal disk interactions on planet pairs trapped in 2:1 mmr using planetsof mass typical of the kepler planet candidates (kpc) and explore large rangesfor the mass, and density profile of the planetesimal disk. we find thatplanet-planetesimal disk interactions naturally create the observed asymmetryin period-ratio distribution for large ranges of planetesimal disk and planetproperties. if the planetesimal disk mass is above a threshold of ~0.2x theplanet mass, these interactions typically disrupt mmr. afterwards, the planetsmigrate in such a way that the final period-ratio is slightly higher than theinteger ratio corresponding to the initial mmr. below this threshold theseinteractions typically cannot disrupt the resonance and the period ratio staysclose to the integer ratio. the threshold explains why the more massive planetpairs found by rv surveys are still in resonance. we encourage future researchto explore how significantly the associated accretion would change the planets'atmospheric and surface properties.

0704.0632	detecting and characterizing planetary systems with transit timing	in the coming decades, research in extrasolar planets aims to advance twogoals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar tothe earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. we present anew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towardsboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that isable to make the requisite observations. in a system where a known planettransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the timebetween transits to vary. these transit timing variations can be used to inferthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a massthat is smaller than the mass of the earth. this detection techniquecomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motionresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reducedsensitivity. small ground-based observatories have already exceeded thephotometric precision necessary to detect sub-earth mass planets. however, ttvplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number ofhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existingtelescopes. these issues will be compounded as the number of known transitingplanets suitable for ttv study will increase substantially in the near future.a relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramaticallyincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

1503.03173	low false-positive rate of kepler candidates estimated from a  combination of spitzer and follow-up observations	(abridged) nasa's kepler mission has provided several thousand transitingplanet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets.therefore, the most fundamental question about these candidates is the fractionof bona fide planets. estimating the rate of false positives of the overallkepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. we present theresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with thespitzer telescope during the the kepler mission. these observations arededicated to estimating the false positive rate (fpr) amongst the keplercandidates. we select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges instellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transitswith spitzer at 4.5 microns. we use these observations to measures thecandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. a bandpass-dependent depthalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the sourceof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. for most of the candidates(85%), the transit depths measured with kepler are consistent with the depthsmeasured with spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that themost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars thatdilute the photometry. the spitzer constraints on their own yield fprs between5-40%, depending on the kois. by considering the population of the kepler fieldstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, wefind that the overall fpr of our sample is low. the measured upper limit on thefpr of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. this observationalresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that isnot investigated by the kepler observations, provides an independent indicationthat kepler's false positive rate is low.

1504.04028	time variation of kepler transits induced by stellar spots - a way to  distinguish between prograde and retrograde motion. ii. application to kois	mazeh, holczer, and shporer (2015) have presented an approach that can, inprinciple, use the derived transit timing variation (ttv) of some transitingplanets observed by the $kepler$ mission to distinguish between prograde andretrograde motion of their orbits with respect to their parent stars' rotation.the approach utilizes ttvs induced by spot-crossing events that occur when theplanet moves across a spot on the stellar surface, looking for a correlationbetween the derived ttvs and the stellar brightness derivatives at thecorresponding transits. this can work even in data that cannot temporallyresolve the spot-crossing events themselves. here we apply this approach to the$kepler$ kois, identifying nine systems where the photometric spot modulationis large enough and the transit timing accurate enough to allow detection of attv-brightness-derivatives correlation. of those systems five show highlysignificant prograde motion (kepler-17b, kepler-71b, koi-883.01, koi-895.01,and koi-1074.01), while no system displays retrograde motion, consistent withthe suggestion that planets orbiting cool stars have prograde motion. all fivesystems have impact parameter $0.2\lesssim b\lesssim0.5$, and all systemswithin that impact parameter range show significant correlation, excepthat-p-11b where the lack of a correlation follows its large stellar obliquity.our search suffers from an observational bias against detection of high impactparameter cases, and the detected sample is extremely small. nevertheless, ourfindings may suggest that stellar spots, or at least the larger ones, tend tobe located at a low stellar latitude, but not along the stellar equator,similar to the sun.

1510.08933	period ratio distribution of near-resonant planets indicates  planetesimal scattering	an intriguing trend among kepler's multi-planet systems is an overabundanceof planet pairs with period ratios just wide of mean motion resonances (mmr)and a dearth of systems just narrow of them. in a recently published paperchatterjee &amp; ford (2015; henceforth cf15) has proposed that gas-disk migrationtraps planets in a mmr. after gas dispersal, orbits of these trapped planetsare altered through interaction with a residual planetesimal disk. they foundthat for massive enough disks planet-planetesimal disk interactions can breakresonances and naturally create moderate to large positive offsets from theinitial period ratio for large ranges of planetesimal disk and planetproperties. divergence from resonance only happens if the mass of planetesimalsthat interact with the planets is at least a few percent of the total planetmass. this threshold, above which resonances are broken and the offset fromresonances can grow, naturally explains why the asymmetric large offsets werenot seen in more massive planet pairs found via past radial velocity surveys.in this article we will highlight some of the key findings of cf15. inaddition, we report preliminary results from an extension of this study, thatinvestigates the effects of planet-planetesimal disk interactions on initiallynon-resonant planet pairs. we find that planetesimal scattering typicallyincreases period ratios of non-resonant planets. if the initial period ratiosare below and in proximity of a resonance, under certain conditions, thisincrement in period ratios can create a deficit of systems with period ratiosjust below the exact integer corresponding to the mmr and an excess just above.from an initially uniform distribution of period ratios just below a 2:1 mmr,planetesimal interactions can create an asymmetric distribution across this mmrsimilar to what is observed for the kepler planet pairs.

astro-ph;0010178	dynamical instabilities in extrasolar planetary systems containing two  giant planets	instabilities and strong dynamical interactions between several giant planetshave been proposed as a possible explanation for the surprising orbitalproperties of extrasolar planetary systems. in particular, dynamicalinstabilities would seem to provide a natural mechanism for producing thehighly eccentric orbits seen in many systems. here we present results fromnumerical integrations for the dynamical evolution of planetary systemscontaining two identical giant planets in nearly circular orbits very close tothe dynamical stability limit. we determine the statistical properties of thethree main types of systems resulting from the development of an instability:systems containing one planet, following either a collision between the twoinitial planets, or the ejection of one of them to infinity, and systemscontaining two planets in a new, quasi-stable configuration. we discuss theimplications of our results for the formation and evolution of observedextrasolar planetary systems. we conclude that the distributions ofeccentricities and semimajor axes for observed systems cannot be explainedeasily by invoking dynamical interactions between two planets initially oncircular orbits. while highly eccentric orbits can be produced naturally bythese interactions, collisions between the two planets, which occur frequentlyin the range of observed semimajor axes, would result in many more nearlycircular orbits than in the observed sample.

astro-ph;0210275	dynamical instabilities in extrasolar planetary systems	instabilities and strong dynamical interactions between multiple giantplanets have been proposed as a possible explanation for the surprising orbitalproperties of extrasolar planetary systems. in particular, dynamicalinstabilities seem to provide a natural mechanism for producing the highlyeccentric orbits seen in many systems. previously, we performed numericalintegrations for the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing twogiant planets of equal masses initially in nearly circular orbits very close tothe dynamical stability limit. we found the ratio of collisions to ejections inthese simulations was greater than the ratio of circular orbits to eccentricorbits among the known extrasolar planets. further, the mean eccentricity ofthe planets remaining after an ejection was larger than the mean eccentricityof the known extrasolar planets. recently, we have performed additionalintegrations, generalizing to consider two planets of unequal masses. our newsimulations reveal that the two-planet scattering model can produce adistribution of eccentricities consistent with the observed eccentricitydistribution for plausible mass distributions. additionally, this modelpredicts a maximum eccentricity of about 0.8, in agreement with observations.early results from simulations of three equal-mass planets also reveal areduced frequency of collisions and a broad range of final eccentricities forthe retained inner planet.

astro-ph;0305441	quantifying the uncertainty in the orbits of extrasolar planets	precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of ~100extrasolar planetary systems. we investigate the uncertainty in the orbitalsolutions that have been fit to these observations. understanding theseuncertainties will become more and more important as the discovery space forextrasolar planets shifts to longer and longer periods. while detections ofshort period planets can be rapidly refined, planets with long orbital periodswill require observations spanning decades to constrain the orbital parametersprecisely. already in some cases, multiple distinct orbital solutions providesimilarly good fits, particularly in multiple planet systems. we present amethod for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital fits and addressingspecific questions directly from the observational data rather than relying onbest fit orbital solutions. this markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) technique hasthe advantage that it is well suited for the high dimensional parameter spacesnecessary for the multiple planet systems. we apply the mcmc technique toseveral extrasolar planetary systems, assessing the uncertainties in orbitalelements for several systems. our mcmc simulations demonstrate that for somesystems there are strong correlations between orbital parameters and/orsignificant non-gaussianities in parameter distributions, even though themeasurement errors are nearly gaussian. once these effects are considered theactual uncertainties in orbital elements can be significantly larger or smallerthan the published uncertainties. we also present simple applications of ourmethods such as predicting the times of possible transits for gj 876.

astro-ph;0412703	adaptive scheduling algorithms for planet searches	high-precision radial velocity planet searches have surveyed over ~2000nearby stars and detected over ~200 planets. while these same stars likelyharbor many additional planets, they will become increasingly challenging todetect, as they tend to have relatively small masses and/or relatively longorbital periods. therefore, observers are increasing the precision of theirobservations, continuing to monitor stars over decade timescales, and alsopreparing to survey thousands more stars. given the considerable amounts oftelescope time required for such observing programs, it is important use theavailable resources as efficiently as possible. previous studies have foundthat a wide range of predetermined scheduling algorithms result in planetsearches with similar sensitivities. we have developed adaptive schedulingalgorithms which have a solid basis in bayesian inference and informationtheory and also are computationally feasible for modern planet searches. wehave performed monte carlo simulations of plausible planet searches to test thepower of adaptive scheduling algorithms. our simulations demonstrate thatplanet searches performed with adaptive scheduling algorithms cansimultaneously detect more planets, detect less massive planets, and measureorbital parameters more accurately than comparable surveys using a non-adaptivescheduling algorithm. we expect that these techniques will be particularlyvaluable for the n2k radial velocity planet search for short-period planets aswell as future astrometric planet searches with the space interferometrymission which aim to detect terrestrial mass planets.

astro-ph;0502441	evidence for planet-planet scattering in upsilon andromedae	doppler spectroscopy has detected 136 planets around nearby stars. a majorpuzzle is why their orbits are highly eccentric, while all planets in our solarsystem are on nearly circular orbits, as expected if they formed by accretionprocesses in a protostellar disk. several mechanisms have been proposed togenerate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has beenlittle observational evidence to support any particular one. here we reportthat the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets aroundupsilon andromedae (ups and) provides evidence for a close dynamicalinteraction with another planet, now lost from the system. the planets startedon nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (upsand d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. the coupledevolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in theeccentricity of the middle planet (ups and c). indeed, we show that ups and cperiodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 9000 years. ouranalysis shows that strong planet-planet scattering, one of several mechanismspreviously discussed for increasing orbital eccentricities, must have operatedin this system.

astro-ph;0503302	vegetation's red edge: a possible spectroscopic biosignature of  extraterrestrial plants	earth's deciduous plants have a sharp order-of-magnitude increase in leafreflectance between approximately 700 and 750 nm wavelength. this strongreflectance of earth's vegetation suggests that surface biosignatures withsharp spectral features might be detectable in the spectrum of scattered lightfrom a spatially unresolved extrasolar terrestrial planet. we assess thepotential of earth's step-function-like spectroscopic feature, referred to asthe "red edge", as a tool for astrobiology. we review the basic characteristicsand physical origin of the red edge and summarize its use in astronomy: earlyspectroscopic efforts to search for vegetation on mars and recent reports ofdetection of the red edge in the spectrum of earthshine (i.e., the spatiallyintegrated scattered light spectrum of earth). we present earthshineobservations from apache point observatory to emphasize that time variabilityis key to detecting weak surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge.we briefly discuss the evolutionary advantages of vegetation's red edgereflectance, and speculate that while extraterrestrial "light harvestingorganisms" have no compelling reason to display the exact same red edge featureas terrestrial vegetation, they might have similar spectroscopic features atdifferent wavelengths than terrestrial vegetation. this implies that futureterrestrial-planet-characterizing space missions should obtain data that allowtime-varying, sharp spectral features at unknown wavelengths to be identified.we caution that some mineral reflectance edges are similar in slope andstrength to vegetation's red edge (albeit at different wavelengths); if anextrasolar planet reflectance edge is detected care must be taken with itsinterpretation.

astro-ph;0508360	the effects of multiple companions on the efficiency of the sim planet  searches	the space interferometry mission (sim) is expected to make preciseastrometric measurements that can be used to detect low mass planets aroundnearby stars. since most nearby stars are members of multiple star systems,many stars will have a measurable acceleration due to their companion, whichmust be included when solving for astrometric parameters and searching forplanetary perturbations. additionally, many of the stars with one radialvelocity planet show indications of additional planets. therefore, astrometricsurveys like sim must be capable of detecting planets and measuring orbitalparameters in systems with multiple stellar and/or planetary companions. wehave conducted monte carlo simulations to investigate how the presence ofmultiple companions affects the sensitivity of an astrometric survey such assim. we find that the detection efficiency for planets in wide binary systemsis relatively unaffected by the presence of a binary companion, if theplanetary orbital period is less than half the duration of the astrometricsurvey. for longer orbital periods, there are significant reductions in thesensitivity of an astrometric survey. additionally, we find that the signalrequired to detect a planet can be increased significantly due to the presenceof an additional planet orbiting the same star. fortunately, adding a modestnumber of precision radial velocity observations significantly improves thesensitivity for many multiple planet systems. thus, the combination of radialvelocity observations and astrometric observations by sim will be aparticularly valuable for studying multiple planet systems.

astro-ph;0512634	improving the efficiency of markov chain monte carlo for analyzing the  orbits of extrasolar planets	precise radial velocity measurements have led to the discovery of ~170extrasolar planetary systems. understanding the uncertainties in the orbitalsolutions will become increasingly important as the discovery space forextrasolar planets shifts to planets with smaller masses and longer orbitalperiods. the method of markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) provides a rigorousmethod for quantifying the uncertainties in orbital parameters in a bayesianframework (ford 2005a). the main practical challenge for the generalapplication of mcmc is the need to construct markov chains which quicklyconverge. the rate of convergence is very sensitive to the choice of thecandidate transition probability distribution function (ctpdf). here we explainone simple method for generating alternative ctpdfs which can significantlyspeed convergence by one to three orders of magnitude. we have numericallytested dozens of ctpdfs with simulated radial velocity data sets to identifythose which perform well for different types of orbits and suggest a set ofctpdfs for general application. additionally, we introduce other refinements tothe mcmc algorithm for radial velocity planets, including an improved treatmentof the uncertainties in the radial velocity observations, an algorithm forautomatically choosing step sizes, an algorithm for automatically determiningreasonable stopping times, and the use of importance sampling for including thedynamical evolution of multiple planet systems. together, these improvementsmake it practical to apply mcmc to multiple planet systems. we demonstrate theimprovements in efficiency by analyzing a variety of extrasolar planetarysystems.

astro-ph;0608328	bayesian model selection and extrasolar planet detection	radial velocity (rv) planet searches are increasingly finding planets withsmall velocity amplitudes, with long orbital periods, or in multiple planetsystems. bayesian inference has the potential to improve the interpretation ofexisting observations, the planning of future observations and ultimatelyinferences concerning the overall population of planets. in recent years, therefinement of markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) algorithms has made it practicalto accurately characterize orbital parameters and their uncertainties from rvobservations of single-planet and weakly interacting multiple-planet systems.unfortunately, mcmc is not sufficient for bayesian model selection, i.e.,comparing the marginal posterior probability of models, as is necessary todetermine how strongly the observational data favor a model with n+1 planetsover a model with just n planets. many of the obvious estimators for themarginal posterior probability suffer from poor convergence properties. wecompare several estimators of the marginal likelihood and feature those thatdisplay desirable convergence properties based on the analysis of a sample dataset for hd 88133b. we find that methods based on importance sampling are mostefficient, provided that a good analytic approximation of the posteriorprobability distribution is available. we present a simple algorithm for usinga sample from the posterior to construct a mixture distribution thatapproximates the posterior and can be used for importance sampling and bayesianmodel selection. we conclude with some suggestions for the development andrefinement of computationally efficient and robust estimators of marginalposterior probabilities.

astro-ph;0701745	the formation of ice giants in a packed oligarchy: instability and  aftermath	as many as 5 ice giants--neptune-mass planets composed of 90% ice and rockand 10% hydrogen--are thought to form at heliocentric distances of 10-25 au onclosely packed orbits spaced ~5 hill radii apart. such oligarchies areultimately unstable. once the parent disk of planetesimals is sufficientlydepleted, oligarchs perturb one another onto crossing orbits. we explore boththe onset and the outcome of the instability through numerical integrations,including dynamical friction cooling of planets by a planetesimal disk whoseproperties are held fixed. to trigger instability and the ejection of the firstice giant in systems having an original surface density in oligarchs of sigma ~1 g/cm^2, the disk surface density s must fall below 0.1 g/cm^2. ejections arepredominantly by jupiter and occur within 10 myr. to eject more than 1 oligarchrequires s &lt; 0.03 g/cm^2. systems starting with up to 4 oligarchs in additionto jupiter and saturn can readily yield solar-system-like outcomes in which 2surviving ice giants lie inside 30 au and have their orbits circularized bydynamical friction. our numerical simulations support the idea that planetarysystems begin in more crowded and compact configurations, like those ofshear-dominated oligarchies. in contrast to previous studies, we identify s &lt;0.1 sigma as the regime relevant for understanding the evolution of the outersolar system, and we encourage future studies to concentrate on this regimewhile relaxing our assumption of a fixed planetesimal disk.

astro-ph;0703163	origins of eccentric extrasolar planets: testing the planet-planet  scattering model	(abridged) in planetary systems with two or more giant planets, dynamicalinstabilities can lead to collisions or ejections through strong planet--planetscattering. previous studies for simple initial configurations with twoequal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numericalsimulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. here, weshow that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circularorbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of finaleccentricities. the two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce theobserved eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.further, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity ofabout 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided thatboth planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. this comparesfavorably with current observations and will be tested by future planetdiscoveries. the combination of planet--planet scattering and tidalcircularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets withvery short period orbits. orbital migration due to planet scattering could playan important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with veryshort period orbits. we also re-examine and discuss various possiblecorrelations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolarplanets. we demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses,orbital periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models ofplanet formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0703166	dynamical outcomes of planet-planet scattering	observations in the past decade have revealed extrasolar planets with a widerange of orbital semimajor axes and eccentricities. based on the presentunderstanding of planet formation via core accretion and oligarchic growth, weexpect that giant planets often form in closely packed configurations. whilethe protoplanets are embedded in a protoplanetary gas disk, dissipation canprevent eccentricity growth and suppress instabilities from becoming manifest.however, once the disk dissipates, eccentricities can grow rapidly, leading toclose encounters between planets. strong planet--planet gravitationalscattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidalcircularization, very short-period planets, as observed in the exoplanetpopulation. we present new results for this scenario based on extensivedynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with andwithout residual gas disks. we assign the initial planetary masses and orbitsin a realistic manner following the core accretion model of planet formation.we show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet--planet scattering canreproduce quite well the observed eccentricity distribution. our results alsomake testable predictions for the orbital inclinations of short-period giantplanets formed via strong planet scattering followed by tidal circularization.

0811.0001	secular evolution of hd 12661: a system caught at an unlikely time	the eccentricity evolution of multiple planet systems can provide valuableconstraints on planet formation models. unfortunately, the inevitableuncertainties in the current orbital elements can lead to significantambiguities in the nature of the secular evolution. integrating any single setof orbital elements inadequately describes the full range of secular evolutionsconsistent with current observations. thus, we combine radial velocityobservations of hd 12661 with markov chain monte carlo sampling to generateensembles of initial conditions for direct n-body integrations. we find thatany mean motion resonances are quite weak and do not significantly impact thesecular evolution, and that current observations indicate circulation or largeamplitude libration of the periapses. the eccentricity of the outer planetundergoes large oscillations for nearly all of the allowed two-planet orbitalsolutions. this type of secular evolution would arise if planet c had beenimpulsively perturbed, perhaps due to strong scattering of an additional planetthat was subsequently accreted onto the star. finally, we note that the secularevolution implied by the current orbital configuration implies that planet cspends ~96% of the time following an orbit more eccentric than that presentlyobserved. either this system is being observed during a relatively rare state,or additional planets are affecting the observed radial velocities and/or thesystem's secular eccentricity evolution.
