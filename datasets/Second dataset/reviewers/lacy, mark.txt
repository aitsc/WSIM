0902.2907	the evolutionary history of lyman break galaxies between redshift 4 and  6: observing successive generations of massive galaxies in formation	we present new measurements of the evolution in the lyman break galaxy (lbg)population between z~4 and z~6. by utilizing the extensive multiwavelengthdatasets available in the goods fields, we identify 2443 b, 506 v, and 137i'-band dropout galaxies likely to be at z~4, 5, and 6. with the goal ofunderstanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies atz&gt;4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function ofcosmic time. we find that at a fixed rest-uv luminosity, the average stellarmasses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z~6 and 4. inorder to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of highredshift lbgs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young,newly-luminous objects at each successive redshift. when considered along withthe short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results maysuggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting onlyseveral hundred million years. in contrast to the unchanging relationshipbetween the average stellar mass and rest-uv luminosity, we find that thenumber density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4&lt;z&lt;6.given this rapid increase of uv luminous massive galaxies, we explore thepossibility that a significant fraction of massive (m*&gt;1e11 msun) z~2-3 distantred galaxies (drgs) were in part assembled in an lbg phase at earlier times.integrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming lbgsover 4&lt;z&lt;6 down to z~2, we find that z&gt;3 lbgs could have contributedsignificantly to the quiescent drg population, indicating that the intensestar-forming systems probed by current sub-millimeter observations are not theonly route toward the assembly of drgs at z~2.

0706.3222	the first-2mass red quasar survey	combining radio observations with optical and infrared color selection --demonstrated in our pilot study to be an efficient selection algorithm forfinding red quasars -- we have obtained optical and infrared spectroscopy for120 objects in a complete sample of 156 candidates from a sky area of 2716square degrees. consistent with our initial results, we find our selectioncriteria -- j-k&gt;1.7, r-k&gt;4.0 -- yield a ~50% success rate for discoveringquasars substantially redder than those found in optical surveys. comparisonwith uvx- and optical color-selected samples shows that &gt;~ 10% of the quasarsare missed in a magnitude-limited survey. simultaneous two-frequency radioobservations for part of the sample indicate that a synchrotron continuumcomponent is ruled out as a significant contributor to reddening the quasars'spectra. we go on to estimate extinctions for our objects assuming their redcolors are caused by dust. continuum fits and balmer decrements suggest e(b-v)values ranging from near zero to 2.5 magnitudes. correcting the k-bandmagnitudes for these extinctions, we find that for k &lt;= 14.0, red quasars makeup between 25% and 60% of the underlying quasar population; owing to theincompleteness of the 2mass survey at fainter k-band magnitudes, we can onlyset a lower limit to the radio-detected red quasar population of &gt;20-30%.

0909.1565	galaxies at high redshift and reionization	the quest to discover the most distant galaxies has developed rapidly in thelast decade. we are now exploring redshifts of 6 and beyond, when the universewas less than a billion years old, an epoch when the previously-neutralintergalactic medium was reionized. the continuing discovery of galaxies atprogressively higher and higher redshifts has been driven by the availabilityof large telescopes on the ground and in space, improvements in detectortechnology, and new search strategies. over the past 4 years, the lyman breaktechnique has been shown to be effective in isolating z~6 star-forming i'-dropgalaxies through spectroscopic confirmation with large ground-based telescopes(keck, gemini and the eso vlts). narrow-band imaging, notably with the widefield of the subaru telescope, has also produced samples of lyman-alphaemitters at these redshifts. a the discovery of this i'-drop galaxy populationhas been used to infer the global star formation rate density at this epoch(z~6), and we are now beginning to constrain the contribution to reionizationof the uv flux from these galaxies. infrared data from the spitzer spacetelescope has been used to determine the spectral energy distributions (seds)from the rest-frame uv to the optical, and constrain the previous starformation histories, masses and ages. the indications are that much of thestellar mass of these galaxies might have formed in vigorous bursts at z&gt;6. thenext big advances would be to test the population synthesis modelling of thesez~6 galaxies through spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical (rather than crudebroad-band seds), and also to push the observational horizon for galaxiesfurther to directly explore star formation during the reionization epoch. jwstis likely to have a profound impact on realising these goals.

0909.2255	the contribution of high redshift galaxies to cosmic reionization: new  results from deep wfc3 imaging of the hubble ultra deep field	we have searched for star-forming galaxies at z~7 by applying the lyman-breaktechnique to newly-released 1.1micron y-band images from wfc3 on hst. bycomparing these images of the hubble ultra deep field with the acs z'-band(0.85micron), we identify objects with red colours, (z'-y)_ab&gt;1.3), consistentwith the ly-alpha forest absorption at z~6.7-8.8. we identify 12 of thesez'-drops down to a limiting magnitude y_ab&lt;28.5 (equivalent to a star formationrate of 1.3m_sun/yr at z=7.1), which are undetected in the other acs filters.we use the wfc3 j-band image to eliminate contaminant low mass galactic stars,which typically have redder colours than z~7 galaxies. one of our z'-drops is aprobably a t-dwarf star. the z~7 z'-drops have much bluer spectral slopes thanlyman-break galaxies at lower redshift. our brightest z'-drop is not present inthe nicmos j-band image of the same field taken 5 years before, and is apossible transient object. from the 10 remaining z~7 candidates we determine alower limit on the star formation rate density of 0.0017m_sun/yr/mpc^3 for asalpeter initial mass function, which rises to 0.0025-0.0034m_sun/yr/mpc^3after correction for luminosity bias. the star formation rate density is afactor of ~10 less than that at z=3-4, and is about half the value at z~6.while based on a single deep field, our results suggest that this starformation rate density would produce insufficient lyman continuum photons toreionize the universe unless the escape fraction of these photons is extremelyhigh (f_esc&gt;0.5), and the clumping factor of the universe is low. even then, weneed to invoke a large contribution from galaxies below our detection limit.the apparent shortfall in ionizing photons might be alleviated if stellarpopulations at high redshift are low metallicity or have a top-heavy imf.

0910.1099	millimetre observations of a sample of high-redshift obscured quasars	we present observations at 1.2 mm with mambo-ii of a sample of z&gt;~2radio-intermediate obscured quasars, as well as co observations of two sourceswith the plateau de bure interferometer. five out of 21 sources (24%) aredetected at a significance of &gt;=3sigma. stacking all sources leads to astatistical detection of &lt;s_1.2mm&gt;= 0.96+-0.11 mjy and stacking only thenon-detections also yields a statistical detection, with &lt;s_1.2mm&gt;= 0.51+-0.13mjy. this corresponds to a typical far-infrared luminosity l_fir~4x10^12 lsol.if the far-infrared luminosity is powered entirely by star-formation, and notby agn-heated dust, then the characteristic inferred star-formation rate is~700 msol yr-1. this far-infrared luminosity implies a dust mass ofm_dust~3x10^8 msol. we estimate that such large dust masses on kpc scales canplausibly cause the obscuration of the quasars. we present dust seds for oursample and derive a mean sed for our sample. this mean sed is not well fittedby clumpy torus models, unless additional extinction and far-infraredre-emission due to cool dust are included. there is a hint that the hostgalaxies of obscured quasars must have higher far-infrared luminosities andcool-dust masses and are therefore often found at an earlier evolutionary phasethan those of unobscured quasars. for one source at z=2.767, we detect theco(3-2) transition, with s_co delta nu=630+-50 mjy km s-1, corresponding tol_co(3-2)= 3.2x10^7 lsol, or l'_co(3-2)=2.4x10^10 k km s-1 pc2. for anothersource at z=4.17, the lack of detection of the co(4-3) line yields a limit ofl'_co(4-3)&lt;1x10^10 k km s-1 pc2. molecular gas masses, gas depletion timescalesand gas-to-dust ratios are estimated (abridged).

0910.1363	an infrared comparison of type-1 and type-2 quasars	we model the optical to far-infrared seds of a sample of six type-1 and sixtype-2 quasars selected in the mid-infrared. the objects in our sample arematched in mid-ir luminosity and selected based on their spitzer irac colors.we obtained new targeted spitzer irs and mips observations and used archivalphotometry to examine the optical to far-ir seds. we investigate whether theobserved differences between samples are consistent with orientation-basedunification schemes. the type-1 objects show significant emission at 3 micron.they do not show strong pah emission and have less far-ir emission on averagewhen compared to the type-2 objects. the seds of the type-2 objects show a wideassortment of silicate features, ranging from weak emission to deep silicateabsorption. some also show strong pah features. in comparison, silicate is onlyseen in emission in the type-1 objects. this is consistent with some of thetype-2s being reddened by a foreground screen of cooler dust, perhaps in thehost galaxy itself. we investigate the agn contribution to the far-ir emissionand find it to be significant. we also estimate the star formation rate foreach of the objects by integrating the modeled far-ir flux and compare thiswith the sfr found from pah emission. we find the type-2 quasars have a higheraverage sfr than the type-1 quasars based on both methods, though this could bedue to differences in bolometric luminosities of the objects. while we findpronounced differences between the two types of objects, none of them areinconsistent with orientation-based unification schemes.

0910.5521	on the 10-micron silicate feature in active galactic nuclei	the 10-micron silicate feature observed with spitzer in active galacticnuclei (agn) reveals some puzzling behavior. it (1) has been detected inemission in type 2 sources, (2) shows broad, flat-topped emission peaks shiftedtoward long wavelengths in several type 1 sources, and (3) is not seen in deepabsorption in any source observed so far. we solve all three puzzles with ourclumpy dust radiative transfer formalism. (1) we present the spectral energydistribution (sed) of sst1721+6012, the first type 2 quasar observed to show aclear 10-mic silicate feature in emission. we constructed a large database ofclumpy torus models and performed extensive fitting of the observed sed,constraining several of the torus parameters. we find that the sourcebolometric luminosity is ~3*10^12 l_sun. our modeling suggests that &lt;35% ofobjects with tori sharing characteristics and geometry similar to the best fitwould have their central engines obscured. this relatively low obscurationprobability can explain the clear appearance of the 10-mic emission feature insst1721+6012 together with its rarity among other qso2. (2) we also fitted thesed of pg1211+143, one of the first type 1 qsos with a 10-mic silicate featurein emission. among similar sources, this qso appears to display an unusuallybroadened feature whose peak is shifted toward longer wavelengths. althoughthis led to suggestions of non-standard dust chemistry in these sources, ouranalysis fits such seds with standard galactic dust; the apparent peak shiftsarise from radiative transfer effects. (3) we find that the distribution ofsilicate feature strengths among clumpy torus models closely resembles theobserved distribution, and the feature never occurs deeply absorbed. (abridged)

0707.2951	spectacular shells in the host galaxy of the qso mc2 1635+119	we present deep hst/acs images and keck spectroscopy of mc2 1635+119, a qsohosted by a galaxy previously classified as an undisturbed elliptical. our newimages reveal dramatic shell structure indicative of a merger event in therelatively recent past. the brightest shells in the central regions of the hostare distributed alternately in radius, with at least two distinct shells on oneside of the nucleus and three on the other, out to a distance of ~13 kpc. thelight within the five shells comprises ~6% of the total galaxy light. lowersurface brightness ripples or tails and other debris extend out to a distanceof ~65 kpc. a simple n-body model for a merger reproduces the inner shellstructure and gives an estimate for the age of the merger between ~30 myr and~1.7 gyr, depending on a range of reasonable assumptions. while the inner shellstructure is suggestive of a minor merger, the total light contribution fromthe shells and extended structures are more indicative of a major merger. thespectrum of the host galaxy is dominated by a population of intermediate age(~1.4 gyr), indicating a strong starburst episode that may have occurred at thetime of the merger event. we speculate that the current qso activity may havebeen triggered in the recent past by either a minor merger, or by debris froman older (~gyr) major merger that is currently ``raining'' back into thecentral regions of the merger remnant.

0708.0407	discovery of radio jets in z~2 ulirgs with deep 9.7um silicate  absorption	recent spitzer observations have revealed a substantial population of z~2ulirgs with deep silicate absorption (\tau_{9.7}&gt;1). this paper reports a 20cmradio study of such a sample to elucidate their physical nature. we discoverthat a substantial fraction (40%) of deep silicate absorption ulirgs at z~2 aremoderately radio-loud with l_{1.4ghz}=10^{25}--10^{26}whz^{-1}. this is instrong contrast with z&lt;1 radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars where none ofthe sources with available irs spectra have \tau_{9.7}&gt;1. in addition, weobserve radio jets in two of our sources where one has a double lobe structure~200kpc in extent, and another shows a one-sided jet extending ~90kpc from thenucleus. the likely high inclination of the latter, coupled with its deepsilicate absorption, implies the mid-ir obscuration does not share an axis withthe radio jets. these sources are highly obscured quasars, observed in thetransition stage after the birth of the radio source, but before feedbackeffects dispel the ism and halt the black hole accretion and starburstactivity.

1009.1852	star formation and dust obscuration in the tidally distorted galaxy ngc  2442	abridged: we present a detailed investigation of the morphologicaldistribution and level of star formation and dust obscuration in the nearbytidally distorted galaxy ngc2442. spitzer images in the ir at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,8.0um, and 24um and galex images at 1500\aa{} and 2300\aa{} allow us to resolvethe galaxy on scales between 240-600pc. we supplement these with archival datain the b, j, h, and k bands. we use the 8um, 24um and fuv (1500\aa) emission tostudy the star formation rate (sfr). we find that globally, these tracers ofstar formation give a range of results of ~6-11\msun/yr, with thedust-corrected fuv giving the highest value of sfr. we can reconcile the uv andir-based estimates by adopting a steeper uv extinction curve that lies inbetween the starburst (calzetti) and smc extinction curves. however, theregions of highest sfr intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with astarburst-like extinction. overall, the level of star-formation we find ishigher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,which, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction thatcaused the distorted morphology of ngc2442 likely also triggered increasedlevels of star-formation activity. outside of the spiral arms, we discover whatappears to be a superbubble, ~1.7kpc across in the irac images. significanth{\alpha}, uv and ir emission in the area also suggest vigorous ongoingstar-formation. a known, recent supernova (sn1999ga) is located at the edge ofthis superbubble. although speculative at this stage, this area suggests alarge star-forming region with a morphology shaped by generations ofsupernovae. lastly, we discover an 8um (pah) circumnuclear ring with an ~0.8kpcradius. the h{\alpha} emission is largely concentrated inside that ring andshows a vague spiral structure in the rest of the galaxy.

1009.2750	obscured starburst activity in high redshift clusters and groups	using spitzer-mips 24um imaging and keck spectroscopy we examine the natureof the obscured star forming population in three clusters and three groups atz~0.9. these six systems are components of the cl1604 supercluster, the largeststructure imaged by spitzer at redshifts near unity. we find that the averagedensity of 24um-detected galaxies within the cl1604 clusters is nearly twicethat of the surrounding field and that this overdensity scales with thecluster's dynamical state. the 24um-bright members often appear opticallyunremarkable and exhibit only moderate [oii] line emission due to severeobscuration. their spatial distribution suggests they are an infallingpopulation, but an examination of their spectral properties, morphologies andoptical colors indicate they are not simply analogs of the field populationthat have yet to be quenched. using stacked composite spectra, we find the24um-detected cluster and group galaxies exhibit elevated levels of balmerabsorption compared to galaxies undergoing normal, continuous star formation. asimilar excess is not observed in field galaxies with equivalent infraredluminosities, indicating a greater fraction of the detected cluster and groupmembers have experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past comparedto their counterparts in the field. our results suggest that gas-rich galaxiesat high redshift experience a temporary increase in their star formationactivity as they assemble into denser environments. using hst-acs imaging wefind that disturbed morphologies are common among the 24um-detected cluster andgroup members and become more prevalent in regions of higher galaxy density. weconclude that mergers are the dominant triggering mechanism responsible for theenhanced star formation found in the cl1604 groups, while a mix of harassmentand mergers are likely driving the activity of the cluster galaxies.

1010.0691	evidence for a maximum jet efficiency for the most powerful radio  galaxies	we use new mid-infrared (mid-ir) photometry from the spitzer space telescopeto study the relations between low-frequency radio luminosity density l_151mhz,mid-ir (12um rest-frame) luminosity l_12um, and optical-emission-line ([oii])luminosity l_[oii], for a complete sample of z~1 radio galaxies from the 3crr,6ce, 6c*, 7crs and toot00 surveys. the narrow redshift span of our sample(0.9&lt;z&lt;1.1) means that it is unbiased to evolutionary effects. we find evidencethat these three quantities are positively correlated. the scaling betweenl_12um and l_[oii] is similar to that seen in other agn samples, consistentwith both l_12um and l_[oii] tracing accretion rate. we show that the positivecorrelation between l_12um and l_151mhz implies that there is a genuine lack ofobjects with low values of l_12um at high values of l_151mhz. given that l_12umtraces accretion rate, while l_151mhz traces jet power, this can be understoodin terms of a minimum accretion rate being necessary to produce a given jetpower. this implies that there is a maximum efficiency with which accretedenergy can be chanelled into jet power and that this efficiency is of orderunity.

1010.1385	the spitzer high redshift radio galaxy survey	we present results from a comprehensive imaging survey of 70 radio galaxiesat redshifts 1&lt;z&lt;5.2 using all three cameras onboard the spitzer spacetelescope. the resulting spectral energy distributions unambiguously show astellar population in 46 sources and hot dust emission associated with theactive nucleus in 59. using a new restframe s_3um/s_1.6um versus s_um/s_3umcriterion, we identify 42 sources where the restframe 1.6um emission from thestellar population can be measured. for these radio galaxies, the medianstellar mass is high, 2x10^11 m_sun, and remarkably constant within the range1&lt;z&lt;3. at z&gt;3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease instellar mass. this suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk oftheir stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition ofstellar and agn emission is needed.  the restframe 500 mhz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated withstellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dustluminosity. this suggests that the radio galaxies have a large range ofeddington ratios. we also present new very large array 4.86 and 8.46 ghzimaging of 14 radio galaxies and find that radio core dominance --- anindicator of jet orientation --- is strongly correlated with hot dustluminosity. while all of our targets were selected as narrow-lined, type 2agns, this result can be understood in the context of orientation-dependentmodels if there is a continuous distribution of orientations from obscured type2 to unobscured type 1 agns rather than a clear dichotomy. finally, four radiogalaxies have nearby (&lt;6") companions whose mid-ir colors are suggestive oftheir being agns. this may indicate an association between radio galaxyactivity and major mergers.

0709.2805	evidence for quasar activity triggered by galaxy mergers in hst  observations of dust-reddened quasars	we present hubble acs images of thirteen dust reddened type-1 quasarsselected from the first/2mass red quasar survey. these quasars have highintrinsic luminosities after correction for dust obscuration (-23.5 &gt; m_b &gt;-26.2 from k-magnitude). the images show strong evidence of recent or ongoinginteraction in eleven of the thirteen cases, even before the quasar nucleus issubtracted. none of the host galaxies are well fit by a simple ellipticalprofile. the fraction of quasars showing interaction is significantly higherthan the 30% seen in samples of host galaxies of normal, unobscured quasars.there is a weak correlation between the amount of dust reddening and themagnitude of interaction in the host galaxy, measured using the ginicoefficient and the concentration index. although few host galaxy studies ofnormal quasars are matched to ours in intrinsic quasar luminosity, no evidencehas been found for a strong dependence of merger activity on host luminosity insamples of the host galaxies of normal quasars. we thus believe that the highmerger fraction in our sample is related to their obscured nature, with asignificant amount of reddening occurring in the host galaxy. the red quasarphenomenon seems to have an evolutionary explanation, with the young quasarspending the early part of its lifetime enshrouded in an interacting galaxy.this might be further indication of a link between agn and starburst galaxies.

1112.3655	the gemini cluster astrophysics spectroscopic survey (gclass): the role  of environment and self-regulation in galaxy evolution at z ~ 1	we evaluate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxy propertiesat 0.85 &lt; z &lt; 1.20 using a 3.6um-selected spectroscopic sample of 797 clusterand field galaxies drawn from the gclass survey. we confirm that for galaxieswith logm* &gt; 9.3 the well-known correlations between environment and propertiessuch as star-forming fraction (f_sf), sfr, ssfr, d(4000), and color are alreadyin place at z ~ 1. we separate the effects of environment and stellar mass ongalaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies atfixed environment, and fixed stellar mass. the ssfr of star-forming galaxies atfixed environment is correlated with stellar mass; however, at fixed stellarmass it is independent of environment. the same trend exists for the d(4000)measures of both the star-forming and quiescent galaxies and shows that theirproperties are determined primarily by their stellar mass, not by theirenvironment. instead, it appears that environment's primary role is to controlthe fraction of star-forming galaxies. using the spectra we identify candidatepoststarburst galaxies and find that those with 9.3 &lt; logm* &lt; 10.7 are 3.1 +/-1.1 times more common in high-density regions compared to low-density regions.the clear association of poststarbursts with high-density regions as well asthe lack of a correlation between the ssfrs and d(4000)s of star-forminggalaxies with their environment suggests that at z ~ 1 theenvironmental-quenching timescale must be rapid. lastly, we construct a simplequenching model which demonstrates that the lack of a correlation between thed(4000) of quiescent galaxies and their environment results naturally if selfquenching dominates over environmental quenching at z &gt; 1, or if the evolutionof the self-quenching rate mirrors the evolution of the environmental-quenchingrate at z &gt; 1, regardless of which dominates.

0711.0266	mid-infrared spectroscopy of high-redshift obscured quasars	we present mid-infrared observations of 18 sources from a sample of 21 z~2radio-intermediate obscured quasars. the mid-infrared spectra of the sourcesare continuum dominated, and 12 sources show deep silicate absorption withtau_9.7~1-2. combining mid-infrared and optical spectra, we achieve 86%spectroscopic completeness which allows us to confirm that most (63 +14 -22 %)z~2 radio-intermediate quasars are obscured. the new spectra also prove thatmany high-redshift type-2 quasars do not show any rest-frame ultravioletemission lines. from the 18 individual mid-infrared spectra, we classify mostof the sources into three subsamples: those with hints of the 7.7 and 6.2micron polyaromatic hydrocarbons (3/18 sources show pahs, subsample a), thosewith an excess of emission around 8 micron but no hint of the 6.2 micron pah(7/18 cases, subsample b) and pure-continuum sources with no visible excess(4/18 sources, subsample c). the remaining 4/18 sources have spectra that arefeatureless or too noisy for any features to be visible. in subsample a,averaging the spectra leads to a statistical detection of both 6.2 and 7.7micron pahs over the continuum, with the strength of the 7.7 micron pahcomparable to that of submillimetre-selected galaxies (smgs) at similarredshifts. these sources are in a phase of coeval growth of a supermassiveblack hole and a host galaxy.

1204.5480	gas and dust in a z=2.8 obscured quasar	we present new detections of the co(5-4), co(7-6), [ci](1-0) and [ci](2-1)molecular and atomic line transitions towards the unlensed, obscured quasarams12 (z=2.7672), observed with the iram pdbi. this is the first unlensed, highredshift source to have both [ci] transitions detected. continuum measurementsbetween 70 $\mu$m and 3 mm are used to constrain the fir sed, and we find abest fit fir luminosity of log[lfir/lsol] = 13.5+/-0.1, dust temperature t_d =88+/-8 k and emissivity index {\beta} = 0.6+/-0.1. the highly-excited moleculargas probed by co(3-2), (5-4) and (7-6), is modelled with large velocitygradient (lvg) models. the gas kinetic temperature t_g, density n(h2), and thecharacteristic size r0, are determined using the dust temperature from the firsed as a prior for the gas temperature. the best fitting parameters are t_g =90+/-8 k, n(h2) = 10^(3.9+/-0.1) cm^(-3) and r0 = 0.8+/-0.04 kpc. the ratio ofthe [ci] lines gives a [ci] excitation temperature of 43+/-10 k, indicating the[ci] and the high-excitation co are not in thermal equilibrium. the [ci]excitation temperature is below that of t_d and t_g of the high-excitation co,perhaps because [ci] lies at a larger radius where there may also be a largereservoir of co at a cooler temperature, perhaps detectable through theco(1-0). using the [ci](1-0) line we can estimate the strength of the co(1-0)line and hence the gas mass. this suggests that a significant fraction (~30%)of the molecular gas is missed from the high-excitation line analysis. theeddington limited black hole mass is found from the bolometric luminosity to bembh &gt;~ 1.5x10^9 msol. along with the stellar mass of 3x10^11 msol, these give ablack hole - bulge mass ratio of mbh/mbulge &gt;~ 0.005. this is in agreement withstudies on the evolution of the mbh/mbulge relationship at high redshifts,which find a departure from the local value ~0.002.

1207.2175	first-2mass red quasars: transitional objects emerging from the dust	we present a sample of 120 dust-reddened quasars identified by matching radiosources detected at 1.4 ghz in the first survey with the near-infrared 2masscatalog and color-selecting red sources. optical and/or near-infraredspectroscopy provide broad wavelength sampling of their spectral energydistributions that we use to determine their reddening, characterized bye(b-v). we demonstrate that the reddening in these quasars is best-described bysmc-like dust. this sample spans a wide range in redshift and reddening (0.1 &lt;z &lt; 3, 0.1 &lt; e(b-v) &lt; 1.5), which we use to investigate the possiblecorrelation of luminosity with reddening. at every redshift, dust-reddenedquasars are intrinsically the most luminous quasars. we interpret this resultin the context of merger-driven quasar/galaxy co-evolution where these reddenedquasars are revealing an emergent phase during which the heavily obscuredquasar is shedding its cocoon of dust prior to becoming a "normal" blue quasar.when correcting for extinction, we find that, depending on how the parentpopulation is defined, these red quasars make up &lt; 15-20% of the luminousquasar population. we estimate, based on the fraction of objects in this phase,that its duration is 15-20% as long as the unobscured, blue quasar phase.

1208.4585	spitzer observations of young red quasars	we present mid-infrared spectra and photometry of thirteen redshift 0.4&lt;z&lt;1dust-reddened quasars obtained with spitzer irs and mips. we compare propertiesderived from their infrared spectral energy distributions (intrinsic agnluminosity and far-infrared luminosity from star formation) to the hostluminosities and morphologies from hst imaging, and black hole masses estimatedfrom optical and/or near-infrared spectroscopy. our results are broadlyconsistent with models in which most dust reddened quasars are an intermediatephase between a merger-driven starburst triggering a completely obscured agn,and a normal, unreddened quasar. we find that many of our objects have highaccretion rates, close to the eddington limit. these objects tend to fall belowthe black hole mass -- bulge luminosity relation as defined by local galaxies,whereas most of our low accretion rate objects are slightly above the localrelation, as typical for normal quasars at these redshifts. our observationsare therefore most readily interpreted in a scenario in which galaxy stellarmass growth occurs first by about a factor of three in each merger/starburstevent, followed sometime later by black hole growth by a similar amount. we donot, however, see any direct evidence for quasar feedback affecting starformation in our objects, for example in the form of a relationship betweenaccretion rate and star formation. five of our objects, however, do showevidence for outflows in the oiii 5007 angstrom emission line profile,suggesting that the quasar activity is driving thermal winds in at least somemembers of our sample.

1208.5987	no evidence for lyman-alpha emission in spectroscopy of z &gt; 7 candidate  galaxies	we present gemini/gnirs spectroscopic observations of 4 z-band (z~7) dropoutgalaxies and vlt/xshooter observations of one z-band dropout and 3 y-band(z~8-9) dropout galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field, which were selectedwith wide field camera 3 imaging on the hubble space telescope. we find noevidence of lyman-alpha emission with a typical 5-sigma sensitivity of5x10^-18erg/cm^2/s, and we use the upper limits on lyman-alpha flux and thebroad-band magnitudes to constrain the rest-frame equivalent widths for thisline emission. accounting for incomplete spectral coverage, we survey 3.0z-band dropouts and 2.9 y-band dropouts to a lyman-alpha rest-frame equivalentwidth limit &gt; 120ang (for an unresolved emission line); for an equivalent widthlimit of 50ang the effective numbers of drop-outs surveyed fall to 1.2 z-banddrop-outs and 1.5 y-band drop-outs. a simple model where the fraction of highrest-frame equivalent width emitters follows the trend seen at z=3-6.5 isinconsistent with our non-detections at z=7-9 at the ~ 1-sigma level forspectrally unresolved lines, which may indicate that a significant neutral hifraction in the intergalactic medium suppresses the lyman-alpha line in z-dropand y-drop galaxies at z &gt; 7.

1210.1894	probing the m-sigma relation in the non-local universe using red qsos	we describe a method to measure the m-sigma relation in the non-localuniverse using dust-obscured qsos. we present results from a pilot sample ofnine 2mass red qsos with redshifts 0.14&lt;z&lt;0.37. we find that there is an offset(0.8 dex, on average) between the position of our objects and the localrelation for agn, in the sense that the majority of red qso hosts have lowervelocity dispersions and/or more massive bhs than local galaxies. these resultsare in agreement with recent studies of agn at similar and higher redshifts.this could indicate an unusually rapid growth in the host galaxies since z~0.2,if these objects were to land in the local relation at present time. however,the z&gt;0.1 agn (including our sample and those of previous studies) havesignificantly higher bh mass than those of local agn, so a direct comparison isnot straightforward. further, using several samples of local and higher-z agn,we find a striking trend of an increasing offset with respect to the localm-sigma relation as a function of agn luminosity, with virtually all objectswith log(l_5100/erg s^-1) &gt; 43.6 falling above the relation. given therelatively small number of agn at z&gt;0.1 for which there are direct measurementsof stellar velocity dispersions, it is impossible at present to determinewhether there truly is evolution in m-sigma with redshift. larger, carefullyselected samples of agn are necessary to disentangle the dependence of m-sigmaon mass, luminosity, accretion rates, and redshift.

1301.4477	vlt/xshooter &amp; subaru/moircs spectroscopy of hudf-yd3: no evidence for  lyman-alpha emission at z=8.55	we present spectroscopic observations with vlt/xshooter and subaru/moircs ofa relatively bright y-band drop-out galaxy in the hubble ultra deep field,first selected by bunker et al. (2010), mclure et al. (2010) and bouwens et al.(2010) to be a likely z~8-9 galaxy on the basis of its colours in the hst acsand wfc3 images. this galaxy, hudf.yd3 (also known as udfy-38135539) has beentargetted for vlt/sinfoni integral field spectroscopy by lehnert et al. (2010),who published a candidate lyman-alpha emission line at z=8.55 from this source.in our independent spectroscopy using two different infrared spectrographs (5hours with vlt/xshooter and 11 hours with subaru/moircs) we are unable toreproduce this line. we do not detect any emission line at the spectral andspatial location reported in lehnert et al. (2010), despite the expected signalin our combined moircs &amp; xshooter data being 5-sigma. the line emission alsoseems to be ruled out by the faintness of this object in recently extremelydeep f105w (y-band) hst/wfc3 imaging from hudf12; the line would fall withinthis filter and such a galaxy should have been detected at y(ab)=28.6mag (~20sigma) rather than the marginal y(ab)~30mag observed in the y-band image, &gt;3times fainter than would be expected if the emission lie was real. hence itappears highly unlikely that the reported lyman-alpha line emission at z&gt;8 isreal, meaning that the highest-redshift sources for which lyman-alpha emissionhas been seen are at z=6.9-7.2. it is conceivable that lyman-alpha does notescape galaxies at higher redshifts, where the gunn-peterson absorption rendersthe universe optically thick to this line. however, deeper spectroscopy on alarger sample of candidate z&gt;7 galaxies will be needed to test this.

1303.7194	evidence for agn-driven outflows in young radio quasars	we present near-infrared spectra of young radio quasars [p(1.4ghz) ~ 26-27w/hz] selected from the wide-field infrared survey explorer. the detectedobjects have typical redshifts of z ~ 1.6-2.5 and bolometric luminosities ~10^47 erg/s. based on the intensity ratios of narrow emission lines, we findthat these objects are mainly powered by active galactic nuclei (agns),although star formation contribution cannot be completely ruled out. the hostgalaxies experience moderate levels of extinction, a(v) ~ 0-1.3 mag. theobserved [o iii] luminosities and rest-frame j-band magnitudes constrain theblack hole masses to lie in the range ~ 10^8.9-10^9.7 solar mass. from theempirical correlation between black hole mass and host galaxy mass, we inferstellar masses of ~ 10^11.3-10^12.2 solar mass. the [o iii] line isexceptionally broad, with full width at half maximum ~1300 to 2100 km/s,significantly larger than that of ordinary distant quasars. we argue that theselarge line widths can be explained by jet-induced outflows, as predicted bytheoretical models of agn feedback.

1405.1737	multiwavelength characterization of faint ultra steep spectrum radio  sources : a search for high-redshift radio galaxies	ultra steep spectrum (uss) radio sources are one of the efficient tracers ofpowerful high-z radio galaxies (hzrgs). in contrast to searches for powerfulhzrgs from radio surveys of moderate depths, fainter uss samples derived fromdeeper radio surveys can be useful in finding hzrgs at even higher redshiftsand in unveiling a population of obscured weaker radio-loud agn at moderateredshifts. using our 325 mhz gmrt observations (5-sigma ~ 800 microjy) and 1.4ghz vla observations (5-sigma ~ 80 - 100 microjy) available in two subfields(viz., vla-vimos vlt deep survey (vla-vvds) and subaru x-ray deep field (sxdf))of the xmm-lss field, we derive a large sample of 160 faint uss radio sourcesand characterize their nature. the optical, ir counterparts of our uss samplesources are searched using existing deep surveys, at respective wavelengths. weattempt to unveil the nature of our faint uss sources using diagnostictechniques based on mid-ir colors, flux ratios of radio to mid-ir, and radioluminosities. redshift estimates are available for 86/116 (~ 74%) uss sourcesin the vla-vvds field and for 39/44 (~ 87%) uss sources in the sxdf fields withmedian values (z_median) ~ 1.18 and ~ 1.57, which are higher than that fornon-uss radio sources (z_median non-uss ~ 0.99 and ~ 0.96), in the twosubfields, respectively. the flux ratio of radio to mid-ir (s_1.4 ghz/s_3.6micron) versus redshift diagnostic plot suggests that more than half of our usssample sources distributed over z ~ 0.5 to 3.8 are likely to be hosted inobscured environments. a significant fraction (~ 26% in the vla-vvds and ~ 13%in the sxdf) of our uss sources without redshift estimates mostly remainunidentified in the existing optical, ir surveys, and exhibit high radio tomid-ir flux ratio limits similar to hzrgs, and thus, can be considered aspotential hzrg candidates.

1503.02561	submillimetre observations of wise/radio-selected agn and their  environments	we present jcmt scuba-2 850microns submillimetre (submm) observations of 30mid-infrared (mid-ir) luminous agn, detected jointly by the wise all-sky irsurvey and the nvss/first radio survey. these rare sources are selected bytheir extremely red mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) andcompact radio counterparts. further investigations show that they are highlyobscured, have abundant warm agn-heated dust and are thought to be experiencingintense agn feedback. these galaxies appear to be consistent with anagn-dominated galaxy, and could be a transient phase of merging galaxies. whencomparing the number of submm galaxies (smgs) detected serendipitously in thesurrounding 1.5-arcmin to those in blank-field submm surveys, there is a verysignificant overdensity, of order 5, but no sign of radial clustering centredat our primary objects. the wise/radio-selected agn thus reside in 10-mpc-scaleoverdense environments, that could be forming in pre-viralised clusters ofgalaxies. wise/radio-selected agns appear to be the strongest signposts ofhigh-density regions of active, luminous and dusty galaxies. scuba-2 850micronsobservations indicate that their submm fluxes are low compared to many popularagn sed templates, hence the wise/radio-selected agns have either less coldand/or more warm dust emission than normally assumed for typical agn. most ofthe targets are not detected, only four targets are detected at scuba-2850microns, and have total ir luminosities &gt;= 10^13 l_solar, if their redshiftsare consistent with the subset of the 10 scuba-2 undetected targets with knownredshifts, z ~ 0.44 - 2.86.

1505.05262	alma detection of a disc-dominated [c ii] emission line at z=4.6 in the  luminous qso j1554+1937	we present observations and analysis of an unusual [c ii] emission line inthe very luminous qso sdss j155426.16+193703.0 at z~4.6. the line is extremelybroad (fwhm 735 km/s) and seems to have a flat-topped or double-peaked lineprofile. a velocity map of the line shows a gradient across the source thatindicates large-scale rotation of star-forming gas. together, the velocity mapand line profile suggest the presence of a massive rotating disc with adynamical mass m_dyn &gt; 5x10^10 m_sun. using the assumption of a rotating discorigin, we employ an empirical relation between galaxy disc circular velocityand bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) to estimate that sigma &gt; 310 km/s,subject to a correction for the unknown disc inclination. this result impliesthat this source is consistent with the local m--sigma relation, or offset atmost by an order of magnitude in black hole mass. in contrast, the assumptionof a bulge origin for the [c ii] emission line would lead to a conclusion thatthe black hole is nearly two orders of magnitude more massive than predicted bythe m--sigma relation, similar to previous findings for other high-redshiftqsos. as disc rotation may be a common origin for [c ii] emission at highredshifts, these results stress that careful consideration of dynamical originsis required when using observations of this line to derive properties ofhigh-redshift galaxies.

0807.2433	quasar black hole masses from velocity dispersions	much progress has been made in measuring black hole (bh) masses in(non-active) galactic nuclei using the tight correlation between stellarvelocity dispersions (sigma) in galaxies and the mass of their central bh. theuse of this correlation in quasars, however, is hampered by the difficulty inmeasuring sigma in host galaxies that tend to be overpowered by their brightnuclei. we discuss results from a project that focuses on z~0.3 quasarssuffering from heavy extinction at shorter wavelengths. this makes it possibleto obtain clean spectra of the hosts in the spectral regions of interest, whilebroad lines (like h-alpha) are still visible at longer wavelengths. we comparebh masses obtained from velocity dispersions to those obtained from the broadline region and thus probe the evolution of this relation and bh growth withredshift and luminosity. our preliminary results show an offset between theposition of our objects and the local relation, in the sense that red quasarshave, on average, lower velocity dispersions than local galaxies. we discusspossible biases and systematic errors that may affect our results.

astro-ph;0003290	the evolution of the stellar hosts of radio galaxies	we present new near-infrared images of z&gt;0.8 radio galaxies from theflux-limited 7c-iii sample of radio sources for which we have recently obtainedalmost complete spectroscopic redshifts. the 7c objects have radio luminositiesabout 20 times fainter than 3c radio galaxies at a given redshift. the absolutemagnitudes of the underlying host galaxies and their scale sizes are onlyweakly dependent on radio luminosity. radio galaxy hosts at z~2 aresignificantly brighter than the hosts of radio-quiet quasars at similarredshifts and the model agn hosts of kauffmann &amp; haehnelt (2000). there is noevidence for strong evolution in scale size, which shows a large scatter at allredshifts. the hosts brighten significantly with redshift, consistent with thepassive evolution of a stellar population that formed at z&gt;~3. this scenario isconsistent with studies of host galaxy morphology and submillimeter continuumemission, both of which show strong evolution at z&gt;~2.5. the lack of a strong``redshift cutoff'' in the radio luminosity function to z&gt;4 suggests that theformation epoch of the radio galaxy host population lasts &gt;~1gyr from z&gt;~5 toz~3. we suggest these facts are best explained by models in which the mostmassive galaxies and their associated agn form early due to high baryondensities in the centres of their dark matter haloes.

astro-ph;0003461	the quasar fraction in low-frequency selected complete samples and  implications for unified schemes	low-frequency radio surveys are ideal for selecting orientation-independentsamples of extragalactic sources because the sample members are selected byvirtue of their isotropic steep-spectrum extended emission. we use the new 7credshift survey along with the brighter 3crr and 6c samples to investigate thefraction of objects with observed broad emission lines - the `quasar fraction'- as a function of redshift and of radio and narrow emission line luminosity.we find that the quasar fraction is more strongly dependent upon luminosity(both narrow line and radio) than it is on redshift. above a narrow [oii]emission line luminosity of log l_[oii] &gt; 35 w (or radio luminosity log l_151 &gt;26.5 w/hz/sr), the quasar fraction is virtually independent of redshift andluminosity; this is consistent with a simple unified scheme with an obscuringtorus with a half-opening angle theta_trans approx 53 degrees. for objects withless luminous narrow lines, the quasar fraction is lower. we show that this isnot due to the difficulty of detecting lower-luminosity broad emission lines ina less luminous, but otherwise similar, quasar population. we discuss evidencewhich supports at least two probable physical causes for the drop in quasarfraction at low luminosity: (i) a gradual decrease in theta_trans and/or agradual increase in the fraction of lightly-reddened (0 &lt; a(v) &lt; 5)lines-of-sight with decreasing quasar luminosity; and (ii) the emergence of adistinct second population of low luminosity radio sources which, like m87,lack a well-fed quasar nucleus and may well lack a thick obscuring torus.

astro-ph;0006368	discovery of a classic fr-ii broad absorption line quasar from the first  survey	we have discovered a remarkable quasar, first j101614.3+520916, whose opticalspectrum shows unambiguous broad absorption features while its double-lobedradio morphology and luminosity clearly indicate a classic fanaroff-riley typeii radio source. its radio luminosity places it at the extreme of the recentlyestablished class of radio-loud broad absorption line quasars (becker et al.1997, 2000; brotherton et al. 1998). because of its hybrid nature, we speculatethat first j101614.3+520916 is a typical fr-ii quasar which has beenrejuvenated as a broad absorption line (bal) quasar with a compact steepspectrum core. the direction of the jet axis of first j101614.3+520916 can beestimated from its radio structure and optical brightness, indicating that weare viewing the system at a viewing angle of &gt; 40 degrees. the position anglesof the radio jet and optical polarization are not well-aligned, differing by 20to 30 degrees. when combined with the evidence presented by becker et al.(2000) for a sample of 29 bal quasars showing that at least some bal quasarsare viewed along the jet axis, the implication is that no preferred viewingorientation is necessary to observe bal systems in a quasar's spectrum. this,and the probable young nature of compact steep spectrum sources, leadsnaturally to the alternate hypothesis that bals are an early stage in the livesof quasars.

astro-ph;0010419	the radio luminosity function from the low-frequency 3crr, 6ce &amp; 7crs  complete samples	we measure the radio luminosity function (rlf) of steep-spectrum radiosources using three redshift surveys of flux-limited samples selected at low(151 &amp; 178 mhz) radio frequency, low-frequency source counts and the local rlf.the redshift surveys used are the new 7c redshift survey (7crs) and thebrighter 3crr and 6ce surveys totalling 356 sources with virtually completeredshift information. this yields unprecedented coverage of the radioluminosity versus z plane for steep-spectrum sources, and hence the mostaccurate measurements of the steep-spectrum rlf yet made. we find that a simpledual-population model for the rlf fits the data well, requiring differentialdensity evolution (with z) for the two populations. the low-luminositypopulation can be associated with radio galaxies with weak emission lines, andincludes sources with both fri and frii radio structures; its comoving spacedensity $\rho$ rises by about one dex between z~0 and z~1 but cannot yet bemeaningfully constrained at higher redshifts. the high-luminosity populationcan be associated with frii radio galaxies and quasars with strong emissionlines; its $\rho$ rises by nearly three dex between z~0 and z~2. these resultsmirror the situation seen in x-ray and optically-selected agn. the integratedradio luminosity density of the combination of the two populations iscontrolled by the value of $\rho$ at the low-luminosity end of the rlf of thehigh-luminosity population, a quantity which has been directly measured at z~1by the 7crs. we argue that robust determination of this quantity at higherredshifts requires a new redshift survey based on a large (~1000 source) sampleabout five times fainter than the 7crs.

astro-ph;0106473	on the redshift cut-off for steep-spectrum radio sources	we use three samples (3crr, 6ce and 6c*) selected at low radio frequency toconstrain the cosmic evolution in the radio luminosity function (rlf) for the`most luminous' steep-spectrum radio sources. although intrinsically rare, suchsources give the largest possible baseline in redshift for the completeflux-density-limited samples currently available. using parametric models todescribe the rlf which incorporate distributions in radio spectral shape andlinear size as well as the usual luminosity and redshift, we find that the dataare consistent with a constant comoving space density between z~2.5 and z~4.5.we find this model is favoured over a model with similar evolutionary behaviourto that of optically-selected quasars (i.e. a roughly gaussian distribution inredshift) with a probability ratio of ~25:1 and ~100:1 for spatially-flatcosmologies with omega_lambda = 0 and omega_lambda = 0.7 respectively. withinthe uncertainties, this evolutionary behaviour may be reconciled with theshallow decline preferred for the comoving space density of flat-spectrumsources by dunlop &amp; peacock (1990) and jarvis &amp; rawlings (2000), in line withthe expectations of unified schemes.

astro-ph;0107441	the reddest quasars	in a survey of quasar candidates selected by matching the first and 2masscatalogs, we have found two extraordinarily red quasars. first j013435.7-093102is a 1 jy source at z=2.216 and has b-k &gt; 10, while first j073820.1+275045 is a2.5 mjy source at z=1.985 with b-k = 8.4. first j073820.1+275045 has strongabsorption lines of mgii and civ in the rest frame of the quasar and is highlypolarized in the rest frame ultraviolet, strongly favoring the interpretationthat its red spectral energy distribution is caused by dust reddening local tothe quasar. first j073820.1+275045 is thus one of the few low radio-luminosity,highly dust-reddened quasars known. the available observational evidence forfirst j013435.7-093102 leads us to conclude that it too is reddened by dust. weshow that first j013435.7-093102 is gravitationally lensed, increasing thenumber of known lensed, extremely dust-reddened quasars to at least three,including mg0414-0534 and pks1830-211. we discuss the implications of whetherthese objects are reddened by dust in the host or lensing galaxies. if reddenedby their local environment, then we estimate that between 10 and 20% of theradio-loud quasar population is reddened by dust in the host galaxy. thediscovery of first j073820.1+275045 and objects now emerging from x-ray surveyssuggests the existence of an analogous radio-quiet red quasar population. suchobjects will be entirely missed by standard radio or optical quasar surveys. ifdust in the lensing galaxies is primarily responsible for the extreme rednessof the lensed quasars, then an untold number of gravitationally lensed quasarsare being overlooked.

astro-ph;0302170	using radio galaxies to find super-structures	radio galaxies are excellent at tracing large-scale structure due to theirhigh bias. we present new results from the tons08 radio galaxy redshift survey.we find unequivocal evidence for a huge (at least 80 x 80 x 100 mpc^3)super-structure at redshift z=0.27, confirming tentative evidence for such astructure from the 7c redshift survey (7crs). a second, newly discoveredsuper-structure is also tentatively found at redshift 0.35 (of dimensions atleast 100 x 100 x 100 mpc^3). out of the total sample size of 84 radiogalaxies, at least 25 are associated with the two super-structures. we usequasi-linear structure formation theory to estimate the number of suchstructures expected in the tons08 volume if the canonical value for radiogalaxy bias is assumed. under this assumption, the structures represent ~ 4-5sigma peaks in the primordial density field and their expected number is low(10^{-2}-10^{-4}). fortunately, there are several plausible explanations (manyof which are testable) for these low probabilities in the form of potentialmechanisms for boosting the bias on large scales. these include: theassociation of radio galaxies with highly biased rich clusters insuper-structures, enhanced triggering by group/group mergers, and enhancedtriggering and/or redshift space distortion in collapsing systems as the growthof super-structures moves into the non-linear regime. similar structures couldhave been missed in previous surveys because of the effects of poisson-samplingfluctuations.

astro-ph;0303348	massive black holes at high redshifts	black holes with masses m_bh~10^{8.5} m_sun dominate the accretion history ofthe universe. these black hole masses are typical of those found inradio-selected galaxies today, suggesting that the giant elliptical hosts oflow redshift radio galaxies were the hosts of powerful, mostly radio-quiet,quasars in the high redshift universe. the reason that all radio galaxies arefound in such hosts may be the correlation of black hole mass with radioluminosity, but it is emphasized that accretion rate too plays an importantrole in the production of powerful radio jets. the tight k-z relation ofluminous, high redshift, radio galaxies is probably a selection effect due tothe selection on high black hole masses and high accretion rates. luminousradio galaxies are the radio-loud part of the ``quasar-2'' population, and theratio of radio-loud quasars to luminous radio galaxies, about 1:1, is so farour only good estimate of the relative numbers of quasar-1s and quasar-2s. thenumbers of radio-quiet and radio-intermediate quasar-2s are still uncertain,but a much larger population than the quasar-1s would conflict with constraintsfrom the present-day black hole mass density. a comparison of the numberdensities of dark matter haloes and the high redshift quasars, however,suggests that there are plenty of dark haloes capable of hosting the known highredshift agn and thus room for a significant, but not huge, quasar-2population.

astro-ph;0310103	the aligned z ~ 1 radio galaxy 3c 280	the z~1 radio galaxy 3c280 has a striking rest-frame uv morphology, withmultiple line and continuum components precisely aligned with the radiostructure, including an obvious semi-circular arc. we explore the nature ofthese various components by bringing together hst and ground-based imaging,ground-based spectroscopy, and radio mapping. from plausible decompositions ofthe spectra, we show that the continuum of the nuclear component is likelydominated by a combination of nebular thermal continuum, quasar light, andlight from old stars. a component that falls directly on the probable path ofthe radio jet shows mostly nebular thermal continuum and includes contributionsfrom a relatively young stellar population with an age around 100 myr. the arcappears to be completely dominated by line emission and nebular thermalcontinuum, with no evidence for a significant stellar contribution. though muchof the aligned light is in uv components, the underlying old elliptical is alsowell-aligned with the radio axis. the elliptical is well-fit by a devaucouleurs profile, probably has a moderately old stellar population (~3 gyr),and is a massive system with a velocity dispersion of sigma ~ 270 km/s thatimplies it contains a supermassive black hole. although the arc and theextended emission surrounding the eastern lobe suggest that interactionsbetween the radio lobe and jet must have been important in creating the uvmorphology, the ionization and kinematic properties in these componentsare moreconsistent with photoionization than shock excitation. 3c280 may be atransition object between the compact steep-spectrum radio galaxies which seemto be shock-dominated, and the extended radio sources which may have evolvedpast this phase and rarely show shock signatures.

0808.3668	the first-2mass red quasar survey ii: an anomalously high fraction of  lobals in searches for dust-reddened quasars	we present results on a survey to find extremely dust-reddened type-1quasars. combining the first radio survey, the 2mass infrared survey and thesloan digital sky survey, we have selected a candidate list of 122 potentialred quasars. with more than 80% spectroscopically identified objects, well over50% are classified as dust-reddened type 1 quasars, whose reddenings (e(b-v))range from approximately 0.1 to 1.5 magnitudes. they lie well off the colorselection windows usually used to detect quasars and many fall within thestellar locus, which would have made it impossible to find these objects withtraditional color selection techniques. the reddenings found are much moreconsistent with obscuration happening in the host galaxy rather than stemmingfrom the dust torus. we find an unusually high fraction of broad absorptionline (bal) quasars at high redshift, all but one of them belonging to the lowionization bal (lobal) class and many also showing absorption the metastablefeii line (felobal). the discovery of further examples of dust-reddened lobalquasars provides more support for the hypothesis that bal quasars (at leastlobal quasars) represent an early stage in the lifetime of the quasar. the factthat we see such a high fraction of bals could indicate that the quasar is in ayoung phase in which quasar feedback from the bal winds is suppressing starformation in the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0603218	star formation in qso host galaxies	many of the conditions that are necessary for starbursts appear to beimportant in the triggering of qsos. however, it is still debatable whetherstarbursts are ubiquitously present in galaxies harboring qsos. in this paperwe review our current knowledge from observations of the role of starbursts indifferent types of qsos. post-starburst stellar populations are potentiallypresent in the majority of qso hosts. qsos with far-infrared colors similar tothose of ultraluminous infrared galaxies invariably reside in merging galaxiesthat have interaction-induced starbursts of a few hundred myr or less. similar,but dramatically more luminous post-starburst populations are found in therecently discovered class of qsos known as post-starburst qsos, or q+a's. bothof these classes, however, comprise only a small fraction (10-15%) of the totalqso population. the so-called "red" qsos generally suffer from strongextinction at optical wavelengths, making them ideal candidates for the studyof hosts. their stellar populations typically show a post-starburst componentas well, though with a larger range of ages. finally, optical "classical" qsohosts show traces of major star formation episodes (typically involving &gt;10% ofthe mass of the stellar component) in the more distant past (1-2 gyr). thesestarbursts appear to be linked to past merger events. it remains to bedetermined whether these mergers were also responsible for triggering the qsoactivity that we observe today.

astro-ph;0607306	the stellar mass density at z~6 from spitzer imaging of i-drop galaxies	we measure the ages, stellar masses, and star formation histories of z~6galaxies, observed within 1gyr of the big bang. we use imaging from hst andspitzer from the public "great observatories origins deep survey", coupled withground-based near-infrared imaging, to measure the spectral energydistributions from 0.8-5microns, spanning the rest-frame uv and optical. fromour sample of ~50 i-drop lyman-break star-forming galaxies in goods-south withz'(ab)&lt;27mag, we focus on ~30 with reliable photometric or spectroscopicredshifts. half of these are confused with foreground sources at spitzerresolution, but from the 16 with clean photometry we find that a surprisinglylarge fraction (40%) have evidence for substantial balmer-breaks. thisindicates the presence of old underlying stellar populations that dominate thestellar masses. for these objects, we find ages of 200-700myr, implyingformation redshifts of 7&lt;z&lt;14, and large stellar masses in the range1-3x10^10m_sun. analysis of 7 i-drops that are undetected at 3.6micronsindicates that these are younger, considerably less massive systems. wecalculate that line contamination should not severely affect our photometry orderived results. using data out to 8microns, we find little evidence forsubstantial intrinsic dust reddening. correcting for incompleteness in oursample, we find a lower limit on the comoving stellar mass density at z~6 to be2.5x10^6m_sun/mpc^3. we are able to explore the star formation histories of ourselected galaxies, and we infer that the past global star formation rate mayhave been much higher than that observed at z~6. the associated uv flux weinfer at z&gt;7 could have played a major role in reionizing the universe.

astro-ph;0703224	the massive hosts of radio galaxies across cosmic time	we present the results of a comprehensive spitzer survey of 69 radio galaxiesacross 1&lt;z&lt;5.2. using irac (3.6-8.0um), irs (16um) and mips (24-160um) imaging,we decompose the rest-frame optical to infrared spectral energy distributionsinto stellar, agn, and dust components and determine the contribution of hostgalaxy stellar emission at rest-frame h-band. stellar masses derived fromrest-frame near-ir data, where agn and young star contributions are minimized,are significantly more reliable than those derived from rest-frame optical anduv data. we find that the fraction of emitted light at rest-frame h-band fromstars is &gt;60% for ~75% the high redshift radio galaxies. as expected fromunified models of agn, the stellar fraction of the rest-frame h-band luminosityhas no correlation with redshift, radio luminosity, or rest-frame mid-ir (5um)luminosity. additionally, while the stellar h-band luminosity does not varywith stellar fraction, the total h-band luminosity anti-correlates with thestellar fraction as would be expected if the underlying hosts of these radiogalaxies comprise a homogeneous population. the resultant stellar luminositiesimply stellar masses of 10^{11-11.5}msun even at the highest redshifts.powerful radio galaxies tend to lie in a similar region of mid-ir color-colorspace as unobscured agn, despite the stellar contribution to their mid-ir sedsat shorter-wavelengths. the mid-ir luminosities alone classify most hzrgs aslirgs or ulirgs with even higher total-ir luminosities. as expected, theseexceptionally high mid-ir luminosities are consistent with an obscured,highly-accreting agn. we find a weak correlation of stellar mass with radioluminosity.

(ii) the resonant o vi 1032,1036ang doublet (previouslyidentified as ly beta) is in an optically thick (1:1) ratio. at face value thisimplies an an extreme density (n_e ~ 10^{17}/m^3) more typical of broad lineregion clouds. however, we attribute this instead to the damping wings of lybeta from the resonant absorption.

astro-ph;9903314	radio-optical alignments in a low radio luminosity sample	we present an optically-based study of the alignment between the radio axesand the optical major axes of eight z~0.7 radio galaxies in a 7c sample. theradio galaxies in this sample are ~20-times less radio luminous than 3cgalaxies at the same redshift, and are significantly less radio-luminous thanany other well-defined samples studied to date. using nordic optical telescopeimages taken in good seeing conditions at rest-frame wavelengths just longwardof the 4000a break, we find a statistically significant alignment effect in the7c sample. furthermore, in two cases where the aligned components are wellseparated from the host we have been able to confirm spectroscopically thatthey are indeed at the same redshift as the radio galaxy. however, aquantitative analysis of the alignment in this sample and in a corresponding 3csample from hst archival data indicates that the percentage of aligned flux maybe lower and of smaller spatial scale in the 7c sample. our study suggests thatalignments on the 50-kpc scale are probably closely related to the radioluminosity, whereas those on the 15 kpc scale are not. we discuss these resultsin the context of popular models for the alignment effect.

astro-ph;9905357	a complete sample of radio sources in the north ecliptic cap, selected  at 38 mhz -- iii. further imaging observations and the photometric properties  of the sample	further imaging observations of a sample of radio sources in the northecliptic cap are presented and a number of new identifications are made. usingredshifts from spectroscopic data presented in a companion paper (lacy et al.\1999b), the photometric properties of the galaxies in the sample are discussed.it is shown that: (1) out to at least z~0.6 radio galaxies are good standardcandles irrespective of radio luminosity; (2) for 0.6~&lt;z~&lt;1 a large fraction ofthe sample have magnitudes and colours consistent with a non-evolving giantelliptical, and (3) at higher redshifts, where the r-band samples therest-frame uv flux, most objects have less uv luminosity than expected if theyform their stellar populations at a constant rate from a high redshift to$z\sim 1$ in unobscured star-forming regions (assuming an einstein -- de sittercosmology). the consequences of these observations are briefly discussed.

astro-ph;9905358	optical spectroscopy of two overlapping, flux-density-limited samples of  radio sources in the north ecliptic cap, selected at 38 mhz and 151 mhz	we present the results of optical spectroscopy of two flux-density-limitedsamples of radio sources selected at frequencies of 38 and 151 mhz in the sameregion around the north ecliptic cap, the 8c-nec and 7c-iii samplesrespectively. both samples are selected at flux density levels ~20 timesfainter than samples based on the 3c catalogue. they are amongst the firstlow-frequency selected samples with no spectral or angular size selection forwhich almost complete redshift information has been obtained and they willtherefore provide a valuable resource for understanding the cosmic evolution ofradio sources and their hosts and environments. the 151-mhz 7c-iii sample isselected to have s_151 &gt;=0.5 jy and is the more spectroscopically complete; outof 54 radio sources fairly reliable redshifts have been obtained for 44objects. the 8c sample has a flux limit of s_38 &gt;=1.3 jy and contains 58sources of which 46 have fairly reliable redshifts. we discuss possible biasesin the observed redshift distribution, and some interesting individual objects.using the 8c-nec and 7c-iii samples in conjunction, we form the first sampleselected on low-frequency flux in the rest-frame of the source, rather than theusual selection on flux density in the observed frame. this allows us to removethe bias associated with an increasing rest-frame selection frequency withredshift. we investigate the difference this selection makes to correlations ofradio source properties with redshift and luminosity. we show in particularthat flux-density-based selection leads to an overestimate of the steepness ofthe correlation of radio source size with redshift.

astro-ph;9905388	the emission line - radio correlation for radio sources using the 7c  redshift survey	we have used narrow emission line data from the new 7c redshift survey toinvestigate correlations between the narrow-line luminosities and the radioproperties of radio galaxies and steep-spectrum quasars. the 7c redshift surveyis a low-frequency (151 mhz) selected sample with a flux-density limit about25-times fainter than the 3crr sample. by combining these samples, we can forthe first time distinguish whether the correlations present are controlled by151 mhz radio luminosity l_151 or redshift z. we find unequivocal evidence thatthe dominant effect is a strong positive correlation between narrow lineluminosity l_nlr and l_151, of the form l_nlr proportional to l_151 ^ 0.79 +/-0.04. correlations of l_nlr with redshift or radio properties, such as linearsize or 151 mhz (rest-frame) spectral index, are either much weaker or absent.we use simple assumptions to estimate the total bulk kinetic power q of thejets in frii radio sources, and confirm the underlying proportionality betweenjet power and narrow line luminosity first discussed by rawlings &amp; saunders(1991). we make the assumption that the main energy input to the narrow lineregion is photoionisation by the quasar accretion disc, and relate q to thedisc luminosity, q_phot. we find that 0.05 &lt; q / q_phot &lt; 1 so that the jetpower is within about an order of magnitude of the accretion disc luminosity.the most powerful radio sources are accreting at rates close to the eddingtonlimit of supermassive black holes (~ 10^9 - 10^10 solar masses), whilst lowerpower sources are accreting at sub-eddington rates.

(2008). we also present spectroscopicconfirmation of two rich cluster candidates at z ~ 1.2. based onnod-and-shuffle spectroscopy from gmos-n on gemini there are 17 and 28confirmed cluster members in sparcs j163435+402151 and sparcs j163852+403843which have spectroscopic redshifts of 1.1798 and 1.1963, respectively. theclusters have velocity dispersions of 490 +/- 140 km/s and 650 +/- 160 km/s,respectively which imply masses (m200) of (1.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^{14} m_{solar} and(2.4 +/- 1.8) x 10^{14} m_{solar}. confirmation of these candidates as bonafide massive clusters demonstrates that two-filter imaging is an effective, yetobservationally efficient, method for selecting clusters at z &gt; 1.

0810.3567	eight-dimensional mid-infrared/optical bayesian quasar selection	we explore the multidimensional, multiwavelength selection of quasars frommid-ir (mir) plus optical data, specifically from spitzer-irac and the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we apply modern statistical techniques to combinedspitzer mir and sdss optical data, allowing up to 8-d color selection ofquasars. using a bayesian selection method, we catalog 5546 quasar candidatesto an 8.0 um depth of 56 ujy over an area of ~24 sq. deg; ~70% of thesecandidates are not identified by applying the same bayesian algorithm to4-color sdss optical data alone. our selection recovers 97.7% of known type 1quasars in this area and greatly improves the effectiveness of identifying3.5&lt;z&lt;5 quasars. even using only the two shortest wavelength irac bandpasses,it is possible to use our bayesian techniques to select quasars with 97%completeness and as little as 10% contamination. this sample has a photometricredshift accuracy of 93.6% (delta z +/-0.3), remaining roughly constant whenthe two reddest mir bands are excluded. while our methods are designed to findtype 1 (unobscured) quasars, as many as 1200 of the objects are type 2(obscured) quasar candidates. coupling deep optical imaging data with deepmid-ir data could enable selection of quasars in significant numbers past thepeak of the quasar luminosity function (qlf) to at least z~4. such a samplewould constrain the shape of the qlf and enable quasar clustering studies overthe largest range of redshift and luminosity to date, yielding significantgains in our understanding of quasars and the evolution of galaxies.
