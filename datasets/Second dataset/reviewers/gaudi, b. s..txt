0902.4237	detecting transits of planetary companions to giant stars	of the approximately 350 extrasolar planets currently known, of order 10%orbit evolved stars with radii r &gt;~ 2.5 r_sun. these planets are of particularinterest because they tend to orbit more massive hosts, and have been subjectedto variable stellar insolation over their recent histories as their primariesevolved off the main sequence. unfortunately, we have limited information aboutthe physical properties of these planets, as they were all detected by theradial velocity method and none have been observed to transit. here we evaluatethe prospects for detecting transits of planetary companions to giant stars. weshow that several of the known systems have a priori transit probabilities of&gt;~ 10%, and about one transiting system is expected for the sample of hoststars with r &gt;= 2.5 r_sun. although the transits are expected to have verysmall amplitudes (~few x 10^-4) and long durations (&gt;~ 50 hrs), we argue thatthe difficulty with detecting these signals in broadband light is one ofsystematic errors and practicality rather than photon noise, even for modestaperture ~1m telescopes. we propose a novel method that may overcome thesedifficulties, which uses narrow-band measurements to isolate the thin ring ofchromospheric emission expected at the limb of giant stars. the transit signalsin these narrow bands are expected to be larger in magnitude and briefer induration than in broad-band emission, and thus alleviating many of thedifficulties with transit detection in broad-band emission. finally, we pointout that it may be possible to discover planetary companions to giant starsusing kepler, provided that a sufficient number of such targets are monitored.

0903.2264	galaxy orientation and alignment effects in the sdss dr6	we identify, categorize, and quantify alignment effects among host andsatellite galaxies using a spectroscopically-confirmed, low-redshift (z&lt;0.23)galaxy sample from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6. consistent withother recent findings, we find that satellite galaxies (sgs) of red, centrallyconcentrated (elliptical) host galaxies (hgs) with radial velocity separation|delta_v|&lt;600 km/s preferentially reside near the projected major axes of theirhgs. among these, this preference is strongest for highly concentrated, redsgs. we find that fractional anisotropy increases with decreasing \delta_v anddelta_r and is nearly 40% greater among the closest sgs (delta_r&lt;250 kpc/h)relative to more distant (delta_r&gt;500 kpc/h) sgs. for highly concentrated sgsat small (&lt;300 kpc/h) projected separation, we observe a strong radial(hostward) alignment signal in isophotal position angles (pas) due to isophotaltwisting and contamination that is not present when using galaxy model pas.among objects for which both isophotal and galaxy model pas agree to &lt;15degrees, this elongation signal is significantly weaker. we also investigatethe "holmberg effect," a well-known result wherein nearby (&lt;40 kpc/h) sgs oflarge, inclined spiral hgs were seen to preferentially reside near the minoraxes of their hgs. survey limitations preclude a strict test of this effectusing only sdss spectroscopic galaxies. by adopting a looser set of cuts thanthose of holmberg's study, we recover a comparable preference among faint bluesgs for the hg minor axis at marginal significance (~3 sigma). we conclude thatseveral types of alignment likely exist among different galaxy populations, butthat the observed nature and strength of alignment trends depend sensitively onboth selection criteria and on the method used to determine galaxy orientation.

0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1001.0572	frequency of solar-like systems and of ice and gas giants beyond the  snow line from high-magnification microlensing events in 2005-2008	we present the first measurement of planet frequency beyond the "snow line"for planet/star mass-ratios[-4.5&lt;log q&lt;-2]: d^2 n/dlog q/dlogs=(0.36+-0.15)/dex^2 at mean mass ratio q=5e-4, and consistent with being flatin log projected separation, s. our result is based on a sample of 6 planetsdetected from intensive follow-up of high-mag (a&gt;200) microlensing eventsduring 2005-8. the sample host stars have typical mass m_host 0.5 msun, anddetection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations(r_e/s_max,r_e*s_max), where r_e 3.5 au sqrt(m_host/msun) is the einsteinradius and s_max (q/5e-5)^{2/3}, corresponding to deprojected separations ~3times the "snow line". though frenetic, the observations constitute a"controlled experiment", which permits measurement of absolute planetfrequency. high-mag events are rare, but the high-mag channel is efficient:half of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yieldedplanet detections. the planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7larger than from rv studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2&lt;p&lt;2000 days].however, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived fromrv studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it ismeasured). this suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex insemi-major axis, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. finally, if allplanetary systems were "analogs" of the solar system, our sample would haveyielded 18.2 planets (11.4 "jupiters", 6.4 "saturns", 0.3 "uranuses", 0.2"neptunes") including 6.1 systems with 2 or more planet detections. thiscompares to 6 planets including one 2-planet system in the actual sample,implying a first estimate of 1/6 for the frequency of solar-like systems.

1111.4032	characterizing lenses and lensed stars of high-magnification single-lens  gravitational microlensing events with lenses passing over source stars	we present the analysis of the light curves of 9 high-magnificationsingle-lens gravitational microlensing events with lenses passing over sourcestars, including ogle-2004-blg-254, moa-2007-blg-176,moa-2007-blg-233/ogle-2007-blg-302, moa-2009-blg-174, moa-2010-blg-436,moa-2011-blg-093, moa-2011-blg-274, ogle-2011-blg-0990/moa-2011-blg-300, andogle-2011-blg-1101/moa-2011-blg-325. for all events, we measure the linearlimb-darkening coefficients of the surface brightness profile of source starsby measuring the deviation of the light curves near the peak affected by thefinite-source effect. for 7 events, we measure the einstein radii and thelens-source relative proper motions. among them, 5 events are found to haveeinstein radii less than 0.2 mas, making the lenses candidates of very low-massstars or brown dwarfs. for moa-2011-blg-274, especially, the small einsteinradius of $\theta_{\rm e}\sim 0.08$ mas combined with the short time scale of$t_{\rm e}\sim 2.7$ days suggests the possibility that the lens is afree-floating planet. for moa-2009-blg-174, we measure the lens parallax andthus uniquely determine the physical parameters of the lens. we also find thatthe measured lens mass of $\sim 0.84\ m_\odot$ is consistent with that of astar blended with the source, suggesting that the blend is likely to be thelens. although we find planetary signals for none of events, we provideexclusion diagrams showing the confidence levels excluding the existence of aplanet as a function of the separation and mass ratio.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1207.1244	a possible binary system of a stellar remnant in the high magnification  gravitational microlensing event ogle-2007-blg-514	we report the extremely high magnification (a &gt; 1000) binary microlensingevent ogle-2007-blg-514. we obtained good coverage around the double peakstructure in the light curve via follow-up observations from differentobservatories. the binary lens model that includes the effects of parallax(known orbital motion of the earth) and orbital motion of the lens yields abinary lens mass ratio of q = 0.321 +/- 0.007 and a projected separation of s =0.072 +/- 0.001$ in units of the einstein radius. the parallax parameters allowus to determine the lens distance d_l = 3.11 +/- 0.39 kpc and total massm_l=1.40 +/- 0.18 m_sun; this leads to the primary and secondary componentshaving masses of m_1 = 1.06 +/- 0.13 m_sun and m_2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 m_sun,respectively. the parallax model indicates that the binary lens system islikely constructed by the main sequence stars. on the other hand, we used abayesian analysis to estimate probability distributions by the model thatincludes the effects of xallarap (possible orbital motion of the source arounda companion) and parallax (q = 0.270 +/- 0.005, s = 0.083 +/- 0.001). theprimary component of the binary lens is relatively massive with m_1 =0.9_{-0.3}^{+4.6} m_sun and it is at a distance of d_l = 2.6_{-0.9}^{+3.8} kpc.given the secure mass ratio measurement, the companion mass is therefore m_2 =0.2_{-0.1}^{+1.2} m_sun. the xallarap model implies that the primary lens islikely a stellar remnant, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star or a blackhole.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

1502.00004	characterizing transiting planet atmospheres through 2025	[abridged] we have only been able to comprehensively characterize theatmospheres of a handful of transiting planets, because most orbit faint stars.tess will discover transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars, enabling,in principle, an atmospheric survey of 10^2 to 10^3 bright hot jupiters andwarm sub-neptunes. uniform observations of such a statistically significantsample would provide leverage to understand---and learn from---the diversity ofshort-period planets. we argue that the best way to maximize the scientificreturns of tess is with a follow-up space mission consisting of a ~1 mtelescope with an optical--nir spectrograph: it could measure molecularabsorption for non-terrestrial planets, as well as eclipses and phasevariations for the hottest jovians. such a mission could observe up to 10^3transits per year, thus enabling it to survey a large fraction of the bright(j&lt;11) tess planets. jwst could be used to perform detailed atmosphericcharacterization of the most interesting transiting targets (transit, eclipse,and---when possible---phase-resolved spectroscopy). tess is also expected todiscover a few temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby m-dwarfs.characterizing these worlds will be time-intensive: jwst will need months toprovide tantalizing constraints on the presence of an atmosphere, planetaryrotational state, clouds, and greenhouse gases. future flagship missions shouldbe designed to provide better constraints on the habitability of m-dwarftemperate terrestrial planets.

(2012) and the previous wfirst-2.4drm, reported by spergel et. (2013). the 2.4-m primary mirror enables a missionwith greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-mdesigns considered previously, increasing both the science return of theprimary surveys and the capabilities of wfirst as a guest observer facility.the addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline designenables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

astro-ph;0504162	searching for transiting planets in stellar systems	we analyze the properties of searches devoted to finding planetary transitsby observing simple stellar systems, such as globular clusters, open clusters,and the galactic bulge. we develop the analytic tools necessary to predict thenumber of planets that a survey will detect as a function of the parameters ofthe system, the observational setup, site properties, and planet properties. wefind that the detection probability is generally maximized for i-bandobservations. the signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit is weaklydependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the skybackground, and falls very sharply for sources below sky. therefore the numberof detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of stars withfluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number of sources with photometricerror less a given threshold). in order to maximize the number of detections,experiments should be tailored such that stars near sky are above the detectionthreshold. once this requirement is met, the number of detected planets isrelatively weakly dependent on the detection threshold, diameter of thetelescope, exposure time, seeing, age of the system, and planet radius. thenumber of detected planets is a strongly decreasing function of the distance tothe system, implying that the nearest, richest clusters may prove to be optimaltargets.

(2004b), which combines light-curve analysis with priorsfrom a galactic model of the source and lens populations, to take account offinite-source effects. this is the first event so analyzed for whichfinite-source effects are important, and hence we develop two new techniquesfor evaluating these effects. somewhat surprisingly, we find thatogle-2004-blg-343 is no more sensitive to planets than two previously analyzedevents with a_{max}~100, despite the fact that it was observed at ~12 timeshigher magnification. however, we show that had the event been observed overits peak, it would have been sensitive to almost all neptune-mass planets overa factor of 5 of projected separation and even would have had some sensitivityto earth-mass planets. this shows that some microlensing events being detectedin current experiments are sensitive to very low-mass planets. we also givesuggestions on how extremely high-magnification events can be more promptlymonitored in the future.

astro-ph;0603276	microlens ogle-2005-blg-169 implies cool neptune-like planets are common	we detect a neptune mass-ratio (q~8e-5) planetary companion to the lens starin the extremely high-magnification (a~800) microlensing eventogle-2005-blg-169. if the parent is a main-sequence star, it has mass m~0.5m_sun implying a planet mass of ~13 m_earth and projected separation of ~2.7au. when intensely monitored over their peak, high-magnification events similarto ogle-2005-blg-169 have nearly complete sensitivity to neptune mass-ratioplanets with projected separations of 0.6 to 1.6 einstein radii, correspondingto 1.6--4.3 au in the present case. only two other such events were monitoredwell enough to detect neptunes, and so this detection by itself suggests thatneptune mass-ratio planets are common. moreover, another neptune was recentlydiscovered at a similar distance from its parent star in a low-magnificationevent, which are more common but are individually much less sensitive toplanets. combining the two detections yields 90% upper and lower frequencylimits f=0.37^{+0.30}_{-0.21} over just 0.4 decades of planet-star separation.in particular, f&gt;16% at 90% confidence. the parent star hosts no jupiter-masscompanions with projected separations within a factor 5 of that of the detectedplanet. the lens-source relative proper motion is \mu~7--10 mas/yr, implyingthat if the lens is sufficiently bright, i&lt;23.8, it will be detectable by hstby 3 years after peak. this would permit a more precise estimate of the lensmass and distance, and so the mass and projected separation of the planet.analogs of ogle-2005-blg-169lb orbiting nearby stars would be difficult todetect by other methods of planet detection, including radial velocities,transits, or astrometry.

0809.2997	microlensing event moa-2007-blg-400: exhuming the buried signature of a  cool, jovian-mass planet	we report the detection of the cool, jovian-mass planet moa-2007-blg-400lb.the planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peakmagnification a_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. the angular extentof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller thanthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is alsosmoothed out by the finite source size. thus the deviation from a single-lensfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). nevertheless, we demonstratethat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertainedfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairlyprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the largesignificance (\delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. the planet/star projectedseparation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to twoindistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be m &lt; 0.75 m_sun(assuming it is a main-sequence star). a bayesian analysis that includes allavailable observational constraints indicates a primary in the galactic bulgewith a mass of ~0.2-0.5 m_sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 m_jupiter.the separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1au (~5.3-9.7au) and~103k (~34k) for the close (wide) solution. if the primary is a main-sequencestar, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so ameasurement of its mass and distance.

astro-ph;9807086	the relative lens-source proper motion in macho 98-smc-1	we present photometric and spectroscopic data for the second microlensingevent seen toward the small magellanic cloud (smc), macho-98-smc-1. the lens isa binary. we resolve the caustic crossing and find that the source took 2 deltat = 8.5 hours to transit the caustic. we measure the source temperaturet_eff=8000 k both spectroscopically and from the color (v-i)_0~0.22. we findtwo acceptable binary-lens models. in the first, the source crosses the causticat phi=43.2 deg and the unmagnified source magnitude is i_s=22.15. the angleimplies that the lens crosses the source radius in time t_* = delta t sin phi =2.92 hours. the magnitude (together with the temperature) implies that theangular radius of the source is theta_* = 0.089 micro-arsec. hence, the propermotion is mu=theta_*/t_*=1.26 km/s/kpc.  for the second solution, the corresponding parameters are phi=30.6 deg,i_s=21.81, t_*=2.15 hours, theta_* = 0.104 micro-asrsec, mu=2.00 km/s/kpc. bothproper-motion estimates are slower than 99.5% of the proper motions expectedfor halo lenses. both are consistent with an ordinary binary lens moving at ~75-120 km/s within the smc itself. we conclude that the lens is most likely inthe smc proper.

astro-ph;9903008	a complete set of solutions for caustic-crossing binary microlensing  events	we present a method to analyze binary-lens microlensing light curves with onewell-sampled fold caustic crossing. in general, the surface of chi^2 showsextremely complicated behavior over the 9-parameter space that characterizesbinary lenses. this makes it difficult to systematically search the space andverify that a given local minimum is a global minimum. we show that for eventswith well-monitored caustics, the caustic-crossing region can be isolated fromthe rest of the light curve and easily fit to a 5-parameter function. four ofthese caustic-crossing parameters can then be used to constrain the search inthe larger 9-parameter space. this allows a systematic search for all solutionsand thus identification of all local minima. we illustrate this technique usingthe planet data for macho 98-smc-1, an excellent and publicly availablecaustic-crossing data set. we show that a very broad range of parametercombinations are compatible with the planet data set, demonstrating thatobservations of binary-lens lightcurves with sampling of only one causticcrossing do not yield unique solutions. the corollary to this is that the timeof the second caustic crossing cannot be reliably predicted on the basis ofearly data including the first caustic crossing alone. we investigate therequirements for determination of a unique solution and find that occasionalobservations of the first caustic crossing may be sufficient to derive acomplete solution.

astro-ph;9909325	limits on stellar and planetary companions in microlensing event  ogle-1998-bul-14	we present the planet photometric data set for \ob14, a high magnification($a_{\rm max}\sim 16$) event alerted by the ogle collaboration toward thegalactic bulge in 1998. the planet data set consists a total of 461 i-band and139 $v-$band points, the majority of which was taken over a three month period.the median sampling interval during this period is about 1 hour, and the$1\sigma$ scatter over the peak of the event is 1.5%. the excellent dataquality and high maximum magnification of this event make it a prime candidateto search for the short duration, low amplitude perturbations that aresignatures of a planetary companion orbiting the primary lens. the observedlight curve for \ob14 is consistent with a single lens (no companion) withinphotometric uncertainties. we calculate the detection efficiency of the lightcurve to lensing companions as a function of the mass ratio and angularseparation of the two components. we find that companions of mass ratio $\ge0.01$ are ruled out at the 95% confidence level for projected separationsbetween $0.4-2.4 \re$, where $\re$ is the einstein ring radius of the primarylens. assuming that the primary is a g-dwarf with $\re\sim3 {\rm au}$ ourdetection efficiency for this event is $\sim 60%$ for a companion with the massand separation of jupiter and $\sim5%$ for a companion with the mass andseparation of saturn. our efficiencies for planets like those around upsilonand and 14 her are &gt; 75%.

astro-ph;9910307	detection of rotation in a binary microlens: planet photometry of macho  97-blg-41	we analyze planet collaboration data for macho 97-blg-41, the onlymicrolensing event observed to date in which the source transits two disjointcaustics. the planet data, consisting of 46 v-band and 325 i-band observationsfrom five southern observatories, span a period from the initial alert untilthe end of the event. our data are incompatible with a static binary lens, butare well fit by a rotating binary lens of mass ratio q=0.34 and angularseparation d ~ 0.5 (in units of the einstein ring radius) in which the binaryseparation changes in size by delta d = -0.070 +/- 0.009 and in orientation bydelta theta = (5.61 +/- 0.36) degrees during the 35.17 days between theseparate caustic transits. we use this measurement combined with otherobservational constraints to derive the first kinematic estimate of the mass,distance, and period of a binary microlens. the relative probabilitydistributions for these parameters peak at a total lens mass m ~ 0.3 solarmasses (m-dwarf binary system), lens distance d_l ~ 5.5 kpc, and binary periodp ~ 1.5 yr. the robustness of our model is demonstrated by its strikingagreement with macho/gman data that cover several sharp features in the lightcurve not probed by the planet observations, and which did not enter ourmodeling procedure in any way. available data sets thus indicate that the lightcurve of macho 97-blg-41 can be modeled as a source crossing two caustics of aphysically-realistic rotating binary so that, contrary to a recent suggestion,the additional effects of a postulated planetary companion to the binary lensare not required.

astro-ph;9910465	the planet microlensing follow-up network: results and prospects for the  detection of extra-solar planets	among various techniques to search for extra-solar planets, microlensing hassome unique characteristics. contrary to all other methods which favour nearbyobjects, microlensing is sensitive to planets around stars at distances ofseveral kpc. these stars act as gravitational lenses leading to a brighteningof observed luminous source stars. the lens stars that are tested for thepresence of planets are not generally seen themselves. the largest sensitivityis obtained for planets at orbital separations of 1-10 au offering the view onan extremely interesting range with regard to our own solar system and inparticular to the position of jupiter. the microlensing signal of ajupiter-mass planet lasts typically a few days. this means that a planetreveals its existence by producing a short signal at its quasi-instantaneousposition, so that planets can be detected without the need to observe asignificant fraction of the orbital period. relying on the microlensing alertsissued by several survey groups that observe ~10^7 stars in the galactic bulge,planet (probing lensing anomalies network) performs precise and frequentmeasurements on ongoing microlensing events in order to detect deviations froma light curve produced by a single point-like object. these measurements allowconstraints to be put on the abundance of planets. from 42 well-sampled eventsbetween 1995 and 1999, we infer that less than 1/3 of m-dwarfs in the galacticbulge have jupiter-mass companions at separations between 1 and 4 au from theirparent star, and that less than 45% have 3-jupiter-mass companions between 1and 7 au.
