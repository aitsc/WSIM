0902.3369	mid-infrared spectroscopy of infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0.5-3	we present results on low-resolution mid-infrared (mir) spectra of 70infrared-luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs)onboard spitzer. we selected sources from the european large area infraredsurvey (elais) with s15 &gt; 0.8 mjy and photometric or spectroscopic z &gt; 1. abouthalf of the sample are qsos in the optical, while the remaining sources aregalaxies, comprising both obscured agn and starbursts. we classify the spectrausing well-known infrared diagnostics, as well as a new one that we propose,into three types of source: those dominated by an unobscured agn (qsos),obscured agn, and starburst-dominated sources. starbursts concentrate at z ~0.6-1.0 favored by the shift of the 7.7-micron pah band into the selection 15micron band, while agn spread over the 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.1 range. star formationrates (sfr) are estimated for individual sources from the luminosity of the pahfeatures. an estimate of the average pah luminosity in qsos and obscured agn isobtained from the composite spectrum of all sources with reliable redshifts.the estimated mean sfr in the qsos is 50-100 mo yr^-1, but the implied firluminosity is 3-10 times lower than that obtained from stacking analysis of thefir photometry, suggesting destruction of the pah carriers by energetic photonsfrom the agn. the sfr estimated in obscured agn is 2-3 times higher than inqsos of similar mir luminosity. this discrepancy might not be due to luminosityeffects or selection bias alone, but could instead indicate a connectionbetween obscuration and star formation. however, the observed correlationbetween silicate absorption and the slope of the near- to mid-infrared spectrumis compatible with the obscuration of the agn emission in these sources beingproduced in a dust torus.

0902.4236	the hellas2xmm survey. xii. the infrared/sub-millimeter view of an x-ray  selected type 2 quasar at z=2	we present multi-wavelength observations (from optical to sub-millimeter,including spitzer and scuba) of h2xmmj 003357.2-120038 (also gd158_19), anx-ray selected, luminous narrow-line (type 2) quasar at z=1.957 selected fromthe hellas2xmm survey. its broad-band properties can be reasonably well modeledassuming three components: a stellar component to account for the optical andnear-ir emission, an agn component (i.e., dust heated by an accreting activenucleus), dominant in the mid-ir, with an optical depth at 9.7 micron along theline of sight (close to the equatorial plane of the obscuring matter) oftau(9.7)=1 and a full covering angle of the reprocessing matter (torus) of 140degrees, and a far-ir starburst component (i.e., dust heated by star formation)to reproduce the wide bump observed longward of 70 micron. the derivedstar-formation rate is about 1500 solar masses per year. the overall modelingindicates that gd158_19 is a high-redshift x-ray luminous, obscured quasar withcoeval powerful agn activity and intense star formation. it is probably caughtbefore the process of expelling the obscuring gas has started, thus quenchingthe star formation.

0909.2535	spectroscopic identifications of spitzer sources in the  swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field: a large fraction of active galactic nuclei  with high f(24micron)/f(r) ratio	we present a catalog of optical spectroscopic identifications of sourcesdetected by spitzer at 3.6 or 24 micron down to 10 and 280 microjy,respectively, in the swire/xmm-newton/elais-s1 field and classified via linewidth analysis and diagnostic diagrams. a total of 1376 sources down to r~24.2mag have been identified (1362 detected at 3.6 micron, 419 at 24 micron, and405 at both) by low-resolution optical spectroscopy carried out with fors2,vimos, and efosc2 at the very large telescope and 3.6m eso telescopes. thespectroscopic campaigns have been carried out over the central 0.6 squaredegrees area of elais-s1 which, in particular, has also been observed byxmm-newton and chandra. we find the first direct optical spectroscopic evidencethat the fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn; mostly agn2) increases withincreasing f(24 micron)/f(r) ratio, reaching values of 70(+/-20)% in the range316&lt;f(24 micron)f(r)&lt;1000. we present an irac-mips color-color diagram able toseparate agn1 from obscured agn2 candidates. after having corrected for thespectroscopic incompleteness of our sample, it results that the agn fraction atf(24 micron)=0.8 mjy is ~22(+/-7)% and decreases slowly to ~19(+/-5)% down tof(24 micron)=0.3 mjy.

1006.1247	tools for computing the agn feedback: radio-loudness distribution and  the kinetic luminosity function	we studied the active galactic nuclei (agn) radio emission from a compilationof hard x-ray selected samples, all observed in the 1.4 ghz band. a total ofmore than 1600 agn with 2-10 kev de-absorbed luminosities higher than 10^42erg/s were used. for a sub-sample of about 50 z\lsim 0.1 agn it was possible toreach a ~80% fraction of radio detections and therefore, for the first time, itwas possible to almost completely measure the probability distribution functionof the ratio between the radio and the x-ray luminosity rx=log[l(1.4)/lx]. theprobability distribution function of rx was functionally fitted as dependent onthe x-ray luminosity and redshift, p(rx|lx,z). it roughly spans over 6 decades(-7&lt;rx&lt;-1), and does not show any sign of bi-modality. it resulted that theprobability of finding large values of the rx ratio increases with decreasingx-ray luminosities and (possibly) with increasing redshift. no statisticalsignificant difference was found between the radio properties of the x-rayabsorbed and unabsorbed agn. the measure of the probability distributionfunction of rx allowed us to compute the kinetic luminosity function and thekinetic energy density which, at variance with what assumed in many galaxyevolution models, is observed to decrease of about a factor of five at redshiftbelow 0.5. about half of the kinetic energy density results to be produced bythe more radio quiet (rx&lt;-4) agn. in agreement with previous estimates, the agnefficiency in converting the accreted mass energy into kinetic power is, onaverage, ~5x10-3.

1010.0768	the m_bh-m_star relation of obscured agns at high redshift	we report the detection of broad halpha emission in three x-ray selectedobscured agns at z=1-2. by exploiting the halpha width and the intrinsic x-rayluminosity, we estimate their black hole masses, which are in the range0.1-3x10^9 msun. by means of multi-band photometric data, we measure thestellar mass of their host galaxy and, therefore, infer their m_bh/m_starratio. these are the first obscured agns at high-z, selected based on theirblack hole accretion (i.e. on the basis of their x-ray luminosity), that can belocated on the m_bh-m_star relation at high-z. all of these obscured high-zagns are fully consistent with the local m_bh-m_star relation. this resultconflicts with those for other samples of agns in the same redshift range,whose m_bh/m_star ratio departs significantly from the value observed in localgalaxies. we suggest that the obscured agns in our sample are in an advancedevolutionary stage, have already settled onto the local m_bh-m_star relation,and whose nuclear activity has been temporarily revived by recent galaxyinteractions.

1010.5243	q2122-444: a naked agn fully dressed	based on previous spectral and temporal optical studies, q2122-444 has beenclassified as a naked agn or true type 2 agn, that is, an agn that genuinelylacks a broad line region (blr). its optical spectrum seemed to possess onlynarrow forbidden emission lines that are typical of type 2 (obscured) agns, butthe long-term optical light curve, obtained from a monitoring campaign overmore than two decades, showed strong variability, apparently ruling out thepresence of heavy obscuration. here, we present the results from a ~40 ksxmm-newton observation of q2122-444 carried out to shed light on the energeticsof this enigmatic agn. the x-ray analysis was complemented with atca radio datato assess the possible presence of a jet, and with new ntt/efosc2 opticalspectroscopic data to verify the actual absence of a blr. the higher-qualityoptical data revealed the presence of strong and broad balmer lines that are atodds with the previous spectral classification of this agn. the lack ofdetection of radio emission rules out the presence of a jet. the x-ray datacombined with simultaneous uv observations carried out by the om aboardxmm-newton confirm that q2122-444 is a typical type-1 agn without anysignificant intrinsic absorption. new estimates of the black hole massindependently obtained from the broad balmer lines and from a new scalingtechnique based on x-ray spectral data suggest that q2122-444 is accreting at arelatively high rate in eddington units.

0710.0300	the contribution of very massive high-redshift swire galaxies to the  stellar mass function	(abridged) we selected high-z massive galaxies at 5.8 microns, in the swireelais-s1 field (1 sq. deg.). galaxies with the 1.6 microns stellar peakredshifted into the irac bands (z~1-3, called ``ir-peakers'') were identified.stellar masses were derived by means of spectro-photometric fitting and used tocompute the stellar mass function (mf) at z=1-2 and 2-3. a parametric fit tothe mf was performed, based on a bayesian formalism, and the stellar massdensity of massive galaxies above z=2 determined. we present the firstsystematic study of the very-massive tail of the galaxy stellar mass functionat high redshift. a total of 326 sources were selected. the majority of thesegalaxies have stellar masses in excess of 1e11 msun and lie at z&gt;1.5. theavailability of mid-ir data turned out to be a valuable tool to constrain thecontribution of young stars to galaxy seds, and thus their m(stars)/l ratio.the influence of near-ir data and of the chosen stellar library on the sedfitting are also discussed. a significant evolution is found not only forgalaxies with m~1e11 msun, but also in the highest mass bins considered. thecomoving number density of these galaxies was lower by more than a factor of 10at z=2-3, with respect to the local estimate. swire 5.8 micron peakers moremassive than 1.6x1e11 msun provide 30-50% of the total stellar mass density ingalaxies at z=2-3.

0710.1811	the hellas2xmm survey: xi. unveiling the nature of x-ray bright  optically normal galaxies	x-ray bright optically normal galaxies (xbongs) constitute a small but notnegligible fraction of hard x-ray selected sources in recent chandra andxmm-newton surveys. even though several possibilities were proposed to explainwhy a relatively luminous hard x-ray source does not leave any significantsignature of its presence in terms of optical emission lines, the nature ofxbongs is still subject of debate. we aim to a better understanding of theirnature by means of a multiwavelength and morphological analysis of a smallsample of these sources. good-quality photometric near-infrared data(isaac/vlt) of four low-redshift (z=0.1-0.3) xbongs, selected from thehellas2xmm survey, have been used to search for the presence of the putativenucleus, applying the surface-brightness decomposition technique through theleast-squares fitting program galfit. the surface brightness decompositionallows us to reveal a nuclear point-like source, likely to be responsible ofthe x-ray emission, in two out of the four sources. the results indicate thatmoderate amounts of gas and dust, covering a large solid angle (possibly 4pi)at the nuclear source, combined with the low nuclear activity, may explain thelack of optical emission lines. the third xbong is associated with an x-rayextended source and no nuclear excess is detected in the near infrared at thelimits of our observations. the last source is associated to a close (d&lt; 1arcsec) double system and the fitting procedure cannot achieve a firmconclusion.

1211.2688	on the agn radio luminosity distribution and the black hole fundamental  plane	we have studied the dependence of the agn nuclear radio (1.4 ghz) luminosityon both the agn 2-10 kev x-ray and the host-galaxy k-band luminosity. acomplete sample of 1268 x-ray selected agn (both type 1 and type 2) has beenused, which is the largest catalogue of agn belonging to statistically welldefined samples where radio, x and k band information exists. at variance withprevious studies, radio upper limits have been statistically taken into accountusing a bayesian maximum likelihood fitting method. it resulted that a good fitis obtained assuming a plane in the 3d l_r-l_x-l_k space, namely logl_r= xi_xlogl_x + xi_k logl_k + xi_0, having a ~1 dex wide (1 sigma) spread in radioluminosity. as already shown, no evidence of bimodality in the radio luminositydistribution was found and therefore any definition of radio loudness in agn isarbitrary. using scaling relations between the bh mass and the host galaxyk-band luminosity, we have also derived a new estimate of the bh fundamentalplane (in the l_5ghz -l_x-m_bh space). our analysis shows that previousmeasures of the bh fundamental plane are biased by ~0.8 dex in favor of themost luminous radio sources. therefore, many agn studies, where the bhfundamental plane is used to investigate how agn regulate their radiative andmechanical luminosity as a function of the accretion rate, or many agn/galaxyco-evolution models, where radio-feedback is computed using the agn fundamentalplane, should revise their conclusions.

1401.1332	dust from agbs: relevant factors and modelling uncertainties	the dust formation process in the winds of asymptotic giant branch stars isdiscussed, based on full evolutionary models of stars with mass in the range$1$m$_{\odot} \leq$m$\leq 8$m$_{\odot}$, and metallicities $0.001 &lt; z &lt;0.008$.dust grains are assumed to form in an isotropically expanding wind, by growthof pre--existing seed nuclei. convection, for what concerns the treatment ofconvective borders and the efficiency of the schematization adopted, turns outto be the physical ingredient used to calculate the evolutionary sequences withthe highest impact on the results obtained. low--mass stars with m$\leq3$m$_{\odot}$ produce carbon type dust with also traces of silicon carbide. themass of solid carbon formed, fairly independently of metallicity, ranges from afew $10^{-4}$m$_{\odot}$, for stars of initial mass $1-1.5$m$_{\odot}$, to$\sim 10^{-2}$m$_{\odot}$ for m$\sim 2-2.5$m$_{\odot}$; the size of dustparticles is in the range $0.1 \mu$m$\leq a_c \leq 0.2\mu$m. on the contrary,the production of silicon carbide (sic) depends on metallicity. for $10^{-3}\leq z \leq 8\times 10^{-3}$ the size of sic grains varies in the range $0.05\mu {\rm m} &lt; {\rm a_{sic}} &lt; 0.1 \mu$m, while the mass of sic formed is$10^{-5}{\rm m}_{\odot} &lt; {\rm m_{sic}} &lt; 10^{-3}{\rm m}_{\odot}$. models ofhigher mass experience hot bottom burning, which prevents the formation ofcarbon stars, and favours the formation of silicates and corundum. in this casethe results scale with metallicity, owing to the larger silicon and aluminiumcontained in higher--z models. at z=$8\times 10^{-3}$ we find that the mostmassive stars produce dust masses $m_d \sim 0.01$m$_{\odot}$, whereas models ofsmaller mass produce a dust mass ten times smaller. the main component of dustare silicates, although corundum is also formed, in not negligible quantities($\sim 10-20\%$).

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

astro-ph;0006233	sub-mm and x-ray background: two unrelated phenomena?	obscured agns are thought to contribute a large fraction of the hard x-raybackground (2-10 kev), and have also been proposed as the powerhouse of afraction of the scuba sources which make most of the background at 850um, thusproviding a link between the two spectral windows. we have tackled this issueby comparing data at 2-10 kev and at 850um for a sample of 34 sources at fluxes(or limiting fluxes) which resolve most of the background in the two bands. wepresent here new scuba observations, and new correlations between separate datasets retrieved from the literature. similar correlations presented by othersare added for completeness. none of the 11 hard x-ray (2-10 kev) sources has acounterpart at 850um, with the exception of a chandra source in the ssa13field, which is a candidate type 2, heavily absorbed qso at high redshift. theratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly upper limits) of the x-ray sources aresignificantly lower than the value observed for the cosmic background. inparticular, we obtain that 2-10 kev sources brighter than 10^-15 erg s^-1cm^-2, which make at least 75% of the background in this band, contribute forless than 7% to the submillimeter background. out of the 24 scuba sources, 23are undetected by chandra. the ratios f(850um)/f(5kev) (mostly lower limits) ofthese scuba sources indicate that most of them must be powered either bystarburst activity, or by an agn which is obscured by a column nh &gt; 10^25cm^-2, with a reflection efficiency in the hard x rays significantly lower than1% in most cases. however, agns of this type could not contribute significantlyto the 2-10 kev background.

astro-ph;0010009	dust in active nuclei. i. evidence for "anomalous" properties	we present observational evidences that dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns has different properties than in the galactic diffuse interstellar medium.by comparing the reddening of optical and infrared broad lines and the x-rayabsorbing column density we find that the e(b-v)/n_h ratio is nearly alwayslower than galactic by a factor ranging from ~3 up to ~100. other observationalresults indicate that the av/n_h ratio is significantly lower than galactic invarious classes of agns including intermediate type 1.8-1.9 seyferts, hardx-ray selected and radio selected quasars, broad absorption line qsos and grismselected qsos. the lack of prominent absorption features at 9.7um (silicates)and at 2175a (carbon dip) in the spectra of seyfert 2s and of reddened seyfert1s, respectively, add further evidence for dust in the circumnuclear region ofagns being different from galactic.  these observational results indicate that the dust composition in thecircumnuclear region of agns could be dominated by large grains, which make theextinction curve flatter, featureless and are responsible for the reduction ofthe e(b-v)/n_h and av/n_h ratios.  regardless of the physical origin of these phenomena, the reduced dustabsorption with respect to what expected from the gaseous column density shouldwarn about a mismatch between the optical and the x-ray classification of theactive galactic nuclei in terms of their obscuration.

astro-ph;0509081	the hellas2xmm survey. vii. the hard x-ray luminosity function of agn up  to z=4: more absorbed agn at low luminosities and high redshifts	we have determined the cosmological evolution of the density of agn and oftheir nh distribution as a function of the un-absorbed 2-10 kev luminosity upto redshift 4. we used the hellas2xmm sample combined with other publishedcatalogs, yielding a total of 508 agn. our best fit is obtained with aluminosity-dependent density evolution (ldde) model where low luminosity(lx~10^43 erg s^-1) agn peak at z~0.7, while high luminosity agn (lx&gt;10^45 ergs^-1) peak at z~2.0. a pure luminosity evolution model (ple) can instead berejected. there is evidence that the fraction of absorbed (nh&gt;10^22 cm^-2) agndecreases with the intrinsic x-ray luminosity, and increases with the redshift.our best fit solution provides a good fit to the observed counts, the cosmicx-ray background, and to the observed fraction of absorbed agn as a function ofthe flux in the 10^-15&lt;s(2-10)&lt;10^-10 erg s^-1 cm^-2 range. we find that theabsorbed, high luminosity (lx&gt;10^44 erg s^-1) agn have a density of 267 deg^-2at fluxes s(2-10)&gt;10^-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2. using these results, we estimate adensity of supermassive black holes in the local universe of 3.2 (h^2_70) x10^5 m_sol mpc^-3, which is consistent with the recent measurements of theblack hole mass function in the local galaxies.

astro-ph;0509244	the hellas2xmm survey. ix. spectroscopic identification of super-eros  hosting agns	we present vlt near-ir spectroscopic observations of three x-ray sourcescharacterized by extremely high x-ray-to-optical ratios (x/o&gt;40), extremely redcolors (6.3&lt;r-k&lt;7.4, i.e. eros) and bright infrared magnitudes (17.6&lt;k&lt;18.3).these objects are very faint in the optical, making their spectroscopicidentification extremely challenging. instead, our near-ir spectroscopicobservations have been successful in identifying the redshift of two of them(z=2.08 and z=1.35), and tentatively even of the third one (z=2.13). whencombined with the x-ray properties, our results clearly indicate that all theseobjects host obscured qsos (4e44 &lt; l(2-10kev) &lt; 1.5e45 erg/s, 2e22 &lt; n_h &lt; 4e23cm-2) at high redshift. the only object with unresolved morphology in the kband shows broad halpha emission, but not broad hbeta, implying a type 1.9 agnclassification. the other two objects are resolved and dominated by the hostgalaxy light in the k band, and appear relatively quiescent: one of them has aliner-like emission line spectrum and the other presents only a single, weakemission line which we tentatively identify with halpha. the galaxyluminosities for the latter two objects are an order of magnitude brighter thantypical local l* galaxies and the derived stellar masses are well in excess of10^11 msun. for these objects we estimate black hole masses higher than 10^9msun and we infer that they are radiating at eddington ratios l/l_edd &lt; 0.1. wediscuss the implications of these findings for the coevolution of galaxies andblack hole growth. our results provide further support that x-ray sources withhigh x/o ratios and very red colors tend to host obscured qso in very massivegalaxies at high redshift.

astro-ph;0601355	active galactic nuclei in the mid-ir. evolution and contribution to the  cosmic infrared background	we study the evolution of the luminosity function (lf) of type-1 and type-2agn in the mid-infrared, and derive their contribution to the cosmic infraredbackground (cirb) and the expected deep source counts to be observed by spitzerat 24 micron. the sample of type-1 and type-2 agn was selected at 15 micron(iso) and 12 micron (iras), and classified on the basis of their opticalspectra. local templates of type-1 and type-2 agn have been used to derive theintrinsic 15 micron luminosities. we adopted an evolving smooth two-power lawshape of the lf, whose parameters have been derived using an un-binned maximumlikelihood method. we find that the lf of type-1 agn is compatible with a pureluminosity evolution (l(z)=l(0)(1+z)^k_l) model where k_l~2.9. a smallflattening of the faint slope of the lf with increasing redshift is favoured bythe data. a similar evolutionary scenario is found for the type-2 populationwith a rate k_l ranging from ~1.8 to 2.6, depending significantly on theadopted mid-infrared spectral energy distribution. also for type-2 agn aflattening of the lf with increasing redshift is suggested by the data,possibly caused by the loss of a fraction of type-2 agn hidden within theoptically classified starburst and normal galaxies. the type-1 agn contributionto the cirb at 15 micron is (4.2-12.1) x 10e-11 w m^-2 sr^-1, while the type-2agn contribution is (5.5-11.0) x 10e-11 w m^-2 sr^-1. we expect that spitzerwill observe, down to a flux limit of s_24 = 0.01 mjy, a density of ~1200deg^-2 type-1 and ~1000 deg^-2 type-2 optically classified agn. the derivedtotal contribution of the agn galaxies to the cirb (4-10%) and spitzer countsshould be considered as lower limits, because of a possible loss of type-2sources caused by the optical classification.

astro-ph;0607107	the xmm-newton survey of the elais-s1 field. i: number counts, angular  correlation function and x-ray spectral properties	we have surveyed with xmm-newton the central ~0.6 deg2 region of the elais-s1field down to flux limits of ~5.5x10-16 cgs (0.5-2 kev, s band), ~2x10-15 cgs(2-10 kev, h band), and ~4x10-15 cgs (5-10 kev, hh band). we detect a total of478 sources, 395 and 205 of which detected in the s and h bands respectively.we identified 7 clearly extended sources and estimated their redshift throughx-ray spectral fits with thermal models. in four cases the redshift isconsistent with z=0.4. we have computed the angular correlation function of thesources in the s and h bands, finding best fit correlation anglestheta_0=5.2+/-3.8 arcsec and theta_0=12.8+/-7.8 arcsec respectively. a roughestimate of the present-day correlation length r_0 can be obtained invertingthe limber equation and assuming an appropriate redshift distribution dn/dz.the results range between 12.8 and 9.8 h-1 mpc in the s band and between 17.9and 13.4 h-1 mpc in the h band, with 30-40% statistical errors, assuming eithersmooth redshift distributions or redshift distributions with spikes accountingfor the presence of a structure at z=0.4. the relative density of the s bandsources is higher near the clusters and groups at z~0.4 and extends toward eastand toward south/west. this suggests that the structure is complex, with a sizecomparable to the full xmm-newton field. conversely, the highest relativesource densities of the h band sources are located in the central-west regionof the field.

astro-ph;9506140	the optical variability of qso's	the long-term variability of a sample of 486 optically selected qsos in thefields of the sa94, sa57 and sgp has been studied. the relations of variabilitywith luminosity and redshift have been investigated by means of statisticalestimators that are ``robust'' and allow at the same time to eliminate theinfluence of the measurement errors. the analysis in the qsos rest frame ofboth the ensemble structure function ($sf$) and individual variability indicesshow: 1) a negative correlation between variability and luminosity; 2) asignificant positive correlation between variability and $z$; 3) suchcorrelations may be equally well parameterized either with a model in which thetimescale of the variability is fixed for all the qsos ($\tau \sim 2.4$ yr),while the amplitude linearly increases with the absolute magnitude and $z$, orwith a model in which the timescale of the variability linearly depends on theabsolute magnitude and the amplitude is only a function of $z$. the sameanalysis carried out in the observer's frame shows: 1) a negative correlationbetween variability and luminosity; 2) the timescale of variability does notdepend significantly either on the absolute magnitude or on $z$; 3) theensemble structure function is well represented by a parameterization in which,with a fixed timescale of about 5.5 yr, the amplitude linearly increases withthe absolute magnitude; 4) although the general behaviour of the $sf$ does notshow a systematic variation of the timescale and/or amplitude with $z$, if weexamine the average variability index for objects with $-25&gt;m_b&gt;-27$, we findthat below $z=1$ qsos are significantly less variable than at higher redshift.implications in terms of the black-hole, starburst and microlensing models arebriefly discussed.

astro-ph;9711067	the optical-uv continuum of a sample of qsos	the average optical-uv continuum shape of qsos has been investigated usingspectra of 62 qsos having good relative photometric calibrations. the qsospectra were extracted from two complete color selected samples in themagnitude intervals b ~ 16-20. the analysis was performed fitting power-lawcontinua (f proportional to nu^(alpha)) in well defined rest-frame wavelengthintervals after removing regions of the spectrum affected by strong emissionlines or weak emission bumps. the average slope in the rest-frame optical-uvregion 1200 - 5500 a shows a rapid change around the 3000 a emission bump withalpha=0.15 longward of it and alpha=-0.65 at shorter wavelengths. althoughthese average slopes have been obtained using spectra of qsos with differentluminosities and redshifts, there are no significant correlations of theaverage spectral index with these quantities. for a few qsos in the sample wewere able to measure the same softening of the spectral shape within theindividual spectrum. these results have significant consequences on theestimate of the cosmological evolution of the optically selected qsos as theyaffect, for instance, the k-corrections. new k-corrections in the b, v, r andgr bands were computed. the derived average spectral shape in the optical-uvband puts interesting constraints on the expected emission mechanisms.

astro-ph;9802282	erratum on the qso evolution derived from the hbqs and other complete  qso surveys	an eso key programme dedicated to an homogeneous bright qso survey (hbqs) hasbeen completed. 327 qsos (mb&lt;-23, 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.2) have been selected over 555 deg^2with 15&lt;b&lt;18.75. for b&lt;16.4 the qso surface density turns out to be a factor2.2 higher than what measured by the pg survey, corresponding to a surfacedensity of 0.013+/-.006 deg^{-2}. if the edinburgh qso survey is included, anoverdensity of a factor 2.7 is observed, corresponding to a density of0.016+/-0.005 deg^{-2}. in order to derive the qso optical luminosity function(lf) we used monte carlo simulations that take into account of the selectioncriteria, photometric errors and qso spectral slope distribution. the lf can berepresented with a pure luminosity evolution (l(z)\propto(1+z)^k) of a twopower law both for q_0=0.5 and q_0=0.1. for q_0=0.5 k=3.26, slower than theprevious boyle's (1992) estimations of k=3.45. a flatter slope beta=-3.72 ofthe bright part of the lf is also required. the observed overdensity of brightqsos is concentrated at z&lt;0.6. it results that in the range 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6 theluminosity function is flatter than observed at higher redshifts. in thisredshift range, for mb&lt;-25, 32 qsos are observed instead of 19 expected fromour best-fit ple model. this feature requires a luminosity dependent luminosityevolution in order to satisfactorily represent the data in the whole 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.2interval.
