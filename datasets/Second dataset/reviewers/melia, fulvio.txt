0812.4778	constraints on dark energy from the observed expansion of our cosmic  horizon	within the context of standard cosmology, an accelerating universe requiresthe presence of a third `dark' component of energy, beyond matter andradiation. the available data, however, are still deemed insufficient todistinguish between an evolving dark energy component and the simplest model ofa time-independent cosmological constant. in this paper, we examine thecosmological expansion in terms of observer-dependent coordinates, in additionto the more conventional co-moving coordinates. this procedure explicitlyreveals the role played by the radius r_h of our cosmic horizon in theinterrogation of the data. (in rindler's notation, r_h coincides with the`event horizon' in the case of de sitter, but changes in time for othercosmologies that also contain matter and/or radiation.) with this approach, weshow that the interpretation of dark energy as a cosmological constant isclearly disfavored by the observations. within the framework of standardfriedman-robertson-walker cosmology, we derive an equation describing theevolution of r_h, and solve it using the wmap and type ia supernova data. inparticular, we consider the meaning of the observed equality (or near equality)r_h(t_0) ~ ct_0, where t_0 is the age of the universe. this empirical result isfar from trivial, for a cosmological constant would drive r_h(t) towards ct(where t is the cosmic time) only once--and that would have to occur right now.though we are not here espousing any particular alternative model of darkenergy, for comparison we also consider scenarios in which dark energy is givenby scaling solutions, which simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in thestandard model, including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, andaccount very well for the fact that r_h(t_0) ~ ct_0.

0706.3429	radio synchrotron emission from secondary leptons in the vicinity of sgr  a*	a point-like source of ~tev gamma-rays has recently been seen towards thegalactic center by hess and other air cerenkov telescopes. in recent work(ballantyne et al. 2007), we demonstrated that these gamma-rays can beattributed to high-energy protons that (i) are accelerated close to the eventhorizon of the central black hole, sgr a*, (ii) diffuse out to ~pc scales, and(iii) finally interact to produce gamma-rays. the same hadronic collisionprocesses will necessarily lead to the creation of electrons and positrons.here we calculate the synchrotron emissivity of these secondary leptons in thesame magnetic field configuration through which the initiating protons havebeen propagated in our model. we compare this emission with the observed ~ghzradio spectrum of the inner few pc region which we have assembled from archivaldata and new measurements we have made with the australia telescope compactarray. we find that our model predicts secondary synchrotron emission with asteep slope consistent with the observations but with an overall normalizationthat is too large by a factor of ~ 2. if we further constrain our theoreticalgamma-ray curve to obey the implicit egret upper limit on emission from thisregion we predict radio emission that is consistent with observations, i.e.,the hadronic model of gamma ray emission can, simultaneously and withoutfine-tuning, also explain essentially all the diffuse radio emission detectedfrom the inner few pc of the galaxy.

0907.4977	x-ray and radio variability of m31*, the andromeda galaxy nuclear  supermassive black hole	we confirm our earlier tentative detection of m31* in x-rays and measure itslight-curve and spectrum. observations in 2004-2005 find m31* rather quiescentin the x-ray and radio. however, x-ray observations in 2006-2007 and radioobservations in 2002 show m31* to be highly variable at times. a separatevariable x-ray source is found near p1, the brighter of the two optical nuclei.the apparent angular bondi radius of m31* is the largest of any black hole, andlarge enough to be well resolved with chandra. the diffuse emission within thisbondi radius is found to have an x-ray temperature ~0.3 kev and density 0.1cm-3, indistinguishable from the hot gas in the surrounding regions of thebulge given the statistics allowed by the current observations. the x-raysource at the location of m31* is consistent with a point source and a powerlaw spectrum with energy slope 0.9+/-0.2. our identification of this x-raysource with m31* is based solely on positional coincidence.

1001.1275	a lower limit of 50 microgauss for the magnetic field near the galactic  centre	the amplitude of the magnetic field near the galactic centre has beenuncertain by two orders of magnitude for several decades. on a scale ofapproximately 100 pc fields of approximately 1000 microg have been reported,implying a magnetic energy density more than 10,000 times stronger than typicalfor the galaxy. alternatively, the assumption of pressure equilibrium betweenthe various phases of the galactic centre interstellar medium (includingturbulent molecular gas; the contested "very hot" plasma; and the magneticfield) suggests fields of approximately 100 microg over approximately 400 pcsize scales. finally, assuming equipartition, fields of only approximately 6microg have been inferred from radio observations for 400 pc scales. here wereport a compilation of previous data that reveals a down-break in the region'snon-thermal radio spectrum (attributable to a transition from bremsstrahlung tosynchrotron cooling of the in situ cosmic-ray electron population). we showthat the spectral break requires that the galactic centre field be at least 50microg on 400 pc scales, lest the synchrotron-emitting electrons produce toomuch gamma-ray emission given existing constraints. other considerationssupport a field of 100 microg, implying that &gt; 10% of the galaxy's magneticenergy is contained in only &lt; 0.05% of its volume.

1009.4340	gamma-rays and the far-infrared-radio continuum correlation reveal a  powerful galactic centre wind	we consider the thermal and non-thermal emission from the inner 200 pc of thegalaxy. the radiation from this almost star-burst-like region is ultimatelydriven dominantly by on-going massive star formation. we show that thisregion's radio continuum (rc) emission is in relative deficit with respect tothe expectation afforded by the far- infrared-radio continuum correlation(frc). likewise we show that the region's gamma-ray emission falls short ofthat expected given its star formation and resultant supernova rates. thesefacts are compellingly explained by positing that a powerful (400-1200 km/s)wind is launched from the region. this wind probably plays a number ofimportant roles including advecting positrons into the galactic bulge thusexplaining the observed ~kpc extension of the 511 kev positron annihilationsignal around the gc. we also show that the large-scale gc magnetic field fallsin the range ~100-300 microg and that - in the time they remain in the region -gc cosmic rays do not penetrate into the region's densest molecular material.

1010.0059	high energy cosmic-ray diffusion in molecular clouds: a numerical  approach	the propagation of high-energy cosmic rays through giant molecular cloudsconstitutes a fundamental process in astronomy and astrophysics. the diffusionof cosmic-rays through these magnetically turbulent environments is oftenstudied through the use of energy-dependent diffusion coefficients, althoughthese are not always well motivated theoretically. now, however, it is feasibleto perform detailed numerical simulations of the diffusion processcomputationally. while the general problem depends upon both the fieldstructure and particle energy, the analysis may be greatly simplified bydimensionless analysis. that is, for a specified purely turbulent field, theanalysis depends almost exclusively on a single parameter -- the ratio of themaximum wavelength of the turbulent field cells to the particle gyrationradius. for turbulent magnetic fluctuations superimposed over an underlyinguniform magnetic field, particle diffusion depends on a second dimensionlessparameter that characterizes the ratio of the turbulent to uniform magneticfield energy densities. we consider both of these possibilities and parametrizeour results to provide simple quantitative expressions that suitablycharacterize the diffusion process within molecular cloud environments. doingso, we find that the simple scaling laws often invoked by the high-energyastrophysics community to model cosmic-ray diffusion through such regionsappear to be fairly robust for the case of a uniform magnetic field with astrong turbulent component, but are only valid up to $\sim 50$ tev particleenergies for a purely turbulent field. these results have importantconsequences for the analysis of cosmic-ray processes based on tev emissionspectra associated with dense molecular clouds.

1010.2949	diffusive cosmic ray acceleration at the galactic centre	the diffuse tev emission detected from the inner $\sim2^\circ$ of the galaxyappears to be strongly correlated with the distribution of molecular gas alongthe galactic ridge. although it is not yet entirely clear whether the origin ofthe tev photons is due to hadronic or leptonic interactions, the tightcorrelation of the intensity distribution with the molecular gas stronglypoints to a pionic-decay process involving relativistic protons. but thespectrum of the tev radiation---a power law with index $\alpha\approx-2.3$---cannot be accommodated easily with the much steeper distribution ofcosmic rays seen at earth. in earlier work, we examined the possible sources ofthese relativistic protons and concluded that neither the supermassive blackhole sagittarius a* (identified with the hess source j1745-290), nor severalpulsar wind nebulae dispersed along the galactic plane, could produce a tevemission profile morphologically similar to that seen by hess. we concludedfrom this earlier study that only relativistic protons accelerated throughoutthe inter-cloud medium could account for the observed diffuse tev emission fromthis region. in this paper, we develop a model for diffusive protonacceleration driven by a turbulent alfv\'enic magnetic field present throughoutthe gaseous medium. though circumstantial, this appears to be the firstevidence that at least some cosmic rays are accelerated diffusively within theinner $\sim300$ pc of the galaxy.

1011.0206	wild at heart:-the particle astrophysics of the galactic centre	we treat of the high-energy astrophysics of the inner ~200 pc of the galaxy.our modelling of this region shows that the supernovae exploding here every fewthousand years inject enough power to i) sustain the steady-state, in situpopulation of cosmic rays (crs) required to generate the region's non-thermalradio and tev {\gamma}-ray emis-sion; ii) drive a powerful wind that advectsnon-thermal particles out of the inner gc; iii) supply the low-energy crs whosecoulombic collisions sustain the temperature and ionization rate of theanomalously warm, envelope h2 detected throughout the cen-tral molecular zone;iv) accelerate the primary electrons which provide the extended, non-thermalradio emission seen over ~150 pc scales above and below the plane (the galacticcentre lobe); and v) accelerate the primary protons and heavier ions which,advected to very large scales (up to ~10 kpc), generate the recently-identifiedwmap haze and corresponding fermi haze/bubbles. our modelling bounds theaverage magnetic field amplitude in the inner few degrees of the galaxy to therange 60 &lt; b/microg &lt; 400 (at 2 sigma confidence) and shows that even tev crslikely do not have time to penetrate into the cores of the region's densemolecular clouds before the wind removes them from the region. this latterfinding apparently disfavours scenarios in which crs - in this star-burst-likeenvironment - act to substantially modify the conditions of star-formation. wespeculate that the wind we identify plays a crucial role in advectinglow-energy positrons from the galactic nucleus into the bulge, therebyexplaining the extended morphology of the 511 kev line emission.

1109.5189	the r_h = ct universe	the backbone of standard cosmology is the friedmann-robertson-walker solutionto einstein's equations of general relativity (gr). in recent years,observations have largely confirmed many of the properties of this model, whichis based on a partitioning of the universe's energy density into three primaryconstituents: matter, radiation, and a hypothesized dark energy which, inlambdacdm, is assumed to be a cosmological constant lambda. yet with thisprogress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) haveemerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. one ofthese is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon r_h(t_0) with thedistance ct_0 light has traveled since the big bang, in terms of the currentage t_0 of the universe. this equality is very peculiar because it need nothave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)in the context of lambdacdm. in this paper, we propose an explanation for whythis equality may actually be required by gr, through the application ofbirkhoff's theorem and the weyl postulate, at least in the case of a flatspacetime. if this proposal is correct, r_h(t) should be equal to ct for allcosmic time t, not just its present value t_0. therefore models such aslambdacdm would be incomplete because they ascribe the cosmic expansion tovariable conditions not consistent with this relativistic constraint. we showthat this may be the reason why the observed galaxy correlation function is notconsistent with the predictions of the standard model. we suggest that anr_h=ct universe is easily distinguishable from all other models at largeredshift (i.e., in the early universe), where the latter all predict a rapiddeceleration.

1109.6736	polarimetric imaging of sgr a* in its flaring state	the galaxy's supermassive black hole, sgr a*, produces an outburst ofinfrared radiation about once every 6 hours, sometimes accompanied by an evenmore energetic flurry of x-rays. the nir photons are produced by nonthermalsynchrotron processes, but we still don't completely understand where or whythese flares originate, nor exactly how the x-rays are emitted. the power-lawelectrons radiating the infrared light may be partially cooled, so thedistribution may be a broken power law with a ("cooling break") transitionfrequency. in addition, the emission region appears to be rather compact,possibly restricted to the inner edge of the accretion disk. in that case, thex-ray outburst may itself be due to synchrotron processes by the most energeticparticles in this population. in this paper, we examine several key features ofthis proposal, producing relativistically correct polarimetric images of sgra*'s nir and x-ray flare emission, in order to determine (1) whether themeasured nir polarization fraction is consistent with this geometry, and (2)whether the predicted x-ray to nir peak fluxes are confirmed by the currentlyavailable multi-wavelength observations. we also calculate the x-raypolarization fraction and position angle (relative to that of the nir photons)in anticipation of such measurements in the coming years. we show that whereasthe polarization fraction and position angle of the x-rays are similar to thoseof the nir component for synchrotron-cooled emission, these quantities aremeasurably different when the x-rays emerge from a scattering medium. it isclear, therefore, that the development of x-ray polarimetry will represent amajor new tool for studying the spacetime near supermassive black holes.

1112.4774	photon geodesics in frw cosmologies	the hubble radius is a particular manifestation of the universe'sgravitational horizon, r_h(t_0)=c/h_0, the distance beyond which physicalprocesses remain unobservable to us at the present epoch. based on recentobservations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) with wmap, andground-based and hst searches for type ia supernovae, we now know thatr_h(t_0)~13.5 glyr. this coincides with the maximum distance (ct_0~13.7 glyr)light could have traveled since the big bang. however, the physical meaning ofr_h is still not universally understood or accepted, though the minimalist viewholds that it is merely the proper distance at which the rate of cosmicrecession reaches the speed of light c. even so, it is sometimes argued that wecan see light from sources beyond r_h, the claim being that r_h lies at aredshift of only ~2, whereas the cmb was produced at a much greater redshift(~1100). in this paper, we build on recent developments with the gravitationalradius by actually calculating null geodesics for a broad range of frwcosmologies, to show---at least in the specific cases we consider here,including lcdm---that no photon trajectories reaching us today could have evercrossed r_h(t_0). we therefore confirm that the current hubble radius, contraryto a commonly held misconception, is indeed the limit to our observability. wefind that the size of the visible universe in lcdm, measured as a properdistance, is approximately 0.45ct_0.

1202.4680	assessing the feasibility of cosmic-ray acceleration by magnetic  turbulence at the galactic center	the presence of relativistic particles at the center of our galaxy isevidenced by the diffuse tev emission detected from the inner $\sim$$2^\circ$of the galaxy. although it is not yet entirely clear whether the origin of thetev photons is due to hadronic or leptonic interactions, the tight correlationof the intensity distribution with the distribution of molecular gas along thegalactic ridge strongly points to a pionic-decay process involving relativisticprotons. in earlier work, we concluded that point-source candidates, such asthe supermassive black hole sagittarius a* (identified with the hess sourcej1745-290), or the pulsar wind nebulae dispersed along the galactic plane,could not account for the observed diffuse tev emission from this region.motivated by this result, we consider here the feasibility that the cosmic rayspopulating the galactic center (gc) region are accelerated in situ by magneticturbulence. our results indicate that even in a highly conductive environment,this mechanism is efficient enough to energize protons within the intercloudmedium to the $\ga $ tev energies required to produce the hess emission.

1206.6289	fitting the union2.1 sn sample with the r_h=ct universe	the analysis of type ia supernova data over the past decade has been anotable success story in cosmology. these standard candles offer us anunparalleled opportunity of studying the cosmological expansion out to aredshift of ~1.5. the consensus today appears to be that lcdm offers the bestexplanation for the luminosity-distance relationship seen in these events.however, a significant incompatibility is now emerging between the standardmodel and other equally important observations, such as those of the cosmicmicrowave background. lcdm does not provide an accurate representation of thecosmological expansion at high redshifts (z&gt;&gt;2). it is therefore essential tore-analyze the type ia supernova data in light of the cosmology (the r_h=ctuniverse) that best represents the universe's dynamical evolution at earlytimes. in this paper, we directly compare the distance-relationship in lcdmwith that predicted by r_h=ct, and each with the union2.1 sample, and show thatthe two theories produce virtually indistinguishable profiles, though the fitwith r_h=ct has not yet been optimized. this is because the data cannot bedetermined independently of the assumed cosmology---the supernova luminositiesmust be evaluated by optimizing 4 parameters simultaneously with those in theadopted model. this renders the data compliant to the underlying theory, so them odel-dependent data reduction should not be ignored in any comparativeanalysis between competing cosmologies. in this paper, we use r_h=ct to fit thedata reduced with lcdm, and though quite promising, the match is not perfect.an even better fit would result with an optimization of the data using r_h=ctfrom the beginning.

1206.6527	the r_h=ct universe without inflation	the horizon problem in the standard model of cosmology (ldcm) arises from theobserved uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which has thesame temperature everywhere (except for tiny, stochastic fluctuations), even inregions on opposite sides of the sky, which appear to lie outside of eachother's causal horizon. since no physical process propagating at or belowlightspeed could have brought them into thermal equilibrium, it appears thatthe universe in its infancy required highly improbable initial conditions. inthis paper, we examine this well-known problem by considering photonpropagation through a friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) spacetime at a morefundamental level than has been attempted before, demonstrating that thehorizon problem only emerges for a subset of frw cosmologies, such as lcdm,that include an early phase of rapid deceleration. we show that the horizonproblem is nonexistent for the recently introduced r_h=ct universe, obviatingthe principal motivation for the inclusion of inflation. we demonstrate throughdirect calculation that, in the r_h=ct universe, even opposite sides of thecosmos have remained causally connected to us - and to each other - from thevery first moments in the universe's expansion. therefore, within the contextof the r_h=ct universe, the hypothesized inflationary epoch from t=10^{-35}seconds to 10^{-32} seconds was not needed to fix this particular "problem",though it may still provide benefits to cosmology for other reasons.

1207.0015	angular correlation of the cmb in the r_h=ct universe	the emergence of several unexpected large-scale features in the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) has pointed to possible new physics driving theorigin of density fluctuations in the early universe and their evolution intothe large-scale structure we see today. in this paper, we focus our attentionon the possible absence of angular correlation in the cmb anisotropies atangles larger than ~60 degrees, and consider whether this feature may be thesignature of fluctuations expected in the r_h=ct universe. we calculate the cmbangular correlation function for a fluctuation spectrum expected from growth ina universe whose dynamics is constrained by the equation-of-state p=-rho/3,where p and rho are the total pressure and density, respectively. we find that,though the disparity between the predictions of lcdm and the wmap sky may bedue to cosmic variance, it may also be due to an absence of inflation. theclassic horizon problem does not exist in the r_h=ct universe, so a period ofexponential growth was not necessary in this cosmology in order to account forthe general uniformity of the cmb (save for the aforementioned tinyfluctuations of 1 part in 100,000 in the wmap relic signal. we show that ther_h=ct universe without inflation can account for the apparent absence in cmbangular correlation at angles &gt; 60 degrees without invoking cosmic variance,providing additional motivation for pursuing this cosmology as a viabledescription of nature.

1207.0734	cosmological implications of the cmb large-scale structure	wmap and planck may have uncovered several anomalies in the full cmb sky thatcould indicate possible new physics driving the growth of density fluctuationsin the early universe. these include an unusually low power at the largestscales and an apparent alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments. inlcdm, the quadrupole and octopole moments should be statistically independent.these low probability features may simply be due to posterior selections frommany such possible effects. if this is not the case, however, their combinedstatistical significance would be equal to the product of their individualsignificances. ignoring the biasing due to posterior selection, the missinglarge-angle correlations would have a probability as low as ~0.1% and the low-lmultipole alignment would be unlikely at the ~4.9% level; under the leastfavourable conditions, their simultaneous observation in the context of thestandard model could then be likely at only the ~0.005% level. in this paper,we explore the possibility that these features are indeed anomalous, and showthat the corresponding probability of cmb multipole alignment in the r_h=ctuniverse would then be ~7-10%, depending on the number of large-scalesachs-wolfe induced fluctuations. since the low power at the largest spatialscales is reproduced in this cosmology without the need to invoke cosmicvariance, the overall likelihood of observing both of these features in the cmbis &gt; 7%, much more likely than in lcdm. the key physical ingredient responsiblefor this difference is the existence in the former of a maximum fluctuationsize at the time of recombination, which is absent in the latter because ofinflation.

1207.1332	proper size of the visible universe in frw metrics with constant  spacetime curvature	in this paper, we continue to examine the fundamental basis for thefriedmann-robertson-walker (frw) metric and its application to cosmology,specifically addressing the question: what is the proper size of the visibleuniverse? there are several ways of answering the question of size, thoughoften with an incomplete understanding of how far light has actually traveledin reaching us today from the most remote sources. the difficulty usuallyarises from an inconsistent use of the coordinates, or an over-interpretationof the physical meaning of quantities such as the so-called proper distancer(t)=a(t)r, written in terms of the (unchanging) co-moving radius r and theuniversal expansion factor a(t). in this paper, we use the five non-trivial frwmetrics with constant spacetime curvature (i.e., the static frw metrics, butexcluding minkowski) to prove that in static frw spacetimes in which expansionbegan from an initial signularity, the visible universe today has a proper sizeequal to r_h(t_0/2), i.e., the gravitational horizon at half its current age.the exceptions are de sitter and lanczos, whose contents had pre-existingpositions away from the origin. in so doing, we confirm earlier results showingthe same phenomenon in a broad range of cosmologies, including lcdm, based onthe numerical integration of null geodesic equations through an frw metric.

0711.4181	the cosmic horizon	the cosmological principle, promoting the view that the universe ishomogeneous and isotropic, is embodied within the mathematical structure of therobertson-walker (rw) metric. the equations derived from an application of thismetric to the einstein field equations describe the expansion of the universein terms of comoving coordinates, from which physical distances may be derivedusing a time-dependent expansion factor. these coordinates, however, do notexplicitly reveal properties of the cosmic spacetime manifested in birkhoff'stheorem and its corollary. in this paper, we compare two forms of themetric--written in (the traditional) comoving coordinates, and a set ofobserver-dependent coordinates--first for the well-known de sitter universecontaining only dark energy, and then for a newly derived form of the rwmetric, for a universe with dark energy and matter. we show that rindler'sevent horizon--evident in the co-moving system--coincides with what one mightcall the "curvature horizon" appearing in the observer-dependent frame. theadvantage of this dual prescription of the cosmic spacetime is that with thelatest wmap results, we now have a much better determination of the universe'smass-energy content, which permits us to calculate this curvature withunprecedented accuracy. we use it here to demonstrate that our observationshave probed the limit beyond which the cosmic curvature prevents any signalfrom having ever reached us. in the case of de sitter, where the mass-energydensity is a constant, this limit is fixed for all time. for a universe with achanging density, this horizon expands until de sitter is reachedasymptotically, and then it too ceases to change.

0711.4810	dark energy in light of the cosmic horizon	based on dramatic observations of the cmb with wmap and of type ia supernovaewith the hubble space telescope and ground-based facilities, it is nowgenerally believed that the universe's expansion is accelerating. within thecontext of standard cosmology, the universe must therefore contain a third`dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. however, the currentdata are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving darkenergy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmologicalconstant. in this paper, we examine the role played by our cosmic horizon r0 inour interrogation of the data, and reach the rather firm conclusion that theexistence of a cosmological constant is untenable. the observations are tellingus that r0=c t0, where t0 is the perceived current age of the universe, yet acosmological constant would drive r0 towards ct (where t is the cosmic time)only once, and that would have to occur right now. in contrast, scalingsolutions simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model,including the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well forthe fact that r0=c t0. we show here that for such dynamical dark energy models,either r0=ct for all time (thus eliminating the apparent coincidencealtogether), or that what we believe to be the current age of the universe isactually the horizon time th=r0/c, which is always shorter than t0. our bestfit to the type ia supernova data indicates that t0 would then have to be ~16.9billion years. though surprising at first, an older universe such as this wouldactually eliminate several other long-standing problems in cosmology, includingthe (too) early appearance of supermassive black holes (at a redshift &gt; 6) andthe glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group.

1304.1802	cosmic chronometers in the r_h=ct universe	the use of luminous red galaxies as cosmic chronometers provides us with anindispensable method of measuring the universal expansion rate h(z) in amodel-independent way. unlike many probes of the cosmological history, thisapproach does not rely on integrated quantities, such as the luminositydistance, and therefore does not require the pre-assumption of any particularmodel, which may bias subsequent interpretations of the data. we employ threestatistical tools -- the akaike, kullback, and bayes information criteria (aic,kic and bic) -- to compare the lcdm model and the r_h=ct universe with thecurrently available measurements of h(z), and show that the r_h=ct universe isfavored by these model selection criteria. the parameters in each model areindividually optimized by maximum likelihood estimation. the r_h=ct universefits the data with a reduced chi^2_dof=0.745 for a hubble constanth_0=63.2+/-2.5 km/s/mpc, and h_0 is the sole parameter in this model. bycomparison, the optimal lcdm model, which has three free parameters (includingh_0=68.9+/-2.4 km/s/mpc, omega_m=0.32, and a dark-energy equation of statep_de=-rho_de), fits the h(z) data with a reduced chi^2_dof=0.777. with thesechi^2_dof values, the aic yields a likelihood of about 82 per cent that thedistance--redshift relation of the r_h=ct universe is closer to the correctcosmology, than is the case for lcdm. if the alternative bic criterion is used,the respective bayesian posterior probabilities are 91.2 per cent (r_h=ct)versus 8.8 per cent (lcdm). using the concordance lcdm parameter values, ratherthan those obtained by fitting lcdm to the cosmic chronometer data, wouldfurther disfavor lcdm.

1306.4415	cosmological tests using grbs, the star formation rate and possible  abundance evolution	the principal goal of this paper is to use attempts at reconciling the swiftlong gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) with the star formation history (sfh) to comparethe predictions of $\lambda$cdm with those in the $r_{\rm h}=ct$ universe. inthe context of the former, we confirm that the latest swift sample of grbsreveals an increasing evolution in the grb rate relative to the star formationrate (sfr) at high redshifts. the observed discrepancy between the grb rate andthe sfr may be eliminated by assuming a modest evolution parameterized as$(1+z)^{0.8}$---perhaps indicating a cosmic evolution in metallicity. however,we find a higher metallicity cut of $z=0.52z_{\odot}$ than was seen in previousstudies, which suggested that lgrbs occur preferentially in metal poorenvironments, i.e., $z\sim0.1-0.3z_{\odot}$. we use a simple power-lawapproximation to the high-\emph{z} ($\ga 3.8$) sfh, i.e., $r_{\rmsf}\propto[(1+z)/4.8]^{\alpha}$, to examine how the high-\emph{z} sfr may beimpacted by a possible abundance evolution in the swift grb sample. for anexpansion history consistent with $\lambda$cdm, we find that the swift redshiftand luminosity distributions can be reproduced with reasonable accuracy if$\alpha=-2.41_{-2.09}^{+1.87}$. for the $r_{\rm h}=ct$ universe, the grb rateis slightly different from that in $\lambda$cdm, but also requires an extraevolutionary effect, with a metallicity cut of $z=0.44z_{\odot}$. assuming thatthe sfr and grb rate are related via an evolving metallicity, we find that thegrb data constrain the slope of the high-\emph{z} sfr in $r_{\rm h}=ct$ to be$\alpha=-3.60_{-2.45}^{+2.45}$. both cosmologies fit the grb/sfr data ratherwell.

1312.5798	the high-z quasar hubble diagram	two recent discoveries have made it possible for us to begin using high-zquasars as standard candles to construct a hubble diagram (hd) at z &gt; 6. theseare (1) the recognition from reverberation mapping that a relationship existsbetween the optical/uv luminosity and the distance of line-emitting gas fromthe central ionizing source. thus, together with a measurement of the velocityof the line-emitting gas, e.g., via the width of blr lines, such as mg ii, asingle observation can therefore in principle provide a determination of theblack hole's mass; and (2) the identification of quasar ulas j1120+0641 at z =7.085, which has significantly extended the redshift range of these sources,providing essential leverage when fitting theoretical luminosity distances tothe data. in this paper, we use the observed fluxes and mg ii line-widths ofthese sources to show that one may reasonably test the predicted high-zdistance versus redshift relationship, and we assemble a sample of 20 currentlyavailable high-z quasars for this exercise. we find a good match between theoryand observations, suggesting that a more complete, high-quality survey mayindeed eventually produce an hd to complement the highly-detailed study alreadyunderway (e.g., with type ia sne, grbs, and cosmic chronometers) at lowerredshifts. with the modest sample we have here, we show that the r_h=ctuniverse and lcdm both fit the data quite well, though the smaller number offree parameters in the former produces a more favorable outcome when wecalculate likelihoods using the akaike, kullback, and bayes informationcriteria. these three statistical tools result in similar probabilities,indicating that the r_h=ct universe is more likely than lcdm to be correct, bya ratio of about 85% to 15%.

1403.0908	the premature formation of high redshift galaxies	observations with wfc3/ir on the hubble space telescope and the use ofgravitational lensing techniques have facilitated the discovery of galaxies asfar back as z ~ 10-12, a truly remarkable achievement. however, this rapidemergence of high-z galaxies, barely ~ 200 myr after the transition frompopulation iii star formation to population ii, appears to be in conflict withthe standard view of how the early universe evolved. this problem has much incommon with the better known (and probably related) premature appearance ofsupermassive black holes at z ~ 6. it is difficult to understand how ~ 10^9solar-mass black holes could have appeared so quickly after the big bangwithout invoking non-standard accretion physics and the formation of massiveseeds, neither of which is seen in the local universe. in earlier work, weshowed that the appearance of high-z quasars could instead be understood morereasonably in the context of the r_h=ct universe, which does not suffer fromthe same time compression issues as lcdm does at early epochs. here, we buildon that work by demonstrating that the evolutionary growth of primordialgalaxies was consistent with the current view of how the first stars formed,but only with the timeline afforded by the r_h=ct cosmology. we also show thatthe growth of high-z quasars was mutually consistent with that of the earliestgalaxies, though it is not yet clear whether the former grew from 5-20solar-mass seeds created in population iii or population ii supernovaexplosions.

1405.2388	a comparison of cosmological models using time delay lenses	the use of time-delay gravitational lenses to examine the cosmologicalexpansion introduces a new standard ruler with which to test theoreticalmodels. the sample suitable for this kind of work now includes 12 lens systems,which have thus far been used solely for optimizing the parameters of$\lambda$cdm. in this paper, we broaden the base of support for this new,important cosmic probe by using these observations to carry out a one-on-onecomparison between {\it competing} models. the currently available sampleindicates a likelihood of $\sim 70-80%$ that the $r_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is thecorrect cosmology versus $\sim 20-30%$ for the standard model. this possiblyinteresting result reinforces the need to greatly expand the sample oftime-delay lenses, e.g., with the successful implementation of the dark energysurvey, the vst atlas survey, and the large synoptic survey telescope. inanticipation of a greatly expanded catalog of time-delay lenses identified withthese surveys, we have produced synthetic samples to estimate how large theywould have to be in order to rule out either model at a $\sim 99.7%$ confidencelevel. we find that if the real cosmology is $\lambda$cdm, a sample of $\sim150$ time-delay lenses would be sufficient to rule out $r_{\rm h}=ct$ at thislevel of accuracy, while $\sim 1,000$ time-delay lenses would be required torule out $\lambda$cdm if the real universe is instead $r_{\rm h}=ct$. thisdifference in required sample size reflects the greater number of freeparameters available to fit the data with $\lambda$cdm.

1406.4918	on recent claims concerning the r_h=ct universe	the r_h=ct universe is a friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) cosmology which,like lcdm, assumes the presence of dark energy in addition to (baryonic andnon-luminous) matter and radiation. unlike lcdm, however, it is alsoconstrained by the equation of state (eos) p=-rho/3, in terms of the totalpressure p and energy density rho. one-on-one comparative tests between r_h=ctand lcdm have been carried out using over 14 different cosmologicalmeasurements and observations. in every case, the data have favoured r_h=ctover the standard model, with model selection tools yielding a likelihood~90-95% that the former is correct, versus only ~5-10% for the latter. in otherwords, the standard model without the eos p=-rho/3 does not appear to be theoptimal description of nature. yet in spite of these successes---or perhapsbecause of them---several concerns have been published recently regarding thefundamental basis of the theory itself. the latest paper on this subject evenclaims---quite remarkably---that r_h=ct is a vacuum solution, though quiteevidently rho is not 0. here, we address these concerns and demonstrate thatall criticisms leveled thus far against r_h=ct, including the supposed vacuumcondition, are unwarranted. they all appear to be based on incorrectassumptions or basic theoretical errors. nevertheless, continued scrutiny suchas this will be critical to establishing r_h=ct as the correct description ofnature.

1409.7815	the agn hubble diagram and its implications for cosmology	we use a recently proposed luminosity distance measure for relatively nearbyactive galactic nuclei (agns) to test the predicted expansion of the universein the r_h=ct and lcdm cosmologies. this comparative study is particularlyrelevant to the question of whether or not the universe underwent a transitionfrom decelerated to accelerated expansion, which is believed to haveoccurred---on the basis of type ia sn studies---within the redshift range (0 &lt;z &lt; 1.3) that will eventually be sampled by these objects. we find that the agnhubble diagram constructed from currently available sources does not supportthe existence of such a transition. while the scatter in the agn data is stilltoo large for any firm conclusions to be drawn, the results reported herenonetheless somewhat strengthen similar results of comparative analyses usingother types of source. we show that the akaike, kullback, and bayes informationcriteria all consistently yield a likelihood of ~84-96% that r_h=ct is closerto the "true" cosmology than lcdm is, though neither model adequately accountsfor the data, suggesting an unnaccounted-for source of scatter.

1410.0875	a comparison of cosmological models using strong gravitational lensing  galaxies	strongly gravitationally lensed quasar-galaxy systems allow us to comparecompeting cosmologies as long as one can be reasonably sure of the massdistribution within the intervening lens. in this paper, we assemble a catalogof 69 such systems, and carry out a one-on-one comparison between the standardmodel, lcdm, and the r_h=ct universe. we find that both models account for thelens observations quite well, though the precision of these measurements doesnot appear to be good enough to favor one model over the other. part of thereason is the so-called bulge-halo conspiracy that, on average, results in abaryonic velocity dispersion within a fraction of the optical effective radiusvirtually identical to that expected for the whole luminous-dark matterdistribution. given the limitations of doing precision cosmological testingusing the current sample, we also carry out monte carlo simulations based onthe current lens measurements to estimate how large the source catalog wouldhave to be in order to rule out either model at a ~99.7% confidence level. wefind that if the real cosmology is lcdm, a sample of ~200 strong gravitationallenses would be sufficient to rule out r_h=ct at this level of accuracy, while~300 strong gravitational lenses would be required to rule out lcdm if the realuniverse were instead r_h=ct. the difference in required sample size reflectsthe greater number of free parameters available to fit the data with lcdm. wepoint out that, should the r_h=ct universe eventually emerge as the correctcosmology, its lack of any free parameters for this kind of work will provide aremarkably powerful probe of the mass structure in lensing galaxies, and ameans of better understanding the origin of the bulge-halo conspiracy.

1411.5678	cosmological tests using the angular size of galaxy clusters	we use measurements of the galaxy-cluster angular size versus redshift totest and compare the standard model (lcdm) and the r_h=ct universe. we showthat the latter fits the data with a reduced chi^2_dof=0.786 for a hubbleconstant h_0= 72.6 (-3.4+3.8) km/s/mpc, and h_0 is the sole parameter in thismodel. by comparison, the optimal flat lcdm model, with two free parameters(including omega_m=0.50 and h_0=73.9 (-9.5+10.6) km/s/mpc), fits theangular-size data with a reduced chi^2_dof=0.806. on the basis of theirchi^2_dof values alone, both models appear to account for the data very well inspite of the fact that the r_h=ct universe expands at a constant rate, whilelcdm does not. however, because of the different number of free parameters inthese models, selection tools, such as the bayes information criterion, favourr_h=ct over lcdm with a likelihood of ~86% versus ~14%. these results impactthe question of galaxy growth at large redshifts. previous work suggested aninconsistency with the underlying cosmological model unless elliptical and diskgalaxies grew in size by a surprisingly large factor ~6 from z~3 to 0. the factthat both lcdm and r_h=ct fit the cluster-size measurements quite well castssome doubt on the suggestion that the unexpected result with individualgalaxies may be due to the use of an incorrect expansion scenario, rather thanastrophysical causes, such as mergers and/or selection effects.

1411.5771	the cosmic equation of state	the cosmic spacetime is often described in terms of the frw metric, thoughthe adoption of this elegant and convenient solution to einstein's equationsdoes not tell us much about the equation of state, p=w rho, in terms of thetotal energy density rho and pressure p of the cosmic fluid. lcdm and ther_h=ct universe are both frw cosmologies that partition rho into (at least)three components, matter rho_m, radiation rho_r, and a poorly understood darkenergy rho_de, though the latter goes one step further by also invoking theconstraint w=-1/3. this condition is required by the simultaneous applicationof the cosmological principle and weyl's postulate. model selection tools inone-on-one comparisons favor r_h=ct with a likelihood of ~90% versus only ~10%for lcdm. nonetheless, the predictions of lcdm often come quite close to thoseof r_h=ct, suggesting that its parameters are optimized to mimic the w=-1/3equation of state. in this paper, we demonstrate that the equation of state inr_h=ct helps us to understand why the optimized fraction omega_m=rho_m/rho inlcdm must be ~0.27, an otherwise seemingly random variable. we show that whenone forces lcdm to satisfy the equation of state w=(rho_r/3-rho_de)/rho, thevalue of the hubble radius today, c/h_0, can equal its measured value ct_0 onlywith omega_m~0.27 when the equation of state for dark energy is w_de=-1. thispeculiar value of omega_m therefore appears to be a direct consequence oftrying to fit the data with the equation of state w=(rho_r/3-rho_de)/rho in auniverse whose principal constraint is instead r_h=ct or, equivalently, w=-1/3.

1501.02838	a comparative analysis of the supernova legacy survey sample with  {\lambda}cdm and the $r_{\rm h}=ct$ universe	the use of type~ia sne has thus far produced the most reliable measurement ofthe expansion history of the universe, suggesting that $\lambda$cdm offers thebest explanation for the redshift--luminosity distribution observed in theseevents. but the analysis of other kinds of source, such as cosmic chronometers,gamma ray bursts, and high-$z$ quasars, conflicts with this conclusion,indicating instead that the constant expansion rate implied by the $r_{\rmh}=ct$ universe is a better fit to the data. the central difficulty with theuse of type~ia sne as standard candles is that one must optimize three or fournuisance parameters characterizing supernova luminosities simultaneously withthe parameters of an expansion model. hence in comparing competing models, onemust reduce the data independently for each. we carry~out such a comparison of$\lambda$cdm and the $r_{\rm h}=ct$ universe, using the supernova legacy survey(snls) sample of 252 sn~events, and show that each model fits its individuallyreduced data very well. but since $r_{\rm h}=ct$ has only one free parameter(the hubble constant), it follows from a standard model selection techniquethat it is to be preferred over $\lambda$cdm, the minimalist version of whichhas three (the hubble constant, the scaled matter density and either thespatial curvature constant or the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter). weestimate by the bayes information criterion that in a pairwise comparison, thelikelihood of $r_{\rm h}=ct$ is $\sim 90\%$, compared with only $\sim 10\%$ fora minimalist form of $\lambda$cdm, in which dark energy is simply acosmological constant. compared to $r_{\rm h}=ct$, versions of the standardmodel with more elaborate parametrizations of dark energy are judged to be evenless likely.

0804.3111	diffuse tev emission at the galactic centre	the high-energy stereoscopic system (hess) has detected intense diffuse tevemission correlated with the distribution of molecular gas along the galacticridge at the centre of our galaxy. earlier hess observations of this region hadalready revealed the presence of several point sources at these energies, oneof them (hess j1745-290) coincident with the supermassive black holesagittarius a*. it is still not entirely clear what the origin of the tevemission is, nor even whether it is due to hadronic or leptonic interactions.it is reasonable to suppose, however, that at least for the diffuse emission,the tight correlation of the intensity distribution with the molecular gasindicates a pionic-decay process involving relativistic protons. in this paper,we explore the possible source(s) of energetic hadrons at the galactic centre,and their propagation through a turbulent medium. we conclude that thoughsagittarius a* itself may be the source of cosmic rays producing the emissionin hess j1745-290, it cannot be responsible for the diffuse emission fartherout. a distribution of point sources, such as pulsar wind nebulae dispersedalong the galactic plane, similarly do not produce a tev emission profileconsistent with the hess map. we conclude that only a relativistic protondistribution accelerated throughout the inter-cloud medium can account for thetev emission profile measured with hess.

1503.05052	alcock-paczynski test with model-independent bao data	cosmological tests based on the statistical analysis of galaxy distributionsare usually dependent on the evolution of the sources. an exception is thealcock-paczynski (ap) test, which is based on the changing ratio of angular tospatial/redshift size of (presumed) spherically-symmetric source distributionswith distance. intrinsic redshift distortions due to gravitational effects mayalso have an influence, but there is now a way to overcome them: with theinclusion in the ap test of an observational signature with a sharp feature,such as the baryonic acoustic oscillation (bao) peak. redshift distortionsaffect only the amplitude of the peak, not its position. as we will show here,the use of this diagnostic, with newly acquired data on the anisotropicdistribution of the bao peaks from sdss-iii/boss-dr11 at average redshifts &lt;z&gt;= 0.57 and &lt;z&gt; = 2.34, disfavors the current concordance (lcdm) model at 2.7sigma. a statistically acceptable fit to the ap data with wcdm (the version oflcdm with a dark-energy equation of state omega_de\equiv p_de/rho_de ratherthan omega_de=omega_lambda=-1) is possible only withomega_de=-0.24^{+0.60}_{-0.42} and omega_m= 0.74^{+0.22}_{-0.33}. within thecontext of expanding friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) cosmologies, these datastrongly favor the zero `active mass' equation-of-state, the basis for ther_h=ct universe, in which rho+3p=0, where rho and p are, respectively, thetotal density and pressure of the cosmic fluid. in r_h=ct, however, thecurrently inferred cmb and bao scales would have to be different, while astrong point in favor of lcdm is that in this model the same acoustic lengthwould be responsible for both.

1503.06378	testing cosmological models with type ic super luminous supernovae	the use of type ic super luminous supernovae (slsn ic) to examine thecosmological expansion introduces a new standard ruler with which to testtheoretical models. the sample suitable for this kind of work now includes 11slsne ic, which have thus far been used solely in tests involving $\lambda$cdm.in this paper, we broaden the base of support for this new, important cosmicprobe by using these observations to carry out a one-on-one comparison betweenthe $r_{\rm h}=ct$ and $\lambda$cdm cosmologies. we individually optimize theparameters in each cosmological model by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$ statistic.we also carry out monte carlo simulations based on these current slsn icmeasurements to estimate how large the sample would have to be in order to ruleout either model at a $\sim 99.7\%$ confidence level. the currently availablesample indicates a likelihood of $\sim$$70-80\%$ that the $r_{\rm h}=ct$universe is the correct cosmology versus $\sim$$20-30\%$ for the standardmodel. these results are suggestive, though not yet compelling, given thecurrent limited number of slsne ic. we find that if the real cosmology is$\lambda$cdm, a sample of $\sim$$240$ slsne ic would be sufficient to rule out$r_{\rm h}=ct$ at this level of confidence, while $\sim$$480$ slsne ic would berequired to rule out $\lambda$cdm if the real universe is instead $r_{\rmh}=ct$. this difference in required sample size reflects the greater number offree parameters available to fit the data with $\lambda$cdm. if such slsne icare commonly detected in the future, they could be a powerful tool forconstraining the dark-energy equation of state in $\lambda$cdm, anddifferentiating between this model and the $r_{\rm h}=ct$ universe.

1505.07671	the age-redshift relationship of old passive galaxies	we use 32 age measurements of passively evolving galaxies as a function ofredshift to test and compare the standard model ($\lambda$cdm) with the $r_{\rmh}=ct$ universe. we show that the latter fits the data with a reduced$\chi^2_{\rm dof}=0.435$ for a hubble constant $h_{0}= 67.2_{-4.0}^{+4.5}$ km$\rm s^{-1}$ $\rm mpc^{-1}$. by comparison, the optimal flat $\lambda$cdmmodel, with two free parameters (including $\omega_{\rmm}=0.12_{-0.11}^{+0.54}$ and $h_{0}=94.3_{-35.8}^{+32.7}$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ $\rmmpc^{-1}$), fits the age-\emph{z} data with a reduced $\chi^2_{\rm dof}=0.428$.based solely on their $\chi^2_{\rm dof}$ values, both models appear to accountfor the data very well, though the optimized $\lambda$cdm parameters are onlymarginally consistent with those of the concordance model ($\omega_{\rmm}=0.27$ and $h_{0}= 70$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ $\rm mpc^{-1}$). fitting the age-$z$data with the latter results in a reduced $\chi^2_{\rm dof}=0.523$. however,because of the different number of free parameters in these models, selectiontools, such as the akaike, kullback and bayes information criteria, favour$r_{\rm h}=ct$ over $\lambda$cdm with a likelihood of $\sim 66.5\%-80.5\%$versus $\sim 19.5\%-33.5\%$. these results are suggestive, though not yetcompelling, given the current limited galaxy age-$z$ sample. we carry out montecarlo simulations based on these current age measurements to estimate how largethe sample would have to be in order to rule out either model at a $\sim99.7\%$ confidence level. we find that if the real cosmology is $\lambda$cdm, asample of $\sim 45$ galaxy ages would be sufficient to rule out $r_{\rm h}=ct$at this level of accuracy, while $\sim 350$ galaxy ages would be required torule out $\lambda$cdm if the real universe were instead $r_{\rm h}=ct$.

1507.08279	a test of cosmological models using high-z measurements of h(z)	the recently constructed hubble diagram using a combined sample of snls andsdss-ii type ia sne, and an application of the alcock-paczynski (ap) test usingmodel-independent baryon acoustic oscillation data, have suggested that theprincipal constraint underlying the cosmic expansion is the totalequation-of-state of the cosmic fluid, rather than that of its dark energy.these studies have focused on the critical redshift range (0 &lt; z &lt; 2) withinwhich the transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion is thought tohave occurred, and they suggest that the cosmic fluid has zero active mass,consistent with a constant expansion rate. the evident impact of thisconclusion on cosmological theory calls for an independent confirmation. inthis paper, we carry out this crucial one-on-one comparison between the r_h=ctuniverse (an frw cosmology with zero active mass) and wcdm/lcdm, using thelatest high-z measurements of h(z). whereas the type ia sne yield theintegrated luminosity distance, while the ap diagnostic tests the geometry ofthe universe, the hubble parameter directly samples the expansion rate itself.we find that the model-independent cosmic chronometer data prefer r_h}=ct overwcdm/lcdm with a bic likelihood of ~95% versus only ~5%, in strong support ofthe earlier sneia and ap results. this contrasts with a recent analysis of h(z)data based solely on bao measurements which, however, strongly depend on theassumed cosmology. we discuss why the latter approach is inappropriate formodel comparisons, and emphasize again the need for truly model-independentobservations to be used in cosmological tests.

0806.0602	decaying dark matter and the deficit of dwarf haloes	the hierarchical clustering inherent in lambda-cdm cosmology seems to producemany of the observed characteristics of large-scale structure. but some glaringproblems still remain, including the over-prediction (by a factor 10) of thenumber of dwarf galaxies within the virialized population of the local group.several secondary effects have already been proposed to resolve this problem.it is still not clear, however, whether the principal solution rests withastrophysical processes, such as early feedback from supernovae, or possiblywith as yet undetermined properties of the dark matter itself. in this paper,we carry out a detailed calculation of the dwarf halo evolution incorporatingthe effects of a hypothesized dark-matter decay, d -&gt; d'+l, where d is theunstable particle, d' is the more massive daughter particle and l is the other,lighter (or possibly massless) daughter particle. this process preferentiallyheats the smaller haloes, expanding them during their evolution and reducingtheir present-day circular velocity. we find that this mechanism can accountvery well for the factor 4 deficit in the observed number of systems withvelocity 10--20 km/s compared to those predicted by the numerical simulations,if dm/m_d' ~ 5-7 x 10^{-5}, where dm is the mass difference between the initialand final states. the corresponding lifetime tau cannot be longer than ~30 gyr,but may be as short as just a few gyr.

1511.05494	supermassive black holes in the early universe	the recent discovery of the ultraluminous quasar sdss j010013.02+280225.8 atredshift 6.3 has exacerbated the time compression problem implied by theappearance of supermassive black holes only ~900 myr after the big bang, andonly ~500 myr beyond the formation of pop ii and iii stars. aside fromheralding the onset of cosmic reionization, these first and second generationstars could have reasonably produced the ~5-20 solar-mass seeds that eventuallygrew into z~6-7 quasars. but this process would have taken ~900 myr, a timelinethat appears to be at odds with the predictions of lcdm without an anomalouslyhigh accretion rate, or some exotic creation of ~10^5 solar-mass seeds. thereis no evidence of either of these happening in the local universe. in thispaper, we show that a much simpler, more elegant solution to the supermassiveblack hole anomaly is instead to view this process using the age-redshiftrelation predicted by the r_h=ct universe, an frw cosmology with zero activemass. in this context, cosmic reionization lasted from t~883 myr to ~2 gyr(z~15 to z~6), so ~5-20 solar-mass black hole seeds formed shortly afterreionization had begun, would have evolved into ~10^10 solar-mass quasars byz~6-7 simply via the standard eddington-limited accretion rate. the consistencyof these observations with the age-redshift relationship predicted by r_h=ctsupports the existence of dark energy; but not in the form of a cosmologicalconstant.

1512.02427	the epoch of reionization in the r_h=ct universe	the measured properties of the epoch of reionization (eor) show thatreionization probably began around z ~ 12-15 and ended by z=6. in addition, acareful analysis of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave backgroundindicate a scattering optical depth tau ~ 0.066+/-0.012 through the eor. in thecontext of lcdm, galaxies at intermediate redshifts and dwarf galaxies athigher redshifts now appear to be the principal sources of uv ionizingradiation, but only for an inferred (ionizing) escape fraction f_ion ~ 0.2,which is in tension with other observations that suggest a value as small as ~0.05. in this paper, we examine how reionization might have progressed in thealternative friedmann-robertson walker cosmology known as the r_h=ct universe,and determine the value of f_ion required with this different rate ofexpansion. we find that r_h=ct accounts quite well for the currently knownproperties of the eor, as long as its fractional baryon density falls withinthe reasonable range 0.026 &lt; omega_b &lt; 0.037. this model can also fit the eordata with f_ion ~ 0.05, but only if the lyman continuum photon production ishighly efficient and omega_b ~ 0.037. these results are still preliminary,however, given their reliance on a particular form of the star-formation ratedensity, which is still uncertain at very high redshifts. it will also behelpful to reconsider the eor in r_h=ct when complete structure formationmodels become available.

astro-ph;0007371	electron positron annihilation radiation from sgra east at the galactic  center	maps of the galactic electron-positron annihilation radiation show evidencefor three distinct and significant features: (1) a central bulge source, (2)emission in the galactic plane, and (3) an enhancement of emission at positivelatitudes above the galactic center. in this paper, we explore the possibilitythat sgr a east, a very prominent radio structure surrounding the galacticnucleus, may be a significant contributer to the central bulge feature. themotivation for doing so stems from a recently proposed link between this radioobject and the egret gamma-ray source 2eg j1746-2852. if this association iscorrect, then sgr a east is also expected to be a source of copious positronproduction. the results presented here show that indeed sgr a east must haveproduced a numerically significant population of positrons, but also that mostof them have not yet had sufficient time to thermalize and annihilate. as such,sgr a east by itself does not appear to be the dominant current source ofannihilation radiation, but it will be when the positrons have cooledsufficiently and they have become thermalized. this raises the interestingpossibility that the bulge component may be due to the relics of earlierexplosive events like the one that produced sgr a east.

astro-ph;0008416	a magnetic dynamo origin for the sub-mm excess in sgr a*	the sub-mm bump observed in the spectrum of sgr a* appears to indicate theexistence of a compact emitting component within several schwarzschild radii,$r_s$, of the nucleus at the galactic center. this is interesting in view ofthe predicted circularized flow within $\sim 5-10 r_s$, based on detailedmulti-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of bondi-hoyle accretion onto thisunusual object. in this paper, we examine the physics of magnetic fieldgeneration by a keplerian dynamo subject to the conditions pertaining to sgra*, and show that the sub-mm bump can be produced by thermal synchrotronemission in this inner region. this spectral feature may therefore be taken asindirect evidence for the existence of this circularization. in addition, theself-comptonization of the sub-mm bump appears to produce an x-ray fluxexceeding that due to bremsstrahlung from this region, which may account forthe x-ray counterpart to sgr a* discovered recently by {\it chandra}. however,the required accretion rate in the keplerian flow is orders of magnitudesmaller than that predicted by the bondi-hoyle simulations. we speculate thatrapid evaporation, in the form of a wind, may ensue from the heating associatedwith turbulent mixing of gas elements with large eccentricity as they settledown into a more or less circular (i.e., low eccentricity) trajectory. thespectrum of sgr a* longward of $\sim 1-2$ mm may be generated outside of thekeplerian flow, where the gas is making a transition from a quasi-sphericalinfall into a circularized pattern.

astro-ph;0010211	correlated sub-mm and x-ray variability in sgr a*	paper withdrawn.  the recent detection of sgr a* in the x-ray band, together with the radiopolarization measurements conducted over the past few years, offer the bestconstraints yet for understanding the nature of the emitting gas within severalschwarzschild radii ($r_s$) of this supermassive black hole candidate at thegalactic center. earlier, we showed that the sub-mm radiation from this sourcemay be associated with thermal synchrotron emission from an inner keplerianregion within the circularization radius of the accreting plasma. in thispaper, we extend this analysis in a very important way, by calculating theimplied high-energy emission of sgr a* associated with the orbiting, hot,magnetized gas. we find that for the accretion rate inferred from the fits tothe sub-mm data, the dominant contribution to sgr a*'s x-ray flux is due toself-comptonization of the radio photons, rather than from bremsstrahlung. thelatter is a two-body process, which would produce significant x-ray emissiononly at much higher accretion rates. this picture leads to the testableprediction that the physical conditions within the inner $\sim5r_s$ arevariable on a time scale of order a year. in particular, the accretion rate$\dot m$ appears to have changed by about 15% between the sub-mm measurementsin 1996 and 1999. given that the radio and self-comptonized fluxes are stronglycorrelated in this picture, the upcoming second generation chandra observationsof sgr a* may provide the direct evidence required to test this model.

astro-ph;0101330	accretion processes in the nucleus of m31	the hypothesized supermassive black hole in the nucleus of m31 (which weshall hereafter call m31*) has many features in common with sgr a* at thegalactic center, yet they differ in several significant and important ways.though m31* is probably ten times heavier, its radio luminosity at 3.6 cm isonly one third that of sgr a*. at the same time, m31* is apparently thousandsof times more luminous in x-rays than its galactic center counterpart. thus, acomparative study of these objects can be valuable in helping us to understandthe underlying physical basis for their activity. we show here that theaccretion model being developed for sgr a* comprises two branches of solutions,distinguished by the relative importance of cooling compared to compressionalheating at the radius $r_c$ where the ambient gas is captured by the blackhole. for typical conditions in the ism, the initial temperature ($t[r_c]\sim10^6-10^7$ k) sits on the unstable branch of the cooling function.  depending on the actual value of $t(r_c)$ and the accretion rate, the plasmasettles either onto a hot branch (attaining a temperature as high as $10^{10}k$ or so at small radii) or a cold branch, in which $t$ drops to $\sim 10^4$ k.sgr a* is presumably a `hot' black hole. we show here that the vla, uv and {\itchandra} observations of m31* reveal it to be a member of the `cold' black holefamily. we discuss several predicted features in the spectrum of m31* that maybe testable by future multi-wavelength observations, including the presence ofa prominent uv spike (from hydrogen line emission) that would be absent on thehot branch.

astro-ph;0105188	measuring the black hole spin in sgr a*	the polarized mm/sub-mm radiation from sgr a* is apparently produced by akeplerian structure whose peak emission occurs within several schwarzschildradii (r_s=2gm/c^2) of the black hole. the chandra x-ray counterpart, ifconfirmed, is presumably the self-comptonized component from this region. inthis paper, we suggest that sub-mm timing observations could yield a signalcorresponding to the period p_0 of the marginally stable orbit, and thereforepoint directly to the black hole's spin a. sgr a*'s mass is now known to be(2.6\pm 0.2)\times 10^6 m_\odot (an unusually accurate value for supermassiveblack hole candidates), for which 2.7 min&lt;p_0&lt;36 min, depending on the value ofa and whether the keplerian flow is prograde or retrograde. a schwarzschildblack hole (a=0) should have p_0 ~ 20 min. the identification of the orbitalfrequency with the innermost stable circular orbit is made feasible by thetransition from optically thick to thin emission at sub-mm wavelengths. withstratification in the emitter, the peak of the sub-mm bump in sgr a*'s spectrumis thus produced at the smallest radius. we caution, however, that theoreticaluncertainties in the structure of the emission region may still produce someambiguity in the timing signal. given that sgr a*'s flux at $\nu\sim 1$ mm isseveral jy, these periods should lie within the temporal-resolving capabilityof sub-mm telescopes using bolometric detectors. a determination of p_0 shouldprovide not only a value of a, but it should also define the angular momentumvector of the orbiting gas in relation to the black hole's spin axis. inaddition, since the x-ray flux detected by chandra appears to be theself-comptonized mm to sub-mm component, these temporal fluctuations may alsobe evident in the x-ray signal.

astro-ph;0110563	new constraints on the nature of radio emission in sagittarius a*	the mm to sub-mm spectrum of sgr a* at the galactic center, as well as itspolarization characteristics, are consistent with the inner 10 schwarzschildradii of a tight keplerian emitting region of hot, magnetized, orbiting gas.this plasma may also be the source through self-comptonization of the x-raysdetected by chandra. it has long been suspected that the circularization regionbetween the quasi-spherical infall at large radii, and this inner zone, isresponsible for producing the rest of sgr a*'s spectrum. in this paper, wereport the results of a detailed study of this region. first, the combinationof existing cm and x-ray data preclude the possibility of producing theobserved strong 1.36 ghz radio flux via thermal synchrotron within a boundedflow. if sgr a*'s radio spectrum is produced by accreting gas, it appears thata non-thermal particle distribution is a necessity. second, if this is thecorrect picture for how sgr a*'s spectrum is produced, it appears that thechandra-detected x-rays may originate either from self-comptonization in theinner keplerian region, or from optically-thin nonthermal synchrotron emissionin the much larger, circularization zone, extending up to 500 schwarzschildradii or more. this is a question that should be answered by upcoming broadbandobservations, since the mm-bump and x-rays are strongly correlated in theformer case, whereas the x-rays are strongly correlated to the cm-radio flux inthe latter. in addition, x-rays produced in the circularized gas could showperiodic or quasi-periodic variations, but not those produced via nonthermalsynchrotron emission much farther out.

astro-ph;0110564	an accretion-induced x-ray flare in sgr a*	the recent detection of a three-hour x-ray flare from sgr a* by chandraprovides very strong evidence for a compact emitting region near thissupermassive black hole at the galactic center. sgr a*'s mm/sub-mm spectrum andpolarimetric properties, and its quiescent-state x-ray flux density, areconsistent with a model in which low angular momentum gas captured at largeradii circularizes to form a hot, magnetized keplerian flow within tens ofschwarzschild radii of the black hole's event horizon. in sgr a*'s quiescentstate, the x-ray emission appears to be produced by self-comptonization (ssc)of the mm/sub-mm synchrotron photons emitted in this region. in this paper, weshow that the prominent x-ray flare seen in sgr a* may be due to a suddenenhancement of accretion through the circularized flow. depending on whetherthe associated response of the anomalous viscosity is to increase or decreasein tandem with this additional injection of mass, the x-ray photons during theoutburst may be produced either via thermal bremsstrahlung (if the viscositydecreases), or via ssc (if the viscosity increases). however, the latterpredicts a softer x-ray spectrum than was seen by chandra, so it appears that abremsstrahlung origin for the x-ray outburst is favored. a strong correlationis expected between the mm/sub-mm and x-ray fluxes when the flare x-rays areproduced by ssc, while the correlated variability is strongest between thesub-mm/far-ir and x-rays when bremsstrahlung emission is dominant during theflare. in addition, we shows that future coordinated multi-wavelengthobservations planned for the 2002 and 2003 cycles may be able to distinguishbetween the accretion and jet scenarios.

astro-ph;0110565	line emission from cooling accretion flows in the nucleus of m31	the recent chandra x-ray observations of the nucleus of m31, combined withearlier vla radio and hst uv spectral measurements, provide the strictestconstraints on the nature of accretion onto the supermassive black hole (calledm31* hereafter) in this region. one of the two newly-detected sources withinroughly an arcsec of m31* may be its x-ray counterpart. if not, the x-ray fluxfrom the nucleus must be even lower than inferred previously. some uncertaintyremains regarding the origin of the uv excess from the compact component knownas p2. in our earlier analysis, we developed a unified picture for thebroadband spectrum of this source. contrary to the `standard' picture in whichthe infalling plasma attains temperatures in excess of 10^{10} k near the eventhorizon, the best fit model for m31*, under the assumption that the uvradiation is in fact produced by this source, appears to correspond to a coolbranch solution, arising from strong line cooling inside the capture radius.starting its infall with a temperature of about 10^6 k in the post-shockregion, the plasma cools down efficiently to about 10^4 k toward smaller radii.an important prediction of this model is the appearance of a prominent uv spikefrom hydrogen line emission. in this paper we model this line emission withsignificantly greater accuracy, using the algorithm cloudy, and to correctlytake into account the attenuation along the line of sight. we predict aspectrum with several additional prominent emission lines that can be used toverify the model with future high-resolution observations.

astro-ph;0111286	is thermal expansion driving the initial gas ejection in ngc 6251?	in this paper, we explore the possibility that the radiative properties ofthe most compact region in ngc 6251* may be understood in the same sense as sgra*, though with some telling differences that may hint at the nature of jetformation. we show that observations of this object with asca, rosat, hst andvlbi together may be hinting at a picture in which bondi-hoyle accretion froman ambient ionized medium feeds a standard disk accreting at ~ 4.0*10^{22} gs^{-1}. somewhere near the event horizon, this plasma is heated to &gt;10^{11} k,where it radiates via thermal synchrotron (producing a radio component) andself-comptonization (accounting for a nonthermal x-ray flux). this temperatureis much greater than its virial value and the hot cloud expands at roughly thesound speed (~0.1c), after which it begins to accelerate on a parsec scale torelativistic velocities. in earlier work, the emission from the extended jethas been modeled successfully using nonthermal synchrotron self-comptonprocesses, with a self-absorbed inner core. in the picture we are developinghere, the initial ejection of matter is associated with a self-absorbed thermalradio component that dominates the core emission on the smallest scales. thenonthermal particle distributions responsible for the emission in the extendedjet are then presumably energized, e.g., via shock acceleration, within theexpanding, hot gas. the power associated with this plasma represents anaccretion efficiency of about 0.54, requiring dissipation in a prograde diskaround a rapidly spinning black hole (with spin parameter a~1).

astro-ph;0205487	spin-induced disk precession in the supermassive black hole at the  galactic center	sgr a* is a compact radio source at the galactic center, thought to be theradiative manifestation of a $2.6\times 10^6 m_\odot$ supermassive black hole.at least a portion of its spectrum--notably the mm/sub-mm ``bump''--appears tobe produced within the inner portion ($r&lt; 10 r_s$) of a hot, magnetizedkeplerian flow, whose characteristics are also consistent with the $\sim 10%$linear polarization detected from this source at mm wavelengths. (theschwarzschild radius, $r_s$, for an object of this mass $m$ is $2gm/c^2\approx7.7\times 10^{11}$ cm, or roughly 1/20 a.u.) the recent detection of a 106-daycycle in sgr a*'s radio variability adds significant intrigue to this picture,since it may signal a precession of the disk induced by the spin $a$ of theblack hole. the dynamical time scale near the marginally stable orbit around anobject with this mass is $\approx 20$ mins. thus, since the physical conditionsassociated with the disk around sgr a* imply rigid-body rotation, a precessionperiod of 106 days may be indicative of a small black hole spin if thecircularized flow is confined to a region $\sim 30 r_s$, for which $a\approx(m/10) (r_o/30 r_s)^{5/2}$. the precession of a larger structure would requirea bigger black hole spin. we note that a small value of $a/m$ ($&lt; 0.1$) wouldbe favored if the non-thermal ($\sim 1-20$ cm) portion of sgr a*'s spectrum ispowered with energy extracted via a blandford-znajek type of process, for whichthe observed luminosity would correspond to an outer disk radius $r_o\sim 30r_s$. such a small disk size is also suggested by earlier hydrodynamicalsimulations, and is implied by sgr a*'s spectral and polarimetriccharacteristics.

astro-ph;0306599	shadowing of the nascent jet in ngc 4261 by a line-emitting supersonic  accretion disk	ngc 4261 (3c 270) is a low-luminosity radio galaxy with two symmetrickiloparsec-scale jets. earlier hubble space telescope observations indicatedthe presence of a hundred-parsec scale disk of cool dust and gas surrounding acentral, supermassive ($\sim 4.9\times 10^8\msun$) black hole. the recentdetection of free-free radio absorption by a small, geometrically-thin disk,combined with earlier studies of the disk's large scale properties, provide thestrictest constraints to date on the nature of the accretion process in thissystem. we show here that a supersonic disk, illuminated by the active galacticnucleus (agn), can not only account for the observed radio shadowing, but canalso produce the optical broad lines emitted from this region. beyond acritical radius $r_c$, line cooling dominates over gravitational dissipationand the gas is effectively cooled down to temperatures below $10^4$ k. within$r_c$, however, heating due to the release of gravitational energy overwhelmsline cooling and the plasma is heated very quickly to a temperature close toits virial value as it falls toward the central engine. the disk isoptically-thin to uv and x-ray radiation within $r_c$, so the ionizingradiation from the agn is preferentially absorbed near $r_c$, affecting thedisk structure significantly. to include the ensuing photoionization effect, wehave used the algorithm cloudy with additional heating introduced bygravitational dissipation to calculate the temperature profile and lineemission from the disk in a self-consistent manner. the results of our modelcalculation are consistent with current multiwavelength observations of thedisk in this source.

astro-ph;0307157	a relativistic disk in sagittarius a*	the detection of a mm/sub-mm ``bump'' in sgr a*'s radio spectrum suggeststhat at least a portion of its overall emission is produced within a compactaccretion torus. this inference is strengthened by observations of stronglinear polarization (at the 10 percent level) within this bump. no linearpolarization has been detected yet at other wavelengths. given that radiationfrom this source is produced on progressively smaller spatial scales withincreasing frequency, the mm/sub-mm bump apparently arises within a merehandful of schwarzschild radii of the black hole. we have found that a small(10-schwarzschild-radii) magnetized accretion torus can not only account forthe spectral bump via thermal synchrotron processes, but that it can alsoreproduce the corresponding polarimetric results. in addition, the quiescentx-ray emission appears to be associated with synchrotron self-comptonization,while x-ray flares detected from sgr a* may be induced by a sudden enhancementof accretion through this torus. this picture predicts correlations among themm, ir, and x-ray flux densities, that appear to be consistent with recentmulti-wavelength observations. further evidence for such a torus in sgr a* isprovided by its radio variability. recent monitoring of sgr a* at cm and mmwavelengths suggests for a spectral break at 3 mm during cm/sub-mm flares.radio emission from sgr a* is intriguing since it is circularly polarizedthough no linear polarization was ever detected. we first proved that theemission must be due to nonthermal process should the flow be bounded. it isthen suggested that the nonthermal electrons are energized very close to theblack hole.

astro-ph;0603136	a testable the stochastic acceleration model for flares in sagittarius  a*	the near-ir and x-ray flares in sagittarius a* are believed to be produced byrelativistic electrons via synchrotron and synchrotron self-comptonization,respectively. these electrons are likely energized by turbulent plasma wavesthrough second-order fermi acceleration that, in combination with the radiativecooling processes, produces a relativistic maxwellian distribution in thesteady state. this model has four principal parameters, namely the magneticfield b, the electron density n and temperature \gamma_c mec2, and the size ofthe flare region r. in the context of stochastic acceleration, the quantitiesrn^1/2b and \gamma_crn should remain nearly constant in time. therefore,simultaneous spectroscopic observations in the nir and x-ray bands can readilytest the model, which, if proven to be valid, may be used to determine theevolution of the plasma properties during an eruptive event with spectroscopicobservations in either band or simultaneous flux density measurements in bothbands. the formulae can be applied to other isolated or confined systems, whereelectrons are accelerated to relativistic energies by plasma wave turbulenceand produce most of the emission via synchrotron processes.

astro-ph;0603137	stochastic acceleration in the galactic center hess source	stochastic acceleration of electrons interacting resonantly with a turbulentmagnetic field in a small accretion torus appears to be the likely mechanismresponsible for much of sagittarius a*'s millimeter and shorter wavelengthspectrum. the longer wavelength radiation is produced at larger radii byelectrons either diffusing from smaller scales or accelerated in situ. animportant prediction of this model is the ejection of a significant flux ofrelativistic protons from a magnetic-field-dominated acceleration site into thewind-shocked medium surrounding the black hole. recently, several air cerenkovtelescopes, notably hess, have detected tev emission from the galactic center,with characteristics hinting at a p-p-induced pion decay process for the\gamma-ray emission. given (1) the size of this acceleration region measured inthe radio band and (2) the wind-injected ism mapped with chandra using thediffuse x-rays, it is feasible to test the idea that protons accelerated within\~20 schwarzschild radii of the black hole produce the tev emission fartherout. we show a fraction of tev protons scattering about once within ~3 pc ofsagittarius a* and the proton power (~10^37 erg s^-1) produced in concert withthe 7 mm radio emission matches the tev luminosity well. this model explainswhy the tev source does not vary on a timescale of a year or less. the particlecascade generated by the p-p scatterings also produces bremsstrahlung, inversecompton, and synchrotron emission at longer wavelengths from secondaryparticles. we compare these with current measurements and demonstrate thatglast will detect this source during its one-year all-sky survey.

astro-ph;9306017	a self-consistent model for the long-term gamma-ray spectral variability  of cygnus x-1	the long-term transitions of the black hole candidate cygnus x-1 (between thestates gamma_1, gamma_2, and gamma_3) include the occasional appearance of astrong ~ mev bump (gamma_1), whose strength appears to be anti-correlated withthe continuum flux (~ 400 kev) due to the compton upscattering of cold diskphotons by the inner, hot corona. we develop a self-consistent disk picturethat accounts naturally for these transitions and their corresponding spectralvariations. we argue that the bump is due to the self-comptonization ofbremsstrahlung photons emitted predominantly near the plane of the coronaitself. our results suggest that a decrease by a factor of approx 2 in theviscosity parameter alpha is responsible for quenching this bump and drivingthe system to the gamma_2 state, whereas a transition from gamma_2 to gamma_3appears to be induced by an increase of about 25 % in the accretion rate mdot.in view of the fact that most of the transitions observed in this source seemto be of the gamma_2 to gamma_3 variety, we conclude that much of the long termgamma-ray spectral variability in cygnus x-1 is due to these small fluctuationsin mdot. the unusual appearance of the gamma_1 state apparently reflects achange in the dissipative processes within the disk.

astro-ph;9709286	x-rays from magnetic flares in cygnus x-1: a unified model with seyfert  galaxies	some recent work has shown that the spectrum of seyfert 1 galaxies is verysimilar to that of several galactic black hole candidates (gbhcs) in their hardstate. however, the smallness of the observed reflection component in cygnusx-1, in addition to other constraints, seem to rule out the two-phase model(otherwise successful in the case of seyfert galaxies) for gbhcs. here, we showthat the latter conclusion is based on a number of key assumptions thatprobably are not valid when the overlying corona is patchy, e.g., when it iscomprised of localized magnetic flares above the disk. we show that in gbhcsthe energy deposited by the x-rays cannot be re-radiated fast enough tomaintain equilibrium, unless the x-ray skin heats up to the comptontemperature, at which point the gas is mostly ionized. this leads to asubstantially reduced cooling rate for the active regions due to thecorrespondingly smaller number of re-injected low-energy photons. we model thiseffect by introducing a transition layer situated between the corona and thecold disk, and find that the resulting spectrum is harder than that obtainedwith the standard (and unrealistic) two-phase model. we apply this model tocygnus x-1 and show that it can account for its observed spectrum. thisanalysis therefore seems to provide a consistentpicture for both seyfertgalaxies and gbhcs within the same framework, with differences arising due tothe changing physical conditionsin the two categories of sources, rather thandue to an ad hoc variation of the model parameters.

astro-ph;9710215	magnetic flares and state transitions in galactic black hole and neutron  star systems	we here examine the conditions of the two-phase disk model under whichmagnetic flares arise above the cold accretion disk due to magnetic buoyancyand produce x-rays via comptonization of the disk's soft radiation. we findthat the disk's ability to produce strong magnetic flares is substantiallydiminished in its radiation dominated regions due to the diffusion of radiationinto the magnetic flux tubes. using a simplified, yet physicallyself-consistent, model that takes this effect into account, we show that thehard x-ray spectrum of some gbhcs can be explained as the x-ray emission bymagnetic flares only when the disk's bolometric luminosity is a relativelysmall fraction ($\sim$ 5%) of the eddington value, $l_{edd}$. further, wecompute the hard ($20-200$ kev) and soft ($1-20$ kev) x-ray power as a functionof the disk's luminosity, and find an excellent agreement with the availabledata for gbhc transient and persistent sources. we conclude that the observedhigh-energy spectrum of stellar-sized accretion disk systems can be explainedby comptonization of the disk's soft radiation by the hot gas trapped insidethe magnetic flares when the luminosity falls in the range $\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}\times l_{edd}$. for higher luminosities, another emissionmechanism must be at work. for lower luminosities, the x-ray emissivity maystill be dominated by magnetic flares, but this process is more likely to bethermal or non-thermal bremstrahlung, so that the x-ray spectrum below $\sim10^{-3}l_{edd}$ may be quite distinct from the typical hard spectrum for higherluminosities.

astro-ph;9806195	stellar gas flows into a dark cluster potential at the galactic center	the evidence for the presence of a concentration of dark matter at thegalactic center is now very compelling. there is no question that the stellarand gas kinematics within 0.01 pc is dominated by under-luminous matter in theform of either a massive black hole, a highly condensed distribution of stellarremnants, or a more exotic source of gravity. the unique, compact radio sourcesgr a* appears to be coincident with the center of this region, but its size(less than 3x10^14 cm at lambda=1.35cm) is still significantly smaller than thecurrent limiting volume enclosing this mass. sgr a* may be the black hole, ifthe dark matter distribution is point-like. if not, we are left with a puzzleregarding its nature, and a question of why this source should be so unique andlie only at the galactic center. here, we examine an alternative to the blackhole paradigm---that the gravitating matter is a condensed cluster of stellarremnants---and study the properties of the galactic center wind flowing throughthis region. some of this gas is trapped in the cluster potential, and we studyin detail whether this hot, magnetized gas is in the proper physical state toproduce sgr a*'s spectrum. we find that at least for the galactic centerenvironment, the temperature of the trapped gas never attains the valuerequired for significant ghz emission. in addition, continuum (mostlybremsstrahlung) emission at higher frequencies is below the currentmeasurements and upper limits for this source. we conclude that the clusterpotential is too shallow for the trapped galactic center wind to account forsgr a*'s spectrum, which instead appears to be produced only within anenvironment that has a steep-gradient potential like that generated by a blackhole.

astro-ph;9806324	a model of the egret source at the galactic center: inverse compton  scattering within sgr a east and its halo	continuum low-frequency radio observations of the galactic center reveal thepresence of two prominent radio sources, sgr a east and its surrounding halo,containing non-thermal particle distributions with power-law indices around2.5-3.3 and 2.4, respectively. the central 1-2 pc region is also a source ofintense (stellar) uv and (dust-reprocessed) far-ir radiation that bathes theseextended synchrotron-emitting structures. a recent detection of gamma-rays(2egj1746-2852) from within around 1 degree of the galactic center by egretonboard the compton gro shows that the emission from this environment extendsto very high energies.  we suggest that inverse compton scatterings between the power-law electronsinferred from the radio properties of sgr a east and its halo, and the uv andir photons from the nucleus, may account for the possibly diffuse gamma-raysource as well. we show that both particle distributions may be contributing tothe gamma-ray emission, though their relevant strength depends on the actualphysical properties (such as the magnetic field intensity) in each source. ifthis picture is correct, the high-energy source at the galactic center isextended over several arcminutes, which can be tested with thenext generationof gamma-ray and hard x-ray missions.

astro-ph;9909411	the role of magnetic field dissipation in the black hole candidate sgr  a*	the compact, nonthermal radio source sgr a* at the galactic center appears tobe coincident with a 2.6 million solar mass point-like object. its energysource may be the release of gravitational energy as gas from the interstellarmedium descends into its potential well. simple attempts at calculating thespectrum and flux based on this picture have come close to the observations,yet have had difficulty in accounting for the low efficiency in this source.there now appear to be two reasons for this low conversion rate: (1) the plasmaseparates into two temperatures, with the protons attaining a significantlyhigher temperature than that of the radiating electrons, and (2) the magneticfield, b, is sub-equipartition, which reduces the magnetic bremsstrahlungemissivity, and therefore the overall power of sgr a*. we investigate thelatter with improvement over what has been attempted before: rather thancalculating b based on a presumed model, we instead infer its distribution withradius empirically with the requirement that the resulting spectrum matches theobservations. our ansatz for b(r) is motivated in part by earlier calculationsof the expected magnetic dissipation rate due to reconnection in a compressedflow. we find reasonable agreement with the observed spectrum of sgr a* as longas its distribution consists of 3 primary components: an outer equipartitionfield, a roughly constant field at intermediate radii (~1000 schwarzschildradii), and an inner dynamo (more or less within the last stable orbit for anon-rotating black hole) which increases b to about 100 gauss. the lattercomponent accounts for the observed sub-millimiter hump in this source.
