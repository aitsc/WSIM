0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

1006.2134	eight gamma-ray pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of fermi  lat data	we report the discovery of eight gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequencysearches using the lat, onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. five ofthe eight pulsars are young (tau_c&lt;100 kyr), energetic (edot&gt;10^36 erg/s), andlocated within the galactic plane (|b|&lt;3 deg). the remaining three are older,less energetic, and located off the plane. five pulsars are associated withsources included in the lat bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, psrj1413-6205, is clearly associated with an egret source. psr j1023-5746 has thesmallest characteristic age (tau_c=4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic(edot=1.1e37 erg/s) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blindsearches. psrs j1957+5033 and j2055+25 have the largest characteristic ages(tau_c~1 myr) and are the least energetic (edot~5e33 erg/s) of thenewly-discovered pulsars. we present the timing models, light curves, anddetailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. we used recent xmmobservations to identify the counterpart of psr j2055+25 as xmmuj205549.4+253959. in addition, publicly available archival chandra x-ray dataallowed us to identify the likely counterpart of psr j1023-5746 as a faint,highly absorbed source, cxou j102302.8-574606. the large x-ray absorptionindicates that this could be among the most distant gamma-ray pulsars detectedso far. psr j1023-5746 is positionally coincident with the tev source hessj1023-575, located near the young stellar cluster westerlund 2, while psrj1954+2836 is coincident with a 4.3 sigma excess reported by milagro at amedian energy of 35 tev. deep radio follow-up observations of the eight pulsarsresulted in no detections of pulsations and upper limits comparable to thefaintest known radio pulsars, indicating that these can be included among thegrowing population of radio-quiet pulsars in our galaxy being uncovered by thelat, and currently numbering more than 20.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1102.0648	discovery of millisecond pulsars in radio searches of southern fermi lat  sources	using the parkes radio telescope we have carried out deep observations ofeleven unassociated gamma-ray sources. periodicity searches of these data havediscovered two millisecond pulsars, psr j1103-5403 (1fgl j1103.9-5355) and psrj2241-5236 (1fgl j2241.9-5236), and a long period pulsar, psr j1604-44 (1fglj1604.7-4443). in addition we searched for but did not detect any radiopulsations from six gammaray pulsars discovered by the fermi satellite to alevel of - 0.04 mjy (for pulsars with a 10% duty cycle). timing of themillisecond pulsar psr j1103-5403 has shown that its position is 9' from thecentroid of the gamma-ray source. since these observations were carried out,independent evidence has shown that 1fgl j1103.9-5355 is associated with theflat spectrum radio source pks 1101-536. it appears certain that the pulsar isnot associated with the gamma-ray source, despite the seemingly low probabilityof a chance detection of a radio millisecond pulsar. we consider that psrj1604-44 is a chance discovery of a weak, long period pulsar and is unlikely tobe associated with 1fgl j1604.7-4443. psr j2241-5236 has a spin period of 2.2ms and orbits a very low mass companion with a 3.5 hour orbital period. therelatively high flux density and low dispersion measure of psr j2241-5236 makesit an excellent candidate for high precision timing experiments. the gamma-raysof 1fgl j2241.9-5236 have a spectrum that is well modelled by a power law withexponential cutoff, and phasebinning with the radio ephemeris results in amulti-peaked gamma-ray pulse profile. observations with chandra have identifieda coincident x-ray source within 0.1" of the position of the pulsar obtained byradio timing

1208.1273	four highly dispersed millisecond pulsars discovered in the arecibo  palfa galactic plane survey	we present the discovery and phase-coherent timing of four highly dispersedmillisecond pulsars (msps) from the arecibo palfa galactic plane survey: psrsj1844+0115, j1850+0124, j1900+0308, and j1944+2236. three of the four pulsarsare in binary systems with low-mass companions, which are most likely whitedwarfs, and which have orbital periods on the order of days. the fourth pulsaris isolated. all four pulsars have large dispersion measures (dm &gt; 100 pccm-3), are distant (&gt; 3.4 kpc), faint at 1.4 ghz (&lt; 0.2 mjy), and are fullyrecycled (with spin periods p between 3.5 and 4.9 ms). the three binaries alsohave very small orbital eccentricities, as expected for tidally circularized,fully recycled systems with low-mass companions. these four pulsars have dm/pratios that are among the highest values for field msps in the galaxy. thesediscoveries bring the total number of confirmed msps from the palfa survey tofifteen. the discovery of these msps illustrates the power of palfa for findingweak, distant msps at low-galactic latitudes. this is important for accurateestimates of the galactic msp population and for the number of msps that thesquare kilometer array can be expected to detect.

1212.4360	six millisecond pulsars detected by the fermi large area telescope and  the radio/gamma-ray connection of millisecond pulsars	we report on the discovery of gamma-ray pulsations from five millisecondpulsars (msps) using the fermi large area telescope (lat) and timingephemerides provided by various radio observatories. we also presentconfirmation of the gamma-ray pulsations from a sixth source, psr j2051-0827.five of these six msps are in binary systems: psrs j1713+0747, j1741+1351,j1600-3053 and the two black widow binary pulsars psrs j0610-2100 and2051-0827. the only isolated msp is the nearby psr j1024-0719, which is alsoknown to emit x-rays. we present x-ray observations in the direction of psrsj1600-3053 and j2051-0827. while the latter is firmly detected, we an only giveupper limits for the x-ray flux of the former. there are no dedicated x-rayobservations available for the other 3 objects.  the msps mentioned above, together with most of the msps detected by fermi,are used to put together a sample of 30 gamma-ray msps which is used to studythe morphology and phase connection of radio and gamma-ray pulse profiles. weshow that msps with pulsed gamma-ray emission which is phase aligned with theradio emission present the steepest radio spectra and the largest magneticfields at the light cylinder among all msps. as well, we also observe a trendtowards very low, or undetectable, radio linear polarisation levels. theseproperties could be attributed to caustic radio emission produced at a range ofdifferent altitudes in the magnetosphere. we note that most of thesecharacteristics are also observed in the crab pulsar, the only other radiopulsar known to exhibit phase-aligned radio and gamma-ray emission.

1301.0359	pulsar searches of fermi unassociated sources with the effelsberg  telescope	using the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope operating at 1.36 ghz, we haveperformed a targeted radio pulsar survey of 289 unassociated gamma-ray sourcesdiscovered by the large area telescope (lat) aboard the fermi satellite andpublished in the 1fgl catalogue (abdo et al., 2010). this survey resulted inthe discovery of millisecond pulsar j1745+1017, which resides in a short-periodbinary system with a low-mass companion, mmin ~ 0.0137 msun, indicative of`black widow' type systems. a two-year timing campaign has produced a refinedradio ephemeris, accurate enough to allow for phase-folding of the lat photons,resulting in the detection of a dual-peaked gamma-ray light-curve, proving thatpsr j1745+1017 is the source responsible for the gamma-ray emission seen in1fgl j1745.5 + 1018 (2fgl j1745.6+1015; nolan et al., 2012). we find thegamma-ray spectrum of psr j1745+1017 to be well modelled by anexponentially-cut-off power law with cut-off energy 3.2 gev and photon index1.6. the observed sources are known to contain a further 10 newly discoveredpulsars which were undetected in this survey. our radio observations of thesesources are discussed and in all cases limiting flux densities are calculated.the reasons behind the seemingly low yield of discoveries are also discussed.

1302.2914	the double pulsar: evidence for neutron star formation without an iron  core-collapse supernova	the double pulsar system psr j0737-3039a/b is a double neutron star binary,with a 2.4-hour orbital period, which has allowed measurement of relativisticorbital perturbations to high precision. the low mass of the second-formedneutron star, as well as the low system eccentricity and proper motion, pointto a different evolutionary scenario compared to most other known doubleneutron star systems. we describe analysis of the pulse profile shape over 6years of observations, and present the resulting constraints on the systemgeometry. we find the recycled pulsar in this system, psr j0737-3039a, to be anear-orthogonal rotator, with an average separation between its spin andmagnetic axes of 90 +/- 11 +/- 5 deg. furthermore, we find a mean 95% upperlimit on the misalignment between its spin and orbital angular momentum axes of3.2 deg, assuming that the observed emission comes from both magnetic poles.this tight constraint lends credence to the idea that the supernova that formedthe second pulsar was relatively symmetric, possibly involving electron-captureonto an o-ne-mg core.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1307.8142	goals, strategies and first discoveries of ao327, the arecibo all-sky  327 mhz drift pulsar survey	we report initial results from ao327, a drift survey for pulsars with thearecibo telescope at 327 mhz. the first phase of ao327 will cover the sky atdeclinations of -1 to 28 degrees, excluding the region within 5 degrees of thegalactic plane, where high scattering and dispersion make low-frequency surveyssub-optimal. we record data from a 57 mhz bandwidth with 1024 channels and 125us sampling time. the 60 s transit time through the ao327 beam means that thesurvey is sensitive to very tight relativistic binaries even with noacceleration searches. to date we have detected 44 known pulsars with periodsranging from 3 ms to 2.21 s and discovered 24 new pulsars. the new discoveriesinclude three millisecond pulsars, three objects with periods of a few tens ofmilliseconds typical of young as well as mildly recycled pulsars, a nuller, anda rotating radio transient. five of the new discoveries are in binary systems.the second phase of ao327 will cover the sky at declinations of 28 to 38degrees. we compare the sensitivity and search volume of ao327 to the greenbank north celestial cap survey and the gbt350 drift survey, both of whichoperate at 350 mhz.

1308.3147	a strong magnetic field around the supermassive black hole at the centre  of the galaxy	the centre of our milky way harbours the closest candidate for a supermassiveblack hole. the source is thought to be powered by radiatively inefficientaccretion of gas from its environment. this form of accretion is a standardmode of energy supply for most galactic nuclei. x-ray measurements have alreadyresolved a tenuous hot gas component from which it can be fed. however, themagnetization of the gas, a crucial parameter determining the structure of theaccretion flow, remains unknown. strong magnetic fields can influence thedynamics of the accretion, remove angular momentum from the infalling gas,expel matter through relativistic jets and lead to the observed synchrotronemission. here we report multi-frequency measurements with several radiotelescopes of a newly discovered pulsar close to the galactic centre and showthat its unusually large faraday rotation indicates a dynamically relevantmagnetic field near the black hole. if this field is accreted down to the eventhorizon it provides enough magnetic flux to explain the observed emission fromthe black hole, from radio to x-rays.

1308.4956	psr j1723-2837: an eclipsing binary radio millisecond pulsar	we present a study of psr j1723-2837, an eclipsing, 1.86 ms millisecondbinary radio pulsar discovered in the parkes multibeam survey. radio timingindicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, alow-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. the eclipsefraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the roche lobe sizeinferred for the companion. the timing behavior is significantly affected byunmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital periodderivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.we have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archivalultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.doppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association withthe pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,corresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 msun and an orbitalinclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar massrange of 1.4-2.0 msun. spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of g for thecompanion and an inferred roche-lobe-filling distance that is consistent withthe distance estimated from radio dispersion. the features of psr j1723-2837indicate that it is likely a "redback" system. unlike the five other galacticredbacks discovered to date, psr j1723-2837 has not been detected as agamma-ray source with fermi. this may be due to an intrinsic spin-downluminosity that is much smaller than the measured value if the unmeasuredcontribution from proper motion is large.

1309.0776	searching for pulsars using image pattern recognition	in this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (ai) program thatidentifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition withdeep neural nets---the pics (pulsar image-based classification system) ai. theai mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferencesby looking for patterns from candidate. the information from each pulsarcandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up tothousands pixel of image data. the ai takes these data from each candidate asits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,the pics ai teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a setof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. the deep neural networksin this ai system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types ofpulsars as well as their harmonic signals. the trained ai's performance hasbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.in this completely independent test, pics ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-relatedcandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. the first non-pulsarcandidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. in otherwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. the performance of thissystem can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. this aisystem has been integrated into the palfa survey pipeline and has discoveredsix new pulsars to date.

1310.5857	timing of a young mildly recycled pulsar with a massive white dwarf  companion	we report on timing observations of the recently discovered binary pulsar psrj1952+2630 using the arecibo observatory. the mildly recycled 20.7-ms pulsar isin a 9.4-hr orbit with a massive, m_wd &gt; 0.93 m_sun, white dwarf (wd)companion. we present, for the first time, a phase-coherent timing solution,with precise spin, astrometric, and keplerian orbital parameters. this showsthat the characteristic age of psr j1952+2630 is 77 myr, younger by one orderof magnitude than any other recycled pulsar-massive wd system. we derive anupper limit on the true age of the system of 50 myr. we investigate theformation of psr j1952+2630 using detailed modelling of the mass-transferprocess from a naked helium star on to the neutron star following acommon-envelope phase (case bb roche-lobe overflow). from our modelling of theprogenitor system, we constrain the accretion efficiency of the neutron star,which suggests a value between 100 and 300% of the eddington accretion limit.we present numerical models of the chemical structure of a possibleoxygen-neon-magnesium wd companion. furthermore, we calculate the past and thefuture spin evolution of psr j1952+2630, until the system merges in about 3.4gyr due to gravitational wave emission. although we detect no relativisticeffects in our timing analysis we show that several such effects will becomemeasurable with continued observations over the next 10 years; thus psrj1952+2630 has potential as a testbed for gravitational theories.

1404.1120	interstellar scintillation of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039	we report here a series of observations of the interstellar scintillation(iss) of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039 over the course of 18 months. as inearlier work (coles et al., 2005) the basic phenomenon is the variation in theiss caused by the changing transverse velocities of each pulsar, the ionizedinterstellar medium (iism), and the earth. the transverse velocity of thebinary system can be determined both by vlbi and timing observations. theorbital velocity and inclination is almost completely determined from timingobservations, but the direction of the orbital angular momentum is not known.since the earth's velocity is known, and can be compared with the orbitalvelocity by its effect on the timescale of the iss, we can determine theorientation $\omega$ of the pulsar orbit with respect to equatorial coordinates($\omega = 65\pm2$ deg). we also resolve the ambiguity ($i= 88.7$ or $91.3$deg) in the inclination of the orbit deduced from the measured shapiro delay byour estimate $i=88.1\pm0.5$ deg. this relies on analysis of the iss over bothfrequency and time and provides a model for the location, anisotropy,turbulence level and transverse phase gradient of the iism. we find that theiism can be well-modeled during each observation, typically of a few orbitalperiods, but its turbulence level and mean velocity vary significantly over the18 months.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1407.3827	measuring pulse times of arrival from broadband pulsar observations	in recent years, instrumentation enabling pulsar observations withunprecedentedly high fractional bandwidth has been under development which canbe used to substantially improve the precision of pulsar timing experiments.the traditional template-matching method used to calculate pulsetimes-of-arrival (toas), may not function effectively on these broadband datadue to a variety of effects such as diffractive scintillation in theinterstellar medium, profile variation as a function of frequency, dispersionmeasure (dm) evolution and so forth. in this paper, we describe the channeliseddiscrete fourier transform method that can greatly mitigate the influence ofthe aforementioned effects when measuring toas from broadband timing data. themethod is tested on simulated data, and its potential in improving timingprecision is shown. we further apply the method to psr j1909$-$3744 datacollected at the nan\c{c}ay radio telescope with the nan\c{c}ay ultimate pulsarprocessing instrument. we demonstrate a removal of systematics due to thescintillation effect as well as improvement on toa measurement uncertainties.our method also determines temporal variations in dispersion measure, which areconsistent with multi-channel timing approaches used earlier.

1501.00086	pulsars in globular clusters with the ska	globular clusters are highly efficient radio pulsar factories. these pulsarscan be used as precision probes of the clusters' structure, gas content,magnetic field, and formation history; some of them are also highly interestingin their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios aswell as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity. deep searches withska1-mid and ska1-low will plausibly double to triple the known population.such searches will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be doneduring early commissioning of the telescope - before an all-sky pulsar surveyusing hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. with ska2 it willbe possible to observe most of the active radio pulsars within a large fractionof the galactic globular clusters, an estimated population of 600 - 3700observable pulsars (those beamed towards us). this rivals the total populationof millisecond pulsars that can be found in the galactic field; fullycharacterizing it will provide the best-possible physical laboratories as wellas a rich dynamical history of the galactic globular cluster system.

1504.02294	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iv. mock spectrometer data analysis,  survey sensitivity, and the discovery of 41 pulsars	the on-going palfa survey at the arecibo observatory began in 2004 and issearching for radio pulsars in the galactic plane at 1.4 ghz. observationssince 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than werepreviously employed in this survey. a new data reduction pipeline has been inplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,searches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, aswell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selectionheuristics. this pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8millisecond pulsars (msps; p &lt; 10 ms), bringing the palfa survey's discoverytotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 msps, and one fast radio burst (frb). thepipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsarsincluding 60 found in palfa data by re-analyzing observations previouslysearched by other pipelines. a comprehensive description of the surveysensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has beendetermined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters andamplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recoveredwith the data reduction pipeline. we have confirmed that the palfa surveyachieves the sensitivity to msps predicted by theoretical models. however, wealso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly usedthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods p &gt;= 100 ms thatgradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for p &gt; 4 s at dm &lt; 150 pc/cc.this degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. wefind that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to bedetected in the absence of red noise. this reduced sensitivity could haveimplications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the galaxy.

1504.03684	einstein@home discovery of a palfa millisecond pulsar in an eccentric  binary orbit	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar (msp) psr j1950+2414($p=4.3$ ms) in a binary system with an eccentric ($e=0.08$) 22-day orbit inpulsar alfa survey observations with the arecibo telescope. its companion starhas a median mass of 0.3 $m_\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. fullyrecycled msps like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by masstransfer from a companion star. this process should circularize the orbit, asis observed for the vast majority of binary msps, which predominantly haveorbital eccentricities $e &lt; 0.001$. however, four recently discovered binarymsps have orbits with $0.027 &lt; e &lt; 0.44$; psr j1950+2414 is the fifth suchsystem to be discovered. the upper limits for its intrinsic spin periodderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to thoseof the general msp population. the large eccentricities are incompatible withthe predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happenedduring their evolution. proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of thepulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in anexchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationallydelayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. we compare theproperties of all five known eccentric msps with the predictions of theseformation channels. future measurements of the masses and proper motion mightallow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.

1509.01397	optical identification of he white dwarfs orbiting four millisecond  pulsars in the globular cluster 47 tucanae	we used ultra-deep uv observations obtained with the hubble space telescopeto search for optical companions to binary millisecond pulsars (msps) in theglobular cluster 47 tucanae. we identified four new counterparts (to msps47tucq, 47tucs, 47tuct and 47tucy) and confirmed those already known (to msps47tucu and 47tucw). in the color magnitude diagram, the detected companions arelocated in a region between the main sequence and the co white dwarf coolingsequences, consistent with the cooling tracks of he white dwarfs of massbetween 0.15 msun and 0.20 msun. for each identified companion, mass, coolingage, temperature and pulsar mass (as a function of the inclination angle) havebeen derived and discussed. for 47tucu we also found that the past accretionhistory likely proceeded in a sub-eddington rate. the companion to the redback47tucw is confirmed to be a non degenerate star, with properties particularlysimilar to those observed for black widow systems. two stars have beenidentified within the 2-sigma astrometric uncertainty from the radio positionsof 47tuch and 47tuci, but the available data prevent us from firmly assessingwhether they are the true companions of these two msps.

1509.08805	pulsar j0453+1559: a double neutron star system with a large mass  asymmetry	to understand the nature of supernovae and neutron star (ns) formation, aswell as binary stellar evolution and their interactions, it is important toprobe the distribution of ns masses. until now, all double ns (dns) systemshave been measured to have a mass ratio close to unity (q $\geq$ 0.91). here wereport the measurement of the individual masses of the 4.07-day binary pulsarj0453+1559 from measurements of the rate of advance of periastron and shapirodelay: the mass of the pulsar is 1.559(5) $m_{\odot}$ and that of its companionis 1.174(4) $m_{\odot}$; q = 0.75. if this companion is also a neutron star(ns), as indicated by the orbital eccentricity of the system (e=0.11), then itsmass is the smallest precisely measured for any such object. the pulsar has aspin period of 45.7 ms and a spin derivative of 1.8616(7) x$10^-19$; from thesewe derive a characteristic age of ~ 4.1 x $10^9$ years and a magnetic field of~ 2.9 x $10^9$ g,i.e, this pulsar was mildly recycled by accretion of matterfrom the progenitor of the companion star. this suggests that it was formedwith (very approximately) its current mass. thus nss form with a wide range ofmasses, which is important for understanding their formation in supernovae. itis also important for the search for gravitational waves released during ans-ns merger: it is now evident that we should not assume all dns systems aresymmetric.

0705.3269	age constraints in the double pulsar system j0737-3039	we investigate the age constraints that can be placed on the double pulsarsystem using models for the spin-down of the first-born 22.7-ms pulsar a andthe 2.77-s pulsar b with characteristic ages of 210 and 50 myr respectively.standard models assuming dipolar spin-down of both pulsars suggest that thetime since the formation of b is ~50 myr, i.e. close to b's characteristic age.however, adopting models which account for the impact of a's relativistic windon b's spin-down we find that the formation of b took place either 80 or 180myr ago, depending the interaction mechanism. formation 80 myr ago, closer tob's characteristic age, would result in the contribution from j0737-3039 to theinferred coalescence rates for double neutron star binaries increasing by 40%.the 180 myr age is closer to a's characteristic age and would be consistentwith the most recent estimates of the coalescence rate. the new age constraintsdo not significantly impact recent estimates of the kick velocity, tilt anglebetween pre and post-supernova orbital planes or pre-supernova mass of b'sprogenitor.

astro-ph;0609417	tests of general relativity from timing the double pulsar	the double pulsar system, psr j0737-3039a/b, is unique in that both neutronstars are detectable as radio pulsars. this, combined with significantly highermean orbital velocities and accelerations when compared to other binarypulsars, suggested that the system would become the best available testbed forgeneral relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-fieldregime. here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests ofgeneral relativity. use of the theory-independent mass ratio of the two starsmakes these tests uniquely different from earlier studies. by measuringrelativistic corrections to the keplerian description of the orbital motion, wefind that the ``post-keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted byeinstein's theory of general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, themost precise test yet obtained. we also show that the transverse velocity ofthe system's center of mass is extremely small. combined with the system'slocation near the sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitationaltheories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar-systemtests. it also implies that the second-born pulsar may have formed differentlyto the usually assumed core-collapse of a helium star.
