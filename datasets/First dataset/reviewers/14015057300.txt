84926649885	High performance traffic sign recognition based on sparse representation and SVM classification	The high variability of sign appearance in uncontrolled environments has made the detection and classification of road signs a challenging problem in computer vision. In this paper, an occlusion-robust traffic sign recognition method is proposed. To achieve occlusion-robust detection, we design a cascaded tree detector based on the MN-LBP features and a cascaded tree. For occlusion-robust traffic sign classification, the occlusion-robust dictionaries for sparse representation of multiclass traffic signs are designed. Then, the results of sparse representation are classified with SVM method. The classification results of SVM are more robust than that of the sparse representation classification (SRC) which directly uses judgment. The experiments on test set show that the proposed method is more robust and accurate to detect signs with partial occlusion than the methods based on SVM or SRC.

84867041554	Background model combining Gauss Model with Local Binary Pattern feature	The detection of moving objects using background subtraction is the basic of object recognition and tracking, and it is a critical task for many applications such as remote sensing, video surveillance and traffic monitoring. However, background subtraction is extremely sensitive to dynamic scene changes due to lighting and extraneous events, especially when the dynamic texture such as swaying trees and waving water surface is existed. To handle this circumstance, this paper proposes a reliable background-modeling algorithm, which combines the Gauss Mixture Model (GMM) of pixel level with Local Binary Pattern (LBP) of local area. After modeling each pixel using GMM, we block the reference image with 8*8 windows, and calculate LBP histogram of each block. A pixel in new frames is judged as foreground not only by comparing intensity with background gauss models, but also by comparing its block LBP histogram with relevant background block. Experiment results show this algorithm is efficient than the classical algorithms.

By the Experiments analysis, it showed that the proposed method is working well in the eye localization system and had better performance than traditional projection methods.

84863519880	Improved Gaussian skin color model and its application in face detection	To solve the problem that traditional Gaussian skin color model is not very robust in skin segmentation under different skin colors and different illuminations, an improved Gaussian skin color model is proposed. The parameters of this proposed model can adapt to different faces. And this model combines Gaussian skin color model and gray level distribution through weighting multiplication. Then, a new face detection method based on the skin color model and Adaboost algorithm is proposed to detect faces. Experiments on FERET (facial recognition technology database), LFW (labeled faces in the wild), GTFD (Georgia Tech face database) and dataset of scene images including many faces demonstrate that the face skin color extraction rate of this proposed model is enhanced by 27.1% compared with the performance of traditional Gaussian model and enhanced by 5.5% compared with the performance of Adaboost algorithm.

84872807722	Scheduling strategy for network-based multi-camera relay tracking in large scene	In a video surveillance network system constructed by multi-cameras, when a target accesses to one camera's FOV(field of vision) from another's, it is a key problem in this system to schedule the cameras correctly and to achieve reliable target handoff. In this paper, we propose a novel target handoff algorithm and scheduling strategy for network-based multi-camera in a target relay tracking system. In the algorithm, the moment and the location of target handoff are determined by real-time background estimation, and the rapid scheduling of relay camera is achieved using the scheduling algorithm based on multi-camera network topology model formed through network connection between cameras in large and complex scene. The target features are passed to the relay camera which locating and tracking the target successively. Experimental results show relay camera scheduling and target handoff can be accomplished rapidly and accurately, and very good results have been obtained. © 2013 Binary Information Press.

84874027408	Fast Face Detection Algorithm Based on Improved Skin-Color Model	Automatic face recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in fields of computer vision and pattern recognition, and face detection is the first critical step in full automatic face recognition system. The skin-color feature is an effective feature, but this feature is interfered easily. This paper proposes a method of face detection from a picture based on an improved skin-color model. Firstly, use an improved "reference white" method to remove the interference of non-skin-color region, and then design color- classifier based on statistic large number of skin-color pixels and detect each pixel in color picture is skin-color or non-skin-color through the color-classifier; finally, detect face on the candidate regions and remove the non-face regions, and then locate the face regions. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively detect face with skin-color interference under complex background. © 2012 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.

84884490304	Eye detection and pupil location algorithm based on Gabor filters and K-medoid algorithm	Eye detection is an essential initial step in many face processing applications, such as face tracking, expression analysis and face recognition. In the process of eye detection, in order to overcome the factors of expression changes, illumination changes and glasses' shelters, the eye detection method based on Gabor filters and K-medoid algorithm is proposed. There are mainly three steps to detect eyes and locate pupils. Initially, the proposed method highlights the eyes' position with different scale Gabor filters, which is robust to the changes of eye, occlusion and illumination changes. It then combines Gabor filter method with the improved K-medoid algorithm to conduct cluster analysis to detect eyes' position. Since the position located by K-medoid algorithm is not accurate enough, the last pupil locating algorithm is designed on the location method that combines gray level distribution with entropy function. Experiments with BioID database and FERET color database are performed to evaluate this method. The experimental results demonstrate the consistent robustness and efficiency of the proposed method, in which the detection rate is 97.8% in all the 3470 images and the pupil location rate is 95.5% in the case of low error threshold of 0.15.

84885055889	Particle filter-based object tracking and handover in disjoint view multi-cameras	In intelligent video surveillance, multiple cameras, even a distributed network of video sensors, have to be employed to monitor activities over a complex area nowadays. Hence, the continuous object tracking across multiple cameras and object handover between adjacent cameras is urgently needed, in which many appearance cues and spatial-temporal information can be employed. This paper fuses the spatial-temporal cues with appearance cues into a particle filter to handle the camera handover with multiple cameras having non-overlapping view. The spatial-temporal cues, including source and sink regions, their transition probabilities, and transition time among adjacent regions, are learned offline. Then a spatial-temporal progressive matching scheme using particle filter is proposed to deal with camera handover among adjacent cameras. In particle filter matching course, the commonly used appearance cue, i.e. the histogram in HSV color space is used. Once an object enters into sink region, we first continuously scatter particles in source regions related to this sink region according spatial-temporal information until the object emergence detected, and secondly, based on the particle weights of every source region, adjust their particle numbers till the camera handover is successfully completed. Encouraging experiment results show the efficiency of this scheme. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84885086022	Target tracking algorithm based on multi-subblock feature matching	Real-time target tracking is an important subject in modern intelligent surveillance and security defense systems. However, due to the natural scene's complexity and variability, the tracking becomes complex and difficult especially when the target is occluded in complex background. This paper proposes a tracking algorithm of moving target based on adaptive blocking and feature correlation matching. We compute target's grayscale first, and judge the target's grayscale attribute. Then according to it, we choose a more suitable algorithm to track moving target from edge correlation matching algorithm and grayscale correlation matching algorithm based on multi-subblock. To edge matching algorithm, target's displacement in two successive frames is determined by optimal matching of current unoccluded edge with real-time updated target template. For grayscale correlation matching based on multi-subblocks, the algorithm first estimates occluded region accurately by subblocks with distinct feature, and then tracks the target by residual unoccluded subblocks to participate in grayscale correlation matching. The experimental results of our tracking system show that the algorithm is effective for tracking moving targets. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.

84886256931	Rapid traffic sign detection and classification using categories-first-assigned tree	Traffic sign recognition (TSR) is an example of a hard multiclass classification problem. The high variability of sign appearance in uncontrolled environments has made the detection and classification of road signs a challenging problem in computer vision. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called Categories-First-Assigned Tree (CFA-Tree), for the detection and classification problem of traffic signs. Unlike the previous TSR works with two mainly tasks: detection task and classification task, this work integrate these two tasks into one with the proposed CFA-Tree. In the training process of CFA-Tree, some extended Haar-like features are designed for TSR problem, which largely enhance the performance of CFA-Tree. The experiments show this novel system has high accuracy about 93.5% in TSR problem and achieves a realtime speed of about 6-8 fps on common video sequences. © 2013 Binary Information Press.

84886301237	PCRT: Parallel competitive robust tracking	Robust target tracking is always one of the challenging problems in computer vision, due to intrinsic appearance variations and extrinsic factors in nature scenes. Since a single tracker can not handle all the challenges in tracking, we propose a parallel competitive robust tracking that uses the competition scheme to combine a novel adaptive fragment-based tracker and an online boosting tracker in this paper. When tracking an object, the two component trackers are parallel implementing and their results are evaluated by the competition unit. The winner is considered as final result and used to update the trackers. Experimental results demonstrate this method can track the target accurately and robustly, and has superior performance than state-of-the-art trackers. © 2013 Binary Information Press.

84891950289	Object tracking based on sparse representation of gradient feature	As traditional compressive sensing tracking algorithm will produce tracking errors in circumastances when illumination has dramatic change or there exists a object similar to the target in background, this paper proposes a sparse representation object tracking algorithm by taking the histogram of gradient feature to replace the generalized Haar feature. The algorithm uses the histogram of gradient feature as an original feature firstly, and gets the sparse representation of object feature subspace by using compressive sensing theory. In the subsequent frames, the naive Bayes classifier is used to search the target location and the classifier is online updated finally. As the histogram of gradient feature can represent the target more stably, this algorithm is more robust than original compressive tracking algorithm. Furthermore, the integral histogram is adapted to effectively reduce computational load when the gradient feature is computed. Experiments on different videos show that the tracking algorithm can reach the tracking rate of 10 frames per second in an experimental environment of Intel Core2 2. 93 GHz, matlab R2010a, image size 320×240, and it achieves stable tracking in some special conditions as mentioned above.

84894599881	Traffic sign detection based on Gaussian color model and SVM	Aiming at the characteristics of Chinese traffic signs, in this paper, a fast traffic sign detection algorithm based on Gaussian color model and machine learning is proposed. This algorithm solves the problem of low detection rate when only color model or only classifier method is used in traffic sign detection process. Firstly, after the histogram correction, the Gaussian color model method is used to segment the image. Secondly, the morphology processing is utilized on the segmented image to extract the candidate traffic signs. Finally, the HOG descriptor and SVM are combined to train the classifier, which is used to detect the traffic sign accurately. Experiment results show that this algorithm can effectively improve the traffic sign detection accuracy, decrease the error detection rate, has strong stability and accuracy for the traffic sign detection in lighting, rotating and partially occlusion, and also meets the real time requirement.

84898448029	Chinese license plate recognition based on human vision attention mechanism	License plate recognition (LPR) is one of the most important elements affecting intelligent transportation systems. A number of LPR techniques have been proposed. Humans are good target recognition systems. In other words, humans easily recognize common objects. In this paper, the researchers present a novel method of recognizing Chinese license plates. The method is based on the Human Vision Attention Mechanism (HVAM) and uses Chinese license plates as the targets. The research consists of three stages. The first stage involved finding and identifying license plates in videos of moving vehicles. The second stage separated each license plate into the seven characters. In the third stage, the character recognizer extracted some salient features of Chinese characters and used a multi-stage classifier to recognize each character on the license plate. In the experiment locating license plates, 1176 images taken from various scenes and conditions were employed. The method failed to identify the license plates in only 27 of the images; resulting in a license plate location rate of success of 97.7%. In the experiment for identifying license characters, 1149 images were used, from which license plates had been successfully located. The method failed to identify the characters in 45 of these images giving a success rate of 96.1%. Combining the above two rates, the overall rate of success for our LPR is 93.9%. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84900502183	Color face detection based on improved reference white and sparse network of winnows	Extraction of facial skin color is vulnerable to illumination variation. In order to solve such a problem, this paper proposes an improved colored face detection method that combines improved reference white and sparse network of winnows (SNoW). Firstly, before the face skin color extraction from the image with large illumination variation, the reference white and histogram equalization are fused in HSV color space so as to reduce the color deviation caused by illumination variation. Then, the extraction of the candidate human face regions can be achieved from the reference white light compensation results using skin color model. Finally, the sparse network model method is used to calculate the features in face segmentation blocks and classifies human faces correctly. Experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve good skin color extraction effect and accurate face detection and localization in the complex scene with illumination variations, and also meets the requirement of real-time performance.

84902169123	Modelling arterial pressure waveforms using Gaussian functions and two-stage particle swarm optimizer	Changes of arterial pressure waveform characteristics have been accepted as risk indicators of cardiovascular diseases. Waveform modelling using Gaussian functions has been used to decompose arterial pressure pulses into different numbers of subwaves and hence quantify waveform characteristics. However, the fitting accuracy and computation efficiency of current modelling approaches need to be improved. This study aimed to develop a novel two-stage particle swarm optimizer (TSPSO) to determine optimal parameters of Gaussian functions. The evaluation was performed on carotid and radial artery pressure waveforms (CAPW and RAPW) which were simultaneously recorded from twenty normal volunteers. The fitting accuracy and calculation efficiency of our TSPSO were compared with three published optimization methods: the Nelder-Mead, the modified PSO (MPSO), and the dynamic multiswarm particle swarm optimizer (DMS-PSO). The results showed that TSPSO achieved the best fitting accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.1% for CAPW and 1.0% for RAPW, in comparison with 4.2% and 4.1% for Nelder-Mead, 2.0% and 1.9% for MPSO, and 1.2% and 1.1% for DMS-PSO. In addition, to achieve target MAE of 2.0%, the computation time of TSPSO was only 1.5 s, which was only 20% and 30% of that for MPSO and DMS-PSO, respectively. © 2014 Chengyu Liu et al.

84905453173	Illumination processing in face recognition	Changes in light intensity and angle present a major challenge to the creation of reliable face recognition systems. The existence of bright regions and dark regions has been shown to have a serious negative impact on the performance of face recognition systems. This paper proposes a solution to this problem based on self-quotient image (SQI) processing method. In this method, bright and dark areas are processed separately without changing the essential characteristics of the image of the face. The dark and light areas are processed separately by SQI. Experimental results indicate that this Single-Light-Region and Single-Dark-Region SQI method removes the adverse effect of multi-bright and multi-dark areas better than competing methods. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84905034814	Adaptive ratio local binary pattern with application to eye location	In this paper, a novel method for human eye location is proposed based on a new feature extraction algorithm called adaptive ratio local binary pattern (ARLBP). It adopted the idea that the appearance of an interest region can be well characterized by the distribution of its local features. These patterns provide a simple but powerful spatial description of eye texture, and put up great robustness in different lighting, noise, and low cost of calculation. The working principle of ARLBP is described in detail, and a system is designed for precise eye location. The eye location system is composed of three parts. The pure facial region is detected and cut firstly. Then, the ARLBP features of the face is obtained based on grayscale analysis, and candidate eye regions are given through the eye filter based on texture information by projection method. Finally, the precise eye center locating method is described using boundary tracking and centroid method. The system is tested based on the standard distance measure, and the experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement using the proposed method over others on four headand- shoulder databases. © 2014 Old City Publishing, Inc.

84915785362	Rapid multiclass traffic sign detection in high-resolution images	This paper describes a traffic sign detection (TSD) framework that is capable of rapidly detecting multiclass traffic signs in high-resolution images while achieving a high detection rate. There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of two features called multiblock normalization local binary pattern (MN-LBP) and tilted MN-LBP (TMN-LBP), which are able to express multiclass traffic signs effectively. The second is a tree structure called split-flow cascade, which utilizes common features of multiclass traffic signs to construct a coarse-to-fine TSD detector. The third contribution is the Common-Finder AdaBoost (CF.AdaBoost) algorithm, which is designed to find common features of different training sets to develop an efficient Split-Flow Cascade tree (SFC-tree) for multiclass TSD. Through experiments with an evaluation data set of high-resolution images, we show that the proposed framework is able to detect multiclass traffic signs with high detection accuracy in real time and that it outperforms the state-of-The-Art approaches at detecting a large number of different types of traffic signs rapidly without using any color information.

Based on image preprocessing, the image of the river surface is binarized by using the iterative threshold method. A morphologic closing computation operator is applied to the binary image to remove the small non-edged areas, and a non-symmetry thinning method is used to thin the edge of the riverside image. Then, the Hough transformation is used to acquire the edge line function of the dynamic riverside. Therefore, the width of the water surface and the flow of the river can be calculated accurately under subpixel resolution. The application of the method shows its effectiveness.
