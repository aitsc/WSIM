0903.2340	short-term spectroscopic monitoring of two cool dwarfs with strong  magnetic fields	context: there is now growing evidence that some brown dwarfs (bds) have verystrong magnetic fields, and yet their surface temperatures are so low that thecoupling is expected to be small between the matter and the magnetic field inthe atmosphere. in the deeper layers, however, the coupling is expected to bemuch stronger. aims: this raises the question of whether the magnetic fieldstill leads to the formation of structures in the photosphere. methods: wecarried out a spectroscopic monitoring campaign of two ultracool dwarfs thathave strong magnetic fields: the bd lp944-20 and 2massw j0036159+182110.lp944-20 was observed simultaneously in the optical and in the near infraredregime, 2massw j0036159+182110 only in the infrared. results: both dwarfsturned out to be remarkably constant. in the case of lp944-20, theteff-variations are &lt;50k, and the rms-variations in the equivalent widths ofhalpha small. we also find that the equivalent widths of photospheric lines areremarkably constant. we did not find any significant variations in the case of2massw j0036159+182110 either. thus the most important result is that nosignificant variability was found at the time of our observations. whencomparing our spectra with spectra taken over the past 11 years, we recognizesignificant changes during this time. conclusions: we interpret these resultsas evidence that the photosphere of these objects are remarkably homogeneous,with only little structure in them, and despite the strong magnetic fields.thus, unlike active stars, there are no prominent spots on these objects.

0903.4057	lucky imaging of m subdwarfs	the knowledge of the binary properties of metal-poor and solar-metallicitystars can shed light on the potential differences between the formationprocesses responsible for both types of objects.  the aim of the project is to determine the binary properties (separation,mass ratio, frequency of companions) for m subdwarfs, the low-metallicitycounterparts of field m dwarfs, and investigate any potential differencesbetween both populations.  we have obtained high-resolution imaging in the optical for a sample of 24early-m subdwarfs and nine extreme subdwarfs with the ``lucky imaging''technique using the astralux instrument on the calar alto 2.2-m telescope.  we are sensitive to companions at separations larger than 0.1 arcsec anddifferences of ~2 magnitudes at 0.1 arcsec and ~5 mag at 1 arcsec. we havefound no companion around the 24 subdwarfs under study and one close binary outof nine extreme subdwarfs. a second image of lhs 182 taken three months laterwith the same instrument confirms the common proper motion of the binaryseparated by about 0.7 arcsec. moreover, we do not confirm the common propermotion of the faint source reported by riaz and collaborators at ~2 arcsec fromlhs 1074. we derive a binary frequency of 3+/-3% for m subdwarfs from oursample of 33 objects for separations larger than about five astronomical units.adding to our sample the additional 28 metal-poor early-m dwarfs observed withthe hubble space telescope by riaz and collaborators, we infer a binaryfraction of 3.7+/-2.6% (with a 1 sigma confidence limit), significantly lowerthan the fraction of resolved binary m dwarfs (~20%) over the same mass andseparation ranges (abridged).

0903.4461	physical parameters of t dwarfs derived from high-resolution  near-infrared spectra	we determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and projectedrotational velocity of nine t dwarfs from the comparison of high-resolutionnear-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate the mass and age ofthe objects from state-of-the-art models. we use the ames-cond cloudless solarmetallicity models provided by the phoenix code to match the spectra of the tdwarfs observed with the nir high-resolution spectrograph nirspec using tenechelle orders to cover part of the j band from 1.165 to 1.323 microns withr~20,000. the projected rotational velocity, teff and logg of the objects aredetermined based on the minimum rms of the differences between the modelled andobserved relative fluxes. the modelled spectra reproduce quite well theobserved features for most of the t dwarfs, with teff in the range of 922-1009k, and logg between 4.3 and 5 (cm s^-2). our results support the assumption ofa dust free atmosphere for t dwarfs later than t5, where dust grains form andthen gravitationally sediment into the low atmosphere. the modelled spectra donot accurately mimic some individual very strong lines like the ki doublet at1.2436 and 1.2525 microns. our modelled spectra does not match well theobserved spectra of the two t dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely sdsspj125453.90-012247.4 (t2) and 2mass j05591914-1404488 (t4.5), which is likelydue to the presence of condensate clouds that are not incorporated in themodels used here. by comparing our results and their uncertainties toevolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval ~5-75 mj for t dwarfslater than t5, which are in good agreement with those found in the literature.we found apparent young ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few gyr forthe same t dwarfs, which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.

0904.0005	polarisation of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs	ultra-cool dwarfs of the l spectral type (teff=1400-2200k) are known to havedusty atmospheres. asymmetries of the dwarf surface may arise fromrotationally-induced flattening and dust-cloud coverage, and may result innon-zero linear polarisation through dust scattering.  we aim to study the heterogeneity of ultra-cool dwarfs' atmospheres and thegrain-size effects on the polarisation degree in a sample of nine late m, l andearly t dwarfs.  we obtain linear polarimetric imaging measurements using fors1 at the verylarge telescope, in the bessel i filter, and for a subset in the bessel r andthe gunn z filters.  we measure a polarisation degree of (0.31+/-0.06)% for lhs102bc. we fail todetect linear polarisation in the rest of our sample, with upper-limits on thepolarisation degree of each object of 0.09% to 0.76% (95% cl). for thosetargets we do not find evidence of large-scale cloud horizontal structure inour data. together with previous surveys, our results set the fraction ofultra-cool dwarfs with detected linear polarisation to (30+10-6)% (1-sigma).  for three brown dwarfs, our observations indicate polarisation degreesdifferent (at the 3-sigma level) than previously reported, giving hints ofpossible variations.  our results fail to correlate with the current model predictions forultra-cool dwarf polarisation for a flattening-induced polarisation, or withthe variability studies for a polarisation induced by an hetereneous cloudcover. this stresses the intricacy of each of those tasks, but may as wellproceed from complex and dynamic atmospheric processes.

0907.2185	a census of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the sigma orionis  cluster	(abridged) we have analysed the near-infrared photometric data from thefourth data release (dr4) of the ukirt infrared deep sky suvey (ukidss)galactic clusters survey (gcs) to derive the cluster luminosity and massfunctions, evaluate the extent of the cluster, and study the distribution andvariability of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs down to the deuterium-burninglimit. we have recovered most of the previously published members and found atotal of 287 candidate members within the central 30 arcmin in the 0.5-0.009msun mass range, including new objects not previously reported in theliterature. this new catalogue represents a homogeneous dataset of brown dwarfmember candidates over the central 30 arcmin of the cluster. the expectedphotometric contamination by field objects with similar magnitudes and coloursto sigma orionis members is ~15%. we present evidence of variability at the99.5% confidence level over ~yearly timescales in 10 member candidates thatexhibit signs of youth and the presence of disks. the level of variability islow (&lt;0.3 mag) and does not impact the derivation of the cluster luminosity andmass functions. furthermore, we find a possible dearth of brown dwarfs withinthe central five arcmin of the cluster, which is not caused by a lower level ofphotometric sensitivity around the massive, o-type multiple star sigma ori inthe gcs survey. using state-of-the-art theoretical models, we derived theluminosity and mass functions within the central 30 arcmin from the clustercentre, with completeness down to j = 19 mag, corresponding to masses rangingfrom 0.5 msun down to the deuterium-burning mass boundary (~0.013 msun). themass function of sigma orionis in this mass interval shows a power law indexalpha = 0.5+/-0.2.

0909.0802	candidate free-floating super-jupiters in the young sigma orionis open  cluster	free-floating substellar candidates with estimated theoretical masses of aslow as ~5 jupiter masses have been found in the ~3 myr old sigma orionis opencluster. as the overlap with the planetary mass domain increases, the questionof how these objects form becomes important. the determination of their numberdensity and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understandingtheir formation. we propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in thecluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. using new-and (re-analysed) published izjhks[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840arcmin2, we performed a search for lt-type cluster member candidates in themagnitude range j=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes andcolours. besides recovering the t type object s ori 70 and two other knownobjects, we find three new cluster member candidates, s ori 72-74, with j=21mag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. they have theoretical masses of4 (-2,+3) m_jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detectedby direct imaging outside the solar system. the photometry in archival spitzer[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that s ori 72 is an l/t transition candidate ands ori 73 a t-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in themid-infrared. finally, the l-type candidate s ori 74 with lower qualityphotometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 au) of a stellar member of sigmaorionis and could be a companion. after contaminant correction in the areacomplete to j=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and twocluster members in the mass interval 6-4 m_jup. our result suggests a possibleturnover in the substellar mass spectrum below ~6 jupiter masses, which couldbe investigated further by wider and deeper photometric surveys.

1001.4393	the discovery of a very cool binary system	we report the discovery of a very cool d/sdl7+t7.5p common proper motionbinary system, sdss j1416+13ab, found by cross-matching the ukidss large areasurvey data release 5 against the sloan digital sky survey data release 7. thed/sdl7 is blue in j-h and h-k and has other features suggestive oflow-metallicity and/or high gravity. the t7.5p displays spectral peculiarityseen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in ukidss las dr4, and referredto as ch4-j-early peculiarity. we suggest that ch4-j-early peculiarity arisesfrom low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use forclassifying t dwarfs. ukidss and follow-up ukirt/wfcam photometry shows the tdwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object withh-k = -1.31+/-0.17. warm spitzer irac photometry shows the t dwarf to haveextremely red h-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for asubstellar object. the lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits ourability to estimate parameters for the system. however, applying a conservativedistance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135au. by comparing h-k:h-[4.5] colours of the t dwarf to spectral models weestimate that teff = 500 k and [m/h]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. this suggests amass of ~30 mjupiter for the t dwarf and an age of ~10 gyr for the system. theprimary would then be a 75mjupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relativelydust-free teff ~ 1500k atmosphere. given the unusual properties of the systemwe caution that these estimates are uncertain. we eagerly await parallaxmeasurements and high-resolution imaging which will constrain the parametersfurther.

1106.3050	the impact of the kasatochi eruption on the moon's illumination during  the august 2008 lunar eclipse	the moon's changeable aspect during a lunar eclipse is largely attributableto variations in the refracted unscattered sunlight absorbed by the terrestrialatmosphere that occur as the satellite crosses the earth's shadow. thecontribution to the moon's aspect from sunlight scattered at the earth'sterminator is generally deemed minor. however, our analysis of a publishedspectrum of the 16 august 2008 lunar eclipse shows that diffuse sunlight is amajor component of the measured spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm.the conclusion is supported by two distinct features, namely the spectrum'stail at short wavelengths and the unequal absorption by an oxygen collisionalcomplex at two nearby bands. our findings are consistent with the presence ofthe volcanic cloud reported at high northern latitudes following the 7-8 august2008 eruption in alaska of the kasatochi volcano. the cloud both attenuates theunscattered sunlight and enhances moderately the scattered component, thusmodifying the contrast between the two contributions.

1205.4950	new isolated planetary mass objects and the stellar and substellar mass  function of the sigma orionis cluster	we report on our analysis of the vista orion zyjhks photometric data(completeness magnitudes z=22.6 and j=21.0mag) focusing on a circular area of2798.4 arcmin^2 around the young sigma orionis star cluster (~3myr, ~352pc,solar metallicity). the combination of the vista photometry with optical, wiseand spitzer data allows us to identify a total of 210 cluster member candidateswith masses in the interval 0.25-0.004msun, 23 of which are new planetary-massobject findings. these discoveries double the number of cluster planetary-masscandidates known so far. one object has colors compatible with a t spectraltype. the cluster harbors about as many brown dwarfs (69, 0.072-0.012msun) andplanetary-mass objects (37, 0.012-0.004msun) as very low-mass stars (104,0.25-0.072msun). based on spitzer data, we derive a disk frequency of ~40% forvery low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary mass objects in sigma orionis.the radial density distributions of these three mass intervals are alike: allare spatially concentrated within an effective radius of 12arcmin (1.2pc)around the multiple star sigma ori, and no obvious segregation betweendisk-bearing and diskless objects is observed. using the vista data and themayrit catalog, we derive the cluster mass spectrum (deltan/deltam ~m^{-alpha}) from ~19 to 0.006msun (vista zj completeness), which is reasonablydescribed by two power-law expressions with indices of alpha=1.7+/-0.2 form&gt;0.35msun, and alpha=0.6+/-0.2 for m&lt;0.35msun. the sigma orionis mass spectrumsmoothly extends into the planetary-mass regime down to 0.004msun. our findingsof t-type sources (&lt;0.004msun) in the vista sigma orionis exploration appear tobe smaller than what is predicted by the extrapolation of the cluster massspectrum down to the survey j-band completeness.

1206.4344	glancing views of the earth. from a lunar eclipse to an exoplanetary  transit	it has been posited that lunar eclipse observations may help predict thein-transit signature of earth-like extrasolar planets. however, a comparativeanalysis of the two phenomena addressing in detail the transport of stellarlight through the planet's atmosphere has not yet been presented. here, weproceed with the investigation of both phenomena by making use of a commonformulation. our starting point is a set of previously unpublishednear-infrared spectra collected at various phases during the august 2008 lunareclipse. we then take the formulation to the limit of an infinitely distantobserver in order to investigate the in-transit signature of the earth-sunsystem as being observed from outside our solar system. the refraction-bendingof sunlight rays that pass through the earth's atmosphere is a critical factorin the illumination of the eclipsed moon. likewise, refraction will have animpact on the in-transit transmission spectrum for specific planet-star systemsdepending on the refractive properties of the planet's atmosphere, the stellarsize and the planet's orbital distance. for the earth-sun system, atmid-transit, refraction prevents the remote observer's access to the lower~12-14 km of the atmosphere and, thus, also to the bulk of thespectroscopically-active atmospheric gases. we demonstrate that the effectiveoptical radius of the earth in transit is modulated by refraction and varies by~12 km from mid-transit to 2nd contact. the refractive nature of atmospheres, aproperty which is rarely accounted for in published investigations, will poseadditional challenges to the characterization of earth-like extrasolar planets.refraction may have a lesser impact for earth-like extrasolar planets withinthe habitable zone of some m-type stars.

1206.5296	exels: an exoplanet legacy science proposal for the esa euclid mission  i. cold exoplanets	euclid is the second m-class mission of the esa cosmic vision programme, withthe principal science goal of studying dark energy. euclid is also expected toundertake additional legacy science programmes. one proposal is the exoplaneteuclid legacy survey (exels) which will be the first survey able to measure theabundance of exoplanets down to earth mass for host separations from ~1au outto the free-floating (unbound) regime. the cold and free-floating exoplanetregimes represent a crucial discovery space for testing planet formationtheories. exels will use the gravitational microlensing technique and willdetect 1000 microlensing events per month over 1.6 deg^2 of the galactic bulge.we assess how many of these events will have detectable planetary signaturesusing a detailed multi-wavelength microlensing simulator (mabuls) whichincorporates the besancon galactic model with 3d extinction. mabuls is thefirst theoretical simulation of microlensing to treat the effects of pointspread function (psf) blending self-consistently with the underlying galacticmodel. we use mabuls, together with current numerical models for the euclidpsfs, to explore a number of designs and de-scope options for exels, includingthe exoplanet yield as a function of filter choice and slewing time, and theeffect of systematic photometry errors. using conservative extrapolations ofcurrent empirical exoplanet mass functions determined from ground-basedmicrolensing and radial velocity surveys, exels can expect to detect a fewhundred cold exoplanets around mainly g, k and m-type stellar hosts, including~45 earth-mass planets and ~6 mars-mass planets for an observing programmetotalling 10 months. exels will be capable of measuring the cold exoplanet massfunction down to earth mass or below, with orbital separations from ~1au to thefree-floating regime.

1207.2781	intermediate resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of 36 late-m dwarfs	we present observations of 36 late-m dwarfs obtained with the keckii/nirspecin the j-band at a resolution of \sim20,000. we have measured projectedrotational velocities, absolute radial velocities, and pseudo-equivalent widthsof atomic lines. 12 of our targets did not have previous measurements in theliterature.  for the other 24 targets, we confirm previously reported measurements. wefind that 13 stars from our sample have vsini below our measurement threshold(12 km/s) whereas four of our targets are fast rotators (vsini &gt; 30 km/s). asfast rotation causes spectral features to be washed out, stars with lowprojected rotational velocities are sought for radial velocity surveys.  at our intermediate spectral resolution we have confirmed the identificationof neutral atomic lines reported in mclean et al. 2007. we also calculatedpseudo-equivalent widths (p-ew) of 12 atomic lines. our results confirm thatthe p-ew of k i lines are strongly dependent on spectral types. we observe thatthe p-ew of fe i and mn i lines remain fairly constant with later spectraltype. we suggest that those lines are particularly suitable for derivingmetallicities for late-m dwarfs.

0712.3482	discovery of a wide companion near the deuterium burning mass limit in  the upper scorpius association	we present the discovery of a companion near the deuterium burning mass limitlocated at a very wide distance, at an angular separation of 4.6+/-0.1 arcsec(projected distance of ~ 670 au) from uscoctio108, a brown dwarf of the veryyoung upper scorpius association. optical and near-infrared photometry andspectroscopy confirm the cool nature of both objects, with spectral types of m7and m9.5, respectively, and that they are bona fide members of the association,showing low gravity and features of youth. their masses, estimated from thecomparison of their bolometric luminosities and theoretical models for the agerange of the association, are 60+/-20 and 14^{+2}_{-8} mjup, respectively. theexistence of this object around a brown dwarf at this wide orbit suggests thatthe companion is unlikely to have formed in a disk based on current planetformation models. because this system is rather weakly bound, they did notprobably form through dynamical ejection of stellar embryos.

1401.6029	simultaneous optical and near-infrared linear spectropolarimetry of the  earthshine	aims: we aim to extend our current observational understanding of theintegrated planet earth spectropolarimetry from the optical to thenear-infrared wavelengths. major biomarkers like o$_{\rm 2}$ and water vaporare strong flux absorbents in the earth atmosphere and some linear polarizationof the reflected stellar light is expected to occur at these wavelengths.  methods: simultaneous optical ($0.4-0.9$ $\mu$m) and near-infrared ($0.9-2.3$$\mu$m) linear spectropolarimetric data of the earthshine were acquired byobserving the nightside of the waxing moon. the data have sufficient spectralresolution (2.51 nm in the optical, and 1.83 and 2.91 nm in the near-infrared)to resolve major molecular species present in the earth atmosphere.  results: we find the highest values of linear polarization ($\ge 10\%$) atthe bluest wavelengths, which agrees with the literature. linear polarizationintensity steadily decreases towards red wavelengths reaching a nearly flatvalue beyond $\sim$0.8 $\mu$m. in the near-infrared, we measured a polarizationdegree of $\sim4.5 \%$ for the continuum. we report the detection of molecularfeatures due to o$_{2}$ at $0.760, 1.25 \mu$m and h$_{2}$o at 0.653$-$0.725$\mu$m, 0.780$-$0.825 $\mu$m, 0.93 and 1.12 $\mu$m in the spectropolarimetricdata; most of them show high linear polarimetry degrees above the continuum. inparticular, the broad h$_{2}$o 1.12 $\mu$m band displays a polarimetricintensity as high as that of the blue optical. these features may become apowerful tool to characterize earth-like planets in polarized light.

1406.1345	trigonometric parallaxes of young field l dwarfs	(abridged) we aim to determine the trigonometric parallaxes and propermotions of a sample of ten field l0-l5 dwarfs with spectroscopic evidence forlow-gravity atmospheres. we obtained j and ks imaging data using 2-4-m classtelescopes with a typical cadence of one image per month between 2010 januaryand 2012 december. we also obtained low resolution optical spectra (r~300,500-1100 nm) using the 10-m gtcs to assess the presence of lithium absorptionin four targets and confirm their young age. trigonometric parallaxes andproper motions were derived to typical accuracies of 1 mas and +/-10 mas/yr.all ten l dwarfs have large motions, and are located at distances between 9 and47 pc. they lie above and on the sequence of field dwarfs in the absolute j andk_s magnitude versus spectral type and luminosity versus teff diagrams,implying ages similar to or smaller than those typical of the field. thedetection of atomic lithium in the atmosphere of 2mass j00452143+1634446 isreported for the first time. three dwarfs have locations in the hr diagramindicative of old ages and high masses consistent with the observed lithiumdepletion previously published. we did not find evidence for the presence ofastrometric companions with minimum detectable masses typically &gt;=25 mjup andface-on, circular orbits with periods between 60-90 d and 3 yr around eighttargets. the astrometric and spectroscopic data indicate that about 60-70% ofthe field l-type dwarfs in our sample with evidence for low-gravity atmospheresare indeed young-to-intermediate-age brown dwarfs of the solar neighborhoodwith expected ages and masses in the intervals 10-500 myr and 11-45 mjup. thepeaked-shape of the h-band spectra of l dwarfs, a signpost of youth, appears tobe present up to ages of 120-500 myr and intermediate-to-high gravities.

1410.0363	exels: an exoplanet legacy science proposal for the esa euclid mission.  ii. hot exoplanets and sub-stellar systems	the exoplanet euclid legacy survey (exels) proposes to determine thefrequency of cold exoplanets down to earth mass from host separations of ~1 auout to the free-floating regime by detecting microlensing events in galacticbulge. we show that exels can also detect large numbers of hot, transitingexoplanets in the same population. the combined microlensing+transit surveywould allow the first self-consistent estimate of the relative frequencies ofhot and cold sub-stellar companions, reducing biases in comparing "near-field"radial velocity and transiting exoplanets with "far-field" microlensingexoplanets. the age of the bulge and its spread in metallicity further allowsexels to better constrain both the variation of companion frequency withmetallicity and statistically explore the strength of star-planet tides.  we conservatively estimate that exels will detect ~4100 sub-stellar objects,with sensitivity typically reaching down to neptune-mass planets. of these,~600 will be detectable in both euclid's vis (optical) channel and nisp h-bandimager, with ~90% of detections being hot jupiters. likely scenarios predict arange of 2900-7000 for vis and 400-1600 for h-band. twice as many can beexpected in vis if the cadence can be increased to match the 20-minute h-bandcadence. the separation of planets from brown dwarfs via doppler boosting orellipsoidal variability will be possible in a handful of cases. radial velocityconfirmation should be possible in some cases, using 30-metre-class telescopes.we expect secondary eclipses, and reflection and emission from planets to bedetectable in up to ~100 systems in both vis and nisp-h. transits of ~500planetary-radius companions will be characterised with two-colour photometryand ~40 with four-colour photometry (vis,yjh), and the albedo of (and emissionfrom) a large sample of hot jupiters in the h-band can be exploredstatistically.

1411.3370	characterization of the known t type dwarfs towards the sigma orionis  cluster	(abridged) a total of three t type candidates (sori70, sori73, andsorij0538-0213) lying in the line of sight towards sigma orionis werecharacterized by means of near-infrared photometric, astrometric, andspectroscopic studies. h-band methane images were collected for all threesources and an additional sample of 15 field t type dwarfs using liris/wht.j-band spectra of resolution of ~500 were obtained for sorij0538-0213 withisaac/vlt, and jh spectra of resolution of ~50 acquired with wfc3/hst wereemployed for the spectroscopic classification of sori70 and 73. proper motionswith a typical uncertainty of +/-3 mas/yr and a time interval of ~7-9 yr werederived. using the liris observations of the field t dwarfs, we calibrated thisimager for t spectral typing via methane photometry. the three sori objectswere spectroscopically classified as t4.5+/-0.5 (sori73), t5+/-0.5(sorij0538-0213), and t7$^{+0.5}_{-1.0}$ (sori70). the similarity between theobserved jh spectra and the methane colors and the data of field ultra-cooldwarfs of related classifications suggests that sori70, 73, andsorij053804.65-021352.5 do not deviate significantly in surface gravity inrelation to the field. additionally, the detection of ki at ~1.25 microns insorij0538-0213 points to a high-gravity atmosphere. only the k-band reddishnature of sori70 may be consistent with a low gravity atmosphere. the propermotions of sori70 and 73 are measurable and are larger than that of the clusterby &gt;3.5 sigma. the proper motion of sorij0538-0213 is consistent with a nulldisplacement. these observations suggest that none of the three t dwarfs arelikely sigma orionis members, and that either planetary-mass objects withmasses below ~4 mjup may not exist free-floating in the cluster or they may lieat fainter near-infrared magnitudes than those of the targets (this is h&gt;20.6mag), thus remaining unidentified to date.

1507.01254	constraints on the substellar companions in wide orbits around the  barnard's star from canaricam mid-infrared imaging	we have performed mid-infrared imaging of barnard's star, one of the neareststars to the sun, using canaricam on the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias. weaim to investigate an area within 1-10 arcsec separations, which for the 1.83pc distance of the star translates to projected orbital separations of 1.8-18au (p &gt; 12 yr), which have not been explored yet with astrometry or radialvelocity programs. it is therefore an opportunity to enter the domain ofdistances where most giant planets are expected to form. we performed deepimaging in the n-band window (si-2 filter, 8.7 {\mu}m) reaching a 3{\sigma}detection limit of 0.85+/-0.18 mjy and angular resolution of 0.24 arcsec, closeto the diffraction limit of the telescope at this wavelength. a total of 80 minon-source integration time data were collected and combined for the deepestimage. we achieved a dynamical range of 8.0+/-0.1 mag in the 8.7 {\mu}m band,at angular separations from ~2 to 10 arcsec and of ~6-8 mag at 1-2 arcsec. noadditional sources were found. our detectability limits provide furtherconstraints to the presence of substellar companions of the barnard's star.according to solar metallicity evolutionary models, we can exclude companionsof masses larger than 15 mjup (teff &gt; 400 k), ages of a few gyr, and located in~3.6-18 au orbits with a 3{\sigma} confidence level. this minimum mass isapproximately 5 mjup smaller than any previous imaging survey that explored thesurroundings of barnard's star could restrict.

1509.08718	parallax of the l4.5 dwarf 2m1821$+$14 from high-precision astrometry  with osiris at gtc	we used the osiris camera at the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias (gtc) tomonitor the astrometric motion of the l4.5 dwarf 2m1821$+$14 over 17 months.the astrometric residuals of eleven epochs have a r.m.s. dispersion of 0.4 mas,which is larger than the average precision of 0.23 mas per epoch and hintstowards an additional signal or excess noise. comparison of thepoint-spread-functions in osiris and fors2/vlt images reveals no differencescritical for high-precision astrometry, despite the gtc's segmented primarymirror. we attribute the excess noise to an unknown effect that may beuncovered with additional data. for 2m1821$+$14, we measured a relativeparallax of $106.15 \pm 0.18$ mas and determined a correction of $0.50\pm0.05$mas to absolute parallax, leading to a distance of $9.38 \pm0.03$ pc. weexcluded at 3-$\sigma$ confidence the presence of a companion to 2m1821$+$14down to a mass ratio of 0.1 ($\approx 5\, m_\mathrm{jupiter}$) with a period of50--1000 days and a separation of 0.1--0.7 au. the accurate parallax allowed usto estimate the age and mass of 2m1821$+$14 of 120--700 myr and0.049$^{+0.014}_{-0.024}$ m$_\odot$, thus confirming its intermediate age andsubstellar mass. we complement our study with a parallax and proper motioncatalogue of 587 stars ($i'\simeq15.5-22$) close to 2m1821$+$14, used asastrometric references. this study demonstrates sub-mas astrometry with thegtc, a capability applicable for a variety of science cases including thesearch for extrasolar planets and relevant for future astrometric observationswith e-elt and tmt.

astro-ph;0001060	on the interpretation of the optical spectra of l-type dwarfs	we present synthetic optical spectra in the range 640-930 nm of a sample offield l dwarfs and the brown dwarf gl229b. our computations show that li, na,k, rb, and cs govern the spectra of these objects, with na and k contributingsignificantly to block the optical emergent radiation. molecular absorptions oftio, vo, crh, feh and cah also dominate in the early l-types showing a strengththat progressively decreases for later types. we find that the densities ofthese molecules in the atmospheres are considerably smaller by larger factorsthan those predicted by the chemical equilibrium. in order to reproduce theoverall shape of the optical spectra an additional opacity (ado) is required tobe implemented in the computations. we have modelled it with a simple law [a0(nu / nu0)^n, n=4], and found that this provides a good fit to the data. thisado could be due to molecular/dust absorption or to dust scattering. the ewsand intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity. the liline at 670.8 nm, widely used as a substellarity discriminator, is moreaffected by the ado than by the natural depletion of neutral li. ourcomputations display a rather strong feature even at teffs around 1000 k;depending on the teff and on the amount of dust in the atmospheres of very cooldwarfs, it might be possible to detect li even at temperatures this cool.changes in the physical conditions of dust formation in l-type dwarfs willcause variability of the alkali lines.

astro-ph;0004174	membership and multiplicity among very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs  in the pleiades cluster	we present near-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy of very low-massstars and brown dwarf candidates in the pleiades open cluster. the membershipstatus of these objects is assessed. eight objects out of 45 appear to benon-members. a search for companions among 34 very low-mass pleiades members(m$\le$0.09 m$_\odot$) in high-spatial resolution images obtained with thehubble space telescope and the adaptive optics system of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope produced no resolved binaries with separationslarger than 0.2 arcsec (a ~ 27 au; p ~ 444 years). nevertheless, we findevidence for a binary sequence in the color-magnitude diagrams, in agreementwith the results of steele &amp; jameson (1995) for higher mass stars. we comparethe multiplicity statistics of the pleiades very low-mass stars and browndwarfs with that of g and k-type main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood(duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991). we find that there is some evidence for a deficiencyof wide binary systems (separation &gt;27 au) among the pleiades very low-massmembers. we briefly discuss how this result can fit with current scenarios ofbrown dwarf formation. we correct the pleiades substellar mass function for thecontamination of cluster non-members found in this work. we find acontamination level of 33% among the brown dwarf candidates identified bybouvier et al. (1998). assuming a power law imf across the substellar boundary,we find a slope dn/dm ~ m^{-0.53}, implying that the number of objects per massbin is still rising but the contribution to the total mass of the cluster isdeclining in the brown dwarf regime.

astro-ph;0407334	dynamical masses of the binary brown dwarf gj 569bab	we have obtained new images and high-resolution (r ~ 22400) near-infrared(1.2400-1.2575 micron) spectra of each component of the brown dwarf binary gj569bab using the adaptive optics facility of the keck ii telescope and thenirspec spectrometer. these data have allowed us to improve the determinationof the astrometric orbit and to measure radial velocities of the components. wehave used the astrometric and spectroscopic measurements to derive thedynamical mass of each brown dwarf and the systemic velocity of the pair bymeans of a chi^2 fitting technique. from various considerations, the mass ofeach component is likely in the range 0.034-0.070 msol (gj 569bb) and0.055-0.087 msol (gj 569ba). this implies that the mass ratio, q, of the binaryis greater than 0.4, being the most likely value q = 0.75-0.85. adopting 0.072msol as the most conservative location of the substellar limit for solarmetallicity, our analysis confirms gj 569bb as the first genuine brown dwarfknown without any theoretical assumption. we have compared the dynamical massesof gj 569ba and bb, and their effective temperatures and luminosities, to thepredictions of state-of-the-art theoretical evolutionary isochrones, findingthat models exhibit good performance in the regime of high substellar masses ifthe binary is about a few hundred million years old. however, the surfacegravities of gj 569ba (m8.5v) and bb (m9v) derived from our spectral analysis(the observed data have been compared to the latest synthetic spectra) appearto be smaller than the values provided by the evolutionary models.

0809.0090	chemical abundances of late-type pre-main sequence stars in the  $\sigma$-orionis cluster	the young $\sigma$-orionis cluster is an important location for understandingthe formation and evolution of stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects.its metallicity, although being a fundamental parameter, has not been welldetermined yet. we present the first determination of the metallicity of nineyoung late-type stars in $\sigma$-orionis. using the optical and near-infraredbroadband photometry available in the literature we derive the effectivetemperatures for these nine cluster stars, which lie in the interval 4300--6500k (1--3 \msuno). these parameters are employed to compute a grid of syntheticspectra based on the code moog and kurucz model atmospheres. we employ a$\chi^2$-minimization procedure to derive the stellar surface gravity andatmospheric abundances of al, ca, si, fe, ni and li, using multi-object opticalspectroscopy taken with wyffos+af2 at at the william herschel telescope($\lambda/\delta\lambda\sim7500$). the average metallicity of the$\sigma$-orionis cluster is [fe/h] $ = -0.02\pm0.09\pm0.13$ (random andsystematic errors). the abundances of the other elements, except lithium, seemto be consistent with solar values. lithium abundances are in agreement withthe "cosmic" $^7$li abundance, except for two stars which show a $\log\epsilon(\mathrm{li})$ in the range 3.6--3.7 (although almost consistent withinthe error bars). there are also other two stars with $\log\epsilon(\mathrm{li})\sim 2.75$. we derived an average radial velocity of the$\sigma$-orionis cluster of $28\pm4$km/s. the $\sigma$-orionis metallicity isroughly solar.

astro-ph;0411531	optical linear polarization of late m- and l-type dwarfs	(abridged). we report on the linear polarimetric observations in the johnsoni filter of 44 m6-l7.5 ultracool dwarfs (2800-1400 k). eleven (10 l and 1 m)dwarfs appear to have significant linear polarization (p = 0.2-2.5%). we havecompared the m- and l-dwarf populations finding evidence for a larger frequencyof high i-band polarization in the coolest objects, supporting the presence ofsignificant amounts of dust in l-dwarfs. the probable polarizing mechanism isrelated to the presence of heterogeneous dust clouds nonuniformly distributedacross the visible photospheres and the asymmetric shape of the objects. insome young ultracool dwarfs, surrounding dusty disks may also yieldpolarization. for polarimetric detections, a trend for slightly largerpolarization from l0 to l6.5 may be present in our data, suggesting changes inthe distribution of the grain properties, vertical height of the clouds,metallicity, age, and rotation speed. one of our targets is the peculiar browndwarf (bd) 2mass j2244+20 (l6.5), which shows the largest i-band polarizationdegree. its origin may lie in a surrounding dusty disk or rather largephotospheric dust grains. the m7 young bd cfht-bd-tau 4 and the l3.5 fielddwarf 2mass j0036+18 were also observed in the johnson r filter. our datasupport the presence of a circum(sub)stellar disk around the young accretingbd. our data also support a grain growth in the submicron regime in the visiblephotosphere of j0036+18 (1900 k). the polarimetric data do not obviouslycorrelate with activity or projected rotational velocity. three polarizedearly- to mid-l dwarfs display i-band light curves with amplitudes below 10mmag.

astro-ph;0603194	spectroscopic rotational velocities of brown dwarfs	we have obtained projected rotation velocities (vsini) of a sample of 19ultracool dwarfs with spectral types in the interval m6.5-t8 usinghigh-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with nirspec and the keck iitelescope. among our targets there are two young brown dwarfs, two likely fieldstars, and fifteen likely brown dwarfs (30-72 mjup) of the solar neighborhood.our results indicate that the t-type dwarfs are fast rotators in markedcontrast to m-type stars. we have derived vsini velocities between &lt;15 and 40km/s for them, and have found no clear evidence for t dwarfs rotating stronglyfaster than l dwarfs. however, there is a hint for an increasing lower envelopeon moving from mid-m to the l spectral types in the vsini-spectral type diagramthat was previously reported in the literature; our vsini results extend it toeven cooler types. assuming that field brown dwarfs have a size of 0.08-0.1rsol, we can place an upper limit of 12.5 h on the equatorial rotation periodof t-type brown dwarfs. in addition, we have compared our vsini measurements tospectroscopic rotational velocities of very young brown dwarfs of similar massavailable in the literature. the comparison, although model-dependent, suggeststhat brown dwarfs lose some angular momentum during their contraction; however,their spin down time seems to be significantly longer than that of solar-typeto early-m stars.

astro-ph;0609283	a search for substellar members in the praesepe and sigma orionis  clusters	(abridged). we have conducted deep photometric searches for substellarmembers of the praesepe (0.5-1 gyr) and sigma orionis (3 myr) star clustersusing the sloan i' and z' filters, the 3.5-m and the 5-m hale telescopes on thecalar alto and palomar observatories, respectively. the total area surveyed was1177 arcmin^2 (praesepe) and 1122 arcmin^2 (sigma orionis) down to 5-sigmadetection limits of i'= 24.5 and z'= 24 mag, corresponding to masses of 50-55m_jup (praesepe) and 6 m_jup (sigma orionis). besides recovering previouslyknown cluster members reported in the literature, we have identified newphotometric candidates in both clusters whose masses expand the full rangecovered by our study. in sigma orionis, follow-up nir photometry has allowed usto confirm the likely cluster membership of three newly discoveredplanetary-mass objects. the substellar mass function of sigma orionis, which iscomplete from the star-brown dwarf borderline down to 7 m_jup, keeps risingsmoothly with a slope of alpha = 0.6^{+0.5}_{-0.1}. very interestingly, one ofthe faintest praesepe candidates for which we have also obtained follow-up jhkphotometry nicely fits the expected optical and infrared photometric sequenceof the cluster. from its colors, we have estimated its spectral type in thel4-l6 range. if confirmed as a true praesepe member, it would become the firstl-type brown dwarf (50-60 m_jup) identified in an intermediate-age starcluster. our derivation of the praesepe mass function depends strongly on thecluster age. for the youngest possible ages (500-700 myr), our results suggestthat there is a deficit of praesepe brown dwarfs in the central regions of thecluster, while the similarity between the praesepe and sigma orionis massfunctions increases qualitatively for models older than 800 myr.

astro-ph;9508063	stars approaching the substellar limit in the alpha persei open cluster	we present intermediate dispersion optical spectroscopy for seven verylow-mass stars in the alpha per open cluster with spectral types between m3 andm6, including the brown dwarf candidate of rebolo et al. (1992). our radialvelocity measurements are found to be generally consistent with the meancluster velocity to within the measurement errors. halpha equivalent widthshave been measured and compared to previous published data for other knownmembers of the cluster. a turnover in chromospheric activity around spectraltype m3-m4 is observed. the brown dwarf candidate, located in the cool side ofthe turnover, is confirmed to exhibit a strong halpha variability. it is thecoolest alpha per candidate member for which spectra are available and forwhich chromospheric activity has been measured. using the lii doublet at lambda6707.8 angstroms, we derive upper limits to the atmospheric li abundance in thesample and discuss them in the context of the most recent stellar evolutionarytracks. the non-detection of the lii line in the spectrum of the brown dwarfcandidate implies a mass greater than 0.08 solar masses, and therefore it isnot a substellar object. however, its position in the hr diagram implies thatthis star is indeed very close to the substellar limit.

astro-ph;9701038	brown dwarfs in the pleiades cluster. ii. j, h and k photometry	we have obtained near-ir observations of some of the faintest objects so farknown towards the pleiades cluster, with the aim of investigating the sequencethat connects cluster very low-mass (vlm) stars with substellar objects. wefind that ir data combined with optical magnitudes are a useful tool todiscriminate cluster members from foreground/background late-type field starscontaminating optical surveys. the bottom of the pleiades sequence is clearlydefined by the faint hhj objects as the vlm stars approaching the substellarlimit (sl), by the transition object ppl15, which will barely ignite its hcontent, and by the two brown dwarfs (bds) calar3 and teide1. binarity amongstcluster members could account for the large dispersion observed in the faintend of the ir colour- magnitude diagrams. two objects in our sample, namelyhhj6 and ppl15, are overluminous compared to other members, suggesting probablebinarity. we have reproduced the photometric measurements of both of them bycombining the magnitudes of cluster vlm stars and bds and using the most recenttheoretical evolutionary tracks. the likely masses of the components areslightly above the sl for hhj6, while they are 0.080 and 0.045+-0.010 msun forppl15. these masses are consistent with the constraints imposed by thepublished li observations of these pleiads. we find a single object ir sequencein the pleiades connecting vlm stars and bds. we propose that the sl (~0.075msun) in the pleiades (~120 myr) takes place at absolute magnitudesm(i,j,h,k)=12.4, 10.1, 9.4, 9.0 (~m7). cluster members fainter by 0.2mag in iand by 0.1mag in k should be proper bds. the star-bd frontier in the hyadeswould be located at m(i,j,h,k)=15.0, 11.6, 10.8, 10.4 (~m9). for ages olderthan 1000 myr we estimate that bds are fainter than m(k)=10.9 (later thanm9.5).
