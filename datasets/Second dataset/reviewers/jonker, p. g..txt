0907.2757	optical spectroscopy of the quiescent counterpart to exo 0748-676	we present phase resolved optical spectroscopy and x-ray timing of theneutron star x-ray binary exo 0748-676 after the source returned to quiescencein the fall of 2008. the x-ray light curve displays eclipses consistent inorbital period, orbital phase and duration with the predictions andmeasurements before the return to quiescence. halpha and he i emission linesare present in the optical spectra and show the signature of the orbit of thebinary companion, placing a lower limit on the radial velocity semi-amplitudeof k2&gt;405 km/s. both the flux in the continuum and the emission lines showorbital modulations, indicating that we observe the hemisphere of the binarycompanion that is being irradiated by the neutron star. effects due to thisirradiation preclude a direct measurement of the radial velocity semi-amplitudeof the binary companion; in fact no stellar absorption lines are seen in thespectrum. nevertheless, our observations place a stringent lower limit on theneutron star mass of m1&gt;1.27 msun. for the canonical neutron star mass ofm1=1.4 msun, the mass ratio is constrained to 0.075&lt;q&lt;0.105.

0908.3989	xmmsl1 j060636.2-694933: an xmm-newton slew discovery and swift/magellan  follow up of a new classical nova in the lmc	in order to discover new x-ray transients, the data taken by xmm-newton as itslews between targets are being processed and cross-correlated with other x-rayobservations.  a bright source, xmmsl1 j060636.2-694933, was detected on 18 july 2006 at aposition where no previous x-ray source had been seen. the xmm-newton slewdata, plus follow-up dedicated xmm-newton and swift observations, plus opticaldata acquired with the magellan clay telescope, and archival all-sky automatedsurvey (asas) data were used to classify the new object, and to investigate itsproperties.  no xmm-newton slew x-ray counts are detected above 1 kev and the source isseen to be over five hundred times brighter than the rosat all-sky survey upperlimit at that position. the line-rich optical spectrum acquired with themagellan telescope allows the object to be classified as an ao auroral phasenova, and the soft x-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a super-softsource state in the x-ray decline seen in the follow-up x-ray observations. thearchival asas data suggests that the nova at onset (oct 2005) was a 'very fast'nova, and an estimate of its distance is consistent with the nova beingsituated within the lmc.  with the discovery presented here of a new classical nova in the lmc, it isclear that xmm-newton slew data are continuing to offer a powerful opportunityto find new x-ray transient objects.

0909.2632	following the 2008 outburst decay of the black hole candidate h1743-322  in x-ray and radio	in this paper we report on radio (vla and atca) and x-ray (rxte, chandra andswift) observations of the outburst decay of the transient black hole candidateh1743-322 in early 2008. we find that the x-ray light curve followed anexponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. the exponentialdecay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosityof 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. this together with the relation betweenquiescent x-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literaturesuggests that h1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. both theradio and x-ray light curve show evidence for flares. the radio - x-raycorrelation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. this is muchlower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black holetransients before. the radio spectral index measured during one of the radioflares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, whichindicates that the radio emission is optically thin. this is unlike what hasbeen found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. we attribute theradio flares and the low index for the radio - x-ray correlation to thepresence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection eventsearlier in the outburst. we find no evidence for a change in x-ray power lawspectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of n_h=2.3x10^22 cm^-2 limits the detected number of soft photons and thus theaccuracy of the spectral fits.

0707.2067	on the mass of the neutron star in v395 car/2s 0921-630	we report high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the low-mass x-ray binaryv395 car/2s 0921-630 obtained with the mike echelle spectrograph on themagellan-clay telescope. our spectra are obtained near superior conjunction ofthe mass donor star and we exploit the absorption lines originating from theback-side of the k-type object to accurately derive its rotational velocity.using k0-k1 iii templates, we find vsini=32.9 +/- 0.8 km/s. we show that thechoice of template star and the assumed limb darkening coefficient has littleimpact on the derived rotational velocity. this value is a significant revisiondownwards compared to previously published values. we derive new systemparameter constraints in the light of our much lower rotational velocity. wefind m_1=1.44 +/- 0.10 msun, m_2=0.35 +/- 0.03 msun, and q=0.24 +/- 0.02 wherethe errors have been estimated through a monte-carlo simulation. a possibleremaining systematic effect is the fact that we may be over-estimating theorbital velocity of the mass donor due to irradiation effects. however, anycorrection for this effect will only reduce the compact object mass further,down to a minimum mass of m_1=1.05 +/- 0.08 msun. there is thus strong evidencethat the compact object in this binary is a neutron star of rather typical massand that the previously reported mass values of 2-4msun were too high due to anover-estimate of the rotational broadening.

0912.1139	the complete spectrum of the neutron star x-ray binary 4u0614+091	we observed the neutron star (ns) ultra-compact x-ray binary 4u0614+091quasi-simultaneously in the radio band (vla), mid-ir/ir (spitzer/mips andirac), near-ir/optical (smarts), optical-uv (swift/uvot), soft and hard x-rays(swift/xrt and rxte). the source was steadily in its `hard state'. we detectedthe source in the whole range, for the first time in the radio band at 4.86 and8.46 ghz and in the mid-ir at 24 um, up to 100 kev. the optically thicksynchrotron spectrum of the jet is consistent with being flat from the radio tothe mid-ir band. the flat jet spectrum breaks in the range (1-4)x10^(13) hz toan optically-thin power-law synchrotron spectrum with spectral index ~-0.5.these observations allow us to estimate a lower limit on the jet radiativepower of ~3x10^(32) erg/s and a total jet power lj~10^(34) u_(0.05)^(-1)ec^(0.53) erg/s (where ec is the high-energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrumin ev and u_(0.05) is the radiative efficiency in units of 0.05). thecontemporaneous detection of the optically thin part of the compact jet and thex-ray tail above 30 kev allows us to assess the contribution of the jet to thehard x-ray tail by synchrotron self-compton (ssc) processes. we conclude that,for realistic jet size, boosting, viewing angle and energy partition, the sscemission alone, from the post-shock, accelerated, non-thermal population in thejet, is not a viable mechanism to explain the observed hard x-ray tail of theneutron star 4u0614+091.

1001.1965	disentangling jet and disc emission from the 2005 outburst of xte  j1118+480	the black hole x-ray transient, xte j1118+480, has now twice been observed inoutburst - 2000 and 2005 - and on both occasions remained in the low/hard x-rayspectral state. here we present radio, infrared, optical, soft x-ray and hardx-ray observations of the more recent outburst. we find that the lightcurveshave very different morphologies compared with the 2000 event and the opticaldecay is delayed relative to the x-ray/radio. we attribute this lesser degreeof correlation to contributions of emission from multiple components, inparticular the jet and accretion disc. whereas the jet seemed to dominate thebroadband spectrum in 2000, in 2005 the accretion disc seems to be moreprominent and we use an analysis of the lightcurves and spectra to distinguishbetween the jet and disc emission. there also appears to be an optically thincomponent to the radio emission in the 2005 data, possibly associated withmultiple ejection events and decaying as the outburst proceeds. these resultsadd to the discussion that the term "low/hard state'" covers a wider range ofproperties than previously thought, if it is to account for xte j1118+480during these two outbursts.

1103.1486	the galactic bulge survey: outline and x-ray observations	we introduce the galactic bulge survey (gbs) and we provide the chandrasource list for the region that has been observed to date. among the goals ofthe gbs are constraining the neutron star equation of state and the black holemass distribution via the identification of eclipsing neutron star and blackhole low-mass x-ray binaries. the latter goal will, in addition, be obtained bysignificantly enlarging the number of black hole systems for which a black holemass can be derived. further goals include constraining x-ray binary formationscenarios, in particular the common envelope phase and the occurrence of kicks,via source-type number counts and an investigation of the spatial distributionof x-ray binaries, respectively. the gbs targets two strips of 6x1 degrees (12square degrees in total), one above (1&lt;b&lt;2 degrees) and one below (-2&lt;b&lt;-1degrees) the galactic plane in the direction of the galactic center at bothx-ray and optical wavelengths. by avoiding the galactic plane (-1&lt;b&lt;1 degrees)we limit the influence of extinction on the x-ray and optical emission butstill sample relatively large number densities of sources. the survey isdesigned such that a large fraction of the x-ray sources can be identified fromtheir optical spectra. the x-ray survey, by design, covers a large area on thesky while the depth is shallow using 2 ks per chandra pointing. in this way wemaximize the predicted number ratio of (quiescent) low-mass x-ray binaries tocataclysmic variables. the survey is approximately homogeneous in depth to an0.5-10 kev flux of 7.7x10^-14 erg cm-2 s-1. so far, we have covered abouttwo-thirds (8.3 square degrees) of the projected survey area with chandraproviding over 1200 unique x-ray sources. we discuss the characteristics andthe variability of the brightest of these sources.

1203.2919	formation of the planet around the millisecond pulsar j1719-1438	context. recently the discovery of psr j1719-1438, a 5.8 ms pulsar with acompanion in a 2.2 hr orbit, was reported. the combination of this orbitalperiod and the very low mass function is unique. the discoverers, bailes etal., proposed an ultracompact x-ray binary (ucxb) as the progenitor system.however, the standard ucxb scenario would not produce this system as the timerequired to reach this orbital period exceeds the current estimate of the ageof the universe. the detached state of the system aggravates the problem. aims.we want to understand the evolutionary history of psr j1719-1438, and determineunder which circumstances it could have evolved from an ucxb. methods. we modelucxb evolution varying the donor size and investigate the effect of a wind massloss from the donor, and compare the results with the observed characteristicsof psr j1719-1438. results. an ucxb can reach a 2.2 hr orbit within the age ofthe universe, provided that 1) the millisecond pulsar can significantly heatand expand the donor by pulsar irradiation, or 2) the system loses extraorbital angular momentum, e.g. via a fast wind from the donor. conclusions. themost likely scenario for the formation of psr j1719-1438 is ucxb evolutiondriven by angular momentum loss via the usual gravitational wave emission,which is enhanced by angular momentum loss via a donor wind of ~3x10^-13msun/yr. depending on the size of the donor during the evolution, the companionpresently probably has a mass of ~1-3 jupiter masses, making it a very low masswhite dwarf as proposed by bailes et al. its composition can be either heliumor carbon-oxygen. a helium white dwarf companion makes the long (for an ucxb)orbital period easier to explain, but the required inclination makes it apriori less likely than a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.

1204.2735	the black hole candidate xte j1752-223 towards and in quiescence:  optical and simultaneous x-ray - radio observations	we present optical, x-ray and radio observations of the black hole transient(bht) xte j1752-223 towards and in quiescence. optical photometry shows thatthe quiescent magnitude of xte j1752-223 is fainter than 24.4 magnitudes in thei'-band. a comparison with measurements of the source during its 2009-2010outburst shows that the outburst amplitude is more than 8 magnitudes in thei'-band. known x-ray properties of the source combined with the faintness ofthe quiescence optical counterpart and the large outburst optical amplitudepoint towards a short orbital period system (porb&lt;~6.8 h) with an m type (orlater) mass donor, at a distance of 3.5&lt;~d&lt;~8 kpc. simultaneous x-ray and radiodata were collected with chandra and the evla, allowing constraints to beplaced on the quiescent x-ray and radio flux of xte j1752-223. furthermore,using data covering the final stage of the outburst decay, we investigated thelow luminosity end of the x-ray - radio correlation for this source andcompared it with other bhts. we found that xte j1752-223 adds to the number ofoutliers with respect to the `standard' x-ray - radio luminosity relation.furthermore, xte j1752-223 is the second source, after the bht h1743-322, thatshows a transition from the region of the outliers towards the `standard'correlation at low luminosity. finally, we report on a faint, variable x-raysource we discovered with chandra at an angular distance of ~2.9" to xtej1752-223 and at a position angle consistent with that of the radio jetspreviously observed from the bht. we discuss the possibility that we detectedx-ray emission associated with a jet from xte j1752-223.

0711.2572	constraining the neutron star equation of state using xmm-newton	we have identified three possible ways in which future xmm-newtonobservations can provide significant constraints on the equation of state ofneutron stars. first, using a long observation of the neutron star x-raytransient cenx-4 in quiescence one can use the rgs spectrum to constrain theinterstellar extinction to the source. this removes this parameter from thex-ray spectral fitting of the pn and mos spectra and allows us to investigatewhether the variability observed in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of this sourceis due to variations in the soft thermal spectral component or variations inthe power law spectral component coupled with variations in n_h. this will testwhether the soft thermal spectral component can indeed be due to the hotthermal glow of the neutron star. potentially such an observation could alsoreveal redshifted spectral lines from the neutron star surface. second,xmm-newton observations of radius expansion type i x-ray bursts might revealredshifted absorption lines from the surface of the neutron star. third,xmm-newton observations of eclipsing quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries providethe eclipse duration. with this the system inclination can be determinedaccurately. the inclination determined from the x-ray eclipse duration inquiescence, the rotational velocity of the companion star and thesemi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve determined through opticalspectroscopy, yield the neutron star mass.

0711.2579	constraining the neutron star equation of state using quiescent low-mass  x-ray binaries	chandra or xmm-newton observations of quiescent low-mass x-ray binaries canprovide important constraints on the equation of state of neutron stars. themass and radius of the neutron star can potentially be determined from fittinga neutron star atmosphere model to the observed x-ray spectrum. for a radiusmeasurement it is of critical importance that the distance to the source iswell constrained since the fractional uncertainty in the radius is at least aslarge as the fractional uncertainty in the distance. uncertainties in modellingthe neutron star atmosphere remain. at this stage it is not yet clear if thesoft thermal component in the spectra of many quiescent x-ray binaries isvariable on timescales too short to be accommodated by the cooling neutron starscenario. this can be tested with a long xmm-newton observation of the neutronstar x-ray transient cenx-4 in quiescence. with such an observation one can usethe reflection grating spectrometer spectrum to constrain the interstellarextinction to the source. this removes this parameter from the x-ray spectralfitting of the epic pn and mos spectra and allows one to investigate whetherthe variability observed in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of this source is dueto variations in the soft thermal spectral component or variations in the powerlaw spectral component coupled with variations in n_h. this will test whetherthe soft thermal component can indeed be due to the hot thermal glow of theneutron star. irrespective of the outcome of such a study, the observed coolingin quiescence in sources for which the crust is significantly out of thermalequilibrium with the core due to a prolonged outburst, such as ks 1731-260,seem excellent candidates for mass and radius determinations through modellingthe observed x-rays with a neutron star atmosphere model.

1208.4502	the nature of the bright ulx x-2 in ngc3921: a chandra position and hst  candidate counterpart	we report on chandra observations of the bright ultra-luminous x-ray (ulx)source in ngc3921. previous xmm observations reported in the literature showthe presence of a bright ulx at a 0.5-10 kev luminosity of 2x10^40 erg/s. ourchandra observation finds the source at a lower luminosity of ~8x10^39 erg/s,furthermore, we provide a chandra position of the ulx accurate to 0.7" at 90%confidence. the x-ray variability makes it unlikely that the high luminosity iscaused by several separate x-ray sources. in 3 epochs of archival hubble spacetelescope (hst) observations we find a candidate counterpart to the ulx. thereis direct evidence for variability between the two epochs of wfpc2 f814wobservations with the observation obtained in 2000 showing a brighter source.furthermore, converting the 1994 f336w and 2000 f300w wfpc2 and the 2010 f336wwfc3 observations to the johnson u-band filter assuming a spectral type of o7iwe find evidence for a brightening of the u-band light in 2000. using thehigher resolution wfc3 observations the candidate counterpart is resolved intotwo sources of similar color. we discuss the nature of the ulx and the probableassociation with the optical counterpart(s). finally, we investigate apotential new explanation for some (bright) ulxs as the decaying stages offlares caused by the tidal disruption of a star by a recoiled supermassiveblack hole. however, we find that there should be at most only 1 of suchsystems within z=0.08.

1210.6332	formation of the planet orbiting the millisecond pulsar j1719-1438	in 2011, bailes et al. reported on the discovery of a detached companion in a131 minute orbit around psr j1719-1438, a 173 hz millisecond pulsar. thecombination of the very low mass function and such a short orbital period isunique. the discoverers suggested that the progenitor system could be anultracompact x-ray binary (ucxb), which is a binary with a sub-hour orbitalperiod in which a (semi-)degenerate donor fills its roche lobe and transfersmass to a neutron star. the standard gravitational-wave driven ucxb scenario,however, cannot produce a system like psr j1719-1438 as it would take longerthan the age of the universe to reach an orbital period of 131 min. weinvestigate two modifications to the standard ucxb evolution that may resolvethis discrepancy. the first involves significant heating and bloating of thedonor by pulsar irradiation, and in the second modification the system losesorbital angular momentum via a fast stellar wind from the irradiated donor,additional to the losses via the usual gravitational wave radiation. inparticular a donor wind is effective in accelerating orbital expansion, andeven a mild wind could produce the 131 minute period within the age of theuniverse. we note that ucxbs could be an important class of progenitors ofsolitary millisecond radio pulsars.

1211.1040	identification of galactic bulge survey x-ray sources with tycho-2 stars	we identify 69 x-ray sources discovered by the galactic bulge survey (gbs)that are coincident with, or very close to bright stars in the tycho-2 catalog.additionally, two other gbs sources are resolved binary companions to tycho-2stars where both components are separately detected in x-rays. most of theseare likely to be real matches, but we identify nine objects with large andsignificant x-ray to optical offsets as either detections of resolved binarycompanions or chance alignments. we collate known spectral types for theseobjects, and also examine 2mass colors, variability information from theall-sky automated survey (asas), and x-ray hardness ratios for the brightestobjects. nearly a third of the stars are found to be optically variable,divided roughly evenly between irregular variations and periodic modulations.all fall among the softest objects identified by the gbs. the sample forms avery mixed selection, ranging in spectral class from o9 to m3. in some casesthe x-ray emission appears consistent with normal coronal emission fromlate-type stars, or wind emission from early-types, but the sample alsoincludes one known algol, one w uma system, two be stars, and several x-raybright objects likely to be coronally active stars or binaries. surprisingly, asubstantial fraction of the spectroscopically classified, non-coincidentalsample (12 out of 38 objects) have late b or a type counterparts. many of theseexhibit redder near-ir colors than expected for their spectral type and/orvariability, and it is likely that the x-rays originate from a late-typecompanion star in most or all of these objects.

1310.7238	discovery of a new kind of explosive x-ray transient near m86	we present the discovery of a new type of explosive x-ray flash in chandraimages of the old elliptical galaxy m86. this unique event is characterised bythe peak luminosity of 6x10^42 erg/s for the distance of m86, the presence ofprecursor events, the timescale between the precursors and the main event(~4,000 s), the absence of detectable hard x-ray and gamma-ray emission, thetotal duration of the event and the detection of a faint associated opticalsignal. the transient is located close to m86 in the virgo cluster at thelocation where gas and stars are seen protruding from the galaxy probably dueto an ongoing wet minor merger. we discuss the possible mechanisms for thetransient and we conclude that the x-ray flash could have been caused by thedisruption of a compact white dwarf star by a ~10^4 msun black hole.alternative scenarios such that of a foreground neutron star accreting anasteroid or the detection of an off-axis (short) gamma-ray burst cannot beexcluded at present.

1311.0874	variable doppler shifts of the thermal wind absorption lines in low-mass  x-ray binaries	in this paper we address the general applicability of the method pioneered by\citet{zhang2012} in which the motion of the compact object can be trackedusing wind x-ray absorption lines. we present the velocity measurements of thethermal wind lines observed in the x-ray spectrum of a few low-mass x-raybinaries: gx 13+1, h 1743$-$322, gro j1655$-$40 and grs 1915+105. we find thatthe variability in the velocity of the wind lines in about all of the sourcesis larger than conceivable radial velocity variations of the compact object. gx13+1 provides a potential exception, although it would require the red giantstar to be massive with a mass of $\approx 5-6\ m_{\odot}$. we conclude thatthe variability of the source luminosity occurring on a time scale ofdays/months can affect the outflow properties making it difficult to track theorbital motion of the compact object using current observations. given theintrinsic variability of the outflows we suggest that low-mass x-ray binariesshowing stable coronae instead of an outflow (e.g. 4u 1254$-$69, mxb 1659$-$29,4u 1624$-$49) could be more suitable targets for tracking the orbital motion ofthe compact object.

1312.0632	the youngest known x-ray binary: circinus x-1 and its natal supernova  remnant	because supernova remnants are short lived, studies of neutron star x-raybinaries within supernova remnants probe the earliest stages in the life ofaccreting neutron stars. however, such objects are exceedingly rare: none wereknown to exist in our galaxy. we report the discovery of the natal supernovaremnant of the accreting neutron star circinus x-1, which places an upper limitof t &lt; 4, 600 years on its age, making it the youngest known x-ray binary and aunique tool to study accretion, neutron star evolution, and core collapsesupernovae. this discovery is based on a deep 2009 chandra x-ray observationand new radio observations of circinus x-1. circinus x-1 produces type i x-raybursts on the surface of the neutron star, indicating that the magnetic fieldof the neutron star is small. thus, the young age implies either that neutronstars can be born with low magnetic fields or that they can rapidly becomede-magnetized by accretion. circinus x-1 is a microquasar, creatingrelativistic jets which were thought to power the arcminute scale radio nebulasurrounding the source. instead, this nebula can now be attributed tonon-thermal synchrotron emission from the forward shock of the supernovaremnant. the young age is consistent with the observed rapid orbital evolutionand the highly eccentric orbit of the system and offers the chance to test thephysics of post-supernova orbital evolution in x-ray binaries in detail for thefirst time.

1403.2385	probing the crust of the neutron star in exo 0748-676	x-ray observations of quiescent x-ray binaries have the potential to provideinsight into the structure and the composition of neutron stars. exo 0748-676had been actively accreting for over 24 yr before its outburst ceased in late2008. subsequent x-ray monitoring revealed a gradual decay of the quiescentthermal emission that can be attributed to cooling of the accretion-heatedneutron star crust. in this work, we report on new chandra and swiftobservations that extend the quiescent monitoring to ~5 yr post-outburst. wefind that the neutron star temperature remained at ~117 ev between 2009 and2011, but had decreased to ~110 ev in 2013. this suggests that the crust hasnot fully cooled yet, which is supported by the lower temperature of ~95 evthat was measured ~4 yr prior to the accretion phase in 1980. comparing thedata to thermal evolution simulations reveals that the apparent lack of coolingbetween 2009 and 2011 could possibly be a signature of convection driven byphase separation of light and heavy nuclei in the outer layers of the neutronstar.

0803.0419	xmm-newton slew survey discovery of the nova xmmsl1 j070542.7-381442  (v598 pup)	in an attempt to catch new x-ray transients while they are still bright, thedata taken by xmm-newton as it slews between targets is being processed andcross-correlated with other x-ray observations as soon as the slew data appearsin the xmm-newton archive.  a bright source, xmmsl1 j070542.7-381442, was detected on 9 oct 2007 at aposition where no previous x-ray source had been seen. the xmm slew data andoptical data acquired with the magellan clay 6.5m telescope were used toclassify the new object.  no xmm slew x-ray counts are detected above 1kev and the source is seen to be~750 times brighter than the rosat all-sky survey upper limit at that position.the normally m(v)~16 star, usno-a2.0 0450-03360039, which lies 3.5" from thex-ray position, was seen in our magellan data to be very much enhanced inbrightness. our optical spectrum showed emission lines which identified thesource as a nova in the auroral phase. hence this optical source is undoubtedlythe progenitor of the x-ray source - a new nova (now also known as v598 pup).the x-ray spectrum indicates that the nova was in a super-soft state (withkt(eff)~35ev). we estimate the distance to the nova to be ~3kpc. analysis ofarchival robotic optical survey data shows a rapid decline light curveconsistent with that expected for a very fast nova.  the xmm-newton slew data present a powerful opportunity to find new x-raytransient objects while they are still bright. here we present the first suchsource discovered by the analysis of near real-time slew data.

1405.1733	near-infrared counterparts of ultraluminous x-ray sources	in this paper we present the results of the first systematic search forcounterparts to nearby ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) in the near-infrared(nir). we observed 62 ulxs in 37 galaxies within 10 mpc and discovered 17candidate nir counterparts. the detection of 17 out of 62 ulx candidates pointsto intrinsic differences between systems that show and those that do not showinfrared emission. for six counterparts we conclude from the absolutemagnitudes and - - in some cases - additional information such as morphologyand previously reported photometric or spectroscopic observations, that theyare likely background active galactic nuclei or ulxs residing in star clusters.eleven counterparts have absolute magnitudes consistent with them being singlered supergiant stars. alternatively, these systems may have larger accretiondiscs that emit more nir light than the systems that we do not detect. otherscenarios such as emission from a surrounding nebula or from a compact radiojet are also possible, although for holmberg ii x-1 the nir luminosity farexceeds the expected jet contribution. the eleven possible red supergiantcounterparts are excellent candidates for spectroscopic follow-up observations.this may enable us to measure the mass function in these systems if they areindeed red supergiant donor stars where we can observe absorption lines.

1407.7938	hd314884: a slowly pulsating b star in a close binary	we present the results of a spectroscopic and photometric analysis ofhd314884, a slowly pulsating b star (spb) in a binary system with detected softx-ray emission. we spectrally classify the b star as a b5v-b6v star witht$_{eff}$ = 15,490 $\pm$ 310 k, log $g$ = 3.75 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, and aphotometric period of p$_{0}$ = 0.889521(12) days. a spectroscopic periodsearch reveals an orbital period for the system of p$_{orb}$ = 1.3654(11) days.the discrepancy in the two periods and the identification of a second and thirddistinct frequency in the photometric fourier transform at p$_1$ = 3.1347(56)and p$_2$ = 1.517(28) days provides evidence that hd314884 is a slowlypulsating b star (spb) with at least three oscillation frequencies. thesefrequencies appear to originate from higher-order, non-linear tidal pulsations.using the dynamical parameters obtained from the radial velocity curve, we findthe most probable companion mass to be m$_1$ = $\sim$0.8 m$_{\odot}$ assuming atypical mass for the b star and most probable inclination. we conclude that thex-ray source companion to hd314884 is most likely a coronally active g-typestar or a white dwarf (wd), with no apparent emission lines in the opticalspectrum. the mass probability distribution of the companion star mass spans0.6-2.3 m$_{\odot}$ at 99$\%$ confidence which allows the possibility of aneutron star companion. the x-ray source is unlikely to be a black hole unlessit is of a very low mass or low binary inclination.

1501.02017	gemini spectroscopy of galactic bulge sources: a population of hidden  accreting binaries revealed?	we present gemini spectroscopy for 21 candidate optical counterparts to x-raysources discovered in the galactic bulge survey (gbs). for the majority of the21 sources, the optical spectroscopy establishes that they are indeed thelikely counterparts. one of the criteria we used for the identification was thepresence of an ha emission line. the spectra of several sources revealed an haemission line only after careful subtraction of the f or g stellar spectralabsorption lines. in a sub-class of three of these sources the residual halphaemission line is broad (&gt; 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in anaccretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currentlycannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binaryor in an accretion disk. gbs source cx377 shows this hidden accretion behaviourmost dramatically. the previously-identified broad ha emission of this sourceis not present in its gemini spectra taken about 1 year later. however, broademission is revealed after subtracting an f6 template star spectrum. the geminispectra of three sources (cx446, cx1004, and cxb2) as well as the presence ofpossible eclipses in light curves of these sources suggest that these sourcesare accreting binaries viewed under a high inclination.

1502.01743	the relationship between x-ray luminosity and duty cycle for dwarf novae  and their specific frequency in the inner galaxy	we measure the duty cycles for an existing sample of well observed, nearbydwarf novae using data from aavso, and present a quantitative empiricalrelation between the duty cycle of dwarf novae outbursts and the x-rayluminosity of the system in quiescence. we have found that $\logdc=0.63(\pm0.21)\times(\log l_{x}({\rm erg\,s^{-1}})-31.3)-0.95(\pm0.1)$, wheredc stands for duty cycle. we note that there is intrinsic scatter in thisrelation greater than what is expected from purely statistical errors. usingthe dwarf nova x-ray luminosity functions from \citet{pretorius12} and\citet{byckling10}, we compare this relation to the number of dwarf novae inthe galactic bulge survey which were identified through optical outburstsduring an 8-day long monitoring campaign. we find a specific frequency of x-raybright ($l_{x}&gt;10^{31}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) cataclysmic variables undergoingdwarf novae outbursts in the direction of the galactic bulge of$6.6\pm4.7\times10^{-5}\,m_{\odot}^{-1}$. such a specific frequency would givea solar neighborhood space density of long period cvs of$\rho=5.6\pm3.9\times10^{-6}\,$pc$^{-3}$. we advocate the use of specificfrequency in future work, given that projects like lsst will detect dne welloutside the distance range over which $\rho\approx{\textrm const}$.

1503.08634	radio monitoring of the hard state jets in the 2011 outburst of maxi  j1836-194	maxi j1836-194 is a galactic black hole candidate x-ray binary that wasdiscovered in 2011 when it went into outburst. in this paper, we present thefull radio monitoring of this system during its `failed' outburst, in which thesource did not complete a full set of state changes, only transitioning as faras the hard intermediate state. observations with the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla) and australia telescope compact array (atca) show that the jetproperties changed significantly during the outburst. the vla observationsdetected linearly polarised emission at a level of ~1% early in the outburst,increasing to ~3% as the outburst peaked. high-resolution images with the verylong baseline array (vlba) show a ~15 mas jet along the position angle $-21 \pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the electric vector position angle found from ourpolarisation results ($-21 \pm 4^\circ$), implying that the magnetic field isperpendicular to the jet. astrometric observations suggest that the systemrequired an asymmetric natal kick to explain its observed space velocity.comparing quasi-simultaneous x-ray monitoring with the 5 ghz vla observationsfrom the 2011 outburst shows an unusually steep hard-state radio/x-raycorrelation of $l_{\rm r} \propto l_{\rm x}^{1.8\pm0.2}$, where $l_{\rm r}$ and$l_{\rm x}$ denote the radio and x-ray luminosities, respectively. with atcaand swift monitoring of the source during a period of re-brightening in 2012,we show that the system lay on the same steep correlation. due to the lowinclination of this system, we then investigate the possibility that theobserved correlation may have been steepened by variable doppler boosting.

1503.08874	vlt spectroscopy of the black hole candidate swift j1357.2-0933 in  quiescence	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the counterpart to thehigh-inclination black hole low-mass x-ray binary swift j1357.2-0933 inquiescence. absorption features from the mass donor star were not detected.instead the spectra display prominent broad double-peaked halpha emission andweaker hei emission lines. from the halpha peak-to-peak separation we constrainthe radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to &gt; 789 km/s. furtheranalysis through radial velocity and equivalent width measurements indicatesthat the halpha line is free of variability due to s-wave components or disceclipses. from our data and previous observations during outburst, we concludethat long-term radial velocity changes ascribed to a precessing disc were oflow amplitude or not present. this implies that the centroid position of theline should closely represent the systemic radial velocity. using the derivedsystemic velocity of -150 km/s and the best available limits on the sourcedistance, we infer that the black hole is moving towards the plane in itscurrent galactic orbit unless the proper motion is substantial. finally, thedepth of the central absorption in the double peaked profiles adds support forswift j1357.2-0933 as a high-inclination system. on the other hand, we arguethat the low hydrogen column density inferred from x-ray fitting suggests thatthe system is not seen edge-on.

1509.00315	discovery of a red supergiant counterpart to rx~j004722.4-252051, a ulx  in ngc 253	we present two epochs of near-infrared spectroscopy of the candidate redsupergiant counterpart to rx~j004722.4-252051, a ulx in ngc 253. we measureradial velocities of the object and its approximate spectral type bycross-correlating our spectra with those of known red supergiants. ourvlt/x-shooter spectrum is best matched by that of early m-type supergiants,confirming the red supergiant nature of the candidate counterpart. the radialvelocity of the spectrum, taken on 2014, august 23, is $417 \pm 4$ km/s. thisis consistent with the radial velocity measured in our spectrum taken withmagellan/mmirs on 2013, june 28, of $410 \pm 70$ km/s, although the large erroron the latter implies that a radial velocity shift expected for a black hole oftens of $m_\odot$ can easily be hidden. using nebular emission lines we findthat the radial velocity due to the rotation of ngc 253 is 351 $\pm$ 4 km/s atthe position of the ulx. thus the radial velocity of the counterpart confirmsthat the source is located in ngc 253, but also shows an offset with respect tothe local bulk motion of the galaxy of 66 $\pm$ 6 km/s. we argue that the mostlikely origin for this displacement lies either in a sn kick, requiring asystem containing a $\gtrsim 50$ $m_\odot$ black hole, and/or in orbital radialvelocity variations in the ulx binary system, requiring a $\gtrsim 100$$m_\odot$ black hole. we therefore conclude that rx~j004722.4-252051 is astrong candidate for a ulx containing a massive stellar black hole.

0705.3611	evidence for a jet contribution to the optical/infrared light of neutron  star x-ray binaries	optical/near-infrared (optical/nir; oir) light from low-mass neutron starx-ray binaries (nsxbs) in outburst is traditionally thought to be thermalemission from the accretion disc. here we present a comprehensive collection ofquasi-simultaneous oir and x-ray data from 19 low-magnetic field nsxbs,including new observations of three sources: 4u 0614+09, lmc x-2 and gx 349+2.the average radio-oir spectrum for nsxbs is alpha ~ +0.2 (where l_nu proptonu^alpha) at least at high luminosities when the radio jet is detected. this iscomparable to, but slightly more inverted than the alpha ~ 0.0 found for blackhole x-ray binaries. the oir spectra and relations between oir and x-ray fluxesare compared to those expected if the oir emission is dominated by thermalemission from an x-ray or viscously heated disc, or synchrotron emission fromthe inner regions of the jets. we find that thermal emission due to x-rayreprocessing can explain all the data except at high luminosities for somensxbs, namely the atolls and millisecond x-ray pulsars (msxps). optically thinsynchrotron emission from the jets (with an observed oir spectral index ofalpha_thin &lt; 0) dominate the nir light above l_x ~ 10^36 erg/s and the opticalabove l_x ~ 10^37 erg/s in these systems. for nsxb z-sources, the oirobservations can be explained by x-ray reprocessing alone, although synchrotronemission may make a low level contribution to the nir, and could dominate theoir in one or two cases.

(1998)and the value of n_h we derived from our spectral fits, the distance to rxj170930.2-263927 can be constrained to 2.5-10 kpc. rx j170930.2-263927 isprobably associated with the low-metalicity globular cluster ngc 6293, whichhas a tidal radius of 14.2 arcminutes, since the projected distance to thecentre of the cluster is approximately 25 parsec (9-10 arcminutes). if theassociation is correct, rx j170930.2-263927 would be at ~8.5 kpc. we determinedthat l_outburst / l_quiescence is approximately 10^5 for this outburst. if thequiescent luminosity is caused by cooling of the neutron star core thenenhanced core cooling processes were at work implying a neutron star mass of\~1.7-1.8 msun. combining our chandra observations with archival rosatobservations we show that the source most likely exhibits periods of sustainedlow-level accretion. variable, low-level activity could provide an alternativeexplanation for some of the sources in the recently proposed category of faintsoft x-ray transients. we found excess emission at ~0.6 kev. if such an excessis a unique feature of ultracompact systems, as was recently proposed, rxj170930.2-263927 must have a short orbital period as well. from the constraintson the distance and the non-detection of the optical counterpart with m_v&lt;20.5,we conclude that this system must have a low-mass companion.

astro-ph;0306614	jet-dominated states: an alternative to advection across black hole  event horizons in `quiescent' x-ray binaries	we demonstrate that at relatively low mass accretion rates, black holecandidate (bhc) x-ray binaries (xrbs) should enter `jet-dominated' states, inwhich the majority of the liberated accretion power is in the form of a(radiatively inefficient) jet and not dissipated as x-rays in the accretionflow. this result follows from the empirically established non-linear relationbetween radio and x-ray power from low/hard state bhc xrbs, which we assumealso to hold for neutron star (ns) xrbs. conservative estimates of the jetpower indicate that all bhc xrbs in `quiescence' should be in thisjet-dominated regime. in combination with an additional empirical result,namely that bhc xrbs are more `radio loud' than ns xrbs, we find that inquiescence ns xrbs should be up to two orders of magnitude more luminous inx-rays than bhc xrbs, without requiring any significant advection of energyinto a black hole. this ratio is as observed, and such observations shouldtherefore no longer be considered as direct evidence for the existence of blackhole event horizons. furthermore, even if bhcs do contain black holes withevent horizons, this work demonstrates that there is no requirement for theadvection of significant amounts of accretion energy across the horizon.

astro-ph;0309229	ms 1603.6+2600: an accretion disc corona source?	we have observed the eclipsing low-mass x-ray binary ms1603.6+2600 withchandra for 7 ksec. the x-ray spectrum is well fit with a single absorbedpowerlaw with an index of ~2. we find a clear sinusoidal modulation in thex-ray lightcurve with a period of 1.7+-0.2 hours, consistent with the period of1.85 hours found before. however, no (partial) eclipses were found. we arguethat if the x-ray flare observed in earlier x-ray observations was a type ix-ray burst then the source can only be an accretion disc corona source at adistance between ~11-24 kpc (implying a height above the galactic disk of ~8-17kpc). it has also been proposed in the literature that ms1603.76+2600 is adipper at ~75 kpc. we argue that in this dipper scenario the observed opticalproperties of ms1603.6+2600 are difficult to reconcile with the opticalproperties one would expect on the basis of comparisons with other highinclination low-mass x-ray binaries, unless the x-ray flare was not a type ix-ray burst. in that case the source can be a nearby soft x-ray transientaccreting at a quiescent rate as was proposed by hakala et al.(1998) or a highinclination source at ~15-20 kpc.

astro-ph;0311560	the faint neutron star soft x-ray transient sax j1810.8-2609 in  quiescence	we present the analysis of a 35 ksec long chandra observation of the neutronstar soft x-ray transient (sxt) sax j1810.8-2609. we detect three sources inthe field of view. the position of one of them is consistent with the locationof the rosat error circle of sax j1810.8-2609. the accurate chandra position ofthat source coincides with the position of the proposed optical counterpart,strengthening the identification as the counterpart. we detected the neutronstar sxt system in quiescence at an unabsorbed luminosity of ~1x10^32 erg s^-1(assuming a distance of 4.9 kpc). this luminosity is at the low-end ofquiescent luminosities found in other neutron star sxts. this renders supportto the existence of a group of faint soft x-ray transients of which theaccreting millisecond x-ray pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 is the most prominentmember. the quiescent spectrum of sax j1810.8-2609 is well-fit with an absorbedpower law with photon index of 3.3+-0.5. with a value of 3.3x10^21 cm^-2 thegalactic absorption is consistent with the value derived in outburst. since thespectra of quiescent neutron star sxts are often fit with an absorbed blackbodyor neutron star atmosphere plus power-law model we also fitted the spectrumusing those fit functions. both models provide a good fit to the data. ifcooling of the neutron star core and/or crust is responsible for the soft partof the spectrum the time averaged mass accretion rate must have been very low(~5.7x10^-13 msun yr^-1; assuming standard core cooling only) or the neutronstar must be massive. we also discuss the possibility that the thermal spectralcomponent in neutron stars in quiescence is produced by residual accretion.

astro-ph;0407168	the distances to galactic low-mass x-ray binaries: consequences for  black hole luminosities and kicks	we investigated the reported distances of galactic black hole (bh) andneutron star low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). comparing the distances derivedfor the neutron stars cygx-2 and xte j2123-058 using the observed eddingtonlimited photospheric radius expansion bursts with the distances derived usingthe observed radius and effective temperature of the companion star we findthat the latter are smaller by approximately a factor of 1.5-2. the lattermethod is often employed to determine the distance to bh lmxbs. a possibleexplanation for this discrepancy is that the stellar absorption lines in fastrotating companion stars are different from those in the slowly rotatingtemplate stars as was found before for early type stars. this could lead to asystematic mis-classification of the spectral type of the companion star, whichin turn would yield a systematic error in the distance. we find that, using newdistances for xte j1550-564 and v404 cyg, the maximum outburst luminosity forat least 5 but perhaps even 7 of the 15 bh soft x-ray transients exceeds theeddington luminosity for a 10 m_sun bh showing that these systems would beclassified as ultra-luminous x-ray sources had we observed them in othergalaxies. this renders support for the idea that many ultra-luminous x-raysources are stellar-mass rather than intermediate-mass bhs. we find that therms value of the distance to the galactic plane for bhs is consistent with thatof neutron star lmxbs. this suggests that bhs could also receive akick-velocity during their formation although this has to be investigated inmore detail.

astro-ph;0606721	global optical/infrared - x-ray correlations in x-ray binaries:  quantifying disc and jet contributions	the optical/near-infrared (oir) region of the spectra of low-mass x-raybinaries appears to lie at the intersection of a variety of different emissionprocesses. in this paper we present quasi-simultaneous oir - x-ray observationsof 33 xbs in an attempt to estimate the contributions of various emissionprocesses in these sources, as a function of x-ray state and luminosity. aglobal correlation is found between oir and x-ray luminosity for low-mass blackhole candidate xbs (bhxbs) in the hard x-ray state, of the form l_oir isproportional to lx^0.6. this correlation holds over 8 orders of magnitude in lxand includes data from bhxbs in quiescence and at large distances (lmc andm31). a similar correlation is found in low-mass neutron star xbs (nsxbs) inthe hard state. for bhxbs in the soft state, all the near-infrared (nir) andsome of the optical emission is suppressed below the correlation, a behaviourindicative of the jet switching off/on in transition to/from the soft state. wecompare these relations to theoretical models of a number of emissionprocesses. we find that x-ray reprocessing in the disc and emission from thejets both predict a slope close to 0.6 for bhxbs, and both contribute to theoir in bhxbs in the hard state, the jets producing ~90 percent of the niremission at high luminosities. x-ray reprocessing dominates the oir in nsxbs inthe hard state, with possible contributions from the jets (only at highluminosity) and the viscously heated disc. we also show that the opticallythick jet spectrum of bhxbs extends to near the k-band.

astro-ph;0608089	discovery of twin khz qpos in the peculiar x-ray binary circinus x-1	we report the discovery with the rxte/pca of twin khz qpos in cir x-1. elevencases of simultaneous double qpos occurred, with significances of up to 6.3 and5.5 sigma and centroid frequencies ranging between approximately 56-225 and230-500 hz for the two qpo peaks, respectively, i.e., for the most part atfrequencies well below those of other sources. the qpo properties clearlyindicate that these double peaks are the khz qpos known from low magnetic fieldneutron stars, and not black-hole high-frequency qpos, confirming that cir x-1is a neutron star. the khz qpo peak separation varies over a wide range,\~175-340 hz, and increases with qpo frequency. this is contrary to what isseen in other sources but agrees with predictions of the relativisticprecession model and alfven wave models; beat-frequency models requiremodification to accommodate this. in other observations single khz qpos can beseen down to frequencies as low as ~12 hz, as well as a strong low-frequency(lf) qpo between 1 and 30 hz. the relations between the frequencies of the khzqpos and the lf qpo are in good agreement with those found previously in zsources, confirming that cir x-1 may be a peculiar z source. we suggest thatthe low frequencies of the khz qpos in cir x-1 and to a lesser extent in(other) z sources might be due to a relatively stronger radial inflow to theneutron star than in other khz qpo sources.

astro-ph;0612232	constraints on thermal x-ray radiation from sax j1808.4-3658 and  implications for neutron star neutrino emission	thermal x-ray radiation from neutron star soft x-ray transients in quiescenceprovides the strongest constraints on the cooling rates of neutron stars, andthus on the interior composition and properties of matter in the cores ofneutron stars. we analyze new (2006) and archival (2001) xmm-newtonobservations of the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 inquiescence, which provide the most stringent constraints to date. the x-rayspectrum of sax j1808.4-3658 in the 2006 observation is consistent with apower-law of photon index 1.83\pm0.17, without requiring the presence of ablackbody-like component from a neutron star atmosphere. our 2006 observationshows a slightly lower 0.5-10 kev x-ray luminosity, at a level of68^{+15}_{-13}% that inferred from the 2001 observation. simultaneous fittingof all available xmm data allows a constraint on the quiescent neutron star(0.01-10 kev) luminosity of l_{ns}&lt;1.1*10^{31} erg/s. this limit excludes somecurrent models of neutrino emission mediated by pion condensates, and providesfurther evidence for additional cooling processes, such as neutrino emissionvia direct urca processes involving nucleons and/or hyperons, in the cores ofmassive neutron stars.

astro-ph;0701095	observations of the 599 hz accreting x-ray pulsar igr j00291+5934 during  the 2004 outburst and in quiescence	we report on optical and nir observations obtained during and after the 2004december discovery outburst of the x-ray transient and accretion-poweredmillisecond pulsar igr j00291+5934. our observations monitored the evolution ofthe brightness and the spectral properties of j00291 during the outburst decaytowards quiescence. we also present optical, nir and chandra observationsobtained during true quiescence. photometry of the field during outburstreveals an optical and nir counterpart that brightened from r~23 to r~17 andfrom k=19 to k~16. spectral analysis of the rijhk broadband photometry showsexcess in the nir bands that may be due to synchrotron emission. the halphaemission line profile suggests the orbital inclination is ~22-32 degrees. thepreferred range for the reddening towards the source is 0.7 &lt; e(b-v) &lt; 0.9,which is equivalent to 4.06e21 cm^-2 &lt; nh &lt; 5.22e21 cm^-2. the chandraobservations of the pulsar in its quiescent state gave an unabsorbed 0.5-10 kevflux for the best-fitting power-law model to the source spectrum of (7.0 +/-0.9)e-14 ergs/cm^2/s (adopting a hydrogen column of 4.6e21 cm^-2. the fitresulted in a power-law photon index of 2.4 +/- 0.5. the (r-k)o color observedduring quiescence supports an irradiated donor star and accretion disk. weestimate a distance of 2 to 4 kpc towards j00291 by using the outburst x-raylight curve and the estimated critical x-ray luminosity necessary to keep theouter parts of the accretion disk ionized. using the quiescent x-ray luminosityand the spin period, we constrain the magnetic field of the neutron star to be&lt; 3e8 gauss.

astro-ph;0701810	six new candidate ultracompact x-ray binaries	ultracompact x-ray binaries (ucxbs) appear able to sustain accretion onto thecompact accretor at rates lower than in wider x-ray binaries. this may beunderstood by the smaller accretion disks in ucxbs: a lower x-ray luminositysuffices to keep a disk completely ionized through irradiation and, thus, keepthe viscosity at a sufficiently high level to allow effective transport ofmatter to the compact object. we employ this distinguishing factor on data fromrxte and bepposax to identify six new candidate ucxbs, thus increasing thepopulation by one quarter. the candidates are drawn from the population ofpersistently accreting and type-i x-ray bursting low-mass x-ray binaries. thex-ray bursts establish the low-mass x-ray binary nature and provide a handle onthe accretion rate. we find that the low accretion rates are supported by thelong burst recurrence times and the hard x-ray spectra of the persistentemission as derived from the 2nd integral catalog of soft gamma-ray sources. wediscuss the peculiar light curves of some new ucxb candidates.

astro-ph;0703020	the quasi-persistent neutron star soft x-ray transient 1m 1716-315 in  quiescence	we report on our analysis of a 20 ksec chandra x-ray observation of thequasi-persistent neutron star soft x-ray transient (sxt) 1m1716-315 inquiescence. only one source was detected in the heao-i error region. itsluminosity is 1.6e32-1.3e33 erg s-1. in this the range is dominated by theuncertainty in the source distance. the source spectrum is well described by anabsorbed soft spectrum, e.g. a neutron star atmosphere or black body model. nooptical or near-infrared counterpart is present at the location of the x-raysource, down to a magnitude limit of i&gt; 23.5 and k_s&gt; 19.5. the positionalevidence, the soft x-ray spectrum together with the optical and near-infrarednon-detections provide strong evidence that this source is the quiescentneutron star sxt. the source is 10-100 times too bright in x-rays in order tobe explained by stellar coronal x-ray emission. together with the interstellarextinction measured in outburst and estimates for the source distance, thereported optical and near-infrared limit give an upper limit on the absolutemagnitude of the counterpart of i&gt;8.6 and k_s&gt;5.1. this implies that the systemis either an ultra-compact x-ray binary having p_orb&lt;1 hr or the companion staris an m-dwarf. we reconstructed the long term x-ray lightcurve of the source.1m1716-315 has been active for more than 12 years before returning toquiescence, the reported chandra observation started 16.9+-4.1 years after theoutburst ended.

0810.0489	optical observations of sax j1808.4-3658 during quiescence	we observed the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4-3658 withgemini-south in g' and i' bands, nearly simultaneous with xmm-newtonobservations. a clear periodic flux modulation on the system's orbital periodis present, consistent with the varying aspect of the donor star's heated face.we model the contributions of a disk and donor star to these optical bands. toproduce the observed modulation amplitudes, we conclude that the donor must beirradiated by an external flux 2 orders of magnitude greater than provided bythe measured x-ray luminosity. a possible explanation for this irradiation isthat the radio pulsar mechanism becomes active during the quiescent state assuggested by burderi et al., with relativistic particles heating the donor'sday-side face. our modelling constrains the binary inclination to be between 36and 67 degrees. we obtain estimates for the pulsar mass of &gt;2.2 solar masses(although this limit is sensitive to the source's distance), consistent withthe accelerated ns cooling in this system indicated by x-ray observations. wealso estimate the donor mass to be in the range of 0.07-0.11 solar masses,providing further indications that the system underwent non-standard binaryevolution to reach its current state.

0810.0497	further constraints on thermal quiescent x-ray emission from sax  j1808.4-3658	we observed sax j1808.4-3658 (1808), the first accreting millisecond pulsar,in deep quiescence with xmm-newton and (near-simultaneously) gemini-south. thex-ray spectrum of 1808 is similar to that observed in quiescence in 2001 and2006, describable by an absorbed power-law with photon index 1.74+-0.11 andunabsorbed x-ray luminosity l_x=7.9+-0.7*10^{31} ergs/s, for n_h=1.3*10^{21}cm^{-2}. fitting all the quiescent xmm-newton x-ray spectra with a power-law,we constrain any thermally emitting neutron star with a hydrogen atmosphere tohave a temperature less than 30 ev and l_{ns}(0.01-10 kev)&lt;6.2*10^{30} ergs/s.a thermal plasma model also gives an acceptable fit to the continuum. adding aneutron star component to the plasma model produces less stringent constraintson the neutron star; a temperature of 36^{+4}_{-8} ev and l_{ns}(0.01-10kev)=1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8}*10^{31} ergs/s. in the framework of the current theoryof neutron star heating and cooling, the constraints on the thermal luminosityof 1808 and 1h 1905+000 require strongly enhanced cooling in the cores of theseneutron stars.  we compile data from the literature on the mass transfer rates and quiescentthermal flux of the largest possible sample of transient neutron star lmxbs. weidentify a thermal component in the quiescent spectrum of the accretingmillisecond pulsar igr j00291+5934, which is consistent with the standardcooling model. the contrast between the cooling rates of igr j00291+5934 and1808 suggests that 1808 may have a significantly larger mass. this can beinterpreted as arising from differences in the binary evolution history orinitial neutron star mass in these otherwise similar systems.

0812.3327	the formation of the black hole in the x-ray binary system v404 cyg	using new and archival radio data, we have measured the proper motion of theblack hole x-ray binary v404 cyg to be 9.2+/-0.3 mas/yr. combined with thesystemic radial velocity from the literature, we derive the fullthree-dimensional heliocentric space velocity of the system, which we use tocalculate a peculiar velocity in the range 47-102 km/s, with a best fittingvalue of 64 km/s. we consider possible explanations for the observed peculiarvelocity, and find that the black hole cannot have formed via direct collapse.a natal supernova is required, in which either significant mass (approximately11 solar masses) was lost, giving rise to a symmetric blaauw kick of up to 65km/s, or, more probably, asymmetries in the supernova led to an additional kickout of the orbital plane of the binary system. in the case of a purelysymmetric kick, the black hole must have been formed with a mass ofapproximately 9 solar masses, since when it has accreted 0.5-1.5 solar massesfrom its companion.
