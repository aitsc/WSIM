0908.0245	structure and population of the andromeda stellar halo from a  subaru/suprime-cam survey	we present a photometric survey of the stellar halo of the andromeda galaxy,using suprime-cam on the subaru telescope. a detailed analysis of vicolor-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population is used to measureproperties such as line-of-sight distance, surface brightness, metallicity, andage, and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of them31 halo: (1) several substructures, and (2) the smooth halo. first, we studym31's halo substructure along the north-west/south-east minor axis out to r ~100 kpc and the south-west major axis region at r ~ 60 kpc. we confirm twosubstructures in the south-east halo reported by ibata et al. (2007) anddiscover two overdense substructures in the north-west halo. we investigate theproperties of these four substructures as well as other structures includingthe western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among thesesystems, thereby suggesting each has a different origin. our statisticalanalysis implies that the m31 halo as a whole may contain at least 16substructures, each with a different origin. second, we investigate theproperties of an underlying, smooth and extended halo component out to r &gt; 100kpc. we find that the surface density of this smooth halo can be fitted to ahernquist model of scale radius ~ 17 kpc or a power-law profile with ~ r^{-2.17+/- 0.15}. in contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo density profile,its metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform withnon-monotonic variations with radius, suggesting that the halo population hasnot had sufficient time to dynamically homogenize the accreted populations.further implications for the formation of the m31 halo are discussed.

0911.3654	local group dwarf elliptical galaxies: ii. stellar kinematics to large  radii in ngc 147 and ngc 185	we present kinematic and metallicity profiles for the m31 dwarf elliptical(de) satellite galaxies ngc 147 and ngc 185. the profiles represent the mostextensive spectroscopic radial coverage for any de galaxy, extending to aprojected distance of eight half-light radii (8 r_eff = 14'). we achieve thiscoverage via keck/deimos multislit spectroscopic observations of 520 and 442member red giant branch stars in ngc 147 and ngc 185, respectively. in contrastto previous studies, we find that both des have significant internal rotation.we measure a maximum rotational velocity of 17+/-2 km/s for ngc 147 and 15+/-5km/s for ngc 185. the velocity dispersions decrease gently with radius with anaverage dispersion of 16+/-1 km/s for ngc 147 and 24+/-1 km/s for ngc 185. bothdes have internal metallicity dispersions of 0.5 dex, but show no evidence fora radial metallicity gradient. we construct two-integral axisymmetric dynamicalmodels and find that the observed kinematical profiles cannot be explainedwithout modest amounts of non-baryonic dark matter. we measure centralmass-to-light ratios of ml_v = 4.2+/-0.6 and ml_v = 4.6+/-0.6 for ngc 147 andngc 185, respectively. both de galaxies are consistent with being primarilyflattened by their rotational motions, although some anisotropic velocitydispersion is needed to fully explain their observed shapes. the velocityprofiles of all three local group des (ngc 147, ngc 185 and ngc 205) suggestthat rotation is more prevalent in the de galaxy class than previously assumed,but is often manifest only at several times the effective radius. since all desoutside the local group have been probed to only inside the effective radius,this opens the door for formation mechanisms in which des are transformed orstripped versions of gas-rich rotating progenitor galaxies.

1204.2940	evolution in the dust lane fraction of edge-on l* spiral galaxies since  z=0.8	the presence of a well-defined and narrow dust lane in an edge-on spiralgalaxy is the observational signature of a thin and dense molecular disk, inwhich gravitational collapse has overcome turbulence. using a sample ofgalaxies out to z~1 extracted from the cosmos survey, we identify the fractionof massive disks that display a dust lane. our goal is to explore the evolutionin the stability of the molecular ism disks in spiral galaxies over a cosmictimescale. we check the reliability of our morphological classificationsagainst changes in restframe wavelength, resolution, and cosmic dimming with(artificially redshifted) images of local galaxies from sdss. we find that thefraction of l* disks with dust lanes in cosmos is consistent with the localfraction (~80%) out to z~0.7. at z=0.8, the dust lane fraction is only slightlylower. a somewhat lower dust lane fraction in starbursting galaxies tentativelysupports the notion that a high specific star formation rate can efficientlydestroy or inhibit a dense molecular disk. a small subsample of higher redshiftcosmos galaxies display low internal reddening (e[b-v]), as well as a lowincidence of dust lanes. these may be disks in which the growth of the dustyism disk lags behind that of the stellar disk. we note that at z=0.8, the mostmassive galaxies display a lower dust lane fraction than lower mass galaxies. asmall contribution of recent mergers or starbursts to this most massivepopulation may be responsible. the fact that the fraction of galaxies with dustlanes in cosmos is consistent with little or no evolution implies that modelsto explain the spectral energy distribution or the host galaxy dust extinctionof supernovae based on local galaxies are still applicable to higher redshiftspirals. it also suggests that dust lanes are long lived phenomena or can bereformed over very short time-scales.

1302.5111	the velocity anisotropy of distant milky way halo stars from hubble  space telescope proper motions	based on long baseline (5-7 years) multi-epoch hst/acs photometry, usedpreviously to measure the proper motion of m31, we present the proper motions(pms) of 13 main-sequence milky way halo stars. the sample lies at an averagedistance of r ~24 kpc from the galactic center, with a root-mean-square spreadof 6 kpc. at this distance, the median pm accuracy is 5 km/s. we devise amaximum likelihood routine to determine the tangential velocity ellipsoid ofthe stellar halo. the velocity second moments in the directions of the galactic(l,b) system are &lt; vl^2 &gt;^{1/2} = 123 (+29, -23) km/s, and &lt; vb^2 &gt;^{1/2} = 83(+24, -16) km/s. we combine these results with the known line-of-sight secondmoment, &lt; vlos^2 &gt;^{1/2} = 105 \pm 5$ km/s, at this &lt; r &gt; to study the velocityanisotropy of the halo. we find approximate isotropy between the radial andtangential velocity distributions, with anisotropy parameter beta = 0.0 (+0.2,-0.4). our results suggest that the stellar halo velocity anisotropy out to r ~30 kpc is less radially biased than solar neighborhood measurements. this isopposite to what is expected from violent relaxation, and may indicate thepresence of a shell-type structure at r ~ 24 kpc. with additional multi-epochhst data, the method presented here has the ability to measure the transversekinematics of the halo for more stars, and to larger distances. this can yieldnew improved constraints on the stellar halo formation mechanism, and the massof the milky way.

1304.7769	the stellar initial mass function of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies:  evidence for imf variations with galactic environment	we present constraints on the stellar initial mass function (imf) in twoultra-faint dwarf (ufd) galaxies, hercules and leo iv, based on deep hst/acsimaging. the hercules and leo iv galaxies are extremely low luminosity (m_v =-6.2, -5.5), metal-poor (&lt;[fe/h]&gt;= -2.4, -2.5) systems that have old stellarpopulations (&gt; 11 gyr). because they have long relaxation times, we candirectly measure the low-mass stellar imf by counting stars below themain-sequence turnoff without correcting for dynamical evolution. over thestellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52 - 0.77 msun, the imf is best fit bya power-law slope of alpha = 1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.5} for hercules and alpha = 1.3 +/-0.8 for leo iv. for hercules, the imf slope is more shallow than a salpeter imf(alpha=2.35) at the 5.8-sigma level, and a kroupa imf (alpha=2.3 above 0.5msun) at 5.4-sigma level. we simultaneously fit for the binary fraction,finding f_binary = 0.47^{+0.16}_{-0.14} for hercules, and 0.47^{+0.37}_{-0.17}for leo iv. the ufd binary fractions are consistent with that inferred formilky way stars in the same mass range, despite very different metallicities.in contrast, the imf slopes in the ufds are shallower than other galacticenvironments. in the mass range 0.5 - 0.8 msun, we see a trend across thehandful of galaxies with directly measured imfs such that the power-law slopesbecome shallower (more bottom-light) with decreasing galactic velocitydispersion and metallicity. this trend is qualitatively consistent with resultsin elliptical galaxies inferred via indirect methods and is direct evidence forimf variations with galactic environment.

0804.0798	darwin tames an andromeda dwarf: unraveling the orbit of ngc 205 using a  genetic algorithm	ngc 205, a close satellite of the m31 galaxy, is our nearest example of adwarf elliptical galaxy. photometric and kinematic observations suggest thatngc 205 is undergoing tidal distortion from its interaction with m31. despiteearlier attempts, the orbit and progenitor properties of ngc 205 are not wellknown. we perform an optimized search for these unknowns by combining a geneticalgorithm with restricted n-body simulations of the interaction. this approach,coupled with photometric and kinematic observations as constraints, allows foran effective exploration of the parameter space. we represent ngc 205 as astatic hernquist potential with embedded massless test particles that serve astracers of surface brightness. we explore 3 distinct, initially stableconfigurations of test particles: cold rotating disk, warm rotating disk, andhot, pressure-supported spheroid. each model reproduces some, but not all, ofthe observed features of ngc 205, leading us to speculate that a rotatingprogenitor with substantial pressure support could match all of theobservables. furthermore, plausible combinations of mass and scale length forthe pressure-supported spheroid progenitor model reproduce the observedvelocity dispersion profile. for all 3 models, orbits that best match theobservables place the satellite 11+/-9 kpc behind m31 moving at very largevelocities: 300-500 km/s on primarily radial orbits. given that the observedradial component is only 54 km/s, this implies a large tangential motion forngc 205, moving from the nw to the se. these results suggest ngc 205 is notassociated with the stellar arc observed to the ne of ngc 205. furthermore, ngc205's velocity appears to be near or greater than its escape velocity,signifying that the satellite is likely on its first m31 passage.

1503.00720	a comprehensive archival search for counterparts to ultra-compact high  velocity clouds: five local volume dwarf galaxies	we report five local volume dwarf galaxies (two of which are presented herefor the first time) uncovered during a comprehensive archival search foroptical counterparts to ultra-compact high velocity clouds (uchvcs). the uchvcpopulation of hi clouds are thought to be candidate gas-rich, low mass halos atthe edge of the local group and beyond, but no comprehensive search for stellarcounterparts to these systems has been presented. careful visual inspection ofall publicly available optical and ultraviolet imaging at the position of theuchvcs revealed six blue, diffuse counterparts with a morphology consistentwith a faint dwarf galaxy beyond the local group. optical spectroscopy of allsix candidate dwarf counterparts show that five have an h$\alpha$-derivedvelocity consistent with the coincident hi cloud, confirming their association,the sixth diffuse counterpart is likely a background object. the size andluminosity of the uchvc dwarfs is consistent with other known local volumedwarf irregular galaxies. the gas fraction ($m_{hi}/m_{star}$) of the fivedwarfs are generally consistent with that of dwarf irregular galaxies in thelocal volume, although alfalfa-dw1 (associated with alfalfa uchvchvc274.68+74.70$-$123) has a very high $m_{hi}/m_{star}$$\sim$40. despite theheterogenous nature of our search, we demonstrate that the current dwarfcompanions to uchvcs are at the edge of detectability due to their low surfacebrightness, and that deeper searches are likely to find more stellar systems.if more sensitive searches do not reveal further stellar counterparts touchvcs, then the dearth of such systems around the local group may be inconflict with $\lambda$cdm simulations.

1504.06111	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics). v. ultraviolet  diffuse emission and cirrus properties in the virgo cluster direction	context: the virgo direction has been observed at many wavelengths in therecent years, in particular in the ultraviolet with galex. the far ultraviolet(fuv) diffuse light detected by galex bears interesting information on thelarge scale distribution of galactic dust, owing to the galex fuv bandsensitivity and resolution. aims: we aim to characterise the ultraviolet largescale distribution of diffuse emission in the virgo direction. a map of thisemission may become useful for various studies by identifying regions wheredust affects observations by either scattering light or absorbing radiation.methods: we construct mosaics of the fuv and near ultraviolet diffuse emissionover a large sky region (ra 12 to 13 hours, dec 0 to 20 degrees) surroundingthe virgo cluster, using all the galex available data in the area. we test forthe first time the utilisation of the fuv diffuse light as a galacticextinction e(b-v) tracer. results: the fuv diffuse light scattered on cirrusreveals details in their geometry. despite a large dispersion, the fuv diffuselight correlates roughly with other galactic dust tracers (coming from iras,herschel, planck), offering an opportunity to use the fuv emission to locatethem in future studies with a better resolution (about 5 arcsec nativeresolution, 20 arcsec pixels maps presented in this paper) than several usualtracers. estimating the galactic dust extinction on the basis of this emissionallows us to find a smaller dispersion in the nuv-i colour of backgroundgalaxies at a given e(b-v)than with other tracers. the diffuse light mosaicsobtained in this work are made publicly available.

astro-ph;0008155	dynamical mass estimates for the halo of m31 from keck spectroscopy	the last few months have seen the measurements of the radial velocities ofall of the dwarf spheroidal companions to the andromeda galaxy (m31) using thespectrographs (hires and lris) on the keck telescope. this paper summarises thedata on the radial velocities and distances for all the companion galaxies andpresents new dynamical modelling to estimate the mass of extended halo of m31.the best fit values for the total mass of m31 are between 7 and 10 x 10^{11}solar masses, depending on the details of the modelling. the mass estimate isaccompanied by considerable uncertainty caused by the smallness of the dataset;for example, the upper bound on the total mass is roughly 24 x 10^{11} solarmasses, while the lower bound is about 3 x 10^{11} solar masses. these valuesare less than the most recent estimates of the most likely mass of the milkyway halo. bearing in mind all the uncertainties, a fair conclusion is that them31 halo is roughly as massive as that of the milky way halo. there is nodynamical evidence for the widely held belief that m31 is more massive -- itmay even be less massive.

astro-ph;0404009	measuring the slope of the dust extinction law and the power spectrum of  dust clouds using differentially-reddened globular clusters	we present 3 methods for measuring the galactic dust extinction law slope r_vand a method for quantifying fine structure in dust clouds in the direction ofdifferentially-reddened globular clusters. we apply these methods to the low-latitude globular cluster ngc4833 which displays variable extinction/reddeningabout a mean &lt;a_v&gt; ~ 1. a set of monte carlo simulations is used tocharacterize the efficacy of the methods. the essence of the first 2 methods isto determine, for an assumed value of r_v, the relative visual extinctiondelta(a_v) of each cluster horizontal branch (hb) star with respect to anempirical hb locus; the locus is derived from the cmd of a subset of stars nearthe cluster center in which differential reddening is small. a star-by-starcomparison of delta(a_v) from the (b-v,v) cmd with that from the (v-i,v) cmd isused to find the optimal r_v. in the third method, r_v is determined byminimizing the scatter in the hb in the (b-v, v) cmd after correcting thephotometry for extinction and reddening using the schlegel et al. (1998) dustmaps. the weighted average of the results from 3 methods gives r_v = 3.0 +/-0.4 for the dust towards ngc4833. the dust fine structure is quantified via thedifference, delta(a_v)_ij = [delta(a_v)]_i - [delta(a_v)]_j, between pairs ofcluster hb stars (i,j) as a function of their angular separation r_ij. thevariance of delta(a_v)_ij is found to have a power- law dependence on angularscale: var(r) \propto r^(+0.9 +/- 0.1). this translates into an angular powerspectrum p(kappa) \propto kappa^(-1.9 +/- 0.1) for r ~ 1' - 5', where kappa =1/r. the dust angular power spectrum on small scales (from optical data)matches smoothly onto the larger-scale power spectrum derived from schlegel etal.'s far-infrared map of the dust thermal emission.

astro-ph;0501240	investigating the andromeda stream: i. simple analytic bulge-disk-halo  model for m31	this paper is the first in a series which studies interactions between m31and its satellites, including the origin of the giant southern stream. weconstruct accurate yet simple analytic models for the potential of the m31galaxy to provide an easy basis for calculation of orbits in m31's halo. we usean nfw dark halo, an exponential disk, a hernquist bulge, and a central blackhole point mass to describe the galaxy potential. we constrain the parametersof these functions by comparing to existing surface brightness, velocitydispersion, and rotation curve measurements of m31. our description provides agood fit to the observations, and agrees well with more sophisticated modelingof m31. while in many respects the parameter set is well constrained, there issubstantial uncertainty in the outer halo potential and a near-degeneracybetween the disk and halo components, producing a large, nearly two-dimensionalallowed region in parameter space. we limit the allowed region usingtheoretical expectations for the halo concentration, baryonic content, andstellar $m/l$ ratio, finding a smaller region where the parameters arephysically plausible. our proposed mass model for m31 has $m_{bulge} = 3.2\times 10^{10} \msun$, $m_{disk} = 7.2 \times 10^{10} \msun$, and $m_{200} =7.1\times 10^{11} \msun$, with uncorrected (for internal and foregroundextinction) mass-to-light ratios of $m/l_r = 3.9$ and 3.3 for the bulge anddisk, respectively. we present some illustrative test particle orbits for theprogenitor of the stellar stream in our galaxy potential, highlighting theeffects of the remaining uncertainty in the disk and halo masses.

astro-ph;0501241	investigating the andromeda stream: ii. orbital fits and properties of  the progenitor	we construct test-particle orbits and simple n-body models that match theproperties of the giant stellar stream observed to the south of m31, using themodel of m31's potential derived in the companion paper by geehan et al.(2006). we introduce a simple approximation to account for the difference inposition between the stream and the orbit of the progenitor; this significantlyaffects the best-fitting orbits. the progenitor orbits we derive have orbitalapocenter $\sim 60 \kpc$ and pericenter $\sim 3 \kpc$, though these quantitiesvary somewhat with the current orbital phase of the progenitor which is as yetunknown. our best combined fit to the stream and galaxy properties implies amass within 125 kpc of m31 of $(7.4 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{11} \msun$. based onits length, width, luminosity, and velocity dispersion, we conclude that thestream originates from a progenitor satellite with mass $m_s \sim 10^9 \msun$,and at most modest amounts of dark matter; the estimate of $m_s$ is againcorrelated with the phase of the progenitor. m31 displays a large number offaint features in its inner halo which may be progenitors or continuations ofthe stream. while the orbital fits are not constrained enough for us toconclusively identify the progenitor, we can identify several plausiblecandidates, of which a feature in the planetary nebula distribution found bymerrett et al. is the most plausible, and rule out several others. we makepredictions for the kinematic properties of the successful candidates. thesemay aid in observational identification of the progenitor object, which wouldgreatly constrain the allowed models of the stream.

(2006), we produce a very similarstructure in an n-body simulation. in this scenario, the tidal stream producedat pericenter of the satellite's orbit matches the observed southern stream,while the forward continuation of this tidal stream makes up two orbital loops,broadened into fan-like structures by successive pericentric passages; theseloops correspond to the ne and w shelves. the tidal debris from the satellitealso reproduces a previously-observed "stream" of counterrotating pne and arelated stream seen in red giant stars. the debris pattern in our simulationresembles the shell systems detected around many elliptical galaxies, thoughthis is the first identification of a shell system in a spiral galaxy and thefirst in any galaxy close enough to allow measurements of stellar velocitiesand relative distances. we discuss the physics of these partial shells,highlighting the role played by spatial and velocity caustics in theobservations. we show that kinematic surveys of the tidal debris will provide asensitive measurement of m31's halo potential, while quantifying the surfacedensity of debris in the shelves will let us reconstruct the original mass andtime of disruption of the progenitor satellite.

astro-ph;9605204	internal kinematics of distant field galaxies: i. emission line widths  for a complete sample of faint blue galaxies at &lt;z&gt;=0.25	we present measurements of the oii(3727) emission line width for a completesample of 24 blue field galaxies (21.25&lt;b&lt;22, b-r&lt;1.2) at &lt;z&gt;=0.25, obtainedwith the autofib fibre spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. mostemission lines are spectrally resolved, yet all have dispersions sigma&lt;100km/s.five of the 24 sample members have oii doublet line flux ratios which imply gasdensities in excess of 100 cm^-3. the line emission in these galaxies may bedominated by an active nucleus and the galaxies have been eliminated from thesubsequent analysis. the remaining 19 linewidths are too large by a factor oftwo (7sigma significance) to be attributed to turbulent motions within anindividual star forming region, and therefore most likely reflect the orbitalmotion of ionized gas in the galaxy. we use fabry--perot observations of nearbygalaxies to construct simulated datasets that mimic our observational setup atz=0.25; these allow us to compute the expected distribution of (observable)linewidths sigma_v for a galaxy of a given ``true'' (optical) rotation speedv_c. these simulations include the effects of random viewing angles, clumpyline emission, finite fibre aperture, and internal dust extinction on theemission line profile. we assume a linewidth--luminosity--colour relation: ln[v_c(m_b,b-r) ] = ln[v_c(-19,1)] - eta*(m_b+10) + zeta*[(b-r)-1] and determinethe range of parameters consistent with our data. we find a mean rotation speedof v_c(-19,1)=66+-8km/s (68% confidence limits) for the distant galaxies withm_b=-19 and b-r=1, with a magnitude dependence for v_c of eta=0.07+-0.08, and acolour dependence of zeta =0.28+-0.25. through comparison with several localsamples we show that this value of v_c(-19,1) is significantly lower than theoptical rotation speed of present-day galaxies with the same absolute magnitude
