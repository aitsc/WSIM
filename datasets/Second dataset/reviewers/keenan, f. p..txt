0903.1286	sn 2008s: an electron capture sn from a super-agb progenitor?	we present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of thefaint transient sn 2008s discovered in ngc 6946. sn 2008s exhibited slowphotometric evolution and almost no spectral variability during the first ninemonths, implying a high density cs medium. the light curve is similar in shapeto that of sn 1998s and sn 1979c, although significantly fainter at maximumlight. our quasi-bolometric lightcurve extends to 300 days and shows a tailphase decay rate consistent with that of ^{56}co. we propose that this isevidence for an explosion and formation of ^{56}ni (0.0015 +/- 0.0004 m_sun).the large mir flux detected shortly after explosion can be explained by a lightecho from pre-exisiting dust. the late nir flux excess is plausibly due to acombination of warm newly-formed ejecta dust together with shock-heated dust inthe cs environment. we reassess the progenitor object detected previously inspitzer archive images, supplementing this discussion with a model of the mirspectral energy distribution. this supports the idea of a dusty, opticallythick shell around sn 2008s with an inner radius of nearly 90au and outerradius of 450au, and an inferred heating source of 3000 k and luminosity of l ~10^{4.6} l_sun. the combination of our monitoring data and the evidence fromthe progenitor analysis leads us to support the scenario of a weak electroncapture supernova explosion in a super-agb progenitor star (of initial mass 6-8m_sun) embedded within a thick cs gaseous envelope. we suggest that all of mainproperties of the electron capture sn phenomenon are observed in sn 2008s andfuture observations may allow a definitive answer.

0904.0119	evidence of asymmetry in sn 2007rt, a type iin supernova	an optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the slowly-evolving typeiin sn2007rt is presented, covering a duration of 481 days after discovery. itsearliest spectrum, taken approximately 100 days after the explosion epoch,indicates the presence of a dense circumstellar medium, with which thesupernova ejecta is interacting. this is supported by the slowly-evolving lightcurve. a notable feature in the spectrum of sn 2007rt is the presence of abroad he i 5875 line, not usually detected in type iin supernovae. this mayimply that the progenitor star has a high he/h ratio, having shed a significantportion of its hydrogen shell via mass-loss. an intermediate resolutionspectrum reveals a narrow halpha p-cygni profile, the absorption component ofwhich has a width of 128 km/s. this slow velocity suggests that the progenitorof sn 2007rt recently underwent mass-loss with wind speeds comparable to thelower limits of those detected in luminous blue variables. asymmetries in theline profiles of h and he at early phases bears some resemblance todouble-peaked features observed in a number of ib/c spectra. these asymmetriesmay be indicative of an asymmetric or bipolar outflow or alternatively dustformation in the fast expanding ejecta. in addition, the late time spectrum, atover 240 days post-explosion, shows clear evidence for the presence of newlyformed dust.

0905.4680	a transit timing analysis of nine rise light curves of the exoplanet  system tres-3	we present nine newly observed transits of tres-3, taken as part of a transittiming program using the rise instrument on the liverpool telescope. amarkov-chain monte-carlo analysis was used to determine the planet-star radiusratio and inclination of the system, which were found to berp/rstar=0.1664^{+0.0011}_{-0.0018} and i = 81.73^{+0.13}_{-0.04} respectively,consistent with previous results. the central transit times and uncertaintieswere also calculated, using a residual-permutation algorithm as an independentcheck on the errors. a re-analysis of eight previously published tres-3 lightcurves was conducted to determine the transit times and uncertainties usingconsistent techniques. whilst the transit times were not found to be inagreement with a linear ephemeris, giving chi^2 = 35.07 for 15 degrees offreedom, we interpret this to be the result of systematics in the light curvesrather than a real transit timing variation. this is because the light curvesthat show the largest deviation from a constant period either have relativelylittle out-of-transit coverage, or have clear systematics. a new ephemeris wascalculated using the transit times, and was found to be t_c(0) = 2454632.62610+- 0.00006 hjd and p = 1.3061864 +- 0.0000005 days. the transit times were thenused to place upper mass limits as a function of the period ratio of apotential perturbing planet, showing that our data are sufficiently sensitiveto have probed for sub-earth mass planets in both interior and exterior 2:1resonances, assuming the additional planet is in an initially circular orbit.

0912.3643	the spin-orbit alignment of the transiting exoplanet wasp-3b from  rossiter-mclaughlin observations	we present an observation of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for the planetarysystem wasp-3. radial velocity measurements were made during transit using thesophie spectrograph at the 1.93m telescope at haute-provence observatory. theshape of the effect shows that the sky-projected angle between the stellarrotation axis and planetary orbital axis (lambda) is small and consistent withzero within 2 sigma; lambda = 15 +10/-9 deg. wasp-3b joins the ~two-thirds ofplanets with measured spin-orbit angles that are well aligned and are thoughtto have undergone a dynamically-gentle migration process such as planet-discinteractions. we find a systematic effect which leads to an anomalously highdetermination of the projected stellar rotational velocity (vsini = 19.6+2.2/-2.1 km/s) compared to the value found from spectroscopic line broadening(vsini = 13.4 +/- 1.5 km/s). this is thought to be caused by a discrepancy inthe assumptions made in the extraction and modelling of the data. using a modeldeveloped by hirano et al.

1007.2515	a study of magnetic bright points in the na i d1 line	high cadence, multiwavelength, optical observations of solar magnetic brightpoints, captured at disk center using the rosa and ibis imaging systems on thedunn solar telescope, are presented. magnetic bright points manifesting in thena i d1 core are found to preferentially exist in regions containing strongdownflows, in addition to co-spatial underlying photospheric magnetic fieldconcentrations. downdrafts within na i d1 bright points exhibit speeds of up to7km/s, with preferred structural symmetry in intensity, magnetic field andvelocity profiles about the bright point center. excess intensities associatedwith g-band and ca ii k observations of magnetic bright points reveal apower-law trend when plotted as a function of magnetic flux density. however,na i d1 observations of the same magnetic features indicate an intensityplateau at weak magnetic field strengths below ~150g, suggesting the presenceof a two-component heating process; one which is primarily acoustic, the otherpredominantly magnetic. we suggest that this finding is related to the physicalexpansion of magnetic flux tubes, with weak field strengths (~50g) expanding by~76%, compared to a ~44% expansion when higher field strengths (~150g) arepresent. these observations provide the first experimental evidence of rapiddowndrafts in na i d1 magnetic bright points, and reveal the nature of apreviously unresolved intensity plateau associated with these structures.

1109.0513	a search for line intensity enhancements in the far-uv spectra of active  late-type stars arising from opacity	radiative transfer calculations have predicted intensity enhancements foroptically thick emission lines, as opposed to the normal intensity reductions,for astrophysical plasmas under certain conditions. in particular, the resultsare predicted to be dependent both on the geometry of the emitting plasma andthe orientation of the observer. hence in principle the detection of intensityenhancement may provide a way of determining the geometry of an unresolvedastronomical source. to investigate such enhancements we have analyzed a sampleof active late-type stars observed in the far ultraviolet spectral region.emission lines of o vi in the fuse satellite spectra of epsilon eri, ii peg andprox cen were searched for intensity enhancements due to opacity. we have foundstrong evidence for line intensity enhancements due to opacity during active orflare-like activity for all three stars. the o vi 1032/1038 line intensityratios, predicted to have a value of 2.0 in the optically thin case, are foundto be up to ~30% larger during several orbital phases. our measurements,combined with radiative transfer models, allow us to constrain both thegeometry of the o vi emitting regions in our stellar sources and theorientation of the observer. a spherical emitting plasma can be ruled out, asthis would lead to no intensity enhancement. in addition, the theory tells usthat the line-of-sight to the plasma must be close to perpendicular to itssurface, as observations at small angles to the surface lead to either nointensity enhancement or the usual line intensity decrease over the opticallythin value. for the future, we outline a laboratory experiment, that could beundertaken with current facilities, which would provide an unequivocal test ofpredictions of line intensity enhancement due to opacity, in particular thedependence on plasma geometry.

0711.0126	wasp-3b: a strongly-irradiated transiting gas-giant planet	we report the discovery of wasp-3b, the third transiting exoplanet to bediscovered by the wasp and sophie collaboration. wasp-3b transits its host starusno-b1.0 1256-0285133 every 1.846834+-0.000002 days. our high precisionradial-velocity measurements present a variation with amplitude characteristicof a planetary-mass companion and in-phase with the light-curve. adaptiveoptics imaging shows no evidence for nearby stellar companions, andline-bisector analysis excludes faint, unresolved binarity and stellar activityas the cause of the radial-velocity variations. we make a preliminaryspectroscopic analysis of the host star finding it to have teff = 6400+-100 kand log g = 4.25+-0.05 which suggests it is most likely an unevolved mainsequence star of spectral type f7-8v. our simultaneous modelling of the transitphotometry and reflex motion of the host leads us to derive a mass of 1.76+0.08 -0.14 m_j and radius 1.31 +0.07-0.14 r_j for wasp-3b. the proximity andrelative temperature of the host star suggests that wasp-3b is one of thehottest exoplanets known, and thus has the potential to place stringentconstraints on exoplanet atmospheric models.

1208.3194	the source of three-minute magneto-acoustic oscillations in coronal fans	we use images of high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, obtainedusing both ground- and space-based instrumentation, to investigate the couplingbetween wave phenomena observed at numerous heights in the solar atmosphere.intensity oscillations of 3 minutes are observed to encompass photosphericumbral dot structures, with power at least three orders-of-magnitude higherthan the surrounding umbra. simultaneous chromospheric velocity and intensitytime series reveal an 87 \pm 8 degree out-of-phase behavior, implying thepresence of standing modes created as a result of partial wave reflection atthe transition region boundary. an average blue-shifted doppler velocity of~1.5 km/s, in addition to a time lag between photospheric and chromosphericoscillatory phenomena, confirms the presence of upwardly-propagating slow-modewaves in the lower solar atmosphere. propagating oscillations in euv intensityare detected in simultaneous coronal fan structures, with a periodicity of 172\pm 17 s and a propagation velocity of 45 \pm 7 km/s. numerical simulationsreveal that the damping of the magneto-acoustic wave trains is dominated bythermal conduction. the coronal fans are seen to anchor into the photosphere inlocations where large-amplitude umbral dot oscillations manifest. derivedkinetic temperature and emission measure time-series display prominentout-of-phase characteristics, and when combined with the previously establishedsub-sonic wave speeds, we conclude that the observed euv waves are the coronalcounterparts of the upwardly-propagating magneto-acoustic slow-modes detectedin the lower solar atmosphere. thus, for the first time, we reveal how thepropagation of 3 minute magneto-acoustic waves in solar coronal structures is adirect result of amplitude enhancements occurring in photospheric umbral dots.

1301.3760	transit timing variations in wasp-10b induced by stellar activity?	the hot-jupiter wasp-10b was reported by maciejewski et al. (2011a,b) to showtransit timing variations (ttv) with an amplitude of ~ 3.5 minutes. theseauthors proposed that the observed ttvs were caused by a 0.1 mjup perturbingcompanion with an orbital period of ~ 5.23 d, and hence, close to the outer 5:3mean motion resonance with wasp-10b. to test this scenario, we present eightnew transit light curves of wasp-10b obtained with the faulkes telescope northand the liverpool telescope. the new light curves, together with 22 previouslypublished ones, were modelled with a markov-chain monte-carlo transit fittingcode. (...)  our homogeneously derived transit times do not support the previous claimedttv signal, which was strongly dependent on 2 previously published transitsthat have been incorrectly normalised. nevertheless, a linear ephemeris is nota statistically good fit to the transit times of wasp-10b. we show that theobserved transit time variations are due to spot occultation features orsystematics. we discuss and exemplify the effects of occultation spot featuresin the measured transit times and show that despite spot occultation duringegress and ingress being difficult to distinguish in the transit light curves,they have a significant effect in the measured transit times. we conclude thatif we account for spot features, the transit times of wasp-10 are consistentwith a linear ephemeris with the exception of one transit (epoch 143) which isa partial transit. therefore, there is currently no evidence for the existenceof a companion to wasp-10b. our results support the lack of ttvs ofhot-jupiters reported for the kepler sample.

1403.1470	intensity enhancement of o vi ultraviolet emission lines in solar  spectra due to opacity	opacity is a property of many plasmas, and it is normally expected that if anemission line in a plasma becomes optically thick, its intensity ratio to thatof another transition that remains optically thin should decrease. however,radiative transfer calculations undertaken both by ourselves and others predictthat under certain conditions the intensity ratio of an optically thick to thinline can show an increase over the optically thin value, indicating anenhancement in the former. these conditions include the geometry of theemitting plasma and its orientation to the observer. a similar effect can takeplace between lines of differing optical depth. previous observational studieshave focused on stellar point sources, and here we investigate thespatially-resolved solar atmosphere using measurements of the i(1032 a)/i(1038a) intensity ratio of o vi in several regions obtained with the solarultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation (sumer) instrument on board thesolar and heliospheric observatory (soho) satellite. we find several i(1032a)/i(1038 a) ratios observed on the disk to be significantly larger than theoptically thin value of 2.0, providing the first detection (to our knowledge)of intensity enhancement in the ratio arising from opacity effects in the solaratmosphere. agreement between observation and theory is excellent, and confirmsthat the o vi emission originates from a slab-like geometry in the solaratmosphere, rather than from cylindrical structures.

astro-ph;0009157	chemical abundances in the inner 5 kpc of the galactic disk	high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectral data are presented for fouryoung b-type stars lying towards the galactic centre. determination of theiratmospheric parameters from their absorption line profiles, and uvbyphotometric measurement of the continua indicate that they are massive objectslying slightly out of the plane, and were probably born in the disk between2.5-5 kpc from the centre. we have carried out a detailed absolute anddifferential line-by-line abundance analyses of the four stars compared to twostars with very similar atmospheric parameters in the solar neighbourhood. thestars appear to be rich in all the well sampled chemical elements (c, n, si,mg, s, al), except for oxygen. oxygen abundances derived in the atmospheres ofthese four stars are very similar to that in the solar neighbourhood. if thephotospheric composition of these young stars is reflective of the gaseous ismin the inner galaxy, then the values derived for the enhanced metals are inexcellent agreement with the extrapolation of the galactic abundance gradientspreviously derived by rolleston et al. (2000) and others. however, the data foroxygen suggests that the inner galaxy may not be richer than normal in thiselement, and the physical reasons for such a scenario are unclear.

astro-ph;0108263	boron abundances in main sequence b-type stars: a test of rotational  depletion during main sequence evolution	boron abundances have been derived for seven main sequence b-type stars fromhst stis spectra around the b iii 2066 a line. in two stars, boron appears tobe undepleted with respect to the presumed initial abundance. in one star,boron is detectable but it is clearly depleted. in the other four stars, boronis undetectable implying depletions of 1 to 2 dex. three of these four starsare nitrogen enriched, but the fourth shows no enrichment of nitrogen. onlyrotationally induced mixing predicts that boron depletions are unaccompanied bynitrogen enrichments. the inferred rate of boron depletion from ourobservations is in good agreement with these predictions. other boron-depletednitrogen-normal stars are identified from the literature. also, severalboron-depleted nitrogen-rich stars are identified, and while all fall on theboron-nitrogen trend predicted by rotationally-induced mixing, a majority havenitrogen enrichments that are not uniquely explained by rotation.  the spectra have also been used to determine iron-group (cr, mn, fe, and ni)abundances. the seven b-type stars have near solar iron-group abundances, asexpected for young stars in the solar neighborhood. we have also analysed thehalo b-type star, pg0832+676. we find [fe/h] = -0.88 +/- 0.10, and the absenceof the b iii line gives the upper limit [b/h]&lt;2.5. these and other publishedabundances are used to infer the star's evolutionary status as a post-agb star.

0810.1443	do all flares have white light emission?	high-cadence, multiwavelength optical observations of a solar active region(noaa 10969), obtained with the swedish solar telescope, are presented.difference imaging of white light continuum data reveals a white lightbrightening, 2 min in duration, linked to a co-temporal and co-spatial c2.0flare event. the flare kernel observed in the white light images has a diameterof 300 km, thus rendering it below the resolution limit of most space-basedtelescopes. continuum emission is present only during the impulsive stage ofthe flare, with the effects of chromospheric emission subsequently delayed byapproximately 2 min. the localized flare emission peaks at 300% above thequiescent flux. this large, yet tightly confined, increase in emission is onlyresolvable due to the high spatial resolution of the swedish solar telescope.an investigation of the line-of-sight magnetic field derived from simultaneousmdi data shows that the continuum brightening is located very close to amagnetic polarity inversion line. additionally, an h-alpha flare ribbon isdirected along a region of rapid magnetic energy change, with the footpoints ofthe ribbon remaining co-spatial with the observed white light brighteningthroughout the duration of the flare. the observed flare parameters arecompared with current observations and theoretical models for m- and x-classevents and we determine the observed white-light emission is caused byradiative back warming. we suggest that the creation of white-light emission isa common feature of all solar flares.
