0911.5566	gravity-driven lyman-alpha blobs from cold streams into galaxies	we use high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical amr simulations to predictthe characteristics of la emission from the cold gas streams that fed galaxiesin massive haloes at high redshift. the la luminosity in our simulations ispowered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from theintergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. the uv backgroundcontributes only &lt;20% to the gas heating. the la emissivity is due primarily toelectron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas ~2x10^4k. we calculate thela emissivities assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium (cie) at all gastemperatures. the simulated streams are self-shielded against the uvbackground, so photoionisation and recombination contribute negligibly to thela line formation. we produce theoretical maps of the la surface brightnesses,assuming that ~85% of the la photons are directly observable. we find thattypical haloes of mass mv~10^12-13 msun at z~3 emit as la blobs (labs) withluminosities 10^43-44 erg/s. most of the la comes from the extended narrow,partly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams that feed the growing galaxies. thepredicted lab morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps andelongated extensions. the linewidth is expected to range from 10^2 to more than10^3 km/s with a large variance. the typical la surface brightness profile isproportional to r^-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. oursimulated labs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observedlabs, with distinct kinematic features. the predicted la luminosity function isconsistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughlyrecover the observed scaling relations. this mechanism for producing labsappears inevitable in many high-z galaxies. some of the labs may thus beregarded as direct detections of the cold streams that drove galaxy evolutionat high z.

0912.1858	the impact of cold gas accretion above a mass floor on galaxy scaling  relations	using the cosmological baryonic accretion rate and normal star formationefficiencies, we present a very simple model for star-forming galaxies (sfgs)that accounts for the mass and redshift dependencies of the sfr-mass andtully-fisher relations from z=2 to the present. the time evolution follows fromthe fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the sfrfollows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. the key feature of the model is ahalo mass floor m_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order tosimultaneously account for the observed slopes of the sfr-mass andtully-fischer relations. the same successes cannot be achieved via astar-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the sf efficiency or thefeedback efficiency. combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due tovirial shock heating, the mass floor m_{min} explains galaxy "downsizing",where more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.it turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon andgas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic sfr density fromz~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor m_{min}. the modelhelps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate thatdrives the decrease of cosmic sfr density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise ofthe cosmic sfr density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameterm_{min}~10^{11} solar masses. among the physical mechanisms that could beresponsible for the mass floor, we view that photo-ionization feedback (fromfirst in-situ hot stars) lowering the cooling efficiency is likely to play alarge role.

0708.0422	scaling relations of spiral galaxies	we construct a large data set of global structural parameters for 1300 fieldand cluster spiral galaxies and explore the joint distribution of luminosity l,optical rotation velocity v, and disk size r at i- and 2mass k-bands. the i-and k-band velocity-luminosity (vl) relations have log-slopes of 0.29 and 0.27,respectively with sigma_ln(vl)~0.13, and show a small dependence on color andmorphological type in the sense that redder, early-type disk galaxies rotatefaster than bluer, later-type disk galaxies for most luminosities. the vlrelation at i- and k-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and lightconcentration. the log-slope of the i- and k-band rl relations is a strongfunction of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. the average dispersionsigma_ln(rl) decreases from 0.33 at i-band to 0.29 at k, likely due to the2mass selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies. measurementuncertainties are sigma_ln(v)~0.09, sigma_ln(l)~0.14 and somewhat larger andharder to estimate for ln(r). the color dependence of the vl relation isconsistent with expectations from stellar population synthesis models. the vland rl residuals are largely uncorrelated with each other; the rv-rl residualsshow only a weak positive correlation. these correlations suggest that scatterin luminosity is not a significant source of the scatter in the vl and rlrelations. the observed scaling relations can be understood in the context of amodel of disk galaxies embedded in dark matter halos that invokes low mean spinparameters and dark halo expansion, as we describe in our companion paper(dutton et al. 2007). we discuss in two appendices various pitfalls of standardanalytical derivations of galaxy scaling relations, including the tully-fisherrelation with different slopes.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1101.4225	the role of dissipation in the scaling relations of cosmological merger  remnants	there are strong correlations between the three structural properties ofelliptical galaxies -- stellar mass, velocity dispersion and size -- in theform of a tight "fundamental plane" and a "scaling relation" between each pair.major mergers of disk galaxies are assumed to be a mechanism for producingellipticals, but semi-analytic galaxy formation models (sam) have encounteredapparent difficulties in reproducing the observed slope and scatter of thesize-mass relation. we study the scaling relations of merger remnants usingprogenitor properties from two sams. we apply a simple merger model thatincludes gas dissipation and star formation based on theoretical considerationsand simulations. combining the sams and the merger model allows calculation ofthe structural properties of the remnants of major mergers that enter thepopulation of elliptical galaxies at a given redshift. without tuning themerger model parameters for each sam, the results roughly match the slope andscatter in the observed scaling relations and their evolution in the redshiftrange $z=0-3$. within this model, the observed scaling relations, including thetilt of the fundamental plane relative to the virial plane, result primarilyfrom the decrease of gas fraction with increasing progenitor mass. the scatterin the size-mass relation of the remnants is reduced from that of theprogenitors because of a correlation between progenitor size and gas fractionat a given mass.

1110.3794	candels observations of the structural properties and evolution of  galaxies in a cluster at z=1.62	we discuss the structural and morphological properties of galaxies in az=1.62 proto-cluster using near-ir imaging data from hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 data of the cosmic assembly near-ir deep extragalacticlegacy survey (candels). the cluster galaxies exhibit a clear color-morphologyrelation: galaxies with colors of quiescent stellar populations generally havemorphologies consistent with spheroids, and galaxies with colors consistentwith ongoing star formation have disk-like and irregular morphologies. the sizedistribution of the quiescent cluster galaxies shows a deficit of compact (&lt;1kpc), massive galaxies compared to candels field galaxies at z=1.6. as aresult the cluster quiescent galaxies have larger average effective sizescompared to field galaxies at fixed mass at greater than 90% significance.combined with data from the literature, the size evolution of quiescent clustergalaxies is relatively slow from z~1.6 to the present, growing as(1+z)^(-0.6+/-0.1). if this result is generalizable, then it implies thatphysical processes associated with the denser cluster region seems to havecaused accelerated size growth in quiescent galaxies prior to z=1.6 and slowersubsequent growth at z&lt;1.6 compared to galaxies in the lower density field. thequiescent cluster galaxies at z=1.6 have higher ellipticities compared to lowerredshift samples at fixed mass, and their surface-brightness profiles suggestthat they contain extended stellar disks. we argue the cluster galaxies requiredissipationless (i.e., gas-poor or "dry") mergers to reorganize the diskmaterial and to match the relations for ellipticity, stellar mass, size, andcolor of early-type galaxies in z&lt;1 clusters.

1206.2360	newborn spheroids at high redshift: when and how did the dominant, old  stars in today's massive galaxies form?	we study ~330 massive (m* &gt; 10^9.5 msun), newborn spheroidal galaxies (sgs)around the epoch of peak star formation (1&lt;z&lt;3), to explore the high-redshiftorigin of sgs and gain insight into when and how the old stellar populationsthat dominate today's universe formed. the sample is drawn from the hst/wfc3early-release science programme, which provides deep 10-filter (0.2 - 1.7micron) hst imaging over a third of the goods-south field. we find that thestar formation episodes that built the sgs likely peaked in the redshift range2&lt;z&lt;5 (with a median of z~3) and have decay timescales shorter than ~1.5 gyr.starburst timescales and ages show no trend with stellar mass in the range10^9.5 &lt; m* &lt; 10^10.5 msun. however, the timescales show increased scattertowards lower values (&lt;0.3 gyr) for m* &gt; 10^10.5 msun, and an age trend becomesevident in this mass regime: sgs with m* &gt; 10^11.5 msun are ~2 gyrs older thantheir counterparts with m* &lt; 10^10.5 msun. nevertheless, a smooth downsizingtrend with galaxy mass is not observed, and the large scatter in starburst agesindicate that sgs are not a particularly coeval population. around half of theblue sgs appear not to drive their star formation via major mergers, and thosethat have experienced a recent major merger, show only modest enhancements(~40%) in their specific star formation rates. our empirical study indicatesthat processes other than major mergers (e.g. violent disk instability drivenby cold streams and/or minor mergers) likely play a dominant role in buildingsgs, and creating a significant fraction of the old stellar populations thatdominate today's universe.

1206.4322	the morphologies of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels-uds field:  compact bulges, and the rise and fall of massive disks	we have used deep, hst, near-ir imaging to study the morphological propertiesof the most massive galaxies at high z, modelling the wfc3/ir h-band images ofthe ~200 galaxies in the candels-uds field with 1 &lt; z_phot &lt; 3, and stellarmasses m_star &gt; 10^11 m_sun. we have used both single-sersic and bulge+diskmodels, have investigated the errors/biases introduced by uncertainties in thebackground and the psf, and have obtained formally-acceptable model fits to&gt;90% of the galaxies. our results indicate that these massive galaxies at 1 &lt; z&lt; 3 lie both on and below the local size-mass relation, with a median r_e~2.6kpc, a factor of ~2.3 smaller than comparably-massive local galaxies. moreover,we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growingbimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing z, and by z &gt; 2 thecompact bulges display effective radii a factor ~4 smaller than localellipticals of comparable mass. these trends appear to extend to the bulgecomponents of disk-dominated galaxies, and vice versa. we also find that, whilesuch massive galaxies at low z are bulge-dominated, at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 they arepredominantly mixed bulge+disk systems, and by z &gt; 2 they are mostlydisk-dominated. the majority of the disk-dominated galaxies are activelyforming stars, but this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems.interestingly, however, while most of the quiescent galaxies arebulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40%) of the mostquiescent galaxies have disk-dominated morphologies. thus, while our resultsshow that the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at thiscrucial epoch, they also suggest that the physical mechanisms which quenchstar-formation activity are not simply connected to those responsible for themorphological transformation of massive galaxies into present-day giantellipticals.

1208.3464	the properties of (sub)millimetre-selected galaxies as revealed by  candels hst wfc3/ir imaging in goods-south	we have exploited the hst candels wfc3/ir imaging to study the properties of(sub-)mm galaxies in goods-south. after using the deep radio and spitzerimaging to identify galaxy counterparts for the (sub-)mm sources, we have usedthe new candels data in two ways. first, we have derived improved photometricredshifts and stellar masses, confirming that the (sub-)mm galaxies are massive(&lt;m*&gt;=2.2x10^11 m_solar) galaxies at z=1-3. second, we have exploited the depthand resolution of the wfc3/ir imaging to determine the sizes and morphologiesof the galaxies at rest-frame optical wavelengths, fitting two-dimensionalaxi-symmetric sersic models. crucially, the wfc3/ir h-band imaging enablesmodelling of the mass-dominant galaxy, rather than the blue high-surfacebrightness features which often dominate optical (rest-frame uv) images of(sub-)mm galaxies, and can confuse visual morphological classification. as aresult of this analysis we find that &gt;95% of the rest-frame optical light inalmost all of the (sub-)mm galaxies is well-described by either a singleexponential disk, or a multiple-component system in which the dominantconstituent is disk-like. we demonstrate that this conclusion is consistentwith the results of high-quality ground-based k-band imaging, and explain why.the massive disk galaxies which host luminous (sub-)mm emission are reasonablyextended (r_e=4 kpc), consistent with the sizes of other massive star-formingdisks at z~2. in many cases we find evidence of blue clumps within the sources,with the mass-dominant disk becoming more significant at longer wavelengths.finally, only a minority of the sources show evidence for a major galaxy-galaxyinteraction. taken together, these results support the view that most (sub-)mmgalaxies at z~2 are simply the most extreme examples of normal star-forminggalaxies at that era.

1210.4160	the insignificance of major mergers in driving star formation at z~2	we study the significance of major-merger-driven star formation in the earlyuniverse, by quantifying the contribution of this process to the total starformation budget in 80 massive (m* &gt; 10^10 msun) galaxies at z~2. employingvisually-classified morphologies from rest-frame v-band hst imaging, we findthat 55+/-14% of the star formation budget is hosted by non-interactinglate-types, with 27+/-8% in major mergers and 18+/-6% in spheroids. given thata system undergoing a major merger continues to experience star formationdriven by other processes at this epoch (e.g. cold accretion, minor mergers),~27% is an upper limit to the major-merger contribution to star formationactivity at this epoch. the ratio of the average specific star formation ratein major mergers to that in the non-interacting late-types is ~2.2:1,suggesting that the enhancement of star formation due to major merging istypically modest, and that just under half the star formation in systemsexperiencing major mergers is unrelated to the merger itself. taking this intoaccount, we estimate that the actual major-merger contribution to the starformation budget may be as low as ~15%. while our study does not preclude amajor-merger-dominated era in the very early universe, if the major-mergercontribution to star formation does not evolve strongly into larger look-backtimes, then this process has a relatively insignificant role in driving stellarmass assembly over cosmic time.

1303.3009	toy models for galaxy formation versus simulations	we describe simple useful toy models for key processes of galaxy formation inits most active phase, at z &gt; 1, and test the approximate expressions againstthe typical behaviour in a suite of high-resolution hydro-cosmologicalsimulations of massive galaxies at z = 4-1. we address in particular theevolution of (a) the total mass inflow rate from the cosmic web into galactichaloes based on the eps approximation, (b) the penetration of baryonic streamsinto the inner galaxy, (c) the disc size, (d) the implied steady-state gascontent and star-formation rate (sfr) in the galaxy subject to massconservation and a universal star-formation law, (e) the inflow rate within thedisc to a central bulge and black hole as derived using energy conservation andself-regulated q ~ 1 violent disc instability (vdi), and (f) the implied steadystate in the disc and bulge. the toy models provide useful approximations forthe behaviour of the simulated galaxies. we find that (a) the inflow rate isproportional to mass and to (1+z)^5/2, (b) the penetration to the inner halo is~50% at z = 4-2, (c) the disc radius is ~5% of the virial radius, (d) thegalaxies reach a steady state with the sfr following the accretion rate intothe galaxy, (e) there is an intense gas inflow through the disc, comparable tothe sfr, following the predictions of vdi, and (f) the galaxies approach asteady state with the bulge mass comparable to the disc mass, where thedraining of gas by sfr, outflows and disc inflows is replenished by freshaccretion. given the agreement with simulations, these toy models are usefulfor understanding the complex phenomena in simple terms and forback-of-the-envelope predictions.

0801.1673	downsizing by shutdown in red galaxies	we address the origin of the `downsizing' of elliptical galaxies, accordingto which the stars in more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorterperiod than those in less massive galaxies. we show that this could be thenatural result of a shutdown of star formation in dark matter haloes above acritical mass of 10^12msun. this is demonstrated using a semianalyticsimulation of galaxy formation within the standard hierarchical scenario ofstructure formation. the assumed threshold mass is motivated by the predictionof stable shock heating above this mass and the finding that such a shutdownreproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in luminosity and colour.theshutdown at a critical halo mass introduces a characteristic stellar mass forthe transition of galaxies into the `red sequence' of the galaxycolour-magnitude diagram. central galaxies of haloes that are more massivetoday have reached this mass earlier and can therefore grow further along thered sequence by dry mergers, ending up more massive and containing older stars.small galaxies formed in haloes below the critical mass can shutdown late, whenthey fall into haloes above the critical mass and become satellites. while oursemianalytic simulation that incorporates an explicit shutdown reproducesdownsizing as inferred from the stellar ages of ellipticals, we explain why itis much harder to detect downsizing using the mass functions of differentgalaxy types.

1307.5639	a sub-parsec resolution simulation of the milky way: global structure of  the ism and properties of molecular clouds	we present a self-consistent hydrodynamical simulation of a milky way-likegalaxy, at the resolution of 0.05 pc. the model includes star formation and anew implementation of stellar feedback through photo-ionization, radiativepressure and supernovae. the simulation resolves the structure of theinterstellar medium at subparsec resolution for a few cloud lifetimes, and at0.05 pc for about a cloud crossing time. turbulence cascade and gravitationfrom the kpc scales are de facto included in smaller structures like molecularclouds. we show that the formation of a bar influences the dynamics of thecentral ~100 pc by creating resonances. at larger radii, the spiral arms hostthe formation of regularly spaced clouds: beads on a string and spurs. theseinstabilities pump turbulent energy into the gas, generally in the supersonicregime. because of asymmetric drift, the supernovae explode outside of theirgaseous nursery, which diminishes the effect of feedback on the structure ofclouds. the evolution of clouds is thus mostly due to fragmentation and gasconsumption, regulated mainly by supersonic turbulence. the transition fromturbulence supported to self-gravitating gas is detected in the gas densityprobability distribution function at ~2000 cm^-3. the power spectrum densitysuggests that gravitation governs the hierarchical organisation of structuresfrom the galactic scale down to a few parsecs.

1401.5477	morphologies of z~0.7 agn host galaxies in candels: no trend of merger  incidence with agn luminosity	the processes that trigger active galactic nuclei (agn) remain poorlyunderstood. while lower luminosity agn may be triggered by minor disturbancesto the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to triggerluminous agn. major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for agntriggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques.there is however little observational evidence for a strong connection betweenagn and major mergers. we analyse the morphological properties of agn hostgalaxies as a function of agn and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to acarefully matched sample of control galaxies. agn are x-ray selected in theredshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 and have luminosities 41 &lt; log(l_x [erg/s]) &lt;44.5. 'fake agn' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sourceswith the magnitude of the matched agn. we find that agn host and controlgalaxies have comparable assymetries, sersic indices and ellipticities atrestframe ~950nm. agn host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries norhigher fractions of very disturbed objects. there is no increase in theprevalence of merger signatures with agn luminosity. at 95% confidence we findthat major mergers are responsible for &lt;6% of all agn in our sample as well as&lt;40% of the highest luminosity agn log(l_x [erg/s]) ~ 43.5). major mergerstherefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of agn in theluminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features toremain visible.

1405.1736	the bulge-disk decomposed evolution of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3 in  candels	we present the results of a new and improved study of the morphological andspectral evolution of massive galaxies over the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3. ouranalysis is based on a bulge-disk decomposition of 396 galaxies withmstar&gt;10^11 msolar from the candels wfc3/ir imaging within the cosmos andukidss uds survey fields. we find that, by modelling the h(160) image of eachgalaxy with a combination of a de vaucouleurs bulge (sersic index n=4) and anexponential disk (n=1), we can then lock all derived morphological parametersfor the bulge and disk components, and successfully reproduce theshorter-wavelength j(125), i(814), v(606) hst images simply by floating themagnitudes of the two components. this then yields sub-divided 4-band hstphotometry for the bulge and disk components which, with no additional priors,is well described by spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution. armed withthis information we are able to properly determine the masses andstar-formation rates for the bulge and disk components, and find that: i) fromz=3 to z=1 the galaxies move from disk-dominated to increasinglybulge-dominated, but very few galaxies are pure bulges/ellipticals by z=1; ii)while most passive galaxies are bulge-dominated, and most star-forming galaxiesdisk-dominated, 18+/-5% of passive galaxies are disk-dominated, and 11+/-3% ofstar-forming galaxies are bulge-dominated, a result which needs to be explainedby any model purporting to connect star-formation quenching with morphologicaltransformations; iii) there exists a small but significant population of purepassive disks, which are generally flatter than their star-forming counterparts(whose axial ratio distribution peaks at b/a~0.7); iv) flatter/larger disksre-emerge at the highest star-formation rates, consistent with recent studiesof sub-mm galaxies, and with the concept of a maximum surface-density forstar-formation activity.

1405.5221	the decomposed bulge and disk size-mass relations of massive galaxies at  1&lt;z&lt;3 in candels	we have constructed a mass-selected sample of mstar&gt;10^11msolar galaxies at1&lt;z&lt;3 in the candels uds and cosmos fields and have decomposed these systemsinto their separate bulge and disk components according to their h(160)-bandmorphologies. by extending this analysis to multiple bands we have been able toconduct individual bulge and disk component sed fitting which has provided uswith stellar-mass and star-formation rate estimates for the separate bulge anddisk components. these have been combined with size measurements to explore theevolution of these massive high-redshift galaxies. by utilising the newdecomposed stellar-mass estimates, we confirm that the bulge components displaya stronger size evolution than the disks. this can be seen from both thefraction of bulge components which lie below the local relation and the mediansizes of the bulge components, where the bulges are a median factor of2.93+/-0.32 times smaller than similarly massive local galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2 and3.41+/-0.58 smaller at 2&lt;z&lt;3; for the disks the corresponding factors are1.65+/-0.14 and 1.99+/-0.25. moreover, by splitting our sample into the passiveand star-forming bulge and disk sub-populations and examining their sizes as afraction of their present-day counter-parts, we find that the star-forming andpassive bulges are equally compact, star-forming disks are larger, while thepassive disks have intermediate sizes. this trend is not evident whenclassifying galaxy morphology on the basis of single-sersic fits and adoptingthe overall star-formation rates. finally, by evolving the star-formationhistories of the passive disks back to the redshifts when the passive diskswere last active, we show that the passive and star-forming disks haveconsistent sizes at the relevant epoch. these trends need to be reproduced byany mechanisms which attempt to explain the morphological evolution ofgalaxies.

1407.4233	geometry of star-forming galaxies from sdss, 3d-hst and candels	we determine the intrinsic, 3-dimensional shape distribution of star-forminggalaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, as inferred from their observed projected axis ratios. inthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 msolare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. wenow extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (m* &gt;1e10 msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z &lt; 2. lower-massgalaxies at z&gt;1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction ofelongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lowermasses. galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 msol (1e10 msol) are a mix of roughlyequal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). this suggests thatgalaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over manyorbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar masscomparable to that of the milky way typically first formed such sustainedstellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. combined with constraints on the evolutionof the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation overgalaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmictime, the majority of stars formed in disks.

1409.5122	the host galaxies of x-ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5:  structure, star-formation and their relationships from candels and  herschel/pacs	we study the relationship between the structure and star-formation rate (sfr)of x-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) inthe two chandra deep fields, using hubble space telescope imaging from thecosmic assembly near infrared extragalactic legacy survey (candels) and deepfar-infrared maps from the pep+goods-herschel survey. we derive detaileddistributions of structural parameters and fir luminosities from carefullyconstructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of theagns. at z~1, agns show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive(non-agn) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxydisturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpystructure). in contrast, at z~2, agns show similar levels of galaxy disturbanceas inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which mayarise due to a more pronounced bulge in agn hosts or due to extinguishednuclear light. we undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but ourresults do not strongly favour one interpretation over the other. the mean sfrand its distribution among agns and inactive galaxies are similar at z&gt;1.5. atz&lt;1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the sfrs of agnswith bulge-dominated light profiles. these trends suggest an evolution in therelation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards aminor role for mergers and interactions at z&gt;1.5.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1412.3806	zfourge/candels: on the evolution of m* galaxy progenitors from z=3 to  0.5	galaxies with stellar masses near m* contain the majority of stellar mass inthe universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxyevolution. the milky way (mw) and andromeda (m31) have present day stellarmasses near m*, at 5x10^10 msol (mw-mass) and 10^11 msol (m31-mass). we studythe typical progenitors of these galaxies using zfourge, a deep medium-bandnear-ir imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxiesout to z~3. we use abundance-matching techniques to identify the mainprogenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. we measure the evolution inthe stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-ir luminosities, andstar-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-irhst imaging from candels, and far-ir imaging from goods-h and candels-h. thetypical mw-mass and m31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolutionstages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,to redder dust-obscured ir-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and tored, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. the progenitors of themw-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lowerredshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than theprogenitors of the m31-mass galaxies. the process driving this evolution,including the suppression of star-formation in present-day m* galaxies requiresan evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass thresholdfor quiescent galaxies. the effective size and star-formation rates imply thatthe baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift toz~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the s\'ersic index.therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in m* galaxies corresponds to a rapiddecline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formationefficiency.

1503.00722	the role of bulge formation in the homogenization of stellar populations  at $z\sim2$ as revealed by internal color dispersion in candels	we use data from the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacysurvey to study how the spatial variation in the stellar populations ofgalaxies relate to the formation of galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$. we use theinternal color dispersion (icd), measured between the rest-frame uv and opticalbands, which is sensitive to age (and dust attenuation) variations in stellarpopulations. the icd shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologiesof the galaxies. galaxies with the largest variation in their stellarpopulations as evidenced by high icd have disk-dominated morphologies (withs\'{e}rsic indexes $&lt; 2$) and stellar masses between $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot}&lt; 11$. there is a marked decrease in the icd as the stellar mass and/orthe s\'ersic index increases. by studying the relations between the icd andother galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, anddust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellarpopulations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-formingclumps contrasts older stellar disk populations. this phase reaches a peak forgalaxies only with a specific stellar mass range, $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/ m_\odot}&lt; 11$, and prior to the formation of a substantial bulge/spheroid. in contrast,galaxies at higher or lower stellar masses, and/or higher s\'{e}rsic index ($n&gt; 2$) show reduced icd values, implying a greater homogeneity of their stellarpopulations. this indicates that if a galaxy is to have both a quiescent bulgealong with a star forming disk, typical of hubble sequence galaxies, this ismost common for stellar masses $10 &lt; \mathrm{log~m/m_\odot} &lt; 11$ and when thebulge component remains relatively small ($n&lt;2$).

1503.07164	caught in the act: gas and stellar velocity dispersions in a fast  quenching compact star-forming galaxy at z~1.7	we present keck-i mosfire spectroscopy in the y and h bands of gdn-8231, amassive, compact, star-forming galaxy (sfg) at a redshift $z\sim1.7$. itsspectrum reveals both h$_{\alpha}$ and [nii] emission lines and strong balmerabsorption lines. the h$_{\alpha}$ and spitzer mips 24 $\mu$m fluxes are bothweak, thus indicating a low star formation rate of sfr $\lesssim5-10$m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. this, added to a relatively young age of $\sim700$ myrmeasured from the absorption lines, provides the first direct evidence for adistant galaxy being caught in the act of rapidly shutting down its starformation. such quenching allows gdn-8231 to become a compact, quiescentgalaxy, similar to 3 other galaxies in our sample, by $z\sim1.5$. moreover, thecolor profile of gdn-8231 shows a bluer center, consistent with the predictionsof recent simulations for an early phase of inside-out quenching. itsline-of-sight velocity dispersion for the gas, $\sigma^{\rm{gas}}_{\!_{\rmlos}}=127\pm32$ km s$^{-1}$, is nearly 40% smaller than that of its stars,$\sigma^{\star}_{\!_{\rm los}}=215\pm35$ km s$^{-1}$. high-resolutionhydro-simulations of galaxies explain such apparently colder gas kinematics ofup to a factor of $\sim1.5$ with rotating disks being viewed at differentinclinations and/or centrally concentrated star-forming regions. a clearprediction is that their compact, quiescent descendants preserve some remnantrotation from their star-forming progenitors.

1509.00469	a universal structural and star-forming relation since $z\sim3$:  connecting compact star-forming and quiescent galaxies	we study the evolution of the core (r&lt;1 kpc) and effective (r&lt;r_e)stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. sincez=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(sigma_e) andlog(sigma_1) vs. log(m). these structural relations exhibit slopes and scatterthat remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. forsfgs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in bothsigma_e and sigma_1. such mild declines suggest that sfgs build dense cores bygrowing along these relations. we define this evolution as the structural mainsequence (sigma-ms). quiescent galaxies follow different relations (sigma^q_e,sigma^q_1) off the sigma-ms by having higher densities than sfgs of the samemass and redshift. the normalization of sigma^q_e declines by a factor of 10since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in sigma^q_1. thus, the common denominatorfor quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellarcore, and the formation of such cores in sfgs is the main requirement forquenching. expressed in 2d as deviations off the sfr-ms and off sigma^q_1 ateach redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, l-shapedsequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction andquenching. compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in sfgs relativeto that in the sigma-ms. this process increases the core-to-total mass andsersic index, thereby, making compact sfgs. quenching occurs once compact sfgsreach a maximum central density above sigma^q_1 &gt; 9.5 m_sun/kpc^2. thisthreshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify thestar-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.

1509.04720	the inferred evolution of the cold gas properties of candels galaxies at  0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0	we derive the total cold gas, atomic hydrogen, and molecular gas masses ofapproximately 24 000 galaxies covering four decades in stellar mass atredshifts 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.0, taken from the candels survey. our inferences arebased on the inversion of a molecular hydrogen based star formation law,coupled with a prescription to separate atomic and molecular gas. we find that:1) there is an increasing trend between the inferred cold gas (hi and h2), hi,and h2 mass and the stellar mass of galaxies down to stellar masses of 10^8msun already in place at z = 3; 2) the molecular fractions of cold gas increasewith increasing stellar mass and look-back time; 3) there is hardly anyevolution in the mean hi content of galaxies at fixed stellar mass; 4) the coldgas fraction and relative amount of molecular hydrogen in galaxies decrease ata relatively constant rate with time, independent of stellar mass; 5) there isa large population of low-stellar mass galaxies dominated by atomic gas. thesegalaxies are very gas rich, but only a minor fraction of their gas ismolecular; 6) the ratio between star-formation rate (sfr) and inferred totalcold gas mass (hi + h2) of galaxies (i.e., star-formation efficiency; sfe)increases with star-formation at fixed stellar masses. due to its simplicity,the presented approach is valuable to assess the impact of selection biases onsmall samples of directly-observed gas masses and to extend scaling relationsdown to stellar mass ranges and redshifts that are currently difficult to probewith direct measurements of gas content.

1512.02656	infrared color selection of massive galaxies at z &gt; 3	we introduce a new color-selection technique to identify high-redshift,massive galaxies that are systematically missed by lyman-break selection. thenew selection is based on the h_{160} and irac 4.5um bands, specifically h -[4.5] &gt; 2.25 mag. these galaxies, dubbed "hieros", include two majorpopulations that can be separated with an additional j - h color. thepopulations are massive and dusty star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 3 (jh-blue) andextremely dusty galaxies at z &lt; 3 (jh-red). the 350 arcmin^2 of the goods-n andgoods-s fields with the deepest hst/wfc3 and irac data contain 285 hieros downto [4.5] &lt; 24 mag. we focus here primarily on jh-blue (z &gt; 3) hieros, whichhave a median photometric redshift z ~4.4 and stellar massm_{*}~10^{10.6} msun,and are much fainter in the rest-frame uv than similarly massive lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs). their star formation rates (sfrs) reaches ~240 msun yr^{-1}leading to a specific sfr, ssfr ~4.2 gyr^{-1}, suggesting that the ssfrs formassive galaxies continue to grow at z &gt; 2 but at a lower growth rate than fromz=0 to z=2. with a median half-light radius of 2 kpc, including ~20% as compactas quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts, jh-blue hieros represent perfectstar-forming progenitors of the most massive (m_{*} &gt; 10^{11.2} msun) compactquiescent galaxies at z ~ 3 and have the right number density. hieros make up~60% of all galaxies with m_{*} &gt; 10^{10.5} msun identified at z &gt; 3 from theirphotometric redshifts. this is five times more than lbgs with nearly no overlapbetween the two populations. while hieros make up 15-25% of the total sfrdensity at z ~ 4-5, they completely dominate the sfr density taking place inm_{*} &gt;10^{10.5} msun galaxies, and are therefore crucial to understanding thevery early phase of massive galaxy formation.

0808.0553	cold streams in early massive hot haloes as the main mode of galaxy  formation	the massive galaxies in the young universe, ten billion years ago, formedstars at surprising intensities. although this is commonly attributed toviolent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible withsuch events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated byspheroids (genzel et al. 2006, 2008). cosmological simulations and clusteringtheory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. here wereport that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gasstreams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes(dekel &amp; birnboim 2006; keres et al. 2005). a comparison with the observedabundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas mustrapidly convert to stars. one-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leadingto mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows.with a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars ata given rate are fed by smooth streams. the rarer, submillimetre galaxies thatform stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. unlikedestructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating diskconfiguration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-formingclumps that merge into a central spheroid (noguchi 1999; genzel et al. 2008,elmegreen, bournaud &amp; elmegreen 2008, dekel, sari &amp; ceverino 2009). thisstream-driven scenario for the formation of disks and spheroids is analternative to the merger picture.

astro-ph;0011002	spin profile of galactic halos and disk formation	we summarize recent developments in the study of the origin of halo spinprofiles and preliminary implications on disk formation. the specificangular-momentum distributions within halos in n-body simulations match auniversal shape, m(&lt;j) \propto j/(j_0+j). it is characterized by a power lawover most of the mass, and one shape parameter in addition to the spinparameter \lambda. the angular momentum tends to be aligned throughout the haloand of cylindrical symmetry. even if angular momentum is conserved duringbaryonic infall, the resultant disk density profile is predicted to deviatefrom exponential, with a denser core and an extended tail. a slightly correctedversion of the scaling relation due to linear tidal-torque theory is used toexplain the origin of a typical power-law profile in shells, j(m) \propto m^swith s \gsim 1. while linear theory crudely predicts the amplitudes of halospins, it is not a good predictor of their directions. independently, mergersof halos are found to produce a similar profile due to j transfer from theorbit to the product halo via dynamical friction and tidal stripping. the halospin is correlated with having a recent major merger, though this correlationis weakened by mass loss. these two effects are due to a correlation betweenthe spins of neighboring halos and their orbit, leading to prograde mergers.

astro-ph;0102190	the large-scale tidal velocity field	we present a method for decomposing the cosmological velocity field in agiven volume into its divergent component due to the density fluctuationsinside the volume, and its tidal component due to the matter distributionoutside the volume. the input consists of the density and velocity fields thatare reconstructed either by potent or by wiener filter from a survey ofpeculiar velocities. the tidal field is further decomposed into a bulk velocityand a shear field. the method is applied here to the mark iii data within asphere of radius 60 mpc/h about the local group, and to the sfi data forcomparison. we find that the tidal field contributes about half of thelocal-group velocity with respect to the cmb, with the tidal bulk velocitypointing to within ~ 30 degrees of the cmb dipole. the eigenvector with thelargest eigenvalue of the shear tensor is aligned with the tidal bulk velocityto within ~ 40 degrees. the tidal field thus indicates the important dynamicalrole of a super attractor of mass (2-5) x 10^17 m_sun/h omega^0.4 at ~ 150mpc/h, coinciding with the shapley concentration. there is also a hint for thedynamical role of two big voids in the supergalactic plane. the results areconsistent for the two data sets and the two methods of reconstruction.

astro-ph;0111099	simulating the formation of the local galaxy population	we simulate the formation and evolution of the local galaxy populationstarting from initial conditions with a smoothed linear density field whichmatches that derived from the iras 1.2 jy galaxy survey. our simulations trackthe formation and evolution of all dark matter haloes more massive than 10e+11solar masses out to a distance of 8000 km/s from the milky way. we implementprescriptions similar to those of kauffmann et al. (1999) to follow theassembly and evolution of the galaxies within these haloes. we focus on twovariants of the cdm cosmology: an lcdm and a tcdm model. galaxy formation ineach is adjusted to reproduce the i-band tully-fisher relation of giovanelli etal. (1997). we compare the present-day luminosity functions, colours,morphology and spatial distribution of our simulated galaxies with those of thereal local population, in particular with the updated zwicky catalog, with theiras pscz redshift survey, and with individual local clusters such as coma,virgo and perseus. we also use the simulations to study the clustering biasbetween the dark matter and galaxies of differing type. although somesignificant discrepancies remain, our simulations recover the observedintrinsic properties and the observed spatial distribution of local galaxiesreasonably well. they can thus be used to calibrate methods which use theobserved local galaxy population to estimate the cosmic density parameter or todraw conclusions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. to facilitate suchwork, we publically release our z=0 galaxy catalogues, together with theunderlying mass distribution.

astro-ph;0311487	massive black hole seeds from low angular momentum material	(abridged) we present a model in which the seeds of supermassive black holesform from the lowest angular momentum gas in proto-galaxies at high redshift.we show that this leads to a correlation between black hole masses and spheroidproperties, as observed today. we assume that gas in early-forming, rare haloshas a distribution of specific angular momentum similar to that expected fordark matter halos. this distribution has a significant low angular momentumtail which implies that every proto-galaxy should contain gas that ends up in ahigh-density disc. in halos more massive than a critical threshold of\~10^8msun, the discs are gravitationally unstable, and experience an efficientlin-pringle viscosity that allows mass inflow. this process continues until thefirst massive stars disrupt the disc. black holes are created with acharacteristic mass of ~10^5 msun, independent of the redshift of formation.this serves as a lower bound for black-hole masses in galaxies today. thecomoving mass density of black hole seeds grows with time, and saturates whencosmic reionization stops gas cooling in these low-mass systems. by z~15, thecomoving mass density becomes comparable to that inferred from observations,with room for appropriate additional luminous growth during a later quasaraccretion phase. hierarchical merging after z~15 naturally leads to a linearcorrelation between black-hole mass and stellar spheroid mass, with negligibleblack hole masses in disc-dominated galaxies.

astro-ph;0403135	phase-space structure of dark-matter haloes: scale-invariant pdf driven  by substructure	we present a method for computing the 6-dimensional coarse-grainedphase-space density $f(x,v)$ in an n-body system, and derive its distributionfunction $v(f)$. the method is based on delaunay tessellation, where $v(f)$ isobtained with an effective fixed smoothing window over a wide $f$ range. theerrors are estimated, and $v(f)$ is found to be insensitive to the samplingresolution or the simulation technique. we find that in gravitationally relaxedhaloes built by hierarchical clustering, $v(f)$ is well approximated by arobust power law, $v(f) \propto f^{-2.5 \pm 0.05}$, over more than 4 decades in$f$, from its virial level to the numerical resolution limit. this is tested tobe valid in the $\lambda$cdm cosmology for haloes with masses$10^9-10^{15}\msun$, indicating insensitivity to the slope of the initialfluctuation power spectrum. by mapping the phase-space density in positionspace, we find that the high-$f$ end of $v(f)$ is dominated by the ``cold''subhaloes rather than the parent-halo central region and its global sphericalprofile. the value of $f$ in subhaloes near the virial radius is typically$&gt;100$ times higher than its value at the halo centre, and it decreasesgradually from outside in toward its value at the halo centre. this seems toreflect phase mixing due to mergers and tidal effects involving puffing up andheating. the phase-space density can thus provide a sensitive tool for studyingthe evolution of subhaloes during the hierarchical buildup of haloes. itremains to be understood why the evolved substructure adds up to the actualuniversal power law of $v(f) \propto f^{-2.5}$. it seems that this behaviourresults from the hierarchical clustering process and is not a general result ofviolent relaxation.

astro-ph;0501622	lost &amp; found dark matter in elliptical galaxies	there is strong evidence that the mass in the universe is dominated by darkmatter, which exerts gravitational attraction but whose exact nature isunknown. in particular, all galaxies are believed to be embedded in massivehaloes of dark matter. this view has recently been challenged by surprisinglylow random stellar velocities in the outskirts of ordinary elliptical galaxies,which were interpreted as indicating a lack of dark matter (mendez et al. 2001;romanowsky et al. 2003). here we show that the low velocities are in factcompatible with galaxy formation in dark-matter haloes. using numericalsimulations of disc-galaxy mergers, we find that the stellar orbits in theouter regions of the resulting ellipticals are very elongated. these stars weretorn by tidal forces from their original galaxies during the first closepassage and put on outgoing trajectories. the elongated orbits, combined withthe steeply falling density profile of the observed tracers, explain theobserved low velocities even in the presence of large amounts of dark matter.projection effects when viewing a triaxial elliptical can lead to even lowerobserved velocities along certain lines of sight.

astro-ph;0601295	modelling the galaxy bimodality: shutdown above a critical halo mass	we reproduce the blue and red sequences in the observed joint distribution ofcolour and magnitude for galaxies at low and high redshifts using hybridn-body/semi-analytic simulations of galaxy formation. the match of model anddata is achieved by mimicking the effects of cold flows versus shock heatingcoupled to feedback from active galactic nuclei (agns), as predicted by dekel &amp;birnboim (2006). after a critical epoch z=3, only haloes below a criticalshock-heating mass 10^12msun enjoy gas supply by cold flows and form stars,while cooling and star formation are shut down abruptly above this mass. theshock-heated gas is kept hot because being dilute it is vulnerable to feedbackfrom energetic sources such as agns in their self-regulated mode. the shutdownexplains in detail the bright-end truncation of the blue sequence at ~l*, theappearance of luminous red-and-dead galaxies on the red sequence startingalready at z~2, the colour bimodality, its strong dependence on environmentdensity and its correlations with morphology and other galaxy properties.before z~2-3, even haloes above the shock-heating mass form stars by coldstreams penetrating through the hot gas. this explains the bright star-forminggalaxies at z~3-4, the early appearance of massive galaxies on the redsequence, the high cosmological star-formation rate at high redshifts and thesubsequent low rate at low redshifts.

astro-ph;0601345	kinematical and dynamical modeling of elliptical galaxies	elements of kinematical and dynamical modeling of elliptical galaxies (es)are presented. in projection, nfw models resemble sersic models, but with avery narrow range of shapes (m=3+/-1). the total density profile of es cannotbe nfw-like because the predicted local m/l and aperture velocity dispersionwithin an effective radius (re) are much lower than observed. stars must thendominate es out to a few re. fitting an nfw model to the total density profileof sersic+nfw (stars+dark matter [dm]) es results in very high concentrationparameters, as found by x-ray observers. kinematical modeling of es assuming anisotropic nfw dm model underestimates m/l at the virial radius by a factor of1.6 to 2.4, because dissipationless lcdm halos have slightly different densityprofiles and slightly radial velocity anisotropy. in n-body+gas simulations ofes as merger remnants of spirals embedded in dm halos, the slope of the dmdensity profile is steeper when the initial spiral galaxies are gas-rich. thehansen &amp; moore (2006) relation between anisotropy and the slope of the densityprofile breaks down for gas and dm, but the stars follow an analogous relationwith slightly less radial anisotropies for a given density slope. usingkurtosis (h_4) to infer anisotropy in es is dangerous, as h_4 is also sensitiveto small levels of rotation. the stationary jeans equation provides accuratemasses out to 8 re. the discrepancy between the modeling of romanowsky et al.(2003), indicating a dearth of dm in es, and the simulations analyzed by dekelet al. (2005), which match the spectroscopic observations of es, is partly dueto radial anisotropy and to observing oblate es face-on. however, one of the 15solutions to the orbit modeling of romanowsky et al. is found to have an amountand concentration of dm consistent with lcdm predictions.

astro-ph;9309038	do spirals and ellipticals trace the same velocity field?	we test the hypothesis that the velocity field derived from tully-fishermeasurements of spiral galaxies, and that derived independently from dn-sigmameasurements of ellipticals and s0s, are noisy versions of the same underlyingvelocity field. the radial velocity fields are derived using tensor gaussiansmoothing of radius 1200 km/s. they are compared at grid points near which thesampling by both types of galaxies is proper. this requirement defines a volumeof ~(50 mpc/h)^3, containing ~10 independent subvolumes, mostly limited by theavailable ellipticals. the two fields are compared using a correlationstatistic, whose distribution is determined via monte-carlo simulations. wefind that the data is consistent with the hypothesis, at the 10% level. wedemonstrate that the failure to reject the correlation is not just a result ofthe errors being big, by using the same method to rule out completeindependence between the fields at the 99.8% level. the zero points of the twodistance indicators are matched by maximizing the correlation between the twovelocity fields. there is a marginal hint that the ellipticals tend to streamslower than the spirals by ~8%. the correlation reinforced here is consistentwith the common working hypotheses that (a) the derived large-scale velocityfield is real, (b) it has a gravitational origin, and (c) the large-scalevelocities of spirals and ellipticals are hardly biased relative to each other.on the other hand, it does not rule out any alternative to gravity whereobjects of all types obtain similar large-scale velocities.

astro-ph;9311052	testing the gravitational instability hypothesis?	we challenge a widely accepted assumption of observational cosmology: thatsuccessful reconstruction of observed galaxy density fields from measuredgalaxy velocity fields (or vice versa), using the methods of gravitationalinstability theory, implies that the observed large-scale structures andlarge-scale flows were produced by the action of gravity. this assumption isfalse, in that there exist non-gravitational theories that pass thereconstruction tests and gravitational theories with certain forms of biasedgalaxy formation that fail them. gravitational instability theory predictsspecific correlations between large-scale velocity and mass density fields, butthe same correlations arise in any model where (a) structures in the galaxydistribution grow from homogeneous initial conditions in a way that satisfiesthe continuity equation, and (b) the present-day velocity field is irrotationaland proportional to the time-averaged velocity field. we demonstrate theseassertions using analytical arguments and n-body simulations of gravitationaland non-gravitational models. we also show examples of gravitational andnon-gravitational models that {\it fail} reconstruction tests because galaxyformation is modulated (``biased'') in a way that violates the continuityequation. we discuss the relation between the value of $\omega$ inferred fromvelocity-density comparisons and the true cosmological value.

astro-ph;9404052	omega from the skewness of the cosmic velocity divergence	we propose a method for measuring the cosmological density parameter $\omega$from the statistics of the divergence field, $\theta \equiv h^{-1} \div v$, thedivergence of peculiar velocity, expressed in units of the hubble constant, $h\equiv 100 h km/s/mpc$. the velocity field is spatially smoothed over $\sim 10h^{-1} mpc$ to remove strongly nonlinear effects. assuming weakly-nonlineargravitational evolution from gaussian initial fluctuations, and usingsecond-order perturbative analysis, we show that $ &lt;\theta^3&gt; \propto-\omega^{-0.6} &lt;\theta^2&gt;^2$. the constant of proportionality depends on thesmoothing window. for a top-hat of radius r and volume-weighted smoothing, thisconstant is $26/7-\gamma$, where $\gamma=-d\log &lt;\theta^2&gt; / d\log r$. if thepower spectrum is a power law, $p(k)\propto k^n$, then $\gamma=3+n$. a gaussianwindow yields similar results. the resulting method for measuring $\omega$ isindependent of any assumed biasing relation between galaxies and mass.  the method has been successfully tested with numerical simulations. apreliminary application to real data, provided by the potent recovery procedurefrom observed velocities favors $\omega \sim 1$. however, because of anuncertain sampling error, this result should be treated as an assessment of thefeasibility of our method rather than a definitive measurement of $\omega$.

astro-ph;9610132	from local velocities to microwave background	the mass density field as extracted from peculiar velocities in ourcosmological neighborhood is mapped back in time to the cmb in two ways. first,the density power spectrum ($p_k$) is translated into a temperature angularpower spectrum of sub-degree resolution ($c_l$) and compared to observations.second, the local density field is translated into a temperature map in a patchon the last-scattering surface of a distant observer. a likelihood analysis ofthe mark iii peculiar velocity data have constrained the range of parametersfor $p_k$ within the family of cobe-normalized cdm models (zaroubi et al 1996),favoring a slight tilt in the initial spectrum, $n&lt;1$. the corresponding rangeof $c_l$'s is plotted against current observations, indicating that the cmbdata can tighten the constraints further: only models with ``small'' tilt($n\sim 0.9$) and ``high'' baryonic content ($\omega_b \sim 0.1$) could survivethe two data sets simultaneously. the local mass density field that has beenrecovered from the velocities via a wiener method is convolved with a boltzmanncalculation to recover $10'$ resolution temperature maps as viewed fromdifferent directions. the extent of the cmb patch and the amplitude offluctuations depend on the choice of cosmological parameters, e.g., the local$100\hmpc$ sphere corresponds to $90'$ to $30'$ at the cmb for $\omega$ between1 and 0 respectively. the phases of the temperature map are correlated withthose of the density field, contrary to the contribution of the sachs-wolfeeffect alone. this correlation suggests the possibility of an inversereconstruction of the underlying density field from cmb data with interestingtheoretical implications.

astro-ph;9912073	non-linear stochastic galaxy biasing in cosmological simulations	we study the biasing relation between dark-matter halos or galaxies and theunderlying mass distribution, using cosmological $n$-body simulations in whichgalaxies are modelled via semi-analytic recipes. the nonlinear, stochasticbiasing is quantified in terms of the mean biasing function and the scatterabout it as a function of time, scale and object properties. the biasing ofgalaxies and halos shows a general similarity and a characteristic shape, withno galaxies in deep voids and a steep slope in moderately underdense regions.at $\sim 8\hmpc$, the nonlinearity is typically $\lsim 10$ percent and thestochasticity is a few tens of percent, corresponding to $\sim 30$ percentvariations in the cosmological parameter $\beta=\omega^{0.6}/b$. biasingdepends weakly on halo mass, galaxy luminosity, and scale. the time evolutionis rapid, with the mean biasing larger by a factor of a few at $z\sim 3$compared to $z=0$, and with a minimum for the nonlinearity and stochasticity atan intermediate redshift. biasing today is a weak function of the cosmologicalmodel, reflecting the weak dependence on the power-spectrum shape, but the timeevolution is more cosmology-dependent, relecting the effect of the growth rate.we provide predictions for the relative biasing of galaxies of different typeand color, to be compared with upcoming large redshift surveys. analytic modelsin which the number of objects is conserved underestimate the evolution ofbiasing, while models that explicitly account for merging provide a gooddescription of the biasing of halos and its evolution, suggesting that mergingis a crucial element in the evolution of biasing.
