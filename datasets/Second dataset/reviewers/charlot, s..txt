0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0909.2279	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in galaxies at z~0.1: the effect of  star formation and agn	we present the analysis of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) spectraof a sample of 92 typical star forming galaxies at 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 observed withthe spitzer irs. we compare the relative strengths of pah emission featureswith sdss optical diagnostics to probe the relationship between pah grainproperties and star formation and agn activity. short-to-long wavelength pahratios, and in particular the 7.7-to-11.3 micron feature ratio, are stronglycorrelated with the star formation diagnostics d_n(4000) and h-alpha equivalentwidth, increasing with younger stellar populations. this ratio also shows asignificant difference between active and non-active galaxies, with the activegalaxies exhibiting weaker 7.7 micron emission. a hard radiation field asmeasured by [oiii]/h-beta and [neiii]_15.6/[neii]_12.8 affects pah ratiosdifferently depending on whether this field results from starburst activity oran agn. our results are consistent with a picture in which larger pah moleculesgrow more efficiently in richer media and in which smaller pah molecules arepreferentially destroyed by agn.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1006.5470	mid-infrared spectral measures of star-formation and agn activity in  normal galaxies	we investigate the use of mir pah bands, continuum and emission lines asprobes of star-formation and agn activity in a sample of 100 'normal' and local(z~0.1) emission-line galaxies. the mir spectra were obtained with the spitzerspace telescope infrared spectrograph (irs) as part of the spitzer-sdss-galexspectroscopic survey (ssgss) which includes multi-wavelength photometry fromthe uv to the fir and optical spectroscopy. the continuum and features wereextracted using pahfit (smith et al. 2007), a decomposition code which we findto yield pah equivalent widths up to ~30 times larger than the commonly usedspline methods. despite the lack of extreme objects in our sample (such asstrong agns, low metallicity galaxies or ulirgs), we find significantvariations in pah, continuum and emission line properties and systematic trendsbetween these mir properties and optically derived physical properties such asage, metallicity and radiation field hardness. we revisit the diagnosticdiagram relating pah equivalent widths and [ne ii]12.8micrometers/[oiv]25.9micrometers line ratios and find it to be in much better agreement withthe standard optical star-formation/agn classification than when splinedecompositions are used, while also potentially revealing obscured agns. theluminosity of individual pah components, of the continuum, and with poorerstatistics, of the neon emission lines and molecular hydrogen lines, are foundto be tightly correlated to the total ir luminosity, making individual mircomponents good gauges of the total dust emission in sf galaxies. like thetotal ir luminosity, these individual components can be used to estimate dustattenuation in the uv and in halpha lines based on energy balance arguments. wealso propose average scaling relations between these components and dustcorrected, halpha derived star-formation rates.

0708.2790	spectral models for solar-scaled and alpha-enhanced stellar populations	we present the first models allowing one to explore in a consistent way theinfluence of changes in the alpha-element-to-iron abundance ratio on thehigh-resolution spectral properties of evolving stellar populations. the modelscover the wavelength range 300-1340nm at a resolution of fwhm=1aa, formetallicities in the range 0.005&lt;=z&lt;=0.048 and stellar population ages 3 to 14gyr. these models are based on a recent library of synthetic stellar spectraand a new library of stellar evolutionary tracks, both computed for threedifferent [fe/h] (-0.5,0.0 and 0.2) and two different [alpha/fe] (0.0 and 0.4).we expect our fully synthetic models to be primarily useful for evaluating thedifferential effect of changes in the alpha/fe ratio on spectral propertiessuch as broad-band colours and narrow spectral features. in addition, we assessthe accuracy of absolute model predictions in two ways: first, by comparing thepredictions of models for scaled-solar metal abundances [alpha/fe]=0.0) tothose of existing models based on libraries of observed stellar spectra; andsecondly, by comparing the predictions of models for alpha-enhanced metalabundances ([alpha/fe]=0.4) to observed spectra of massive early-type galaxiesin the sdss-dr4. we find that our models predict accurate strengths for thosespectral indices that are strongly sensitive to the abundances of fe and alphaelements. the predictions are less reliable for the strengths of other spectralfeatures, such as those dominated by the abundances of c and n, as expectedfrom the fact that the models do not yet allow one to explore the influence ofthese elements in an independent way. we conclude that our models are apowerful tool for extracting new information about the chemical properties ofgalaxies for which high-quality spectra have been gathered by modern surveys.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

0709.1147	physical interpretation of the near-infrared colours of low redshift  galaxies	we use empirical techniques to interpret the near-infrared colours of asample of 5800 galaxies drawn from sloan digital sky survey (sdss) mainspectroscopic sample with yjhk photometry from the uk infrared deep sky survey(ukidss) data release one. we study correlations between near-ir coloursmeasured within sdss fibre and physical parameters derived from the spectra.these parameters include specific star formation rate, stellar age, metallicityand dust attenuation. all correlations are analyzed for samples of galaxiesthat are closely matched in redshift, in stellar mass and in concentrationindex. whereas more strongly star-forming galaxies have bluer optical colours,the opposite is true at near-ir wavelengths -- galaxies with higher specificstar formation rate have redder near-ir colours. this result agreesqualitatively with the predictions of models in which thermally pulsingasymptotic giant branch (tp-agb) stars dominate the h and k-band light of agalaxy following a burst of star formation. we also find a surprisingly strongcorrelation between the near-ir colours of star-forming galaxies and their dustattenuation as measured from the balmer decrement. unlike optical colours,however, near-ir colours exhibit very little dependence on galaxy inclination.this suggests that the correlation of near-ir colours with dust attenuationarises because tp-agb stars are the main source of dust in the galaxy. finally,we compare the near-ir colours of the galaxies in our sample to the predictionsof three different stellar population models: the bruzual &amp; charlot 2003 model,a preliminary version of a new model under development by charlot &amp; bruzual,which includes a new prescription for agb star evolution, and the maraston 2005model.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1208.0587	spider vii - revealing the stellar population content of massive  early-type galaxies out to 8re	radial trends of stellar populations in galaxies provide a valuable tool tounderstand the mechanisms of galaxy growth. in this paper, we present the firstcomprehensive analysis of optical-optical and optical-nir colours, as afunction of galaxy mass, out to the halo region (8re) of early-type galaxies(etgs). we select a sample of 674 massive etgs (m*&gt;3x10^10msun) from thesdss-based spider survey. by comparing with a large range of populationsynthesis models, we derive robust constraints on the radial trends in age andmetallicity. metallicity is unambiguously found to decrease outwards, with ameasurable steepening of the slope in the outer regions (re&lt;r&lt;8re). thegradients in stellar age are found to be more sensitive to the models used, butin general, the outer regions of etgs feature older populations compared to thecores. this trend is strongest for the most massive galaxies in our sample(m*&gt;10^11msun). furthermore, when segregating with respect to large scaleenvironment, the age gradient is more significant in etgs residing in higherdensity regions. these results shed light on the processes leading from theformation of the central core to the growth of the stellar envelope of massivegalaxies. the fact that the populations in the outer regions are older and moremetal-poor than in the core suggests a process whereby the envelope of massivegalaxies is made up of accreted small satellites (i.e. minor mergers) whosestars were born during the first stages of galaxy formation.

1212.0860	the uv continua and inferred stellar populations of galaxies at z ~ 7 -  9 revealed by the hubble ultra deep field 2012 campaign	we use the new ultra-deep, near-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra-deepfield (hudf) provided by our udf12 hst wfc3/ir campaign to explore therest-frame uv properties of galaxies at redshifts z &gt; 6.5. we present the firstunbiased measurement of the average uv power-law index, beta, for faintgalaxies at z ~ 7, the first meaningful measurements of beta at z ~ 8, andtentative estimates for a new sample of galaxies at z ~ 9. utilising galaxyselection in the new f140w imaging to minimize colour bias, and applying bothcolour and power-law estimators of beta, we find beta = -2.1 (+/-0.2) at z ~ 7for galaxies with m_uv ~ -18. this means that the faintest galaxies uncoveredat this epoch have, on average, uv colours no more extreme than those displayedby the bluest star-forming galaxies at low redshift. at z ~ 8 we find a similarvalue, beta = -1.9 (+/-0.3). at z ~ 9, we find beta = -1.8 (+/-0.6),essentially unchanged from z ~ 6 - 7 (albeit highly uncertain). finally, weshow that there is as yet no evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter inbeta within our new, robust z ~ 7 galaxy sample. our results are most easilyexplained by a population of steadily star-forming galaxies with either ~ solarmetallicity and zero dust, or moderately sub-solar (~ 10-20%) metallicity withmodest dust obscuration (a_v ~ 0.1-0.2). this latter interpretation isconsistent with the predictions of a state-of-the-art galaxy-formationsimulation, which also suggests that a significant population of very-lowmetallicity, dust-free galaxies with beta ~ -2.5 may not emerge until m_uv &gt;-16, a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the james webb spacetelescope.

1306.6333	chronos: a nir spectroscopic galaxy survey. from the formation of  galaxies to the peak of activity	chronos is our response to esa's call for white papers to define the sciencefor the future l2, l3 missions. chronos targets the formation and evolution ofgalaxies, by collecting the deepest nir spectroscopic data, from the formationof the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. thestrong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of surveyimpossible from a ground-based observatory. the spectra of galaxies representthe equivalent of a dna fingerprint, containing information about the pasthistory of star formation and chemical enrichment. the proposed survey willallow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescalesof quenching triggered by star formation or agn activity, the effect ofenvironment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection betweenthe galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. to provide these data,the mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of verydeep nir spectroscopy. a combination of a high multiplex and very longintegration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-qualityspectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of theuniverse, from 400 million to 6 billion years after the big bang, i.e. coveringthe most active half of cosmic history.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

0803.0997	a new method to separate star forming from agn galaxies at intermediate  redshift: the submillijansky radio population in the vla-cosmos survey	we explore the properties of the submillijansky radio population at 20 cm byapplying a newly developed optical color-based method to separate star forming(sf) from agn galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1.3). although opticalrest-frame colors are used, our separation method is shown to be efficient, andnot biased against dusty starburst galaxies. this classification method hasbeen calibrated and tested on a local radio selected optical sample. givenaccurate multi-band photometry and redshifts, it carries the potential to begenerally applicable to any galaxy sample where sf and agn galaxies are the twodominant populations.  in order to quantify the properties of the submillijansky radio population,we have analyzed ~2,400 radio sources, detected at 20 cm in the vla-cosmossurvey. 90% of these have submillijansky flux densities. we classify theobjects into 1) star candidates, 2) quasi stellar objects, 3) agn, 4) sf, and5) high redshift (z&gt;1.3) galaxies. we find, for the composition of thesubmillijansky radio population, that sf galaxies are not the dominantpopulation at submillijansky flux levels, as previously often assumed, but thatthey make up an approximately constant fraction of 30-40% in the flux densityrange of ~50 microjy to 0.7 mjy. in summary, based on the entire vla-cosmosradio population at 20 cm, we find that the radio population at these fluxdensities is a mixture of roughly 30-40% of sf and 50-60% of agn galaxies, witha minor contribution (~10%) of qsos.

1508.05103	abundance patterns in early-type galaxies: is there a 'knee' in the  [fe/h] vs. [alpha/fe] relation?	early-type galaxies (etgs) are known to be enhanced in alpha elements, inaccordance with their old ages and short formation timescales. in thiscontribution we aim to resolve the enrichment histories of etgs. this means westudy the abundance of fe ([fe/h]) and the alpha-element groups ([alpha/fe])separately for stars older than 9.5 gyr ([fe/h]o, [alpha/fe]o) and for starsbetween 1.5 and 9.5 gyr ([fe/h]i, [alpha/fe]i). through extensive simulation weshow that we can indeed recover the enrichment history per galaxy. we thenanalyze a spectroscopic sample of 2286 early-type galaxies from the sdssselected to be etgs. we separate out those galaxies for which the abundance ofiron in stars grows throughout the lifetime of the galaxy, i.e. in which[fe/h]o &lt; [fe/h]i. we confirm earlier work where the [fe/h] and [alpha/fe]parameters are correlated with the mass and velocity dispersion of etgs. weemphasize that the strongest relation is between [alpha/fe] and age. thisrelation falls into two regimes, one with a steep slope for old galaxies andone with a shallow slope for younger etgs. the vast majority of etgs in oursample do not show the 'knee' in the plot of [fe/h] vs. [alpha/fe] commonlyobserved in local group galaxies. this implies that for the vast majority ofetgs, the stars younger than 9.5 gyrs are likely to have been accreted orformed from accreted gas. the properties of the intermediate-age stars inaccretion-dominated etgs indicate that mass growth through late (minor) mergersin etgs is dominated by galaxies with low [fe/h] and low [alpha/fe]. the methodof reconstructing the stellar enrichment histories of etgs introduced in thispaper promises to constrain the star formation and mass assembly histories oflarge samples of galaxies in a unique way.

1509.01101	the lyman continuum escape fraction of galaxies at z=3.3 in the  vuds-lbc/cosmos field	the lyman continuum (lyc) flux escaping from high-z galaxies into the igm isa fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in thereionization epoch. we have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies atz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of lyc photons escaping fromgalaxy halos. uv deep imaging in the cosmos field obtained with the prime focuscamera lbc at the lbt telescope was used together with a catalog ofspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds) to builda sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with l&gt;0.5l*. we obtained deep lbc images ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.40 both in the rand deep u bands. a sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escapefractions&gt;28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, withthe exception of two marginal detections (s/n~2) in the u band, all the other 8galaxies are most likely contaminated by the uv flux of low-z interloperslocated close to the high-z targets. the average escape fraction derived fromthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel&lt;2%. the impliedhi photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the igmionized at z~3, as observed in the lyman forest of high-z qso spectra or by theproximity effect. these results support a scenario where high redshift,relatively bright (l&gt;0.5l*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustainthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic igm at z~3. star-forminggalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (l&lt;&lt;l*) can be themajor contributors to the reionization of the universe only if their physicalproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. alternatively,ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the agnpopulation at high-z.

0705.3018	the vimos vlt deep survey: tracing the galaxy stellar mass assembly  history over the last 8gyr	we selected a mass-limited sample of 4048 objects from the vimos vlt deepsurvey in the redshift interval 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.3. we used the amplitude of the 4000balmer break (dn4000) to separate the galaxy population and the ew[oii]3727line as proxy for the star formation activity. we discuss to what extentstellar mass drives galaxy evolution, showing for the first time the interplaybetween stellar ages and stellar masses over the past 8gyr. low-mass galaxieshave small dn4000 and at increasing stellar mass, the galaxy distribution movesto higher dn4000 values as observed in the local universe. as cosmic time goesby, we witness an increasing abundance of massive spectroscopically et systemsat the expense of the lt systems. this spectral transformation is a processstarted at early epochs and continuing efficiently down to the local universe.this is confirmed by the evolution of our type-dependent stellar mass function.the underlying stellar ages of lt galaxies apparently do not show evolution,likely as a result of a continuous formation of new stars. all star formationactivity indicators consistently point towards a star formation history peakedin the past for massive galaxies, with little or no residual star formationtaking place in the most recent epochs. the activity and efficiency of formingstars are mechanisms that depend on stellar mass, and the mass assembly becomesprogressively less efficient in massive systems as time elapses. the conceptsof star formation downsizing and mass assembly downsizing describe a singlescenario that has a top-down evolutionary pattern. the role of (dry) mergingevents seems to be only marginal at z&lt;1.3, as our estimated efficiency instellar mass assembly can possibly account for the progressive accumulation ofpassively evolving galaxies.

0807.4636	the vvds-swire-galex-cfhtls surveys: physical properties of galaxies at  z below 1.2 from photometric data	we intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters ofgalaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshiftof 1.2. this method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of allgalaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. we use an extensive dataset,assembled in the context of the vvds survey, which reaches from the uv to their and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. we alsouse a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formationhistories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). we find thatwe can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formationrate with good confidence. we validate the star formation rate determinationsin particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observedgalaxies with an emission line measurement. we use our sample to build thenumber density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specificstar formation rate and redshift. we then study whether the stellar massfunction at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function andstar formation rate distribution at an earlier time. we find that the predictedgrowth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one.however, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower thanobserved, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies isoverpredicted. when comparing with a direct measurement of the major mergerrate from the vvds survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explainabout a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likelycontributed through minor mergers.

astro-ph;0003128	a simple model for the absorption of starlight by dust in galaxies	we present a new model to compute the effects of dust on the integratedspectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized prescription of the mainfeatures of the interstellar medium (ism). the model includes the ionization ofhii regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and theinfluence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption ofradiation. we compute the production of emission lines and the absorption ofcontinuum radiation in the hii regions and the subsequent transfer of line andcontinuum radiation in the surrounding hi regions and the ambient ism. thisenables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of a homogeneoussample of nearby uv-selected starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-irto uv luminosities, the ratio of halpha to hbeta luminosities, the halphaequivalent width, and the uv spectral slope. we show that the finite lifetimeof stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve an apparent discrepancybetween the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. inaddition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional tolambda^-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-ir to uvluminosities and the uv spectral slope. we interpret this relation most simplyas a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. the shallowwavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with thesteepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. inparticular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with opticaldepths similar to those in the milky way provides a consistent interpretationof all the observations. our model for absorption can be incorporated easilyinto any population synthesis model.

astro-ph;0101097	nebular emission from star-forming galaxies	we present a new model for computing consistently the line and continuumemission from galaxies, based on a combination of recent population synthesisand photoionization codes. we use effective parameters to describe the hiiregions and the diffuse gas ionized by single stellar generations in a galaxy[...]. we calibrate the nebular properties of our model using the observed[oiii]/hbeta, [oii]/[oiii], [sii]/halpha, and [nii]/[sii] ratios of arepresentative sample of nearby spiral and irregular, starburst, and hiigalaxies. to compute whole (line plus continuum) spectral energy distributions,we include the absorption by dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ism)using a recent simple prescription, which is consistent with observations ofnearby starburst galaxies. our model enables us to interpret quantitatively theobserved optical spectra of galaxies in terms of stars, gas, and dustparameters. we find that the range of ionized-gas properties spanned by nearbygalaxies implies factors of 3.5 and 14 variations in the halpha and [oii]luminosities produced per unit star formation rate (sfr). when accounting forstellar halpha absorption and absorption by dust in the neutral ism, the actualuncertainties in sfr estimates based on the emergent halpha and [oii]luminosities are as high as several decades. we derive new estimators of thesfr, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and the effective absorption optical depthof the dust in galaxies. we show that, with the help of other lines such as[oii], hbeta, [oiii], [nii], or [sii], the uncertainties in sfr estimates basedon halpha can be reduced to a factor of only 2-3, even if the halpha line isblended with the adjacent [nii] lines. without halpha, however, the sfr isdifficult to estimate from the [oii], hbeta, and [oiii] lines.

astro-ph;0111289	star formation, metallicity and dust properties derived from the sapm  galaxy survey spectra	we have derived star formation rates (sfrs), gas-phase oxygen abundances andeffective dust absorption optical depths for a sample of galaxies drawn fromthe stromlo-apm redshift survey using the new charlot and longhetti (2001;cl01) models, which provide a physically consistent description of the effectsof stars, gas and dust on the integrated spectra of galaxies. our sampleconsists of 705 galaxies with measurements of the fluxes and equivalent widthsof halpha, [oii], and one or both of [nii] and [sii]. for a subset of thegalaxies, 60 and 100 micron iras fluxes are available. we compare the starformation rates derived using the models with those derived using standardestimators based on the halpha, the [oii] and the far-infrared luminosities ofthe galaxies. the cl01 sfr estimates agree well with those derived from theiras fluxes, but are typically a factor of ~3 higher than those derived fromthe halpha or the [oii] fluxes, even after the usual mean attenuationcorrection of a_halpha=1 mag is applied to the data. we show that the reasonfor this discrepancy is that the standard halpha estimator neglects theabsorption of ionizing photons by dust in hii regions and the contamination ofhalpha emission by stellar absorption. we also use our sample to studyvariations in star formation and metallicity as a function of galaxy absolutebj magnitude. for this sample, the star formation rate per unit bj luminosityis independent of magnitude. the gas-phase oxygen abundance does increase withbj luminosity, although the scatter in metallicity at fixed magnitude is large.

astro-ph;0210405	spectroscopic study of blue compact galaxies ii. spectral analysis and  correlations	this is the second paper in a series studying the star formation rates,stellar components, metallicities, and star formation histories and evolutionof a sample of blue compact galaxies. we analyzed spectral properties of 97blue compact galaxies, obtained with the beijing astronomical observatory(china) 2.16 m telescope, with spectral range 3580\aa -- 7400\aa. we classifythe spectra according to their emission lines: 13 of the total 97 bcgs sampleare non-emission line galaxies (non-elgs); 10 have agn-like emission (agns),and 74 of them are star-forming galaxies (sfgs). emission line fluxes andequivalent widths, continuum fluxes, the 4000 \aa balmer break index andequivalent widths of absorption lines are measured from the spectra.  we investigate the emission line trends in the integrated spectra of thestar-forming galaxies in our sample, and find that: 1) the equivalent widths ofemission lines are correlated with the galaxy absolute blue magnitude $m_b$;lower luminosity systems tend to have larger equivalent widths. 2) theequivalent width ratio [nii]6583/h$\alpha$ is anti-correlated with equivalentwidth h$\alpha$; a relationship is given that can be used to remove the [nii]contribution from blended h$\alpha$ + [nii]6548, 6583. 3) the [oii], h$\beta$,h$\gamma$ and h$\alpha$ fluxes are correlated; those can be used as starformation tracers in the blue. 4) the metallicity indices show trends withgalaxy absolute magnitude and attenuation by dust; faint, low-mass bcgs havelower metallicity and color excess.

astro-ph;0309134	stellar population synthesis at the resolution of 2003	we present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellarpopulations at ages between 100,000 yr and 20 gyr at a resolution of 3 a acrossthe whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 a for a wide range ofmetallicities. these predictions are based on a newly available library ofobserved stellar spectra. we also compute the spectral evolution across alarger wavelength range, from 91 a to 160 micron, at lower resolution. themodel incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and anobservationally motivated prescription for thermally-pulsing stars on theasymptotic giant branch. the latter is supported by observations of surfacebrightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. we show that this modelreproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitudediagrams of galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities.stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionaryphases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of starclusters in the magellanic clouds. the model reproduces in detail typicalgalaxy spectra from the early data release (edr) of the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss). we exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrainphysical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dustcontent of galaxies. our model is the first to enable accurate studies ofabsorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range ofages. using the highest-quality spectra of the sdss edr, we show that thismodel can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those lick indicesthat do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios [abridged].

astro-ph;0311060	the physical properties of star forming galaxies in the low redshift  universe	(modified) we present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of\~10^5 galaxies with measurable star formation in the sdss. by comparingphysical information extracted from the emission lines with continuumproperties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies atz&lt;0.2. we take out essentially all aperture bias using resolved imaging,allowing an accurate estimate of the total sfrs in galaxies. we determine thesfr density to be 1.915^{+0.02}_{-0.01}(rand.)^{+0.14}_{-0.42} (sys.) h7010^{-2} msun/yr/mpc^3 at z=0.1 (for a kroupa imf) and we study the distributionof star formation as a function of various physical parameters. the majority ofthe star formation in the low redshift universe takes place in moderatelymassive galaxies (10^10-10^11 msun), typically in hsb disk galaxies. roughly15% of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of anactive nucleus. about 20% occurs in starburst galaxies. we show that thepresent to past-average star formation rate, the scalo b-parameter; is almostconstant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only atm*&gt;10^10 msun. the volume averaged b parameter is 0.408^{+0.005}_{-0.002}(rand).^{+0.029}_{-0.090} (sys.) h70^{-1}. we use this value constrain the starformation history of the universe. in agreement with other work we find acorrelation between $b$ and morphological type, as well as a tight correlationbetween the 4000aa break (d4000) and b. we discuss how d4000 can be used toestimate b parameters for high redshift galaxies.

astro-ph;0506269	the host galaxies of radio-loud agn: mass dependencies, gas cooling and  agn feedback	the properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215radio-loud agn with redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3, defined from the sdss, areinvestigated. these are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4ghzluminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 w/hz. the fraction of galaxies that hostradio-loud agn with l(1.4ghz) &gt; 10^23 w/hz is a strong function of stellarmass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 msun to more than30% at 5x10^11 msun. the integral radio luminosity function is derived in sixranges of stellar and black hole mass. its shape is very similar in all ofthese ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. its normalisationvaries strongly with mass, as m_*^2.5 or m_bh^1.6; this scaling only begins tobreak down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. there is nocorrelation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud agnin the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud isindependent of whether it is optically classified as an agn. the host galaxiesof the radio-loud agn have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies ofthe same mass.  all of these findings support the conclusion that the optical agn and lowradio luminosity agn phenomena are independent and are triggered by differentphysical mechanisms. intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of theradio-loud agn fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from thehot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. it is speculated that gas coolingprovides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud agn activity,and it is argued that agn heating could plausibly balance the cooling of thegas over time.

astro-ph;0509628	a large population of galaxies 9 to 12 billion years back in the history  of the universe	to understand the evolution of galaxies, we need to know as accurately aspossible how many galaxies were present in the universe at different epochs.galaxies in the young universe have hitherto mainly been identified using theirexpected optical colours, but this leaves open the possibility that asignificant population remains undetected because their colours are the resultof a complex mix of stars, gas, dust or active galactic nuclei. here we reportthe results of a flux-limited i-band survey of galaxies at look-back times of 9to 12 billion years. we find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between1.4 and 5. this population is 1.6 to 6.2 times larger than previous estimates,with the difference increasing towards brighter magnitudes. strong ultravioletcontinua (in the rest frame of the galaxies) indicate vigorous star formationrates of more than 10 to 100 solar masses per year. as a consequence, thecosmic star formation rate is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3to 4.

astro-ph;0511656	the vimos-vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering per  spectral type to z~1.5	we measure the evolution of clustering for galaxies with different spectraltypes from 6495 galaxies with 17.5&lt;=i_ab&lt;=24 and measured spectroscopicredshift in the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey. we classify our sample into4 classes, based on the fit of well-defined galaxy spectral energydistributions on observed multi-color data. we measure the projected functionwp(rp) and estimate the best-fit parameters for a power-law real-spacecorrelation function. we find the clustering of early-spectral-type galaxies tobe markedly stronger than that of late-type galaxies at all redshifts up toz&lt;=1.2. at z~0.8, early-type galaxies display a correlation lengthr_0=4.8+/-0.9h^{-1}mpc, while late types have r_0=2.5+/-0.4h^{-1}mpc. theclustering of these objects increases up to r_0=3.42+/-0.7h^{-1}mpc for z~1.4.the relative bias between early- and late-type galaxies within ourmagnitude-limited survey remains approximately constant with b~1.7-1.8 fromz~=0.2 up to z~=1, with indications for a decrease at z&gt;1.2, due to the growthin clustering of the star-forming population. we find similar results whensplitting the sample into `red' and `blue' galaxies using the observed colorbi-modality. when compared to the expected linear growth of mass fluctuations,a natural interpretation of these observations is that: (a) the assembly ofmassive early type galaxies is already mostly complete in the densest darkmatter halos at z~=1; (b) luminous late-type galaxies are located inhigher-density, more clustered regions of the universe at z~=1.5 than atpresent, indicating that star formation activity is progressively increasing,going back in time, in the higher-density peaks that today are mostly dominatedby old galaxies.

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0605300	ages and metallicities of early-type galaxies in the sdss: new insight  into the physical origin of the colour-magnitude and the mg2-sigmav relations	we exploit recent constraints on the ages and metallicities of early-typegalaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to gain new insight into thephysical origin of two fundamental relations obeyed by these galaxies: thecolour-magnitude and the mg2-sigmav relations. our sample consists of 26,003galaxies selected from the sdss dr2 on the basis of their concentrated lightprofiles, for which we have previously derived median-likelihood estimates ofstellar metallicity, light-weighted age and stellar mass. our analysis providesthe most unambiguous demonstration to date of the fact that both relations areprimarily sequences in stellar mass and that total stellar metallicity,alpha-elements-to-iron abundance ratio and light-weighted age all increase withmass along the two relations. for high-mass ellipticals, the dispersion in ageis small and consistent with the error. at the low-mass end, there is a tailtowards younger ages, which dominates the scatter in colour and index strengthat fixed mass. a small, but detectable, intrinsic scatter in themass-metallicity relation also contributes to the scatter in the twoobservational scaling relations, even at high masses. our results suggest thatthe chemical composition of an early-type galaxy is more tightly related to itsdynamical mass (including stars and dark matter) than to its stellar mass. theratio between stellar mass and dynamical mass appears to decrease from theleast massive to the most massive galaxies in our sample.

astro-ph;0606355	the rest-frame optical colors of 99,000 sdss galaxies	we synthesize the rest-frame stroemgren colors using sdss spectra for 99,088galaxies selected from data release 1. this narrow-band ~200 aa photometricsystem (uz, vz, bz, yz), first designed for the determination of effectivetemperature, metallicity and gravity of stars, measures the continuum spectralslope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 aa wavelength range. galaxiesform a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-colordiagram. the bruzual &amp; charlot population synthesis models suggest that theposition of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combinationof metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. galaxy distributionalong the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 gyrold single stellar population. the position perpendicular to the locus isindependent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, asimplied by both the models and the statistics of iras detections. a comparisonof this locus with the galaxy locus in the h_delta-d_n(4000) diagram, utilizedby kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tightcorrelation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. overall,the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire uv to near-ir range canbe described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, orbetter. this nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in themulti-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusionof yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that sdss galaxyspectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. apparently, thecontributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission fromgalaxies are combined in a simple and well-defined way.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

astro-ph;9402063	evolution of galaxies in clusters	we use new models of stellar population synthesis to estimate the fraction ofstars formed during the last major bursts of star formation in e/s0 galaxies inlow-redshift clusters ($z\simlt0.4$) from the spectral signatures ofintermediate-age stars. we find that the mass fraction of stars formed in latebursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased smoothly withredshift, from about 8\% at $z\approx1$ to less than 1\% at $z\approx0$. thisresult, which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers, isnearly independent of the assumed ages and morphological types of theprogenitor galaxies prior to the last major bursts of star formation. we thencompute the implied color and 4000 {\aa} break evolution for progenitors ofe/s0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts $0\simlt z\simlt1$. we investigate aconservative model in which all present-day e/s0 galaxies are assumed toinitially be elliptical galaxies and to then undergo bursts of star formationat the rate estimated from the signatures of intermediate-age stars at lowredshifts. this model reproduces well the observed spread of colors and 4000{\aa} breaks of galaxies in high-redshift clusters, but underestimates thefraction of galaxies in the blue tail of the distribution. such a discrepancymay be interpreted as an increasing fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters athigh redshift, as suggested independently by recent {\it hst} observations ofintermediate-redshift clusters. the current data do not seem to requiremorphological evolution of cluster galaxies out to $z\sim0.4$, but suggest thateither morphological or strong luminosity evolution might have played a majorrole at $z\simgt0.7$.

astro-ph;9803235	the age and metallicity range of early-type galaxies in clusters	we present an unbiased method for evaluating the ranges of ages andmetallicities which are allowed by the photometric properties of the stellarpopulations that dominate the light of early-type galaxies in clusters. themethod is based on the analysis of morphologically-classified early-typegalaxies in 17 clusters at redshifts 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9 and in the nearby coma clusterusing recent stellar population synthesis models that span a wide range ofmetallicities. we confirm that metallicity effects must play a role in theorigin of the slope of the color-magnitude relation for cluster early-typegalaxies. we show, however, that the small scatter of the color-magnituderelation out to redshifts z=1 does not formally imply a common epoch of majorstar formation for all early-type galaxies. instead, it requires that galaxiesassembling more recently be on average more metal-rich than older galaxies ofsimilar luminosity. regardless of the true ages and metallicities of early-typegalaxies within the allowed range, their photometric properties and the impliedstrengths of several commonly used spectral indices are found to be consistentwith apparently passive evolution of the stellar populations. also, the implieddependence of the mass-to-light ratio on galaxy luminosity is consistent withthe observed trend. the results of our unbiased analysis define the boundariesin age and metallicity that must be satisfied by theoretical studies aimed atexplaining the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies in clusters.

0810.2172	eddington ratios of faint agn at intermediate redshift: evidence for a  population of half-starved black holes	we use one of the deepest spectroscopic samples of broad line active galacticnuclei (agn) currently available, extracted from the vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), to compute mgii and civ virial masses estimate of 120 super-massiveblack holes in the redshift range 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.9 and 2.6&lt;z&lt;4.3. we find that themass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low agnluminosities (log l_bol ~ 45). at these luminosities, there is a substantialfraction of black holes accreting far below their eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd&lt; 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for agn of higherluminosities. we speculate that these may be agn on the decaying branch oftheir light-curves, well past their peak activity. this would agree with recenttheoretical predictions of agn evolution.  in the electronic appendix of this paper we publish an update of the vvdstype-1 agn sample, including the first and most of the second epochobservations. this sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

0811.2053	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z~0.9	we derive the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies up to$z\sim0.9$, using data from the vimos vlt deep survey. automatic measurement ofemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the fullspectroscopic sample. this sample is divided into two sub-samples depending onthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;22.5$) and deep$i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;24$). these two samples span two different ranges of stellarmasses. emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxiesand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. for the star-forminggalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phaseoxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to giveconsistent results at low and high redshifts. the stellar masses have beenestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set ofstellar population synthesis models. we assume at first order that the shape ofthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. then we find astronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deepsample. we thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter athigher redshift. the observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation athigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.

0811.2085	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. ii. extending the mass-metallicity relation to the range  z=0.89-1.24	aims. we present a continuation of our study about the relation betweenstellar mass and gas-phase metallicity in the vimos vlt deep survey (vvds). inthis work we extend the determination of metallicities up to redshift = 1.24for a sample of 42 star-forming galaxies with a mean redshift value of 0.99.methods. for a selected sample of emission-line galaxies, we use bothdiagnostic diagrams and empirical calibrations based on [oii] emission linesalong with the empirical relation between the intensities of the [oiii] and[neiii] emission lines and the theoretical ratios between balmer recombinationemission lines to identify star-forming galaxies and to derive theirmetallicities. we derive stellar masses by fitting the whole spectral energydistribution with a set of stellar population synthesis models. results. thesenew methods allow us to extend the mass-metallicity relation to higherredshift. we show that the metallicity determinations are consistent with moreestablished strong-line methods. taken together this allows us to study theevolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z = 1.24 with good control ofsystematic uncertainties. we find an evolution with redshift of the averagemetallicity of galaxies very similar to those reported in the literature: for agiven stellar mass, galaxies at z = 1 have, on average, a metallicity = 0.3 dexlower than galaxies in the local universe. however we do not see anysignificant metallicity evolution between redshifts z = 0.7 (paper i) and z =1.0 (this paper). we find also the same flattening of the mass-metallicityrelation for the most massive galaxies as reported in paper i at lowerredshifts, but again no apparent evolution of the slope is seen between z = 0.7and z = 1.0.
