0902.2794	sn 2008ha: an extremely low luminosity and extremely low energy  supernova	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well asoptical spectra of the peculiar supernova (sn) 2008ha. sn 2008ha had a very lowpeak luminosity, reaching only m_v = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy perunit mass of ejecta. spectroscopically, sn 2008ha is a member of the sn2002cx-like class of sne, a peculiar subclass of sne ia; however, sn 2008ha isthe most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower linevelocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and hasline velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal snia. sn 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantlyshorter than either sn 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal sne ia (~19.5days). the bolometric light curve of sn 2008ha indicates that sn 2008ha peakedat l_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making sn 2008ha perhaps the leastluminous sn ever observed. from its peak luminosity and rise time, we inferthat sn 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 m_sun of 56ni, had a kineticenergy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 m_sun of material. we classifythree new (and one potential) members of the sn 2002cx-like class, expandingthe sample to 14 (and one potential) members. the host-galaxy morphologydistribution of the class is consistent with that of sne ia, ib, ic, and ii.several models for generating low-luminosity sne can explain the observationsof sn 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all sn 2002cx-likeobjects, either electron capture in ne-mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,or deflagration of c-o white dwarfs with sn 2008ha being a partial deflagrationand not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. abridged.

0905.0695	a redetermination of the hubble constant with the hubble space telescope  from a differential distance ladder	we report observations of 240 cepheid variables obtained with the nearinfrared camera (nicmos) through the f160w filter on the hubble space telescope(hst). the cepheids are distributed across six recent hosts of type iasupernovae (sne ia) and the "maser galaxy" ngc 4258, allowing us to directlycalibrate the peak luminosities of the sne ia from the precise, geometricdistance measurements provided by the masers. new features of our measurementinclude the use of the same instrument for all cepheid measurements across thedistance ladder and homogeneity of the cepheid periods and metallicities thusnecessitating only a differential measurement of cepheid fluxes and reducingthe largest systematic uncertainties in the determination of the fiducial sn ialuminosity. the nicmos measurements reduce differential extinction in the hostgalaxies by a factor of 5 over past optical data. combined with an expanded of240 sne ia at z&lt;0.1 which define their magnitude-redshift relation, we findh_0=74.2 +/-3.6, a 4.8% uncertainty including both statistical and systematicerrors. we show that the factor of 2.2 improvement in the precision of h_0 is asignificant aid to the determination of the equation-of-state of dark energy, w= p/(rho c^2). combined with the wmap 5-year measurement of omega_m h^2, wefind w= -1.12 +/- 0.12 independent of high-redshift sne ia or baryon acousticoscillations (bao). this result is also consistent with analyses based on thecombination of high-z sne ia and bao. the constraints on w(z) now with high-zsne ia and bao are consistent with a cosmological constant and improved by afactor of 3 from the refinement in h_0 alone. we show future improvements inh_0 are likely and will further contribute to multi-technique studies of darkenergy.

0907.1083	variable sodium absorption in a low-extinction type ia supernova	recent observations have revealed that some type ia supernovae exhibitnarrow, time-variable na i d absorption features. the origin of the absorbingmaterial is controversial, but it may suggest the presence of circumstellar gasin the progenitor system prior to the explosion, with significant implicationsfor the nature of the supernova progenitors. we present the third detection ofsuch variable absorption, based on six epochs of high-resolution spectroscopyof the type ia supernova sn 2007le from keck and the het. the data span ~3months, from 5 days before maximum light to 90 days after maximum. we find thatone component of the na d absorption lines strengthened significantly withtime, indicating a total column density increase of ~2.5 x 10^12 cm^-2. thechanges are most prominent after maximum light rather than at earlier timeswhen the uv flux from the sn peaks. as with sn 2006x, we detect no change inthe ca ii h&amp;k lines over the same time period, rendering line-of-sight effectsimprobable and suggesting a circumstellar origin for the absorbing material.unlike the previous two sne exhibiting variable absorption, sn 2007le is nothighly reddened (e_b-v = 0.27 mag), also pointing toward circumstellar ratherthan interstellar absorption. photoionization models show that the data areconsistent with a dense (10^7 cm^-3) cloud or clouds of gas located ~0.1 pcfrom the explosion. these results broadly support the single-degeneratescenario previously proposed to explain the variable absorption, with mass lossfrom a nondegenerate companion star responsible for providing the circumstellargas. we also present tentative evidence for narrow halpha emission associatedwith the sn, which will require followup observations at late times to confirm.[abridged]

[caii] emission is probably tied to adusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. sn2009ip andu2773-ot may provide a critical link between historical lbv eruptions, whileu2773-ot may provide a link between lbvs and sn2008s and n300-ot. futuresearches will uncover more examples of precursor lbv variability of this kind,providing key clues that may help unravel the instability driving lbvs.

0910.3317	the carnegie supernova project: analysis of the first sample of  low-redshift type-ia supernovae	we present the analysis of the first set of low-redshift type ia supernovae(sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project. well-sampled, high-precisionoptical (ugribv) and near-infrared (nir; yjhks) light curves obtained in awell-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters,and ugribvyjh template light curves. the intrinsic colors at maximum light arecalibrated to compute optical--nir color excesses for the full sample, thusallowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to bestudied. a low value of rv~1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of sne.however, when the two highly reddened sne in the sample are excluded, a valuegalactic standard of rv~3.2 is obtained. the colors of these two events arewell matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. the peakluminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the declinerates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. in both cases,dispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending onthe filter-color combination. in contrast to the results obtained from colorexcesses, these fits give rv~1--2, even when the two highly reddened sne areexcluded. this discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellarreddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion inthe colors of sne ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of thedecline rate. finally, a hubble diagram is produced by combining the results ofthe fits for each filter. the resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to belimited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation betweenthe distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. the implication isthat the actual precision of sn ia distances is 3--4%.

0912.2465	large late-time asphericities in three type iip supernovae	type ii-plateau supernovae (sne iip) are the results of the explosions of redsupergiants and are the most common subclass of core-collapse supernovae. pastobservations have shown that the outer layers of the ejecta of sne iip arelargely spherical, but the degree of asphericity increases toward the core. wepresent evidence for high degrees of asphericity in the inner cores of threerecent sne iip (sne 2006my, 2006ov, and 2007aa), as revealed by late-timeoptical spectropolarimetry. the three objects were all selected to have verylow interstellar polarization (isp), which minimizes the uncertainties in ispremoval and allows us to use the continuum polarization as a tracer ofasphericity. the three objects have intrinsic continuum polarizations in therange of 0.83-1.56% in observations taken after the end of the photometricplateau, with the polarization dropping to almost zero at the wavelengths ofstrong emission lines. our observations of sn 2007aa at earlier times, taken onthe photometric plateau, show contrastingly smaller continuum polarizations(~0.1%). the late-time h-alpha and [o i] line profiles of sn 2006ov providefurther evidence for asphericities in the inner ejecta. such high corepolarizations in very ordinary core-collapse supernovae provide furtherevidence that essentially all core-collapse supernova explosions are highlyaspherical, even if the outer parts of the ejecta show only small deviationsfrom spherical symmetry.

1007.4842	the absolute magnitudes of type ia supernovae in the ultraviolet	we examine the absolute magnitudes and light-curve shapes of 14nearby(redshift z = 0.004--0.027) type ia supernovae (sne~ia) observed in theultraviolet (uv) with the swift ultraviolet/optical telescope. colors andabsolute magnitudes are calculated using both a standard milky way (mw)extinction law and one for the large magellanic cloud that has been modified bycircumstellar scattering. we find very different behavior in the near-uvfilters (uvw1_rc covering ~2600-3300 a after removing optical light, and u~3000--4000 a) compared to a mid-uv filter (uvm2 ~2000-2400 a). the uvw1_rc-bcolors show a scatter of ~0.3 mag while uvm2-b scatters by nearly 0.9 mag.similarly, while the scatter in colors between neighboring filters is small inthe optical and somewhat larger in the near-uv, the large scatter in theuvm2-uvw1 colors implies significantly larger spectral variability below 2600a. we find that in the near-uv the absolute magnitudes at peak brightness ofnormal sne ia in our sample are correlated with the optical decay rate with ascatter of 0.4 mag, comparable to that found for the optical in our sample.however, in the mid-uv the scatter is larger, ~1 mag, possibly indicatingdifferences in metallicity. we find no strong correlation between either the uvlight-curve shapes or the uv colors and the uv absolute magnitudes. with largersamples, the uv luminosity might be useful as an additional constraint to helpdetermine distance, extinction, and metallicity in order to improve the utilityof sne ia as standardized candles.

1007.5279	near-ultraviolet properties of a large sample of type ia supernovae as  observed with the swift uvot	we present ultraviolet (uv) and optical photometry of 26 type ia supernovae(sne~ia) observed from march 2005 to march 2008 with the nasa {\it swift}ultraviolet and optical telescope (uvot). the dataset consists of 2133individual observations, making it by far the most complete study of the uvemission from sne~ia to date. grouping the sne into three subclasses as derivedfrom optical observations, we investigate the evolution of the colors of thesesne, finding a high degree of homogeneity within the normal subclass, butdramatic differences between that group and the subluminous and sn 2002cx-likegroups. for the normal events, the redder uv filters on uvot ($u$, $uvw1$) showmore homogeneity than do the bluer uv filters ($uvm2$, $uvw2$). searching forpurely uv characteristics to determine existing optically based groupings, wefind the peak width to be a poor discriminant, but we do see a variation in thetime delay between peak emission and the late, flat phase of the light curves.the uv light curves peak a few days before the $b$ band for most subclasses (aswas previously reported by jha et al. 2006a), although the sn 2002cx-likeobjects peak at a very early epoch in the uv. that group also features thebluest emission observed among sne~ia. as the observational campaign isongoing, we discuss the critical times to observe, as determined by this study,in order to maximize the scientific output of future observations.

1010.3718	luminous blue variable eruptions and related transients: diversity of  progenitors and outburst properties	we present new light curves and spectra for a number of extragalactic opticaltransients or "sn impostors" related to giant eruptions of lbvs, and we providea comparative discussion of lbv-like giant eruptions known to date. new datainclude photometry and spectroscopy of sne1999bw, 2000ch, 2001ac, 2002bu,2006bv, and 2010dn. sn2010dn resembles sn2008s and ngc 300-ot, whereas sn2002bushows spectral evolution from a normal lbv at early times to a twin of thesecooler transients at late times. sn2008s, ngc300-ot, and sn2010dn appear to bespecial cases of a broader eruptive phenomenon where the progenitor star wasenshrouded by dust. examining the full sample, sn impostors have range oftimescales from a day to decades, potentially suffering multiple eruptions. theupper end of the luminosity distribution overlaps with the least luminous sne.the low end of the luminosity distribution is poorly defined, and a distinctionbetween various eruptions is not entirely clear. we discuss observational cluesconcerning winds or shocks as the relevant mass-loss mechanism, and we evaluatepossible ideas for physical mechanisms. although examples of these eruptionsare sufficient to illustrate their diversity, their statistical distributionwill benefit greatly from upcoming transient surveys. based on the distributionof eruptions, we propose that sn1961v was not a member of this class ofimpostors, but was instead a true core-collapse sniin preceded by a giant lbveruption.

1011.4150	a massive progenitor of the luminous type iin supernova 2010jl	the bright, nearby, recently discovered supernova sn2010jl is a member of therare class of relatively luminous type~iin events. here we report archival hstobservations of its host galaxy ugc5189a taken roughly 10yr prior to explosion,as well as early-time optical spectra of the sn. the hst images reveal abright, blue point source at the position of the sn, with an absolute magnitudeof -12.0 in the f300w filter. if it is not just a chance alignment, the sourceat the sn position could be (1) a massive young (less than 6 myr) star clusterin which the sn resided, (2) a quiescent, luminous blue star with an apparenttemperature around 14,000k, (3) a star caught during a bright outburst akin tothose of lbvs, or (4) a combination of option 1 and options 2 or 3. although wecannot confidently choose between these possibilities with the present data,any of them imply that the progenitor of sn2010jl had an initial mass above30msun. this reinforces mounting evidence that many sne iin result from verymassive stars, that massive stars can produce visible sne without collapsingquietly to black holes, and that massive stars can retain their h envelopesuntil shortly before explosion. standard stellar evolution models fail toaccount for these observed properties.

1011.5873	supernova 2008bk and its red supergiant progenitor	we have obtained limited photometric and spectroscopic data for supernova(sn) 2008bk in ngc 7793, primarily at &gt;~ 150 d after explosion. we find that itis a type ii-plateau (ii-p) sn which most closely resembles the low-luminositysn 1999br in ngc 4900. given the overall similarity between the observed lightcurves and colors of sne 2008bk and 1999br, we infer that the total visualextinction to sn 2008bk (a_v=0.065 mag) must be almost entirely due to thegalactic foreground, similar to what has been assumed for sn 1999br. we confirmthe identification of the putative red supergiant (rsg) progenitor star of thesn in high-quality g'r'i' images we had obtained in 2007 at the gemini-south 8m telescope. little ambiguity exists in this progenitor identification,qualifying it as the best example to date, next to the identification of thestar sk -69 202 as the progenitor of sn 1987a. from a combination of photometryof the gemini images with that of archival, pre-sn, very large telescope jhk_simages, we derive an accurate observed spectral energy distribution (sed) forthe progenitor. we find from nebular strong-intensity emission-line indices forseveral hii regions near the sn that the metallicity in the environment islikely subsolar (z~0.6 z_sun). the observed sed of the star agrees quite wellwith synthetic seds obtained from model red supergiant atmospheres witheffective temperature t_eff=3600+/-50 k. we find, therefore, that the star hada bolometric luminosity with respect to the sun of log(l_bol/l_sun)=4.57+/-0.06and radius r_star=496+/-34 r_sun at ~6 months prior to explosion. comparing theprogenitor's properties with theoretical massive-star evolutionary models, weconclude that the rsg progenitor had an initial mass in the range of 8--8.5m_sun.

1101.1298	peculiar type ii supernovae from blue supergiants	the vast majority of type ii supernovae (sne) are produced by red supergiants(rsgs), but sn 1987a revealed that blue supergiants (bsgs) can produce membersof this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. this best studiedevent revolutionized our understanding of sne, and linking it to the bulk oftype ii events is essential. we present here optical photometry andspectroscopy gathered for sn 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard type ii snand yet is not a sn 1987a analog. the light curve of sn 2000cb is reminiscentof that of sn 1987a in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but onsubstantially different time scales. spectroscopically, sn 2000cb resembles anormal sn ii but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for sn1987a or normal sne ii, above 18000 km/s for h-alpha at early times. the redcolours, high velocities, late photometric peak, and our modeling of thisobject all point toward a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of asmall-radius star, most likely a bsg, producing 0.1 solar masses of ni-56.adding a similar object to the sample, sn 2005ci, we derive a rate of about 2%of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of bsg explosions.

1106.2897	the progenitor of supernova 2011dh/ptf11eon in messier 51	we have identified a luminous star at the position of supernova (sn)2011dh/ptf11eon, in pre-sn archival, multi-band images of the nearby, nearlyface-on galaxy messier 51 (m51) obtained by the hubble space telescope with theadvanced camera for surveys. this identification has been confirmed, to thehighest available astrometric precision, using a keck-ii adaptive-optics image.the available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the sn is astripped-envelope, core-collapse type iib, with a more compact progenitor(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied sn iib 1993j. we inferthat the extinction to sn 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low galacticforeground contribution, and that the sn environment is of roughly solarmetallicity. the detected object has absolute magnitude m_v^0 ~ -7.7 andeffective temperature ~6000 k. the star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extendedthan what has been inferred for the sn progenitor. we speculate that thedetected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actualprogenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transferbinary system. the position of the detected star in a hertzsprung-russelldiagram is consistent with an initial mass of 17--19 msun. the light of thisstar could easily conceal, even in the ultraviolet, the presence of a stripped,compact, very hot (~1e5 k), nitrogen-rich wolf-rayet star progenitor.

1106.3551	ptf11eon/sn2011dh: discovery of a type iib supernova from a compact  progenitor in the nearby galaxy m51	on may 31, 2011 ut a supernova (sn) exploded in the nearby galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). we discovered this event using small telescopes equippedwith ccd cameras, as well as by the palomar transient factory (ptf) survey, andrapidly confirmed it to be a type ii supernova. our early light curve andspectroscopy indicates that ptf11eon resulted from the explosion of arelatively compact progenitor star as evidenced by the rapid shock-breakoutcooling seen in the light curve, the relatively low temperature in early-timespectra and the prompt appearance of low-ionization spectral features. thespectra of ptf11eon are dominated by h lines out to day 10 after explosion, butinitial signs of he appear to be present. assuming that he lines continue todevelop in the near future, this sn is likely a member of the ciib (compactiib; chevalier and soderberg 2010) class, with progenitor radius larger thanthat of sn 2008ax and smaller than the eiib (extended iib) sn 1993j progenitor.our data imply that the object identified in pre-explosion hubble spacetelescope images at the sn location is possibly a companion to the progenitoror a blended source, and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius (~10^13cm) would be highly inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosionphotometric and spectroscopic data.

1107.2404	the rise-time distribution of nearby type ia supernovae	we present an analysis of the b-band and v-band rise-time distributions ofnearby type ia supernovae (sne ia). we use a two-stretch template-fittingmethod to measure the rise and decline of bv light curves. our analysis of 61sne with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time betweenexplosion and maximum light (i.e., the rise time), the slower the decline ofthe light curve after maximum. however, sne with slower post-maximum declinerates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter familyof light curves, indicating that sn ia light curves are not a single-parameterfamily of varying widths. comparison of the b-band rise-time distribution forspectroscopically normal sne ia to those exhibiting high-velocity spectralfeatures indicates that high-velocity (hv) sne ia have shorter b-band risetimes compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. afternormalising the b-band light curves to dm15(b)= 1.1 mag (i.e., correcting thepost-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find thatspectroscopically normal sne ia have a rise time of 18.03 +/- 0.24 d, while hvsne have a faster b-band rise time of 16.63 +/- 0.29 d. despite differences inthe b band, we find that hv and normal sne ia have similar rise times in the vband. the initial rise of a sn ia b-band light curve follows a power law withindex 2.20 +0.27 -0.19, consistent with a parabolic rise in flux predicted byan expanding fireball toy model. we compare our early-time b-band data tomodels for the predicted signature of companion interaction arising from thesingle-degenerate progenitor scenario. there is a substantial degree ofdegeneracy between the adopted power-law index of the sn light-curve template,the rise time, and the amount of shock emission required to match the data.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1202.2130	berkeley supernova ia program iii: spectra near maximum brightness  improve the accuracy of derived distances to type ia supernovae	in this third paper in a series we compare spectral feature measurements tophotometric properties of 108 low-redshift (z &lt; 0.1) type ia supernovae (sneia) with optical spectra within 5 d of maximum brightness. we find thepseudo-equivalent width (pew) of the si ii 4000 line to be a good indicator oflight-curve width, and the pews of the mg ii and fe ii complexes are relativelygood proxies for sn colour. we also employ a combination of light-curveparameters (specifically the salt2 stretch and colour parameters x_1 and c,respectively) and spectral measurements to calculate distance moduli. theresiduals from these models are then compared to the standard model which usesonly light-curve stretch and colour. our investigations show that a distancemodel that uses x_1, c, and the velocity of the si ii 6355 feature does notlead to a decrease in the hubble residuals. we also find that distance modelswith flux ratios alone or in conjunction with light-curve information rarelyperform better than the standard (x_1,c) model. however, when adopting adistance model which combines the ratio of fluxes near ~3750 ang. and ~4550ang. with both x_1 and c, the hubble residuals are decreased by ~10 per cent,which is found to be significant at about the 2-sigma level. the weightedroot-mean-square of the residuals using this model is 0.130 +/- 0.017 mag (ascompared with 0.144 +/- 0.019 mag when using the same sample with the standardmodel). this hubble diagram fit has one of the smallest scatters ever publishedand at the highest significance ever seen in such a study. finally, theseresults are discussed with regard to how they can improve the cosmologicalaccuracy of future, large-scale sn ia surveys.

1202.3140	the low-velocity, rapidly fading type ia supernova 2002es	sn 2002es is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn ia) with acombination of observed characteristics never before seen in a sn ia. atmaximum light, sn 2002es shares spectroscopic properties with the underluminoussn 1991bg subclass of sne ia, but with substantially lower expansion velocities(~6000 km/s) more typical of the sn 2002cx subclass. photometrically, sn 2002esdiffers from both sn 1991bg-like and sn 2002cx-like supernovae. although atmaximum light it is subluminous (m_b=-17.78 mag), sn 2002es has a relativelybroad light curve (dm15(b)=1.28 +/- 0.04 mag), making it a significant outlierin the light-curve width vs. luminosity relationship. we estimate a 56ni massof 0.17 +/- 0.05 m_sun synthesized in the explosion, relatively low for a snia. one month after maximum light, we find an unexpected plummet in thebolometric luminosity. the late-time decay of the light curves is inconsistentwith our estimated 56ni mass, indicating that either the light curve was notcompletely powered by 56ni decay or the ejecta became optically thin togamma-rays within a month after maximum light. the host galaxy is classified asan s0 galaxy with little to no star formation, indicating the progenitor of sn2002es is likely from an old stellar population. we also present a lessextensive dataset for sn 1999bh, an object which shares similar observedproperties. both objects were found as part of the lick observatory supernovasearch, allowing us to estimate that these objects should account for ~2.5% ofsne ia within a fixed volume. we find that current theoretical models areunable to explain the observed of characteristics of sn 2002es.

1202.5301	the first maximum-light ultraviolet through near-infrared spectrum of a  type ia supernova	we present the first maximum-light ultraviolet (uv) through near-infrared(nir) type ia supernova (sn ia) spectrum. this spectrum of sn 2011iv wasobtained nearly simultaneously by the hubble space telescope at uv/opticalwavelengths and the magellan baade telescope at nir wavelengths. these dataprovide the opportunity to examine the entire maximum-light sn iaspectral-energy distribution. since the uv region of a sn ia spectrum isextremely sensitive to the composition of the outer layers of the explosion,which are transparent at longer wavelengths, this unprecedented spectrum canprovide strong constraints on the composition of the sn ejecta, and similarlythe sn explosion and progenitor system. sn 2011iv is spectroscopically normal,but has a relatively fast decline (delta m_15 (b) = 1.69 +/- 0.05 mag). wecompare sn 2011iv to other sne ia with uv spectra near maximum light andexamine trends between uv spectral properties, light-curve shape, and ejectavelocity. we tentatively find that sne with similar light-curve shapes butdifferent ejecta velocities have similar uv spectra, while those with similarejecta velocities but different light-curve shapes have very different uvspectra. through a comparison with explosion models, we find that both asolar-metallicity w7 and a zero-metallicity delayed-detonation model provide areasonable fit to the spectrum of sn 2011iv from the uv to the nir.

1205.3789	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: dynamical modeling of the broad  line region in mrk 50	we present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (blr) in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the lick agnmonitoring project (lamp) 2011. we model the reverberation mapping datadirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the blr, as well asderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizingfactor or virial coefficient. we find that the geometry of the blr in mrk 50 isa nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, awidth of the blr of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of25\pm10 degrees above the plane. we also constrain the inclination angle to be9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. finally, the black hole mass of mrk 50 isinferred to be log10(m(bh)/msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). by comparison to thevirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mappinganalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74based on aligning the m(bh)-{\sigma}* relation for agn and quiescent galaxies.while our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflowin the blr, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.

0711.2570	the detection of a light echo from the type ia supernova 2006x in m100	we report the discovery of a light echo (le) from the type ia supernova (sn)2006x in the nearby galaxy m100. the presence of the le is supported byanalysis of both the advanced camera for surveys (acs) images taken with the{\it hubble space telescope (hst)} at $\sim$300 d after maximum brightness andthe keck optical spectrum obtained at a similar phase. in the image procedure,both the radial-profile analysis and the point-spread-function (psf)subtraction method resolve significant excess emission at 2--5 acs pixels($\sim0.05''-0.13''$) from the center. in particular, the psf-subtracted acsimages distinctly appear to have an extended, ring-like echo. due tolimitations of the image resolution, we cannot confirm any structure or fluxwithin 2 acs pixels from the sn. the late-time spectrum of sn 2006x can bereasonably fit with two components: a nebular spectrum of a normal sn ia and asynthetic le spectrum. both image and spectral analysis show a rather bluecolor for the emission of the le, suggestive of a small average grain size forthe scattering dust. using the cepheid distance to m100 of 15.2 mpc, we findthat the dust illuminated by the resolved le is $\sim$27--170 pc from the sn.the echo inferred from the nebular spectrum appears to be more luminous thanthat resolved in the images (at the $\sim2\sigma$ level), perhaps suggestingthe presence of an inner echo at $&lt;$2 acs pixels ($\sim0.05''$). it is notclear, however, whether this possible local echo was produced by a distinctdust component (i.e., the local circumstellar dust) or by a continuous, largerdistribution of dust as with the outer component. nevertheless, our detectionof a significant echo in sn 2006x confirms that this supernova was produced ina dusty environment having unusual dust properties.

1208.5900	discovery and early multi-wavelength measurements of the energetic type  ic supernova ptf12gzk: a massive-star explosion in a dwarf host galaxy	we present the discovery and extensive early-time observations of the type icsupernova (sn) ptf12gzk. our finely sampled light curves show a rise of 0.8magwithin 2.5hr. power-law fits [f(t)\sim(t-t_0)^n] to these data constrain theexplosion date to within one day. we cannot rule out the expected quadraticfireball model, but higher values of n are possible as well for larger areas inthe fit parameter space. our bolometric light curve and a dense spectralsequence are used to estimate the physical parameters of the exploding star andof the explosion. we show that the photometric evolution of ptf12gzk is slowerthan that of most sne ic, and its high ejecta velocities (~30,000km/s four daysafter explosion) are closer to the observed velocities of broad-lined sne icassociated with gamma-ray bursts (grbs) than to the observed velocities innormal type ic sne. the high velocities are sustained through the sn earlyevolution, and are similar to those of grb-sne when the sn reach peakmagnitude. by comparison with the spectroscopically similar sn 2004aw, wesuggest that the observed properties of ptf12gzk indicate an initial progenitormass of 25-35 solar mass and a large (5-10e51 erg) kinetic energy, close to theregime of grb-sn properties. the host-galaxy characteristics are consistentwith grb-sn hosts, and not with normal sn ic hosts as well, yet this sn doesnot show the broad lines over extended periods of time that are typical ofbroad-line type ic sne.

1303.1742	the low-luminosity end of the radius-luminosity relationship for active  galactic nuclei	we present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between thehbeta broad-line region (blr) radius and the luminosity of the active galacticnucleus (agn). specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surfacebrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new agns imaged with thehubble space telescope wide field camera 3. the surface brightnessdecompositions allow us to create "agn-free" images of the galaxies, from whichwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measuredthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. we also incorporate 20 newreverberation-mapping measurements of the hbeta time lag, which is assumed toyield the average hbeta blr radius. the final sample includes 41 agns coveringfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. the additions and updates incorporatedhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the r-l relationship. the bestfit to the relationship using a bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simplephotoionization arguments. only two agns appear to be outliers from therelationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubtregarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. the scatter around therelationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. a large fraction of theremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distancesto the agn host galaxies. our results help support the possibility that the r-lrelationship could potentially be used to turn the blrs of agns intostandardizable candles. this would allow the cosmological expansion of theuniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a largerrange of redshifts.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1304.4643	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: fe ii reverberation from the outer  broad-line region	the prominent broad fe ii emission blends in the spectra of active galacticnuclei have been shown to vary in response to continuum variations, but pastattempts to measure the reverberation lag time of the optical fe ii lines havemet with only limited success. here we report the detection of fe iireverberation in two seyfert 1 galaxies, ngc 4593 and mrk 1511, based on datafrom a program carried out at lick observatory in spring 2011. light curves foremission lines including h-beta and fe ii were measured by applying a fittingroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-linecomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine thereverberation lags of the emission lines relative to v-band light curves. inboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of fe ii is longer than that of h-beta,although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of fe iitemplate used in the fit. for spectral decompositions done using the fe iitemplate of veron-cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1307.0824	constraints on dark energy with the loss sn ia sample	we present a cosmological analysis of the lick observatory supernova search(loss) type ia supernova (sn ia) photometry sample introduced by ganeshalingamet al. (2010). these sne provide an effective anchor point to estimatecosmological parameters when combined with datasets at higher redshift. thedata presented by ganeshalingam et al. (2010) have been rereduced in thenatural system of the kait and nickel telescopes to minimise systematicuncertainties. we have run the light-curve-fitting software salt2 on ournatural-system light curves to measure light-curve parameters for loss lightcurves and available sn ia datasets in the literature. we present a hubblediagram of 586 sne in the redshift range z=0.01-1.4 with a residual scatter of0.176 mag. of the 226 low-z objects in our sample, 91 objects are from loss,including 45 sne without previously published distances. assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the best fit for the dark energy equation-of-stateparameter w = -0.86^+0.13_-0.16 (stat) +- 0.11 (sys) from sne alone, consistentwith a cosmological constant. our data prefer a universe with an acceleratingrate of expansion with 99.999% confidence. when looking at hubble residuals asa function of host-galaxy morphology, we do not see evidence for a significanttrend, although we find a somewhat reduced scatter in hubble residuals from sneresiding within a projected distance &lt; 10 kpc of the host-galaxy nucleus(\sigma = 0.156 mag). we find that hubble residuals do not correlate with theexpansion velocity of si ii \lambda 6355 measured in optical spectra nearmaximum light. our data are consistent with no presence of a local "hubblebubble." improvements in cosmological analyses within low-z samples can beachieved by better constraining calibration uncertainties in the zero points ofphotometric systems.

0802.1743	late-time observations of sn2006gy: still going strong	owing to its extremely high luminosity and long duration, sn2006gy radiatedmore energy in visual light than any other known sn. two hypotheses to explainits high luminosity -- that it was powered by shock interaction with csm asimplied by its type iin spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decayfrom a large mass of 56ni synthesized in a pair-instability sn -- predicteddifferent late-time properties. here we present observations of sn2006gyobtained more than a year after discovery. we were unable to detect it atvisual wavelengths, but clear near-ir k and h-band detections show that it isstill at least as luminous as the peak of a normal sn ii. we also presentspectra giving an upper limit to the late-time ha luminosity of about 1e39erg/s. based on the weak late-time ha, x-ray, and radio emission, combined withthe difficulty of explaining the shift to ir wavelengths, we can rule outongoing csm interaction as the primary late-time power source. instead, wepropose that the evolution of sn2006gy is consistent with one of two possiblescenarios: (1) a pair-instability sn plus modest csm interaction, where theradioactive decay luminosity shifts to the ir because of dust formation. (2) anir echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existingdust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to haveejected another 10 msun shell about 1500 yr before the sn.

1404.5967	temporal correlations between optical and gamma-ray activity in blazars	we have been using the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope (kait) atlick observatory to optically monitor a sample of 157 blazars that are brightin gamma rays, being detected with high significance ($\ge 10\sigma$) in oneyear by the large area telescope (lat) on the {\it fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope}. we attempt to observe each source on a 3-day cadence with kait,subject to weather and seasonal visibility. the gamma-ray coverage isessentially continuous. kait observations extend over much of the 5-year {\itfermi} mission for several objects, and most have $&gt;100$ optical measurementsspanning the last three years. these blazars (flat-spectrum radio quasars andbl~lac objects) exhibit a wide range of flaring behavior. using the discretecorrelation function (dcf), here we search for temporal relationships betweenoptical and gamma-ray light curves in the 40 brightest sources in hopes ofplacing constraints on blazar acceleration and emission zones. we find strongoptical--gamma-ray correlation in many of these sources at time delays of $\sim1$ to $\sim 10$ days, ranging between $-40$ and +30 days. a stacked average dcfof the 40 sources verifies this correlation trend, with a peak above 99%significance indicating a characteristic time delay consistent with 0 days.these findings strongly support the widely accepted leptonic models of blazaremission. however, we also find examples of apparently uncorrelated flares(optical flares with no gamma-ray counterpart and gamma-ray flares with nooptical counterpart) that challenge simple, one-zone models of blazar emission.moreover, we find that flat-spectrum radio quasars tend to have gamma raysleading the optical, while intermediate and high synchrotron peak blazars withthe most significant peaks have smaller lags/leads.

1405.4863	uncovering the putative b-star binary companion of the sn 1993j  progenitor	the type iib supernova (sn) 1993j is one of only a few stripped-envelopesupernovae with a progenitor star identified in pre-explosion images. sn iibmodels typically invoke h envelope stripping by mass transfer in a binarysystem. for the case of sn 1993j, the models suggest that the companion grew to22 m_solar and became a source of ultraviolet (uv) excess. located in m81, at adistance of only 3.6 mpc, sn 1993j offers one of the best opportunities todetect the putative companion and test the progenitor model. previouslypublished near-uv spectra in 2004 showed evidence for absorption linesconsistent with a hot (b2 ia) star, but the field was crowded and dominated byflux from the sn. here we present hubble space telescope (hst) cosmic originsspectrograph (cos) and wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) observations of sn 1993j from2012, at which point the flux from the sn had faded sufficiently to potentiallymeasure the uv continuum properties from the putative companion. the resultinguv spectrum is consistent with contributions from both a hot b star and the sn,although we cannot rule out line-of-sight coincidences.

0808.0138	subaru and keck observations of the peculiar type ia supernova 2006gz at  late phases	recently, a few peculiar type ia supernovae (sne) that show exceptionallylarge peak luminosity have been discovered. their luminosity requires more than1 msun of 56ni ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might haveoriginated from super-chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. however, the nature ofthese objects is not yet well understood. in particular, no data have beentaken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. we report on subaruand keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the sn ia2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these "overluminous" sne ia.the late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal sne ia,reinforcing the argument that sn 2006gz belongs to a different subclass thannormal sne ia. however, the peculiar features found at late times are notreadily connected to a large amount of 56ni; the sn is faint, and it lacks [feii] and [fe iii] emission. if the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the snejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal sne ia, the mass of 56ni doesnot exceed ~ 0.3 msun. we discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem.with the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identifywhich process is responsible. an interesting possibility is that the bulk ofthe emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in othersne ia, which might be related to dense c-rich regions as indicated by theearly-phase data. alternatively, it might be the case that sn 2006gz, thoughpeculiar, was actually not substantially overluminous at early times.

astro-ph;0001270	helium emission in the type ic sn 1999cq	we present the first unambiguous detection of helium emission lines inspectra of type ic supernovae (sne ic). the presence of he i lines, with fullwidth at half maximum ~ 2000 km/s, and the distinct absence of any otherintermediate-width emission (e.g., halpha), implies that the ejecta of sn ic1999cq are interacting with dense circumstellar material composed of almostpure helium. this strengthens the argument that the progenitors of sne ic arecore-collapse events in stars that have lost both their hydrogen and heliumenvelopes, either through a dense wind or mass-transfer to a companion. in thisway, sn 1999cq is similar to supernovae such as sn 1987k and sn 1993j thathelped firmly establish a physical connection between type ib and type iisupernovae. the light curve of sn 1999cq is very fast, with an extremely rapidrise followed by a quick decline. sn 1999cq is also found to exhibit a highlevel of emission at blue wavelengths (&lt; 5500 a), likely resulting from eitheran unusually large amount of iron and iron-group element emission oruncharacteristically low reddening compared with other sne ic.

astro-ph;0006291	monte carlo simulations of type ia supernova observations in supernova  surveys	we have performed monte carlo simulations of type ia supernova (sn ia)surveys to quantify their efficiency in discovering peculiar overluminous andunderluminous sne ia. we determined how the type of survey (magnitude-limited,distance-limited, or a hybrid) and its characteristics (observations frequencyand detection limit) affect the discovery of peculiar sne ia. we find thatthere are strong biases against the discovery of peculiar sne ia introduced byat least four observational effects: the malmquist bias, the age of the sn iaat the time of its discovery, the shape of its light curve, and its degree ofextinction. surveys with low observation frequency (less than once per 10 days)tend to discover sne ia which are too old for observers to easily recognizetheir peculi arity. subluminous sne ia are underrepresented inmagnitude-limited surveys because they can only be found within a small volumeand they remain above the detection limit for less time. conversely,overluminous sne ia are more easily found in magnitude-limited surveys althoughtheir likely association with dusty regions reduces the volume in which theycan be discovered. the unbiased rate of peculiar sne ia can be recovered onlyin distance-limited surveys with high observation frequencies and withdetection limits which are fainter than the peak magnitude of a subluminous snia in the farthest potential host.

astro-ph;0006292	a high intrinsic peculiarity rate among type ia supernovae	we have compiled a sample of 45 type ia supernovae (sne ia) discovered by thelick observatory supernova search (loss) and the beijing astronomicalobservatory supernova survey (baoss), and determined the rate ofspectroscopically peculiar sne ia (i.e., sn 1986g-like, sn 1991bg-like, and sn1991t-like objects) and the luminosity function of sne ia. because of thenature of the two surveys (distance-limited with small baselines and deeplimiting magnitudes), nearly all sne ia have been discovered in the samplegalaxies of loss and baoss; thus, the observed peculiarity rate and luminosityfunction of sne ia are intrinsic. we find that 36$\pm$9% of nearby sne ia arepeculiar; specifically, the luminosity function of sne ia consists of 20% sn1991t-like, 64% normal, and 16% sn 1991bg-like objects. we have compared ourresults to those found by earlier studies, and to those found at high redshift.the apparent dearth of sn 1991t-like objects at high redshift may be due toextinction, and especially to the difficulty of recognizing them from spectraobtained past maximum brightness or from spectra with low signal-to-noiseratios. implications of the high peculiarity rate for the progenitor systems ofsne ia are also briefly discussed.

astro-ph;0109535	the distance to sn 1999em in ngc 1637 from the expanding photosphere  method	we present 30 optical spectra and 49 photometric epochs sampling the first517 days after discovery of supernova (sn) 1999em, and derive its distancethrough the expanding photosphere method (epm). sn 1999em is shown to be a typeii-plateau (ii-p) event, with a photometric plateau lasting until about 100days after explosion. we identify the dominant ions responsible for most of theabsorption features seen in the optical portion of the spectrum during theplateau phase. we find the distance to sn 1999em to be d = 8.2 +/- 0.6 mpc,with an explosion date of 5.3 +/- 1.4 days before discovery.  we examine potential sources of systematic error in epm-derived distances,and find the most significant to result from uncertainty in the theoreticalmodeling of the flux distribution emitted by the sn photosphere (i.e., the``flux dilution factor''). we compare previously derived epm distances to 5 sneii in galaxies for which a recently revised cepheid distance exists from thehst key project and find d(cepheids) / d(epm) = 0.96 +/- 0.09. finally, weinvestigate the possible use of sne ii-p as standard candles and find that for8 photometrically confirmed sne ii-p with previously derived epm distances andsn 1999em, the mean plateau absolute brightness is m_v(plateau) = -16.4 +/- 0.6mag, implying that distances good to ~30% (1-sigma) may be possible without theneed for a complete epm analysis. at m_v(plateau) = -15.9 +/- 0.2 mag, sn1999em is somewhat fainter than the average sn ii-p. the general consistency ofabsolute sne ii-p brightness during the plateau suggests that the standardcandle assumption may allow sne ii-p to be viable cosmological beacons at z &gt;2.

astro-ph;0203508	possible recovery of sn 1961v in hubble space telescope archival images	sn 1961v in ngc 1058 was originally classified by fritz zwicky as a ``typev'' supernova. however, it has been argued that sn 1961v was not a genuinesupernova, but instead the superoutburst of an eta carinae-like luminous bluevariable star. in particular, filippenko et al. (1995, aj, 110, 2261) usedpre-refurbishment hst wfpc images and the known radio position of sn 1961v toconclude that the star survived the eruption and is likely coincident with a v\~ 25.6 mag, v-i ~ 1.9 mag object. recently, stockdale et al. (2001, aj, 122,283) recovered the fading sn 1961v at radio wavelengths and argue that itsbehavior is similar that of some type ii supernovae. we have analyzedpost-refurbishment archival hst wfpc2 data and find that the new radio positionis still consistent with the filippenko et al. object, which has not changed inbrightness or color, but is also consistent with an adjacent, fainter (i ~ 24.3mag) and very red (v-i &gt; 1.0 mag) object. we suggest that this fainter objectcould be the survivor of sn 1961v. forthcoming hst observations may settle thisissue.

(2001, 2002) in light ofthese results. following the same procedures, but using the new data presentedhere, we arrive at a less restrictive upper mass limit of 15^{+5}_{-3} m_{sun}for the progenitor. the increased upper limit results mainly from the largerdistance derived through the epm than was assumed by the smartt et al.analyses, which relied on less precise (and less recent) distance measurementsto ngc 3184.

astro-ph;0208101	evidence for extremely high dust polarization efficiency in ngc 3184	recent studies have found the type ii-plateau supernova (sn) 1999gi to behighly polarized (p_max = 5.8%, where p_max is the highest degree ofpolarization measured in the optical bandpass; leonard &amp; filippenko 2001) andminimally reddened (e[b-v] = 0.21 +/- 0.09 mag; leonard et al. 2002). frommultiple lines of evidence, including the convincing fit of a ``serkowski''interstellar polarization (isp) curve to the continuum polarization shape, weconclude that the bulk of the observed polarization is likely due to dust alongthe line of sight (l-o-s), and is not intrinsic to sn 1999gi. we present newspectropolarimetric observations of four distant galactic stars close to thel-o-s to sn 1999gi (two are within 0.02 degrees), and find that all are null towithin 0.2%, effectively eliminating galactic dust as the cause of the highpolarization. the high isp coupled with the low reddening implies anextraordinarily high polarization efficiency for the dust along this l-o-s inngc 3184: isp / e(b-v) = 31^{+22}_{-9} % mag^{-1}. this is inconsistent withthe empirical galactic limit (isp / e[b-v] &lt; 9% mag^{-1}), and represents thehighest polarization efficiency yet confirmed for a single sight line in eitherthe milky way or an external galaxy.

astro-ph;0409338	the late-time light curve of the type ia supernova 2000cx	we have conducted a systematic and comprehensive monitoring programme of thetype ia supernova 2000cx at late phases using the vlt and hst. the vltobservations cover phases 360 to 480 days past maximum brightness and includephotometry in the bvrijh bands, together with a single epoch in each of u andks. while the optical bands decay by about 1.4 mag per 100 days, we find thatthe near-ir magnitudes stay virtually constant during the observed period. thismeans that the importance of the near-ir to the bolometric light curveincreases with time. the finding is also in agreement with our detailedmodeling of a type ia supernova in the nebular phase. in these models, theincreased importance of the near-ir is a temperature effect. we note that thiscomplicates late-time studies where often only the v band is well monitored. inparticular, it is not correct to assume that any optical band follows thebolometric light curve at these phases, and any conclusions based on suchassumptions, e.g., regarding positron-escape, must be regarded as premature. avery simple model where all positrons are trapped can reasonably well accountfor the observations. the nickel mass deduced from the positron tail of thislight curve is lower than found from the peak brightness, providing an estimateof the fraction of late-time emission that is outside of the observedwavelength range. our detailed models show the signature of an infraredcatastrophe at these epochs, which is not supported by the observations.

astro-ph;0603297	a non-spherical core in the explosion of supernova sn 2004dj	an important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving the explosionof massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence forasymmetry in the explosion. indirect evidence comes from high pulsarvelocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, andasymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. spectropolarimetry provides adirect probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generallyindicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. large polarizationshave been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type ic) supernovae, whichconfirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive starswith intact hydrogen envelopes (type ii-p supernovae) have shown only weakpolarizations at the early times observed. here we report multi-epochspectropolarimetry of a classic type ii-p supernova that reveals the abruptappearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed inthe thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). we infer a departure fromspherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. combined withearlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be ageneric feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericityin type ii-p supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,hydrogen envelope.

astro-ph;0606494	multiwavelength monitoring of the dwarf seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4395. iii.  optical variability and x-ray/uv/optical correlations	we present optical observations of the low-luminosity seyfert 1 nucleus ofngc 4395, as part of a multiwavelength reverberation-mapping program.observations were carried out over two nights in 2004 april at lick, wise, andkitt peak observatories. we obtained v-band and b-band photometry, and spectraover the range 3500-6800 angstroms. simultaneous hubble space telescope uv andchandra x-ray observations are presented in companion papers. even though ngc4395 was in an extremely low state of activity, we detect significant continuumvariability of 2-10%, increasing toward shorter wavelengths. the continuumlight curves, both spectroscopic and photometric, are qualitatively similar tothe simultaneous uv and x-ray light curves. inter-band cross-correlationssuggest that the optical continuum emission lags behind the uv continuumemission by 24 +7/-9 min, and that the optical continuum emission lags behindthe x-ray continuum emission by 44 +/- 13 min, consistent with a reprocessingmodel for active galactic nucleus emission. there are also hints of balmeremission lines lagging behind the optical continuum by an amount slightlylarger than the emission-line lag detected in the uv. these results are allsimilar to those of other seyfert 1 nuclei. the emission-line lag yields a massmeasurement of the central black hole, which although not very significant, isconsistent with the value derived from the simultaneous uv data.

astro-ph;0611572	new hubble space telescope discoveries of type ia supernovae at z &gt; 1:  narrowing constraints on the early behavior of dark energy	we have discovered 21 new type ia supernovae (sne ia) with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) and have used them to trace the history of cosmic expansionover the last 10 billion years. these objects, which include 13spectroscopically confirmed sne ia at z &gt; 1, were discovered during 14 epochsof reimaging of the goods fields north and south over two years with theadvanced camera for surveys on hst. together with a recalibration of ourprevious hst-discovered sne ia, the full sample of 23 sne ia at z &gt; 1 providesthe highest-redshift sample known. combined with previous sn ia datasets, wemeasured h(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty ofh(z&gt;1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk--thetransition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. theunique leverage of the hst high-redshift sne ia provides the first meaningfulconstraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z &gt;1.  the result remains consistent with a cosmological constant (w(z)=-1), andrules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz &gt;&gt;1). the defining property ofdark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at z&gt;1, in the epochpreceding acceleration, with ~98% confidence in our primary fit. moreover, thez&gt;1 sample-averaged spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of thetypical sn ia over the last 10 gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution ofthe properties of sne ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.

astro-ph;0612617	sn 2006gy: discovery of the most luminous supernova ever recorded,  powered by the death of an extremely massive star like eta carinae	(abridged) we report our discovery and observations of the peculiar type iinsupernova sn2006gy in ngc1260, revealing that it reached a peak magnitude of-22, making it the most luminous supernova ever recorded. it is not yet clearwhat powers the total radiated energy of 1e51 erg, but we argue that anymechanism -- thermal emission, circumstellar interaction, or 56ni decay --requires a very massive progenitor star. the circumstellar interactionhypothesis would require truly exceptional conditions around the star probablyexperienced an lbv eruption like the 19th century eruption of eta carinae.alternatively, radioactive decay of 56ni may be a less objectionablehypothesis. that power source would imply a large ni mass of 22 msun, requiringthat sn2006gy was a pair-instability supernova where the star's core wasobliterated. sn2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason tosuspect a pair-instability explosion. based on a number of lines of evidence,we rule out the hypothesis that sn 2006gy was a ``type iia'' event. instead, wepropose that the progenitor may have been a very massive evolved object likeeta carinae that, contrary to expectations, failed to completely shed itsmassive hydrogen envelope before it died. our interpretation of sn2006gyimplies that the most massive stars can explode earlier than expected, duringthe lbv phase, preventing them from ever becoming wolf-rayet stars. sn2006gyalso suggests that the most massive stars can create brilliant supernovaeinstead of dying ignominious deaths through direct collapse to a black hole.

astro-ph;0612711	sn 2006jc: a wolf-rayet star exploding in a dense he-rich circumstellar  medium	we present optical photometry and spectra of the peculiar type ib supernova(sn) 2006jc. strong and relatively narrow he i emission lines indicate theprogenitor star exploded inside a dense circumstellar medium (csm) rich in he.an exceptionally blue apparent continuum persists from our first spectrumobtained 15 days after discovery through our last spectrum ~1 month later.based on the presence of isolated fe ii emission lines, we interpret the blue"continuum" as blended, perhaps fluorescent, fe emission. one or two of thereddest he i line profiles in our spectra are double peaked, suggesting thatthe csm has an aspherical geometry. the he i lines that are superposed on theblue continuum show p-cygni profiles, while the redder he i lines do not,implying that the blue continuum also originates from an asymmetric massdistribution. the he-rich csm, aspherical geometry, and line velocitiesindicate that the progenitor star was a wne wolf-rayet (wr) star. a recent (2years before the sn), coincident, luminous outburst similar to those seen inluminous blue variables (lbvs) is the leading candidate for the dense csm. suchan eruption associated with a wr star has not been seen before, indicating thatthe progenitor star may have recently transitioned from the lbv phase. we alsopresent unpublished spectral and photometric data on sn 2002ao which, alongwith sn 1999cq, is very similar to sn 2006jc. we propose that these threeobjects may represent a new and distinct class of sne arising from wrprogenitors surrounded by a dense csm.

astro-ph;0701049	on the progenitors of two type ii-p supernovae in the virgo cluster	direct identification of the progenitors of supernovae (sne) is rare becauseof the required spatial resolution and depth of the archival data prior to thesn explosions. here we report on the identification of the progenitors of twonearby sne in the virgo cluster: sn 2006my in ngc 4651 and sn 2006ov in m61. weobtained high-quality ground-based images of sn 2006my with thecanada-france-hawaii telescope, and are able to locate the site of the sn onpre-sn {\it hubble space telescope} ({\it hst}) wide field planetary camera 2images to a high precision (1$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\pm0\farcs$05). wepinpoint the site of sn 2006ov to within 0$\farcs$02 from {\it hst} advancedcamera for surveys images of the sn. we detected a red supergiant progenitorfor each sn within the error circles, with an inferred zero-age main-sequencemass ($m_{\rm zams}$) of $10^{+5}_{-3}$ $m_\odot$ and $15^{+5}_{-3}$ $m_\odot$for the progenitors of sne 2006my and 2006ov, respectively. the mass estimatesfor the progenitors of both sne confirm a suggested trend that the most commontype ii-plateau sne originate from low-mass supergiants with $m_{\rm zams}\approx 8$--20 $m_\odot$.

astro-ph;9907037	the risetime of nearby type ia supernovae	we present calibrated photometric measurements of the earliest detections ofnearby type ia supernovae (sne ia). the set of ~30 new, unfiltered ccdobservations delineate the early rise behavior of sne ia &gt; 18 to 10 days beforemaximum. using simple empirical models, we demonstrate the strong correlationbetween the risetime (i.e., the time between explosion and maximum), thepost-rise light-curve shape, and the peak luminosity. using a variety oflight-curve shape methods, we find the risetime to b maximum for a sn ia withdelta m15(b)=1.1 mag and peak m_v=-19.45 mag to be 19.5+/-0.2 days. we findthat the peak brightness of sne ia is correlated with their risetime; sne iawhich are 0.10 mag brighter at peak in the b-band require 0.80+/-0.05 dayslonger to reach maximum light.  we determine the effects of several possible sources of systematic errors,but none of these significantly impacts the inferred risetime. constraints onsn ia progenitor systems and explosion models are derived from a comparisonbetween the observed and theoretical predictions of the risetime.

0809.5079	coronal lines and dust formation in sn 2005ip: not the brightest, but  the hottest type iin supernova	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of sn2005ip for the first 3yrafter discovery, showing an underlying type ii-l sn interacting with a steadywind to yield an unusual type iin spectrum. for the first 160d, it had a fastlinear decline from a modest peak absolute magnitude of about -17.4(unfiltered), followed by a plateau at roughly -14.8 for more than 2yr.initially having a normal broad-lined spectrum superposed with sparse narrowlines from the photoionized csm, it quickly developed signs of strong csminteraction with a spectrum similar to that of sn1988z. as the underlyingsnii-l faded, sn2005ip exhibited a rich high-ionization spectrum with a denseforest of narrow coronal lines, unprecedented among sne but reminiscent of someactive galactic nuclei. the line-profile evolution of sn 2005ip confirms thatdust formation caused its recently reported infrared excess, but these linesreveal that it is the first sn to show clear evidence for dust in both the fastsn ejecta and the slower post-shock gas. sn2005ip's complex spectrum confirmsthe origin of the strange blue continuum in sn2006jc, which also had post-shockdust formation. we suggest that sn2005ip's late-time plateau and coronalspectrum result from rejuvenated csm interaction between a sustained fast shockand a clumpy stellar wind, where x-rays escape through the optically thininterclump regions to heat the pre-shock csm to coronal temperatures.

0810.3004	first results from the lick agn monitoring project: the mass of the  black hole in arp 151	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 13 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun. we present here the first results fromthis project -- the mass of the central black hole in arp 151. strongvariability throughout the campaign led to an exceptionally clean hbeta lagmeasurement in this object of 4.25(+0.68/-0.66) days in the observed frame.coupled with the width of the hbeta emission line in the variable spectrum, wedetermine a black hole mass of (7.1 +/- 1.2)x10^6 m_sun, assuming the onken etal. normalization for reverberation-based virial masses. we also findvelocity-resolved lag information within the hbeta emission line which clearlyshows infalling gas in the hbeta-emitting region. further detailed analysis maylead to a full model of the geometry and kinematics of broad line region gasaround the central black hole in arp 151.

0810.4923	improved standardization of type ii-p supernovae: application to an  expanded sample	in the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using avariety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematicuncertainties. owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics differingfrom those of type ia sne (sne ia), type ii-plateau supernovae (sne ii-p) areunlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. based on a new analysisof 17 sne ii-p, and on an improved methodology, we find that sne ii-p are goodstandardizable candles, almost comparable to sne ia. we derive a tight hubblediagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the simple correlationbetween luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by hamuy &amp; pinto 2002.we show that the descendent method of nugent et al. 2006 can be furthersimplified and that the correction for dust extinction has low statisticalimpact. we find that our sn sample favors, on average, a very steep dust lawwith total to selective extinction r_v&lt;2. such an extinction law has beenrecently inferred for many sne ia. our results indicate that a distancemeasurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a sn ii-p during theplateau phase combined with sparse photometric measurements.

0811.1205	a golden standard type ia supernova sn 2005cf: observations from the  ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavebands	we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (uv), optical, andnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra,for the normal type ia supernova (sn ia) 2005cf. from the well-sampled lightcurves, we find that sn 2005cf reached a b-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag,with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(b) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. thecorrelations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibratedon the basis of an expanded sn ia sample, yielded e(b-v)_host=0.09+/-0.03 magfor sn2005cf. the uv photometry was obtained with the hst and the swiftultraviolet/optical telescope, and the results match each other to within0.1-0.2 mag. the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband u,with an exception in the 2000-2500 angstrom spectral range (corresponding tothe f220w/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainterthan that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution).combining the uv data with the ground-based optical and nir data, we establishthe generic uv-optical-nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive thebolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data. the overallspectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn ia, but withvariety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. the spectra atearly times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (hv) features in the ca iih&amp;k doublet and nir triplet. similar hv features may exist in the siii 6355absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in theearliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be commonin other normal sne ia. the possible origin of the hv absorption features isbriefly discussed (abridged).

0811.3929	sn 2008s: a cool super-eddington wind in a supernova impostor	we present visual-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy of supernovasn2008s. based on the low peak luminosity for a sn of m_r = -13.9 mag,photometric and spectral evolution unlike that of low-luminosity sne, alate-time decline rate slower than 56co decay, and slow outflow speeds of600-1000 km/s, we conclude that sn2008s is not a true core-collapse sn and isprobably not an electron-capture sn. instead, we show that sn2008s more closelyresembles a "sn impostor" event like sn1997bs, analogous to the giant eruptionsof lbvs. its total radiated energy was 1e47.8 ergs, and it may have ejected0.05-0.2 msun in the event. we discover an uncanny similarity between thespectrum of sn 2008s and that of the galactic hypergiant irc+10420, which isdominated by narrow h-alpha, [ca ii], and ca ii emission lines formed in anopaque wind. we propose a scenario where the vastly super-eddington wind ofsn2008s partly fails because of reduced opacity due to recombination, assuggested for irc+10420. the range of initial masses susceptible to eruptivelbv-like mass loss was known to extend down to 20-25 msun, but estimates forthe progenitor of sn2008s (and the similar ngc300 transient) may extend thisrange to around 15 msun. as such, sn2008s may have implications for theprogenitor of sn1987a.
