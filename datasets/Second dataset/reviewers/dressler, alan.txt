0901.4162	a quintet of black hole mass determinations	we report five new measurements of central black hole masses based on stisand wfpc2 observations with the hubble space telescope and on axisymmetric,three-integral, schwarzschild orbit-library kinematic models. we selected asample of galaxies within a narrow range in velocity dispersion that cover arange of galaxy parameters (including hubble type and core/power-law surfacedensity profile) where we expected to be able to resolve the galaxy's sphere ofinfluence based on the predicted value of the black hole mass from the m-sigmarelation. we find masses in units of 10^8 solar masses for the followinggalaxies:  ngc 3585, m_bh = 3.4 (+1.5, -0.6);  ngc 3607, m_bh = 1.2 (+0.4, -0.4);  ngc 4026, m_bh = 2.1 (+0.7, -0.4); and  ngc 5576, m_bh = 1.8 (+0.3, -0.4), all significantly excluding m_bh = 0. for  ngc 3945, m_bh = 0.09 (+0.17, -0.21), which is significantly belowpredictions from m-sigma and m-l relations and consistent with m_bh = 0, thoughthe presence of a double bar in this galaxy may present problems for ouraxisymmetric code.

0903.4897	the m-sigma and m-l relations in galactic bulges and determinations of  their intrinsic scatter	we derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black holemass (m_bh) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity(l) (the m-sigma and m-l relations), based on 49 m_bh measurements and 19 upperlimits. particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter(epsilon_0) in both relations. we find log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta *log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. the results forellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatterrecovered for spirals is significantly larger. the scatter inferred reinforcesthe need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass functionbased on the m-sigma relation, and further implies that there may besubstantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the m-sigma relation.we estimate the m-l relationship as log(m_bh / m_sun) = alpha + beta * log(l_v/ 10^11 l_sun,v) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. these results appear to beinsensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and thedistribution of intrinsic scatter. we show that culling the sample according tothe resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations tolarger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.

0904.4290	rr lyrae variables in two fields in the spheroid of m31	we present hubble space telescope observations taken with the advanced camerafor surveys wide field channel of two fields near m32 - between four and sixkpc from the center of m31. the data cover a time baseline sufficient for theidentification and characterization of 681 rr lyrae variables of which 555 areab-type and 126 are c-type. the mean magnitude of these stars is &lt;v&gt;=25.29 +/-0.05 where the uncertainty combines both the random and systematic errors. thelocation of the stars in the bailey diagram and the ratio of c-type rr lyraesto all types are both closer to rr lyraes in oosterhoff type i globularclusters in the milky way as compared with oosterhoff ii clusters. the meanperiods of the ab-type and c-type rr lyraes are &lt;p(ab)&gt;=0.557 +/- 0.003 and&lt;p(c)&gt;=0.327 +/- 0.003, respectively, where the uncertainties in each caserepresent the standard error of the mean. when the periods and amplitudes ofthe ab-type rr lyraes in our sample are interpreted in terms of metallicity, wefind the metallicity distribution function to be indistinguishable from agaussian with a peak at &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-1.50 +/- 0.02, where the quoted uncertaintyis the standard error of the mean. using a relation between rr lyrae luminosityand metallicity along with a reddening of e(b-v) = 0.08 +/- 0.03, we find adistance modulus of (m-m)o=24.46 +/- 0.11 for m31. we examine the radialmetallicity gradient in the environs of m31 using published values for thebulge and halo of m31 as well as the abundances of its dwarf spheroidalcompanions and globular clusters. in this context, we conclude that the rrlyraes in our two fields are more likely to be halo objects rather thanassociated with the bulge or disk of m31, in spite of the fact that they arelocated at 4-6 kpc in projected distance from the center.

0911.0355	rr lyrae variables in m32 and the disk of m31	we observed two fields near m32 with the advanced camera for surveys/highresolution channel (acs/hrc) on board the hubble space telescope (hst). themain field, f1, is 1.8 arcmin from the center of m32; the second field, f2,constrains the m31 background, and is 5.4 arcmin distant. each field wasobserved for 16-orbits in each of the f435w (narrow b) and f555w (narrow v)filters. the duration of the observations allowed rr lyrae stars and othershort-period variables to be detected. a population of rr lyrae starsdetermined to belong to m32 would prove the existence of an ancient populationin that galaxy, a subject of some debate. we detected 17 rr lyrae variables inf1 and 14 in f2. a 1-sigma upper limit of 6 rr lyrae variables belonging to m32is inferred from these two fields alone. use of our two acs/wfc parallel fieldsprovides better constraints on the m31 background, however, and implies that$7_{-3}^{+4}$ (68 % confidence interval) rr lyrae variables in f1 belong tom32. we have therefore found evidence for an ancient population in m32. itseems to be nearly indistinguishable from the ancient population of m31. the rrlyrae stars in the f1 and f2 fields have indistinguishable mean v-bandmagnitudes, mean periods, distributions in the bailey diagram and ratios of rrcto rr(tot) types. however, the color distributions in the two fields aredifferent, with a population of red rrab variables in f1 not seen in f2. wesuggest that these might be identified with the detected m32 rr lyraepopulation, but the small number of stars rules out a definitive claim.

1006.3076	new results from the magellan imacs spectroscopic lyman alpha survey:  nicmos observations of lyman alpha emitters at z=5.7	we present nicmos j110 (rest-frame 1200-2100 a) observations of the threez=5.7 lyman alpha emitters discovered in the blind multislit spectroscopicsurvey by martin et al. (2008). these images confirm the presence of the twosources which were previously only seen in spectroscopic observations. thethird source, which is undetected in our j110 observations has been detected innarrowband imaging of the cosmic origins survey (cosmos), so our nondetectionimplies a rest frame equivalent width &gt;146 angstroms (3 sigma). the two j110--detected sources have more modest rest frame equivalent widths of 30-40angstroms, but all three are typical of high-redshift laes. in addition, thej110- detected sources have uv luminosities that are within a factor of two ofl*_{uv}, and sizes that appear compact (r_{hl} ~ 0."15) in our nic2 images --consistent with a redshift of 5.7. we use these uv-continuum and lyman alphameasurements to estimate the i-z colors of these galaxies, and show that atleast one, and possibly all three would be missed by the i-dropout lbgselection. these observations help demonstrate the utility of multislitnarrowband spectroscopy as a technique for finding faint emission linegalaxies.

1010.4442	galaxy stellar mass functions of different morphological types in  clusters, and their evolution between z=0.8 and z=0	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) and its evolution inclusters from z~0.8 to the current epoch, based on the wide-field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings) (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07), and the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs) (0.4&lt;z &lt;0.8). we investigate the total mf and find it evolvesnoticeably with redshift. the shape at m*&gt;10^11 m' does not evolve, but belowm*~10^10.8 m' the mf at high redshift is flat, while in the local universe itflattens out at lower masses. the population of m* = 10^10.2 - 10^10.8 m'galaxies must have grown significantly between z=0.8 and z=0. we analyze the mfof different morphological types (ellipticals, s0s and late-types), and findthat also each of them evolves with redshift. all types have proportionallymore massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolutionoccurs among s0 galaxies. examining the morphology-mass relation (the way theproportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxymass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. at both redshifts, ~40% of thestellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. another ~43% of the mass is in s0galaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters. toexplain the observed trends, we discuss the importance of those mechanisms thatcould shape the mf. we conclude that mass growth due to star formation plays acrucial role in driving the evolution. it has to be accompanied by infall ofgalaxies onto clusters, and the mass distribution of infalling galaxies mightbe different from that of cluster galaxies. however, comparing with high-zfield samples, we do not find conclusive evidence for such an environmentalmass segregation. our results suggest that star formation and infall changedirectly the mf of late-type galaxies in clusters and, indirectly, that ofearly-type galaxies through subsequent morphological transformations.

0709.0585	the black hole mass and extreme orbital structure in ngc1399	the largest galaxies, and in particular central galaxies in clusters, offerunique insight into understanding the mechanism for the growth of nuclear blackholes. we present hubble space telescope kinematics for ngc1399, the centralgalaxy in fornax. we find the best-fit model contains a black hole of 5.1 +-0.7x 10^8 msun (at a distance of 21.1 mpc), a factor of over 2 below thecorrelation of black hole mass and velocity dispersion. we also find a dramaticsignature for central tangential anisotropy. the velocity profiles on adjacentsides 0.5" away from the nucleus show strong bimodality, and the centralspectrum shows a large drop in the dispersion. both of these observations pointto an orbital distribution that is tangentially biased. the best-fit orbitalmodel suggests a ratio of the tangential to radial internal velocitydispersions of three. this ratio is the largest seen in any galaxy to date andwill provide an important measure for the mode by which the central black holehas grown.

1012.2235	the evolution of early-type galaxies in clusters from z~ 0.8 to z~ 0:  the ellipticity distribution and the morphological mix	we present the ellipticity distribution and its evolution for early-typegalaxies in clusters from z~0.8 to z~0, based on the wide-field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings)(0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07), and the eso distant cluster survey(ediscs)(0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8). we first investigate a mass limited sample and we findthat, above a fixed mass limit, the ellipticity distribution of early-typesnoticeably evolves with redshift. in the local universe there areproportionally more galaxies with higher ellipticity, hence flatter, than indistant clusters. this evolution is due partly to the change of the massdistribution and mainly to the change of the morphological mix with z (amongthe early types, the fraction of ellipticals goes from ~70% at high to ~40% atlow-z). analyzing separately the ellipticity distribution of the differentmorphological types, we find no evolution both for ellipticals and s0s.however, for ellipticals a change with redshift in the median value of thedistributions is detected. this is due to a larger population of very round(e&lt;0.05) elliptical galaxies at low-z. to compare our finding to previousstudies, we also assemble a magnitude-"delimited" sample that consists ofearly-type galaxies on the red sequence with -19.3&gt;m_b+1.208z&gt;-21. analyzingthis sample, we do not recover exactly the same results of the mass-limitedsample. hence the selection criteria are crucial to characterize the galaxyproperties: the choice of the magnitude-delimited sample implies the loss ofmany less massive galaxies and so it biases the final results. moreover,although we are adopting the same selection criteria, our results in themagnitude-delimited sample are also not in agreement with those of holden etal.(2009). this is due to the fact that our and their low-z samples have adifferent magnitude distribution because the holden et al.(2009) sample suffersfrom incompleteness at faint magnitudes.

1104.2900	detections of faint lyman-alpha emitters at z = 5.7: galaxy building  blocks and engines of reionization	we report results of a unprecedentedly deep, blind search for ly-alphaemitters (laes) at z = 5.7 using imacs, the inamori-magellan areal camera &amp;spectrograph, with the goal of identifying missing sources of reionization thatcould also be basic building blocks for today's l* galaxies. we describe howimprovements in wide field imaging with the baade telescope, upgrades to imacs,and the accumulation of ~20 hours of integration per field in excellent seeingled to the detection of single-emission-line sources as faint as f ~ 2 x10^{-18} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}, a sensitivity 5 times deeper than our firstsearch (martin et al. 2008). a reasonable correction for foreground interlopersimplies a steep rise of approximately an order of magnitude in source densityfor a factor of four drop in flux, from f = 10^{-17.0} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} to f= 10^{-17.6} (2.5) x 10^{-18} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2}. at this flux the putativelaes have reached a surface density of ~1 per sq arcminute -- a comoving volumedensity of 4 x 10^{-3} mpc^{-3}, several times the density of l* galaxiestoday. such a population of faint laes would account for a significant fractionof the critical flux density required to complete reionization at this epoch,and would be good candidates for building blocks of stellar mass ~10^{8-9} msunfor the young galaxies of this epoch.

1111.0830	the galaxy stellar mass function and its evolution with time show no  dependence on global environment	we present the analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function in differentenvironments at intermediate redshift (0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8) for two mass-limited galaxysamples. we use the imacs cluster building survey (icbs), at masses m_ast&gt;10^(10.5) m_sun, to study cluster, group, and field galaxies at z=0.3-0.45,and the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs), at masses m_ast &gt; 10^(10.2) m_sun,to investigate cluster and group galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. therefore, in ouranalysis we include galaxies that are slightly less massive than the milky way.having excluded the brightest cluster galaxies, we show thatthe shape of themass distribution does not seem to depend on global environment. our two mainresults are: (1) galaxies in the virialized regions of clusters, in groups, andin the field follow a similar mass distribution. (2) comparing both icbs andediscs mass functions to mass functions in the local universe, we findevolution from z~0.4-0.6 to z~0.07. the population of low-mass galaxies hasproportionally grown with time with respect to that of massive galaxies. thisevolution is independent of environment -- the same for clusters and the field.furthermore, considering only clusters, we find that no differences can bedetected neither within the virialized regions, nor when we compare galaxieswithin and outside the virial radius. subdividing galaxies in terms of color,in clusters, groups, and field red and blue galaxies are regulated by differentmass functions, but comparing separately the blue and red mass functions indifferent environments, no differences are detected in their shape.

1111.0832	the importance of the local density in shaping the galaxy stellar mass  functions	exploiting the capabilities of four different surveys --- thepadova-millennium galaxy and group catalogue (pm2gc), the wide-field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings), the imacs cluster building survey (icbs) and theeso distant cluster survey (ediscs) --- we analyze the galaxy stellar massdistribution as a function of local density in mass-limited samples, in thefield and in clusters from low (z&gt;0.04) to high (z&lt;0.8) redshift. we find thatat all redshifts and in all environments, local density plays a role in shapingthe mass distribution. in the field, it regulates the shape of the massfunction at any mass above the mass limits. in clusters, it seems to beimportant only at low masses (log m_ast/m_sun &lt;10.1 in wings and logm_ast/m_sun &lt; 10.4 in ediscs), otherwise it seems not to influence the massdistribution. putting together our results with those of calvi et al. andvulcani et al. for the global environment, we argue that at least at $z\leq0.8$ local density is more important than global environment in determining thegalaxy stellar mass distribution, suggesting that galaxy properties are notmuch dependent of halo mass, but do depend on local scale processes.

1111.2354	the faint-end slope of the redshift 5.7 lyman alpha luminosity function	using new keck deimos spectroscopy, we examine the origin of the steep numbercounts of ultra-faint emission-line galaxies recently reported by dressler etal. (2011). we confirm six lyman alpha emitters (laes), three of which havesignificant asymmetric line profiles with prominent wings extending 300-400km/s redward of the peak emission. with these six laes, we revise our previousestimate of the number of faint laes in the dressler et al. survey. combiningthese data with the density of bright laes in the cosmic origins survey andsubaru deep field provides the best constraints to date on the redshift 5.7 laeluminosity function (lf). schechter function parameters, phi^* = 4.5 x 10^{-4}mpc^{-3}, l^* = 9.1 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}, and alpha= -1.70, are estimated usinga maximum likelihood technique with a model for slit losses. to place thisresult in the context of the uv-selected galaxy population, we investigate howvarious parameterizations of the lyman alpha equivalent width distribution,along with the measured uv-continuum lf, affect shape and normalization of thelyman alpha lf. the nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from theliterature, falls short of the observed space density of laes at the brightend, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths. thisparameterization of the equivalent width distribution implies that as many as50% of our faintest laes should have m_{uv} &gt; -18.0, rendering themundetectable in even the deepest hubble space telescope surveys at thisredshift. hence, ultra-deep emission-line surveys find some of the faintestgalaxies ever observed at the end of the reionization epoch. such faintgalaxies likely enrich the intergalactic medium with metals and maintain itsionized state. observations of these objects provide a glimpse of the buildingblocks of present-day galaxies at an early time.

1111.3977	the star formation history of m32	we use deep hst acs/hrc observations of a field within m32 (f1) and an m31background field (f2) to determine the star formation history (sfh) of m32 fromits resolved stellar population. we find that 2-5gyr old stars contribute\som40%+/- 17% of m32's mass, while 55%+/-21% of m32's mass comes from starsolder than 5 gyr. the mass-weighted mean age and metallicity of m32 at f1 are&lt;age&gt;=6.8+/-1.5 gyr and &lt;[m/h]&gt;=-0.01+/-0.08 dex. the sfh additionallyindicates the presence of young (&lt;2 gyr old), metal-poor ([m/h]\sim-0.7) stars,suggesting that blue straggler stars contribute ~2% of the mass at f1; theremaining \sim3% of the mass is in young metal-rich stars. line-strengthindices computed from the sfh imply a light-weighted mean age and metallicityof 4.9 gyr and [m/h] = -0.12 dex, and single-stellar-population-equivalentparameters of 2.9+/-0.2 gyr and [m/h]=0.02+/-0.01 dex at f1 (~2.7 re). thiscontradicts spectroscopic studies that show a steep age gradient from m32'scenter to 1re. the inferred sfh of the m31 background field f2 reveals that themajority of its stars are old, with \sim95% of its mass already acquired 5-14gyr ago. it is composed of two dominant populations; \sim30%+/-7.5% of its massis in a 5-8 gyr old population, and \sim65%+/-9% of the mass is in a 8-14 gyrold population. the mass-weighted mean age and metallicity of f2 are&lt;age&gt;=9.2+/-1.2 gyr and &lt;[m/h]&gt;=-0.10+/-0.10 dex, respectively. our resultssuggest that the inner disk and spheroid populations of m31 areindistinguishable from those of the outer disk and spheroid. assuming the meanage of m31's disk at f2 (\sim1 disk scale length) to be 5-9 gyr, our resultsagree with an inside-out disk formation scenario for m31's disk.

1201.0783	the carnegie-spitzer-imacs redshift survey of galaxy evolution since  z=1.5: i. description and methodology	we describe the carnegie-spitzer-imacs (csi) survey, a wide-field, near-irselected spectrophotometric redshift survey with the inamori magellan arealcamera and spectrograph (imacs) on magellan-baade. by defining a flux-limitedsample of galaxies in spitzer 3.6micron imaging of swire fields, the csi surveyefficiently traces the stellar mass of average galaxies to z~1.5. this firstpaper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations, processing ofthe photometry and spectrophotometry. we also describe the processing of thedata: new methods of fitting synthetic templates of spectral energydistributions are used to derive redshifts, stellar masses, emission lineluminosities, and coarse information on recent star-formation. our uniquemethodology for analyzing low-dispersion spectra taken with multilayer prismsin imacs, combined with panchromatic photometry from the ultraviolet to the ir,has yielded 37,000 high quality redshifts in our first 5.3 sq.degs of the swirexmm-lss field. we use three different approaches to estimate our redshifterrors and find robust agreement. over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes ofour selection, we find typical uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) &lt; 0.015. incomparisons with previously published vvds redshifts, for example, we find ascatter of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.012 for galaxies at 0.8&lt; z&lt; 1.2. for galaxiesbrighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.009 andsigma_z/(1+z) = 0.025, respectively. notably, our low-dispersion spectroscopyand analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success rates forboth red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based systematics thatcan seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution on environment.

1201.1009	a direct measurement of hierarchical growth in galaxy groups since z~1	we present the first measurement of the evolution of the galaxy group stellarmass function (grsmf) to redshift z&gt;~1 and low masses (m*&gt;10^12 msun). ourresults are based on early data from the carnegie-spitzer-imacs (csi) survey,utilizing low-resolution spectra and broadband optical/near-ir photometry tomeasure redshifts for a 3.6um selected sample of 37,000 galaxies over a 5.3deg^2 area to z~1.2. employing a standard friends-of-friends algorithm for allgalaxies more massive than log(m*/msun)=10.5, we find a total of ~4000 groups.correcting for spectroscopic incompleteness (including slit collisions), webuild cumulative stellar mass functions for these groups in redshift bins atz&gt;0.35, comparing to the z=0 and z&gt;0 mass functions from various group andcluster samples. our derived mass functions match up well with z&gt;0.35 x-rayselected clusters, and strong evolution is evident at all masses over the past8 gyr. given the already low level of star formation activity in galaxies atthese masses, we therefore attribute most of the observed growth in the grsmfto group-group and group-galaxy mergers, in accordance with qualitative notionsof hierarchical structure formation. given the factor 3-10 increase in thenumber density of groups and clusters with m*&gt;10^12 msun since z=1 and thestrong anticorrelation between star formation activity and environmentaldensity, this late-time growth in group-sized halos may therefore be animportant contributor to the structural and star-formation evolution of massivegalaxies over the past 8 gyr.

1303.3916	the imacs cluster building survey. iii. the star formation histories of  field galaxies	using data from the imacs cluster building survey and from nearby galaxysurveys, we examine the evolution of the rate of star formation in fieldgalaxies from $ z = 0.60$ to the present. fitting the luminosity function to astandard schechter form, we find a rapid evolution of $m_b^*$ consistent withthat found in other deep surveys; at the present epoch $m_b^*$ is evolving atthe rate of $0.38 gyr^{-1}$, several times faster than the predictions ofsimple models for the evolution of old, coeval galaxies. the evolution of thedistribution of specific star formation rates (ssfr) is also too rapid toexplain by such models. we demonstrate that starbursts cannot, even inprinciple, explain the evolution of the ssfr distribution. however, the rapidevolution of both $m_b^*$ and the ssfr distribution can be explained if somefraction of galaxies have star formation rates characterized by both short riseand fall times and by an epoch of peak star formation more recent than themajority of galaxies. although galaxies of every stellar mass up to$1.4\times10^{11}\msun$ show a range of epochs of peak star formation, thefraction of "younger" galaxies falls from about 40% at a mass of$4\times10^{10}\msun$ to zero at a mass of $1.4\times10^{11}\msun$. theincidence of younger galaxies appears to be insensitive to the density of thelocal environment; but does depend on group membership: relatively isolatedgalaxies are much more likely to be young than are group members.

1303.3917	the imacs cluster building survey: iv. the log-normal star formation  history of galaxies	we present here a simple model for the star formation history of galaxiesthat is successful in describing both the star formation rate density overcosmic time, as well as the distribution of specific star formation rates ofgalaxies at the current epoch, and the evolution of this quantity in galaxypopulations to a redshift of z=1. we show first that the cosmic star formationrate density is remarkably well described by a simple log-normal in time. wenext postulate that this functional form for the ensemble is also a reasonabledescription for the star formation histories of individual galaxies. using themeasured specific star formation rates for galaxies at z~0 from paper iii inthis series, we then construct a realisation of a universe populated by suchgalaxies in which the parameters of the log-normal star formation history ofeach galaxy are adjusted to match the specific star formation rates at z~0 aswell as fitting, in ensemble, the cosmic star formation rate density from z=0to z=8. this model predicts, with striking fidelity, the distribution ofspecific star formation rates in mass-limited galaxy samples to z=1; this matchis not achieved by other models with a different functional form for the starformation histories of individual galaxies, but with the same number of degreesof freedom, suggesting that the log-normal form is well matched to the likelyactual histories of individual galaxies. we also impose the specific starformation rate versus mass distributions at higher redshifts from paper iii asconstraints on the model, and show that, as previously suggested, some galaxiesin the field, particularly low mass galaxies, are quite young at intermediateredshifts. as emphasized in paper iii, starbursts are insufficient...[abridged]

1303.4148	the imacs cluster building survey: v. further evidence for starburst  recycling from quantitative galaxy morphologies	using $j$ and $k_s$ band imaging obtained as part of the imacs clusterbuilding survey (icbs) we measure s\'ersic indices for 2160 field and clustergalaxies at $0.31 &lt; z &lt; 0.54$. using both mass- and magnitude-limited samples,we compare the distributions for spectroscopically determined passive,continuously starforming, starburst, and poststarburst systems and show thatpreviously established spatial and statistical connections between these typesextend to their gross morphologies. outside of cluster cores, we find closestructural ties between starburst and continuously starforming, as well aspoststarburst and passive types, but not between starbursts and poststarbursts.these results independently support two conclusions presented in paper ii ofthis icbs series (dressler et al.): 1) most starbursts are the product of anon-disruptive triggering mechanism that is insensitive to global environment,such as minor-mergers; 2) starbursts and poststarbursts generally representtransient phases in the lives of "normal" starforming and quiescent galaxies,respectively, originating from and returning to these systems in closed"recycling" loops. in this picture, spectroscopically identified poststarburstsconstitute a minority of all recently terminated starbursts, largely ruling-outthe typical starburst as a quenching event in all but the densest environments.

1303.4272	the imacs cluster building survey: ii. spectral evolution of galaxies in  the epoch of cluster assembly	the imacs cluster building survey (icbs) provides spectra of ~2200 galaxies0.31&lt;z&lt;0.54 in 5 rich clusters (r &lt;= 5 mpc) and the field. infalling,dynamically cold groups with tens of members account for approximately half ofthe supercluster population, contributing to a growth in cluster mass of ~100%by today. the icbs spectra distinguish non-starforming (pas) and poststarburst(psb) from starforming galaxies -- continuously starforming (csf) orstarbursts, (sbh or sbo), identified by anomalously strong h-delta absorptionor [o ii] emission. for the infalling cluster groups and similar field groups,we find a correlation between pas+psb fraction and group mass, indicatingsubstantial "preprocessing" through quenching mechanisms that can turnstarforming galaxies into passive galaxies without the unique environment ofrich clusters. sbh + sbo starburst galaxies are common, and they maintain anapproximately constant ratio (sbh+sbo)/csf ~ 25% in all environments -- fromfield, to groups, to rich clusters. similarly, while psb galaxies stronglyfavor denser environments, psb/pas ~ 10-20% for all environments. this result,and their timescale tau &lt; 500 myr, indicates that starbursts are not signaturesof a quenching mechanism that produces the majority of passive galaxies. wesuggest instead that starbursts and poststarbursts signal minor mergers andaccretions, in starforming and passive galaxies, respectively, and that theprincipal mechanisms for producing passive systems are (1) early major mergers,for elliptical galaxies, and (2) later, less violent processes -- such asstarvation and tidal stripping, for s0 galaxies.

1304.4239	the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies: new constraints at  intermediate redshift	we present abundance measurements from 26 emission-line selected galaxies atz~0.6-0.7. by reaching stellar masses as low as 10^8 m_{\sun}, theseobservations provide the first measurement of the intermediate redshiftmass-metallicity (mz) relation below 10^9 m_{\sun} for the portion of oursample above m &gt; 10^9 m_{\sun} (8/26 galaxies), we find good agreement withprevious measurements of the intermediate redshift mz relation. compared to thelocal relation, we measure an evolution that corresponds to a 0.12 dex decreasein oxygen abundances at intermediate redshifts. this result confirms the trendthat metallicity evolution becomes more significant towards lower stellarmasses, in keeping with a downsizing scenario where low mass galaxies evolveonto the local mz relation at later cosmic times. we show that these galaxiesfollow the local fundamental metallicity relation, where objects with higherspecific (mass-normalized) star formation rates (sfrs) have lowermetallicities. furthermore, we show that the galaxies in our sample lie on anextrapolation of the sfr-m_{*} relation (the star-forming main sequence).leveraging the mz relation and star-forming main sequence (and combining ourdata with higher mass measurements from the literature), we test models thatassume an equilibrium between mass inflow, outflow and star formation. we findthat outflows are required to describe the data. by comparing different outflowprescriptions, we show that momentum driven winds can describe the mz relation;however, this model under-predicts the amount of star formation in low massgalaxies. this disagreement may indicate that preventive feedback fromgas-heating has been overestimated, or it may signify a more fundamentaldeviation from the equilibrium assumption.

1305.1399	predicting future space near-ir grism surveys using the wfc3 infrared  spectroscopic parallels survey	we present near-infrared emission line counts and luminosity functions fromthe hst wfc3 infrared spectroscopic parallels (wisp) program for 29 fields(0.037 deg^2) observed using both the g102 and g141 grisms. altogether weidentify 1048 emission line galaxies with observed equivalent widths greaterthan 40 angstroms, 467 of which have multiple detected emission lines. the wispsurvey is sensitive to fainter flux levels (3-5x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2) than thefuture space near-infrared grism missions aimed at baryonic acousticoscillation cosmology (1-4x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2), allowing us to probe thefainter emission line galaxies that the shallower future surveys may miss.cumulative number counts of 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5 galaxies reach 10,000 deg^-2 above anh-alpha flux of 2x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. h-alpha-emitting galaxies with comparable[oiii] flux are roughly 5 times less common than galaxies with just h-alphaemission at those flux levels. galaxies with low h-alpha/[oiii] ratios are veryrare at the brighter fluxes that future near-infrared grism surveys will probe;our survey finds no galaxies with h-alpha/[oiii] &lt; 0.95 that have h-alpha fluxgreater than 3x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. our h-alpha luminosity function contains acomparable number density of faint line emitters to that found by the nicmosnear-infrared grism surveys, but significantly fewer (factors of 3-4 less) highluminosity emitters. we also find that our high redshift (z=0.9-1.5) counts arein agreement with the high redshift (z=1.47) narrow band h-alpha survey ofhizels (sobral et al. 2013), while our lower redshift luminosity function(z=0.3-0.9) falls slightly below their z=0.84 result. the evolution in both theh-alpha luminosity function from z=0.3--1.5 and the [oiii] luminosity functionfrom z=0.7-2.3 is almost entirely in the l* parameter, which steadily increaseswith redshift over those ranges.

1309.4458	low masses and high redshifts: the evolution of the mass-metallicity  relation	we present the first robust measurement of the high redshift mass-metallicity(mz) relation at 10^{8}&lt; m/m_{\sun} &lt; 10^{10}, obtained by stacking spectra of83 emission-line galaxies with secure redshifts between 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3. forthese redshifts, infrared grism spectroscopy with the hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 is sensitive to the r23 metallicity diagnostic:([oii]3726,3729 + [oiii] 4959,5007)/h\beta. using spectra stacked in four massquartiles, we find a mz relation that declines significantly with decreasingmass, extending from 12+log(o/h) = 8.8 at m=10^{9.8} m_{\sun} to 12+log(o/h)=8.2 at m=10^{8.2} m_{\sun}. after correcting for systematic offsets betweenmetallicity indicators, we compare our mz relation to measurements from thestacked spectra of galaxies with m&gt;10^{9.5} m_{\sun} and z~2.3. within thestatistical uncertainties, our mz relation agrees with the z~2.3 result,particularly since our somewhat higher metallicities (by around 0.1 dex) arequalitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift z=1.76 of our sample. forthe masses probed by our data, the mz relation shows a steep slope which issuggestive of feedback from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizingevolution where high mass galaxies reach the local mz relation at earliertimes. in addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation of thestar-forming main sequence (the sfr-m_{*} relation) at this redshift. thisresult indicates that grism emission-line selected samples do not havepreferentially high sfrs. finally, we report no evidence for evolution of themass-metallicity-sfr plane; our stack-averaged measurements show excellentagreement with the local relation.

1402.0510	physical properties of emission-line galaxies at z ~ 2 from  near-infrared spectroscopy with magellan fire	we present results from near-infrared spectroscopy of 26 emission-linegalaxies at z ~ 2 obtained with the fire spectrometer on the magellan baadetelescope. the sample was selected from the wisp survey, which uses thenear-infrared grism of the hubble space telescope wide field camera 3 to detectemission-line galaxies over 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.3. our fire follow-up spectroscopy(r~5000) over 1.0-2.5 micron permits detailed measurements of physicalproperties of the z~2 emission-line galaxies. dust-corrected star formationrates for the sample range from ~5-100 m_sun yr-1. we derive a medianmetallicity for the sample of ~0.45 z_sun, and the estimated stellar massesrange from ~10^8.5 - 10^9.5 m_sun. the average ionization parameters measuredfor the sample are typically much higher than what is found for localstar-forming galaxies. we derive composite spectra from the fire sample, fromwhich we infer typical nebular electron densities of ~100-400 cm^-3. based onthe location of the galaxies and composite spectra on bpt diagrams, we do notfind evidence for significant agn activity in the sample. most of the galaxiesas well as the composites are offset in the bpt diagram toward higher [oiii]/h-beta at a given [n ii]/h-alpha, in agreement with other observations ofz &gt; 1 star-forming galaxies, but composite spectra derived from the sample donot show an appreciable offset from the local star-forming sequence on the [oiii]/h-beta versus [s ii]/h-alpha diagram. we infer a high nitrogen-to-oxygenabundance ratio from the composite spectrum, which may contribute to the offsetof the high-redshift galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [oiii]/h-beta versus [n ii]/h-alpha diagram. we speculate that the elevatednitrogen abundance could result from substantial numbers of wolf-rayet stars instarbursting galaxies at z~2.

1402.1771	the carnegie-spitzer-imacs redshift survey of galaxy evolution since  z=1.5: i. description and methodology and more!	we describe the carnegie-spitzer-imacs (csi) survey, a wide-field, near-irselected spectrophotometric redshift survey with imacs on magellan-baade. csiuses a flux-limited sample of galaxies in spitzer irac 3.6micron imaging ofswire fields to efficiently trace the stellar mass of average galaxies toz~1.5. this paper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations,and processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry. we also describe theanalysis of the data: new methods of fitting synthetic seds are used to deriveredshifts, stellar masses, emission line luminosities, and coarse informationon recent star-formation. our unique methodology for analyzing low-dispersionspectra taken with multilayer prisms in imacs, combined with panchromaticphotometry from the ultraviolet to the ir, has yielded high quality redshiftsfor 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 sq. degs of the swire xmm-lss field. a newapproach to assessing data quality is also described, and three differentapproaches are used to estimate our redshift errors, with robust agreement.over the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of our selection, we find typicalredshift uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) &lt; 0.015. in comparisons with previouslypublished spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.011 forgalaxies at 0.7&lt; z&lt; 0.9, and sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9&lt; z&lt; 1.2.for galaxies brighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.008and sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.022, respectively. notably, our low-dispersionspectroscopy and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and successrates for both red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-basedsystematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolutionon environment.

1402.7076	the mass-independence of specific star formation rates in galactic disks	the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the sfr "mainsequence"; ${\rm sfr}-m_*$) is not quite unity: specific star formation rates$({\rm sfr}/m_*)$ are weakly-but-significantly anti-correlated with $m_*$. herewe demonstrate that this trend may simply reflect the well-known increase inbulge mass-fractions -- portions of a galaxy not forming stars -- with $m_*$.using a large set of bulge/disk decompositions and sfr estimates derived fromthe sloan digital sky survey, we show that re-normalizing sfr by disk stellarmass $({\rm ssfr_{\rm disk}\equiv sfr}/m_{*,{\rm disk}})$ reduces the$m_*$-dependence of sf efficiency by $\sim0.25$ dex per dex, erasing itentirely in some subsamples. quantitatively, we find $\log {\rmssfr_{disk}}-\log m_*$ to have a slope $\beta_{\rm disk}\in[-0.20,0.00]\pm0.02$(depending on sfr estimator and main sequence definition) for star-forminggalaxies with $m_*\geq10^{10}m_{\odot}$ and bulge mass-fractions$b/t\lesssim0.6$, generally consistent with a pure-disk control sample($\beta_{\rm control}=-0.05\pm0.04$). that $\langle{\rm sfr}/m_{*,{\rmdisk}}\rangle$ is (largely) independent of host mass for star-forming disks hasstrong implications for aspects of galaxy evolution inferred from any ${\rmsfr}-m_*$ relation, including: manifestations of "mass quenching" (bulgegrowth), factors shaping the star-forming stellar mass function (uniform $d\logm_*/dt$ for low-mass, disk-dominated galaxies), and diversity in star formationhistories (dispersion in ${\rm sfr}(m_*,t)$). our results emphasize the need totreat galaxies as composite systems -- not integrated masses -- inobservational and theoretical work.

0803.0464	the stellar population histories of early-type galaxies. iii. the coma  cluster	we present stellar population parameters of twelve early-type galaxies (etgs)in the coma cluster based on spectra obtained using the low resolution imagingspectrograph on the keck ii telescope. our data allow us to examine in detailthe zero-point and scatter in their stellar population properties. our etgshave ssp-equivalent ages of on average 5-8 gyr with the models used here, withthe oldest galaxies having ages of ~10 gyr old. this average age is identicalto the mean age of field etgs. our etgs span a large range in velocitydispersion but are consistent with being drawn from a population with a singleage. specifically, ten of the twelve etgs are consistent within their formalerrors of having the same age, 5.2+/-0.2 gyr, over a factor of more than 750 inmass. we therefore find no evidence for downsizing of the stellar populationsof etgs in the core of the coma cluster. we suggest that coma cluster etgs mayhave formed the majority of their mass at high redshifts but suffered small butdetectable star formation events at z~0.1-0.3. previous detections of'downsizing' from stellar populations of local etgs may not reflect the samedownsizing seen in lookback studies of rsgs, as the young ages of the localetgs represent only a small fraction of their total masses.

1406.4132	hubble space telescope grism spectroscopy of extreme starbursts across  cosmic time: the role of dwarf galaxies in the star formation history of the  universe	near infrared slitless spectroscopy with the wide field camera 3, onboard thehubble space telescope, offers a unique opportunity to study low-mass galaxypopulations at high-redshift ($z\sim$1-2). while most high$-z$ surveys arebiased towards massive galaxies, we are able to select sources via theiremission lines that have very-faint continua. we investigate the star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass ($m_{\star}$) relation for about 1000 emission-linegalaxies identified over a wide redshift range of $0.3 \lesssim z \lesssim2.3$. we use the h$_{\alpha}$ emission as an accurate sfr indicator and correctthe broadband photometry for the strong nebular contribution to derive accuratestellar masses down to $m_{\star} \sim 10^{7} m_{\odot}$. we focus here on asubsample of galaxies that show extremely strong emission lines (eelgs) withrest-frame equivalent widths ranging from 200 to 1500 \aa. this populationconsists of outliers to the normal sfr-$m_{\star}$ sequence with much higherspecific sfrs ($&gt; 10$ gyr$^{-1}$). while on-sequence galaxies follow acontinuous star formation process, eelgs are thought to be caught during anextreme burst of star formation that can double their stellar mass in less than$100$ myr. the contribution of starbursts to the total star formation densityappears to be larger than what has been reported for more massive galaxies inprevious studies. in the complete mass range $8.2 &lt;$ log($m_{\star}/m_{\odot}$)$&lt; 10$ and a sfr lower completeness limit of about 2 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (10$m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) at $z\sim1$ ($z \sim 2$), we find that starbursts havingew$_{rest}$(h$_{\alpha}$)$&gt;$ 300, 200, and 100 a contribute up to $\sim13$, 18,and 34 %, respectively, to the total sfr of emission-line selected sample at$z\sim1-2$. the comparison with samples of massive galaxies shows an increasein the contribution of starbursts towards lower masses.

1410.0967	the grism lens-amplified survey from space (glass). ii. gas-phase  metallicity and radial gradients in an interacting system at z~2	we present spatially resolved gas-phase metallicity for a system of threegalaxies at z=1.85 detected in the grism lens-amplified survey from space(glass). the combination of hst's diffraction limit and strong gravitationallensing by the cluster macs j0717+3745 results in a spatial resolution of~200-300 pc, enabling good spatial sampling despite the intrinsically smallgalaxy sizes. the galaxies in this system are separated by 50-200 kpc inprojection and are likely in an early stage of interaction, evidenced byrelatively high specific star formation rates. their gas-phase metallicitiesare consistent with larger samples at similar redshift, star formation rate,and stellar mass. we obtain a precise measurement of the metallicity gradientfor one galaxy and find a shallow slope compared to isolated galaxies at highredshift, consistent with a flattening of the gradient due to gravitationalinteraction. an alternative explanation for the shallow metallicity gradientand elevated star formation rate is rapid recycling of metal-enriched gas, butwe find no evidence for enhanced gas-phase metallicities which should resultfrom this effect. notably, the measured stellar masses log(m/msun) = 7.2-9.1probe to an order of magnitude below previous mass-metallicity studies at thisredshift. the lowest mass galaxy has properties similar to those expected forfornax at this redshift, indicating that glass is able to directly study theprogenitors of local group dwarf galaxies on spatially resolved scales. largersamples from the full glass survey will be ideal for studying the effects offeedback, and the time evolution of metallicity gradients. these initialresults demonstrate the utility of hst spectroscopy combined with gravitationallensing for characterizing resolved physical properties of galaxies at highredshift.

1411.1431	matching the evolution of the stellar mass function using log-normal  star formation histories	we show that a model consisting of individual, log-normal star formationhistories for a volume-limited sample of $z\approx0$ galaxies reproduces theevolution of the total and quiescent stellar mass functions at $z\lesssim2.5$and stellar masses $m_*\geq10^{10}\,{\rm m_\odot}$. this model has previouslybeen shown to reproduce the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (${\rmsfr}$--$m_*$) over the same interval, is fully consistent with the observedevolution of the cosmic ${\rm sfr}$ density at $z\leq8$, and entails noexplicit "quenching" prescription. we interpret these results/features in thecontext of other models demonstrating a similar ability to reproduce theevolution of (1) the cosmic ${\rm sfr}$ density, (2) the total/quiescentstellar mass functions, and (3) the ${\rm sfr}$--$m_*$ relation, proposing thatthe key difference between modeling approaches is the extent to which theystress/address diversity in the (starforming) galaxy population. finally, wesuggest that observations revealing the timescale associated with dispersion in${\rm sfr}(m_*)$ will help establish which models are the most relevant togalaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0203468	the slope of the black-hole mass versus velocity dispersion correlation	observations of nearby galaxies reveal a strong correlation between the massof the central dark object m and the velocity dispersion sigma of the hostgalaxy, of the form log(m/m_sun) = a + b*log(sigma/sigma_0); however, publishedestimates of the slope b span a wide range (3.75 to 5.3). merritt &amp; ferraresehave argued that low slopes (&lt;4) arise because of neglect of random measurementerrors in the dispersions and an incorrect choice for the dispersion of themilky way galaxy. we show that these explanations account for at most a smallpart of the slope range. instead, the range of slopes arises mostly because ofsystematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups forthe same galaxies. the origin of these differences remains unclear, but wesuggest that one significant component of the difference results from ferrarese&amp; merritt's extrapolation of central velocity dispersions to r_e/8 (r_e is theeffective radius) using an empirical formula. another component may arise fromdispersion-dependent systematic errors in the measurements. a new determinationof the slope using 31 galaxies yields b=4.02 +/- 0.32, a=8.13 +/- 0.06, forsigma_0=200 km/s. the m-sigma relation has an intrinsic dispersion in log mthat is no larger than 0.3 dex. in an appendix, we present a simple model forthe velocity-dispersion profile of the galactic bulge.

astro-ph;0403257	black hole mass determinations from orbit superposition models are  reliable	we show that orbit-superposition dynamical models (schwarzschild's method)provide reliable estimates of nuclear black hole masses and errors whenconstructed from adequate orbit libraries and kinematic data. we thus rebut tworecent papers that argue that bh masses obtained from this method areunreliable. these papers claim to demonstrate that the range of allowable bhmasses derived from a given dataset is artificially too narrow as a result ofan inadequate number of orbits in the library used to construct dynamicalmodels. this is an elementary error that is easily avoided. we describe amethod to estimate the number and nature of orbits needed for the library. weprovide an example that shows that this prescription is adequate, in the sensethat the range of allowable bh masses is not artificially narrowed by use oftoo few orbits. a second point raised by critics is that kinematic data aregenerally obtained with insufficient spatial resolution to obtain a reliablemass. we make the distinction between unreliable determinations and impreciseones. we show that there are several different properties of a kinematicdataset that can lead to imprecise bh determinations, but none of theattributes we have investigated leads to an unreliable determination. in short,the degree to which the bh radius of influence is resolved by spectroscopicobservations is already reflected in the bh-mass error envelope, and is not ahidden source of error. the bh masses published by our group and the leidengroup are reliable.

astro-ph;0403455	evolution since z=1 of the morphology-density relation of galaxies	we measure the morphology-density relation of galaxies at z=1 across the fullthree orders of magnitude in projected galaxy density available in low-redshiftstudies. our study adopts techniques that are comparable with those applied atlower redshifts, allowing a direct investigation of how the morphologicalsegregation of galaxies has evolved over the last 8 gyr. although themorphology-density relation, as described by the fraction of early-type (e+s0)galaxies, was in place at z=1, its form differs from that observed at both z=0and z=0.5. in the highest density regions the early-type fraction has increasedsteadily with time from f(e+s0)=0.7+/-0.1 at z=1 to f(e+s0)=0.9+/-0.1 at thepresent epoch. however, in intermediate density regions corresponding to groupsand the accretion regions of rich clusters, significant evolution appears tobegin only after z=0.5. finally, at the lowest densities, no evolution isobserved for the early-type fraction of field galaxies which remains constantat f(e+s0)=0.4+/-0.1 at all epochs. we examine a simple picture consistent withthese observations where the early-type population at z=1 is comprised largelyof elliptical galaxies. subsequent evolution in both intermediate and denseregions is attributed to the transformation of spirals into lenticulars.further progress in verifying our hypothesis may be achieved throughdistinguishing ellipticals and lenticulars at these redshifts through resolveddynamical studies of representative systems.

astro-ph;0408490	studying the star formation histories of galaxies in clusters from  composite spectra	we have formed ``composite spectra'' by combining the integrated-lightspectra of individual galaxies in 8 intermediate-redshift and 12 low-redshiftclusters of galaxies. because these composite spectra have much highersignal-to-noise ratios than individual galaxy spectra, they are particularlyuseful in quantifying general trends in star formation for galaxy populationsin distant clusters, z &gt; 0.3. by measuring diagnostic features that representstellar populations of very different ages, a grand-composite spectrum canreflect the fractions of those populations as accurately as if excellentspectral measurements were available for each galaxy.  measuring the equivalent widths of spectral features in composite spectra isespecially well-suited for comparing cosmic variance of star formation inclusters at a given redshift, or comparing clusters over a range of redshifts.when we do this we find that [o ii] emission and especially balmer absorptionis strong in each of our intermediate-redshift clusters, and completelyseparable from a sample of 12 present-epoch clusters, where these features areweak. specifically, we show by comparing to the h-delta strengths ofpresent-epoch populations of continuously star-forming galaxies that thehigher-redshift samples must contain a much higher fraction of starburstgalaxies than are found today in any environment.

astro-ph;0606739	the masses of nuclear black holes in luminous elliptical galaxies and  implications for the space density of the most massive black holes	black hole masses predicted from the mbh-sigma relationship conflict withthose predicted from the mbh-l relationship for the most luminous galaxies,such as brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). this is because stellar velocitydispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with l for bcgs and other giantellipticals. the mbh-l relationship predicts that the most luminous bcgs mayhave mbh approaching 10^{10}m_sol, while the m-sigma relationship alwayspredicts mbh&lt;3x10^9m_sol. we argue that the mbh-l relationship is a plausibleor even preferred description for bcgs and other galaxies of similarluminosity. if cores in central stellar density are formed by binary bhs, thenthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of mbh.using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxiesobserved by hst, we argue that l is superior to sigma as an indicator ofr_gamma in luminous galaxies. the observed r_gamma-mbh relationship for 11 coregalaxies with measured mbh appears to be consistent with the mbh-l relationshipfor bcgs. bcgs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities thatmay be difficult to generate with the modest bh masses inferred from thembh-sigma relationship. mbh~l may be expected to hold for bcgs, if they wereformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of bh to stellarmass. this picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigmawith l and the more rapid increase in effective radii with l seen in bcgs. ifbcgs have large bhs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local bhmass function for mbh&gt;3x10^9m_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richerthan that inferred from the mbh-sigma relationship. the volume density of qsosat earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the mbh-l relationship.

astro-ph;9604092	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst iii: non-parametric recovery  of stellar luminosity distributions	we have non-parametrically determined the luminosity density profiles andtheir logarithmic slopes for 42 early-type galaxies observed with hst. assumingthat the isodensity contours are spheroidal, then the luminosity density isuniquely determined from the surface brightness data through the abel equation.for nearly all the galaxies in our sample, the logarithmic slope of theluminosity density measured at 0.1" (the innermost reliable measurement withthe uncorrected hst) is significantly different from zero; i.e. most ellipticalgalaxies have cusps. there are only two galaxies for which an analytic corecannot be excluded. the distribution of logarithmic slopes at 0.1" appears tobe bimodal, confirming the conclusion of lauer et al. (1995) that early-typegalaxies can be divided into two types based on their surface-brightnessprofiles; i.e., those with cuspy cores and those whose steep power-law profilescontinue essentially unchanged in to the resolution limit. the peaks in theslope distribution occur at -0.8 and -1.9. more than half of the galaxies haveslopes steeper than -1.0. taken together with the recent theoretical work ofmerritt &amp; fridman, these results suggest that many (and maybe most) ellipticalgalaxies are either nearly axisymmetric or spherical near the center, or slowlyevolve due to the influence of stochastic orbits.

astro-ph;9607154	the homogeneity of spheroidal populations in distant clusters	the small scatter observed for the u-v colors of spheroidal galaxies innearby clusters of galaxies provides a powerful constraint on the history ofstar formation in dense environments. however, with local data alone, it is notpossible to separate models where galaxies assembled synchronously overredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 from ones where galaxies formed stochastically at much earliertimes. here we attempt to resolve this ambiguity via high precision rest-frameuv-optical photometry of a large sample of morphologically-selected spheroidalgalaxies in three z~0.54 clusters which have been observed with hst. wedemonstrate the robustness of using hst to conduct the morphological separationof spheroidal and disk galaxies at this redshift and use our new data to repeatthe analysis conducted locally at a significant look-back time. we find a smallscatter (&lt; 0.1 mag rms) for galaxies classed as es and e/s0s, both internallywithin each of the three clusters and externally from cluster to cluster. we donot find any trend for the scatter to increase with decreasing luminosity downto l = l*+3, other than can be accounted for by observational error. neither isthere evidence for a distinction between the scatter observed for galaxiesclassified as ellipticals and s0. our result provides a new constraint on thestar formation history of cluster spheroidals prior to z=0.5 confirming andconsiderably strengthening the earlier conclusions. most of the star formationin the elliptical galaxies in dense clusters was completed before z~3 inconventional cosmologies. although we cannot rule out the continued productionof some ellipticals, our results do indicate an era of initial star formationconsistent with the population of star-forming galaxies recently detectedbeyond z~3.

astro-ph;9610055	the centers of early-type galaxies with hst. iv. central parameter  relations	we analyze hubble space telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hot galaxies). luminous hot galaxieshave cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r ~ r_b toshallow inner profiles with logslope less than 0.3. faint hot galaxies showsteep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores. thecenters of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass andluminosity than the cores of large galaxies at a limiting radius of 10 pc. atintermediate magnitudes (-22.0 &lt; m_v &lt; -20.5), core and power-law galaxiescoexist, and there is a range in r_b at a given luminosity of at least twoorders of magnitude. central properties correlate with global rotation andshape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-lawgalaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. the dense power-law centers ofdisky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-richmergers. the parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products ofgas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. for example, core galaxies accretesmall, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-densitycores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. an alternative modelfor core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (bhs): thebh may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any existsand scouring out a core. an average bh mass per spheroid of 0.002 times thestellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii ofobserved cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of agns andkinematic detections of bhs in nearby galaxies.

astro-ph;9610270	a comparison of direct and indirect mass estimates for distant clusters  of galaxies	we present weak lensing results for 12 distant clusters determined fromimages obtained with the refurbished hst. we detect the signature ofgravitational lensing in 11 of the 12 clusters; the clusters span nearly anorder of magnitude in lensing strength. the sample thus provides an excellentdatabase for correlating direct mass estimates from lensing with indirect oneswhich rely on baryonic tracers. we examine the correlation between the clusterx-ray luminosities and the mean gravitational shear strengths and develop amodel which predicts the relationship expected from the properties of localclusters. after allowing for various observational effects, we find that thepredicted correlation is a reasonable match to the available data, indicatingthat there has been little evolution in the x-ray luminosity-central massrelationship between z=0.4 and now. we discuss the implications of this resultin the context of the evolution of the x-ray luminosity function found byearlier workers. the comparison between shear amplitudes and velocitydispersions, estimated from a modest sample of members, reveals a discrepancyin the sense that these velocity dispersions are typically over-estimated byfactors of ~50%. this supports earlier suggestions that high dispersionsmeasured for distant clusters may be seriously affected by both unidentifiedsubstructure and outliers. combining our lensing masses withmorphologically-based luminosity estimates, we determine mass/light ratios insolar units of m/l_v=180+/-160 h for the entire population and 620+/-250 h forthe spheroidal galaxies where the evolutionary effects can be best treated. weargue that this provides an upper bound to the local cluster m/l correspondingto omega~0.4.

astro-ph;9611004	hst observations of distant clusters: implications for galaxy evolution	the ``morphs'' group has completed the cataloging, parameterization, andmorphological classification of ~2000 galaxies in 10 rich clusters from 0.36 &lt;z &lt; 0.56. from a weak lensing analysis using these data, which compares thex-ray properties (l_x) of the clusters with virial temperature estimates (t_v)from the lensing shear strength, we find little evidence for evolution in thel_x-t_v relation from that observed for local clusters. we discuss how thisobservation constrains models for the x-ray evolution of clusters. the datahave also been used to study the color dispersion of bona-fide ellipticals inhigh-z clusters: we find the spread to be very small, suggesting an earlyformation epoch for the stellar populations of cluster ellipticals. this isconsistent with the evolution of the morphology-density relationship, in whichwe find ellipticals to be as abundant at z=0.5 as in clusters today, andalready well ensconced in the dense regions. in contrast, s0's are lessplentiful and less well-concentrated compared to the present epoch, and spiralgalaxies everywhere more abundant. combined with other spectroscopic andmorphological data, these observations suggest that most of these rapidlyevolving systems are not likely to become bright ellipticals, which were morelikely formed at early epochs. cluster s0 galaxies, on the other hand, arelikely to have been produced in large numbers in the recent past.

astro-ph;9703188	spectroscopic evidence for a supermassive black hole in ngc 4486b	the stellar kinematics of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc 4486b have beenmeasured in seeing sigma_* = .22 arcsec with the canada-france-hawaiitelescope. lauer et al. 1996, apj, 471, l79 have shown that ngc 4486b issimilar to m31 in having a double nucleus. we show that it also resembles m31in its kinematics. the velocity dispersion gradient is very steep: sigmaincreases from 116 +- 6 km/s at r = 2" - 6" to 281 +- 11 km/s at the center.this is much higher than expected for an elliptical galaxy of absolutemagnitude m_b = -16.8: ngc 4486b is far above the scatter in the faber-jacksoncorrelation between sigma and bulge luminosity. therefore the king coremass-to-light ratio, m/l_v = 20, is unusually high compared with normal valuesfor old stellar populations. we construct dynamical models with isotropicvelocity dispersions and show that they reproduce black hole (bh) massesderived by more detailed methods. we also fit axisymmetric, three-integralmodels. isotropic models imply that ngc 4486b contains a central dark object,probably a bh, of mass m_bh = 6^{+3}_{-2} x 10^8 m_sun. however, anisotropicmodels fit the data without a bh if the ratio of radial to azimuthaldispersions is ~ 2 at 1". therefore this is a less strong bh detection than theones in m31, m32, and ngc 3115. a 6 x 10^8 m_sun bh is 9 % of the mass m_bulgein stars; even if m_bh is smaller than the isotropic value, m_bh/m_bulge islikely to be unusually large. double nuclei are a puzzle because the dynamicalfriction timescales for self-gravitating star clusters in orbit around eachother are short. since both m31 and ngc 4486b contain central dark objects, ourresults support models in which the survival of double nuclei is connected withthe presence of a bh (e. g., tremaine 1995, aj, 110, 628).

astro-ph;9707232	evolution since z = 0.5 of the morphology-density relation for clusters  of galaxies	using traditional morphological classifications of galaxies in 10intermediate-redshift (z~0.5) clusters observed with wfpc-2 on the hubble spacetelescope, we derive relations between morphology and local galaxy densitysimilar to that found by dressler for low-redshift clusters. takencollectively, the `morphology-density' relationship, m-d, for these moredistant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found forthe local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences:(1) for the clusters in our sample, the m-d relation is strong in centrallyconcentrated ``regular'' clusters, those with a strong correlation of radiusand surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentratedand irregular, in contrast to the situation for low redshift clusters where astrong relation has been found for both. (2) in every cluster the fraction ofelliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, butthe s0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of thespiral fraction. straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretationsof these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceedshierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2)the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters,and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but s0's aregenerated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.

astro-ph;9708072	the demography of massive dark objects in galaxy centres	we construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with hubblespace telescope photometry and ground-based kinematics. the models assume thateach galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function,arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratioupsilon, and a central massive dark object (mdo) of arbitrary mass m_bh. theyprovide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of m_bh andupsilon; the four galaxies that cannot be fit have kinematically decoupledcores. the mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fit galaxies areconsistent with the fundamental plane correlation upsilon \propto l^0.2, wherel is galaxy luminosity. in all but six galaxies the models require at the 95%confidence level an mdo of mass m_bh ~ 0.006 m_bulge = 0.006 upsilon l. five ofthe six galaxies consistent with m_bh=0 are also consistent with thiscorrelation. the other (ngc 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on m_bh. weconsider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describingthe correlation of the masses of these mdos with other galaxy properties. oneof the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~0.97 of galaxies havemdos, whose masses are well described by a gaussian distribution in log(m_bh/m_bulge) of mean -2.27 and width ~0.07.

astro-ph;9901263	a spectroscopic catalog of 10 distant rich clusters of galaxies	we present spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the fields of 10 distantclusters for which we have previously presented deep imaging with wfpc2 onboard the hst. the clusters span the redshift range z=0.37-0.56 and are thesubject of a detailed ground- and space-based study to investigate theevolution of galaxies as a function of environment and epoch. the datapresented here include positions, photometry, redshifts, spectral linestrengths and classifications for 657 galaxies in the fields of the 10clusters. the catalog comprises 424 cluster members across the 10 clusters and233 field galaxies, with detailed morphological information from our wfpc2images for 204 of the cluster galaxies and 71 in the field. we illustrate somebasic properties of the catalog, including correlations between themorphological and spectral properties of our large sample of cluster galaxies.a direct comparison of the spectral properties of the high redshift cluster andfield populations suggest that the phenomenon of strong balmer lines inotherwise passive galaxies (commonly called e+a, but renamed here as the k+aclass) shows an order-of-magnitude increase in the rich cluster environment,compared to a more modest increase in the field population. this suggests thatthe process or processes involved in producing k+a galaxies are eithersubstantially more effective in the cluster environment or that thisenvironment prolongs the visibility of this phase. a more detailed analysis andmodeling of these data will be presented in poggianti et al. (1998).

astro-ph;9901264	the star formation histories of galaxies in distant clusters	we present a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic catalog of galaxies in 10distant clusters from dressler et al. (1999, d99). we investigate the nature ofthe different spectral classes defined by d99 including star forming,post-starburst and passive galaxy populations, and reproduce their basicproperties using our spectral synthesis model. we attempt to identify theevolutionary pathways between the various spectral classes in order to searchfor the progenitors of the numerous post-starburst galaxies. the comparison ofthe spectra of the distant galaxy populations with samples drawn from the localuniverse leads us to identify a significant population of dust-enshroudedstarburst galaxies, showing both strong balmer absorption and relatively modest[oii] emission, that we believe are the most likely progenitors of thepost-starburst population. we present the differences between the field andcluster galaxies at z=0.4-0.5. we then compare the spectral and themorphological properties of the distant cluster galaxies, exploring theconnection between the quenching of star formation inferred from the spectraand the strong evolution of the s0 population discussed by dressler et al.(1997). we conclude that either two different timescales and/or two differentphysical processes are responsible for the spectral and the morphologicaltransformation.

astro-ph;9907062	the sbf survey of galaxy distances. ii. local and large-scale flows	we present analysis of local large scale flows using the surface brightnessfluctuation (sbf) survey for the distances to 300 early-type galaxies. ourmodels of the distribution function of mean velocity and velocity dispersion ateach point in space include a uniform thermal velocity dispersion and sphericalattractors whose position, amplitude, and radial shape are free to vary. ourfitting procedure performs a maximum likelihood fit of the model to theobservations. we obtain a hubble constant of ho = 77 +/- 4 +/- 7 km/s/mpc, buta uniform hubble flow is not acceptable fit to the data. inclusion of twoattractors, one of whose fit location coincides with the virgo cluster and theother whose fit location is slightly beyond the centaurus clusters nearlyexplain the peculiar velocities, but the quality of the fit can be furtherimproved by the addition of a quadrupole correction to the hubble flow.although the dipole and quadrupole may be genuine manifestations of moredistant density fluctuations, we find evidence that they are more likely due tonon-spherical attractors. we find no evidence for bulk flows which include ourentire survey volume (r &lt; 3000 km/s); our volume is at rest with respect to thecmb. the fits to the attractors both have isothermal radial profiles (v ~ 1/r)over a range of overdensity between about 10 and 1, but fall off more steeplyat larger radius. the best fit value for the small scale, cosmic thermalvelocity is 180 +/- 14 km/s.

astro-ph;9909222	the extragalactic distance scale key project xxvii. a derivation of the  hubble constant using the fundamental plane and dn-sigma relations in leo i,  virgo, and fornax	using published photometry and spectroscopy, we construct the fundamentalplane and d_n-sigma relations in leo i, virgo and fornax. the published cepheidp-l relations to spirals in these clusters fixes the relation between angularsize and metric distance for both the fundamental plane and d_n-sigmarelations. using the locally calibrated fundamental plane, we infer distancesto a sample of clusters with a mean redshift of cz \approx 6000 \kms, andderive a value of h_0=78+- 5+- 9 km/s/mpc (random, systematic) for the localexpansion rate. this value includes a correction for depth effects in thecepheid distances to the nearby clusters, which decreased the deduced value ofthe expansion rate by 5% +- 5%. if one further adopts the metallicitycorrection to the cepheid pl relation, as derived by the key project, the valueof the hubble constant would decrease by a further 6%+- 4%. these two sourcesof systematic error, when combined with a +- 6% error due to the uncertainty inthe distance to the large magellanic cloud, a +- 4% error due to uncertaintiesin the wfpc2 calibration, and several small sources of uncertainty in thefundamental plane analysis, combine to yield a total systematic uncertainty of+- 11%. we find that the values obtained using either the cmb, or a flow-fieldmodel, for the reference frame of the distant clusters, agree to within 1%. thedn-sigma relation also produces similar results, as expected from thecorrelated nature of the two scaling relations. a complete discussion of thesources of random and systematic error in this determination of the hubbleconstant is also given, in order to facilitate comparison with the othersecondary indicators being used by the key project.
