0902.2599	exploring dark energy with next-generation photometric redshift surveys	the coming decade will be an exciting period for dark energy research, duringwhich astronomers will address the question of what drives the acceleratedcosmic expansion as first revealed by type ia supernova (sn) distances, andconfirmed by later observations.  the mystery of dark energy poses a challenge of such magnitude that, asstated by the dark energy task force (detf), "nothing short of a revolution inour understanding of fundamental physics will be required to achieve a fullunderstanding of the cosmic acceleration." the lack of multiple complementaryprecision observations is a major obstacle in developing lines of attack fordark energy theory. this lack is precisely what next-generation surveys willaddress via the powerful techniques of weak lensing (wl) and baryon acousticoscillations (bao) -- galaxy correlations more generally -- in addition to sne,cluster counts, and other probes of geometry and growth of structure. becauseof their unprecedented statistical power, these surveys demand an accurateunderstanding of the observables and tight control of systematics.  this white paper highlights the opportunities, approaches, prospects, andchallenges relevant to dark energy studies with wide-deep multiwavelengthphotometric redshift surveys. quantitative predictions are presented for a20000 sq. deg. ground-based 6-band (ugrizy) survey with 5-sigma depth ofr~27.5, i.e., a stage 4 survey as defined by the detf.

0907.4387	lensing magnification: implications for counts of submillimeter galaxies  and sz clusters	we study lensing magnification of source galaxies by intervening galaxygroups and clusters using a halo model. halos are modeled with truncated nfwprofiles with ellipticity added to their lensing potential and propagated toobservable lensing statistics. we present the formalism to calculate observableeffects due to a distribution of halos of different masses at differentredshifts along the l ine of sight. we calculate the effects of magnificationon the number counts of high-redshift galaxies. using blast survey data forsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs), we find that magnification affects the steep,high flux par t of the counts by about 60%. the effect becomes much stronger ifthe intrinsic distribution is signi ficantly steeper than observed. we alsoconsider the effect of this high-redshift galaxy population on contaminatingthe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) signal of massive clusters using the halo modelapproach. we find that for the majority of clusters expected to be detectedwith ongoing sz surveys, there is significant contamination from the poissonnoise due to background smgs. this contr ibution can be comparable to the szincrement for typical clusters and can also contaminate the sz decrement of lowmass clusters. thus sz observations, especially for the increment part of thesz spectrum, need to include careful modeling of this irreducible contaminationfor mass estimation. lensing further enhances the contamination, especiallyclose to the cores of massive clusters and for very disturbed clusters withlarge magnification cross-section.

0910.1361	galaxy-cmb and galaxy-galaxy lensing on large scales: sensitivity to  primordial non-gaussianity	a convincing detection of primordial non-gaussianity in the local form of thebispectrum, whose amplitude is given by the fnl parameter, offers a powerfultest of inflation. in this paper we calculate the modification of two-pointcross-correlation statistics of weak lensing - galaxy-galaxy lensing andgalaxy-cosmic microwave background (cmb) cross-correlation - due to fnl. wederive and calculate the covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy lensing includingcosmic variance terms. we focus on large scales (l&lt;100) for which the shapenoise of the shear measurement becomes irrelevant and cosmic variance dominatesthe error budget. for a modest degree of non-gaussianity, fnl=+/-50,modifications of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal at the 10% level are seen onscales r~300 mpc, and grow rapidly toward larger scales as \propto r^2. we alsosee a clear signature of the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in thematter power spectrum at ~150 mpc, which can be measured by next-generationlensing experiments. in addition we can probe the local-form primordialnon-gaussianity in the galaxy-cmb lensing signal by correlating the lensingpotential reconstructed from cmb with high-z galaxies. for example, forfnl=+/-50, we find that the galaxy-cmb lensing cross power spectrum is modifiedby ~10% at l~40, and by a factor of two at l~10, for a population of galaxiesat z=2 with a bias of 2. the effect is greater for more highly biasedpopulations at larger z; thus, high-z galaxy surveys cross-correlated with cmboffer a yet another probe of primordial non-gaussianity.

1004.3294	cosmological tests of gravity	modifications of general relativity provide an alternative explanation todark energy for the observed acceleration of the universe. we review recentdevelopments in modified gravity theories, focusing on higher dimensionalapproaches and chameleon/f(r) theories. we classify these models in terms ofthe screening mechanisms that enable such theories to approach generalrelativity on small scales (and thus satisfy solar system constraints). wedescribe general features of the modified friedman equation in such theories.  the second half of this review describes experimental tests of gravity inlight of the new theoretical approaches. we summarize the high precision testsof gravity on laboratory and solar system scales. we describe in some detailtests on astrophysical scales ranging from ~kpc (galaxy scales) to ~gpc(large-scale structure). these tests rely on the growth and inter-relationshipof perturbations in the metric potentials, density and velocity fields whichcan be measured using gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster abundances, galaxyclustering and the integrated sachs-wolfe effect. a robust way to interpretobservations is by constraining effective parameters, such as the ratio of thetwo metric potentials. currently tests of gravity on astrophysical scales arein the early stages --- we summarize these tests and discuss the interestingprospects for new tests in the coming decade.

0709.2375	observational tests of modified gravity	modified gravity theories have richer observational consequences forlarge-scale structure than conventional dark energy models, in that differentobservables are not described by a single growth factor even in the linearregime. we examine the relationships between perturbations in the metricpotentials, density and velocity fields, and discuss strategies for measuringthem using gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster abundances, galaxyclustering/dynamics and the isw effect. we show how a broad class of gravitytheories can be tested by combining these probes. a robust way to interpretobservations is by constraining two key functions: the ratio of the two metricpotentials, and the ratio of the gravitational ``constant'' in the poissonequation to newton's constant. we also discuss quasilinear effects that carrysignatures of gravity, such as through induced three-point correlations.  clustering of dark energy can mimic features of modified gravity theories andthus confuse the search for distinct signatures of such theories. it canproduce pressure perturbations and anisotropic stresses, which breaks theequality between the two metric potentials even in general relativity. withthese two extra degrees of freedom, can a clustered dark energy model mimicmodified gravity models in all observational tests? we show with specificexamples that observational constraints on both the metric potentials anddensity perturbations can in principle distinguish modifications of gravityfrom dark energy models. we compare our result with other recent studies thathave slightly different assumptions (and apparently contradictory conclusions).

1104.0415	designing surveys for tests of gravity	modified gravity theories may provide an alternative to dark energy toexplain cosmic acceleration. we argue that the observational program developedto test dark energy needs to be augmented to capture new tests of gravity onastrophysical scales. several distinct signatures of gravity theories existoutside the linear regime, especially owing to the screening mechanism thatoperates inside halos like the milky way to ensure that gravity tests in thesolar system are satisfied. this opens up several decades in length scale andnew classes of galaxies at low-redshift that can be exploited by surveys. whiletheoretical work on models of gravity is in the early stages, we can alreadyidentify new regimes which cosmological surveys could target to test gravity.these include: 1. a small scale component that focuses on the interior andvicinity of galaxy and cluster halos. 2. spectroscopy of low redshift galaxies,especially galaxies smaller than the milky way, in environments that range fromvoids to clusters. 3. a program of combining lensing and dynamical information,from imaging and spectroscopic surveys respectively, on the same (orstatistically identical) sample of galaxies.

1106.0065	tests of modified gravity with dwarf galaxies	in modified gravity theories that seek to explain cosmic acceleration, dwarfgalaxies in low density environments can be subject to enhanced forces. theclass of scalar-tensor theories, which includes f(r) gravity, predict such aforce enhancement (massive galaxies like the milky way can evade it through ascreening mechanism that protects the interior of the galaxy from this "fifth"force). we study observable deviations from gr in the disks of late-type dwarfgalaxies moving under gravity. the fifth-force acts on the dark matter and higas disk, but not on the stellar disk owing to the self-screening of mainsequence stars. we find four distinct observable effects in such disk galaxies:1. a displacement of the stellar disk from the hi disk. 2. warping of thestellar disk along the direction of the external force. 3. enhancement of therotation curve measured from the hi gas compared to that of the stellar disk.4. asymmetry in the rotation curve of the stellar disk. we estimate that thespatial effects can be up to 1 kpc and the rotation velocity effects about 10km/s in infalling dwarf galaxies. such deviations are measurable: we expectthat with a careful analysis of a sample of nearby dwarf galaxies one canimprove astrophysical constraints on gravity theories by over three orders ofmagnitude, and even solar system constraints by one order of magnitude. thuseffective tests of gravity along the lines suggested by hui et al (2009) andjain (2011) can be carried out with low-redshift galaxies, though care must beexercised in understanding possible complications from astrophysical effects.

1204.6044	astrophysical tests of modified gravity: constraints from distance  indicators in the nearby universe	we use distance measurements in the nearby universe to carry out new tests ofgravity, surpassing other astrophysical tests by over two orders of magnitudefor chameleon theories. the three nearby distance indicators -- cepheids, tipof the red giant branch (trgb) stars, and water masers -- operate ingravitational fields of widely different strengths. this enables tests ofscalar-tensor gravity theories because they are screened from enhanced forcesto different extents. inferred distances from cepheids and trgb stars arealtered (in opposite directions) over a range of chameleon gravity theoryparameters well below the sensitivity of cosmological probes. using publisheddata we have compared cepheid and trgb distances in a sample of unscreeneddwarf galaxies within 10 mpc. as a control sample we use a comparable set ofscreened galaxies. we find no evidence for the order unity force enhancementsexpected in these theories. using a two-parameter description of the models(the coupling strength and background field value) we obtain constraints onchameleon and symmetron screening scenarios. in particular we show that f(r)models with background field values fr0 above 5e-7 are ruled out at the 95%confidence level. we also compare trgb and maser distances to the galaxy ngc4258 as a second test for larger field values. while there are severalapproximations and caveats in our study, our analysis demonstrates the power ofgravity tests in the local universe. we discuss the prospects for additional,improved tests with future observations.

1204.6046	astrophysical tests of modified gravity: a screening map of the nearby  universe	astrophysical tests of modified modified gravity theories in the nearbyuniverse have been emphasized recently by hui, nicolis and stubbs (2009) andjain and vanderplas (2011). a key element of such tests is the screeningmechanism whereby general relativity is restored in massive halos or highdensity environments like the milky way. in chameleon theories of gravity,including all f(r) models, field dwarf galaxies may be unscreened and thereforefeel an extra force, as opposed to screened galaxies. the first step to studydifferences between screened and unscreened galaxies is to create a 3dscreening map. we use n-body simulations to test and calibrate simpleapproximations to determine the level of screening in galaxy catalogs. sourcesof systematic errors in the screening map due to observational inaccuracies aremodeled and their contamination is estimated. we then apply our methods tocreate a map out to 200 mpc in the sloan digital sky survey footprint usingdata from the sloan survey and other sources. in two companion papers this mapwill be used to carry out new tests of gravity using distance indicators andthe disks of dwarf galaxies. we also make our screening map publicly available.

1206.5320	the impact of camera optical alignments on weak lensing measures for the  dark energy survey	telescope point spread function (psf) quality is critical for realising thepotential of cosmic weak lensing observations to constrain dark energy and testgeneral relativity. in this paper we use quantitative weak gravitationallensing measures to inform the precision of lens optical alignment, withspecific reference to the dark energy survey (des). we compute optics spotdiagrams and calculate the shear and flexion of the psf as a function ofposition on the focal plane. for perfect optical alignment we verify the highquality of the des optical design, finding a maximum psf contribution to theweak lensing shear of 0.04 near the edge of the focal plane. however this canbe increased by a factor of approximately three if the lenses are only justaligned within their maximum specified tolerances. we calculate the e andb-mode shear and flexion variance as a function of de-centre or tilt of eachlens in turn. we find tilt accuracy to be a few times more important thande-centre, depending on the lens considered. finally we consider the compoundeffect of de-centre and tilt of multiple lenses simultaneously, by samplingfrom a plausible range of values of each parameter. we find that the compoundeffect can be around twice as detrimental as when considering any one lensalone. furthermore, this combined effect changes the conclusions about whichlens is most important to align accurately. for des, the tilt of the first twolenses is the most important.

1207.6322	information content of weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum:  including the non-gaussian error covariance matrix	we address the amount of information in the non-gaussian regime of weaklensing surveys by modelling all relevant covariances of the power spectra andbispectra, using 1000 ray-tracing simulation realizations for a lambda-cdmmodel and an analytical halo model. we develop a formalism to describe thecovariance matrices of power spectra and bispectra of all triangleconfigurations. in addition to the known contributions which extend up tosix-point correlation functions, we propose a new contribution `the halo samplevariance (hsv)' arising from the coupling of the lensing fourier modes withlarge-scale mass fluctuations on scales comparable with the survey region viahalo bias theory. we show that the model predictions are in good agreement withthe simulation once we take the hsv into account. the hsv gives a dominantcontribution to the covariance matrices at multipoles l &gt; 10^3, which arisesfrom massive haloes with a mass of &gt; 10^14 solar mass and at relatively lowredshifts z &lt; 0.4. since such haloes are easily identified from a multi-colourimaging survey, the effect can be estimated from the data. by adding thebispectrum to the power spectrum, the total information content or thecumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to a certain maximum multipole of a few10^3 is improved by 20--50 per cent, which is equivalent to a factor of1.4--2.3 larger survey area for the power spectrum measurement alone. however,it is still smaller than the case of a gaussian field by a factor of 3 mostlydue to the hsv. thus bispectrum measurements are useful for cosmology, butusing information from upcoming surveys requires that non-gaussian covariancesare carefully estimated.

1303.0295	astrophysical tests of modified gravity: the morphology and kinematics  of dwarf galaxies	this paper is the third in a series on tests of gravity using observations ofstars and nearby dwarf galaxies. we carry out four distinct tests usingpublished data on the kinematics and morphology of dwarf galaxies, motivated bythe theoretical work of hui et al. (2009) and jain and vanderplas (2011). in awide class of gravity theories a scalar field couples to matter and provides anattractive fifth force. due to their different self-gravity, stars and gas mayrespond differently to the scalar force leading to several observabledeviations from standard gravity. hi gas, red giant stars and main sequencestars can be displaced relative to each other, and the stellar disk can displaywarps or asymmetric rotation curves aligned with external potential gradients.to distinguish the effects of modified gravity from standard astrophysicalphenomena, we use a control sample of galaxies that are expected to be screenedfrom the fifth force. in all cases we find no significant deviation from thenull hypothesis of general relativity. the limits obtained from dwarf galaxiesare not yet competitive with the limits from cepheids obtained in our firstpaper, but can be improved to probe regions of parameter space that areinaccessible using other tests. we discuss how our methodology can be appliedto new radio and optical observations of nearby galaxies.

1309.5385	growth of cosmic structure: probing dark energy beyond expansion	the quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatlyaccelerated in recent years. further leaps forward will be facilitated byimminent projects, which will enable us to map the evolution of dark andbaryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. the way that thesefluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to the nature of dark matterand dark energy. dark energy and gravity both affect how rapidly structuregrows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth ofstructure, while the greater the gravity, the more enhanced the growth. whiledistance measurements also constrain dark energy, the comparison of growth anddistance data tests whether general relativity describes the laws of physicsaccurately on large scales. modified gravity models are able to reproduce thedistance measurements but at the cost of altering the growth of structure(these signatures are described in more detail in the accompanying paper onnovel probes of gravity and dark energy). upcoming surveys will exploit thesedifferences to determine whether the acceleration of the universe is due todark energy or to modified gravity. to realize this potential, both wide fieldimaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. projectsincluding des, eboss, desi, pfs, lsst, euclid, and wfirst are in line to mapmore than a 1000 cubic-billion-light-year volume of the universe. these willmap the cosmic structure growth rate to 1% in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2, overthe last 3/4 of the age of the universe.

1309.5389	novel probes of gravity and dark energy	the discovery of cosmic acceleration has stimulated theorists to considerdark energy or modifications to einstein's general relativity as possibleexplanations. the last decade has seen advances in theories that go beyondsmooth dark energy -- modified gravity and interactions of dark energy. whilethe theoretical terrain is being actively explored, the generic presence offifth forces and dark sector couplings suggests a set of distinct observationalsignatures. this report focuses on observations that differ from theconventional probes that map the expansion history or large-scale structure.examples of such novel probes are: detection of scalar fields via labexperiments, tests of modified gravity using stars and galaxies in the nearbyuniverse, comparison of lensing and dynamical masses of galaxies and clusters,and the measurements of fundamental constants at high redshift. theobservational expertise involved is very broad as it spans laboratoryexperiments, high resolution astronomical imaging and spectroscopy and radioobservations. in the coming decade, searches for these effects have thepotential for discovering fundamental new physics. we discuss how the searchescan be carried out using experiments that are already under way or with modestadaptations of existing telescopes or planned experiments. the accompanyingpaper on the growth of cosmic structure describes complementary tests ofgravity with observations of large-scale structure.

1407.0059	beyond the cosmological standard model	after a decade and a half of research motivated by the accelerating universe,theory and experiment have a reached a certain level of maturity. thedevelopment of theoretical models beyond \lambda, or smooth dark energy, oftencalled modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and ahost of observational and experimental tests have been developed. in thisreview we present the current state of the field and describe a framework foranticipating developments in the next decade. we identify the guidingprinciples for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, anddiscuss the prospects for empirical tests. we begin by reviewing attempts toconsistently modify einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notionthat additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must screenthemselves from local tests of gravity. we categorize screening mechanisms intothree broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of highnewtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, andthose for which second derivatives are important. examples of the first class,such as f(r) gravity, employ the familiar chameleon or symmetron mechanisms,whereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive gravity theories,employing the vainshtein mechanism. in each case, we describe the theories aseffective theories. we describe experimental tests, summarizing laboratory andsolar system tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmologicaltests. we discuss future tests which will be sensitive to different signaturesof new physics in the gravitational sector. parts that are more relevant totheorists vs. observers/experimentalists are clearly indicated, in the hopethat this will serve as a useful reference for both audiences, as well ashelping those interested in bridging the gap between them.

1408.4742	cosmic discordance: are planck cmb and cfhtlens weak lensing  measurements out of tune?	we examine the level of agreement between low redshift weak lensing data andthe cmb using measurements from the cfhtlens and planck+wmap polarization. weperform an independent analysis of the cfhtlens six bin tomography results ofheymans et al. (2013). we extend their systematics treatment and find thecosmological constraints to be relatively robust to the choice of non-linearmodeling, extension to the intrinsic alignment model and inclusion of baryons.we find that the 90% confidence contours of cfhtlens and planck+wp do notoverlap even in the full 6-dimensional parameter space of $\lambda$cdm, so thetwo datasets are discrepant. allowing a massive active neutrino or tensor modesdoes not significantly resolve the disagreement in the full n-dimensionalparameter space. our results differ from some in the literature because we usethe full tomographic information in the weak lensing data and marginalize oversystematics. we note that adding a sterile neutrino to $\lambda$cdm does bringthe 8-dimensional 64% contours to overlap, mainly due to the extra effectivenumber of neutrino species, which we find to be 0.84 $\pm$ 0.35 (68%) greaterthan standard on combining the datasets. we discuss why this is not acompletely satisfactory resolution, leaving open the possibility of other newphysics or observational systematics as contributing factors. we provideupdated cosmology fitting functions for the cfhtlens constraints and discussthe differences from ones used in the literature.

astro-ph;0006319	how many galaxies fit in a halo? constraints on galaxy formation  efficiency from spatial clustering	we study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clusteringis described in terms of dark matter halos. at small scales, clusteringstatistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory withhalo biasing. galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, andgalaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function ofhalo mass. this approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy powerspectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, andthe galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scalesthan their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. we findthat requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the apmgalaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. the data atlarge scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at smallmasses, m =10^10 msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the numberof galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-masslimit. these constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosityfunction or tully-fisher relation. we also predict the power spectrum,bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. although halomodels agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higherorder sp parameters in n-body simulations, the model assumption that halos arespherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of thebispectrum at small scales. we stress the importance of finite volume effectsin higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0205055	the kurtosis of the cosmic shear field	we study the fourth-order moment of the cosmic shear field using the darkmatter halo approach to describe the nonlinear gravitational evolution ofstructure in the universe. since the third-order moment of the shear fieldvanishes because of symmetry, non-gaussian signatures in its one-pointstatistics emerge at the fourth-order level. we argue that the shear kurtosisparameter s_4 = &lt;gamma^4&gt;/&lt;gamma^2&gt;^3 may be more directly applicable torealistic data than the well-studied higher-order statistics of the convergencefield, since obtaining the convergence requires a non-local reconstruction fromthe measured shear field.  we compare our halo model predictions for the variance, skewness and kurtosisof lensing fields with ray-tracing simulations of cold dark matter models andfind good agreement. the shear kurtosis calculation is made tractable bydeveloping approximations for fast and accurate evaluations of the8-dimensional integrals needed to obtain the kurtosis. we show that on smallscales it is dominated by correlations within halos more massive than 10^14solar masses. the shear kurtosis is sensitive to the mass density parameter ofthe universe, omega, and has relatively weak dependences on other parameters.the approximations we develop for the third- and fourth-order moments allow foraccurate halo model predictions for the 3-dimensional mass distribution aswell. we demonstrate their accuracy in the small scale regime, below 2 mpc,where analytical approaches used in the literature so far cease to be accurate.

astro-ph;0208515	magnification effects as measures of large-scale structure	the magnification effects of clustered matter produce variations in the imagesizes and number density of galaxies across the sky. this paper advocates theuse of these effects in wide field surveys to map large-scale structure and theprofiles of galaxy and cluster sized halos. the magnitude of the size variationas a function of angular scale is computed and the signal-to-noise is estimatedfor different survey parameters. forthcoming surveys, especially well designedspace-based imaging surveys, will have high signal-to-noise on scales of about0.1 arcminute to several degrees. thus the clustering of matter could bemeasured on spatial scales of about 50 kpc to 100 mpc. the signal-to-noise isdominated by sample variance rather than shot-noise due to the finite numberdensity of galaxies, hence the accuracy of the measurements will be limitedprimarily by survey area, sampling strategy and possible systematics. methodsbased on magnification are compared with the use of shape distortions and thecontrasts and complementarities are discussed. future work needed to plansurvey strategy and interpret measurements based on magnification is outlined.

astro-ph;0209167	the three-point correlation function in cosmology	with the advent of high-quality surveys in cosmology the full three-pointcorrelation function will be a valuable statistic for describing structureformation models. it contains information on cosmological parameters anddetailed halo properties that cannot be extracted from the two-pointcorrelation function. we use the halo clustering model to analyticallycalculate the three-point correlation function (3pcf) for general cosmologicalfields. we present detailed results for the configuration dependence of the3-dimensional mass and galaxy distributions and the 2-dimensional cosmic shearfield. we work in real space, where higher order correlation functions on smallscales are easier to measure and interpret, but halo model calculations getrapidly intractable. hence we develop techniques for accurate evaluations ofthe 1, 2 and 3-halo contributions to the 3pcf.  the 3pcf violates the hierarchical ansatz in both its scale and configurationdependence. we study the behavior of the coefficient q in the hierarchicalexpansion from large, quasilinear scales down to about 20 kpc. we find that thenonlinear 3pcf is sensitive to the halo profile of massive halos, especiallyits inner slope. we model the distribution of galaxies in halos and show thatthe 3pcf of red galaxies has a weaker configuration and scale dependence thanthe mass, while for blue galaxies it is very sensitive to the parameters of thegalaxy formation model. the 3pcf from weak lensing on the other hand showsdifferent scalings due to projection effects and a sensitivity to cosmologicalparameters.

astro-ph;0210261	the three-point correlation function for spin-2 fields	the three-point correlation function (3pcf) of the spin-2 fields, the cosmicshear and cosmic microwave background polarization fields, is a statisticalmeasure of non-gaussian signals. at each vertex of a triangle, the shear fieldhas two independent components. the resulting eight possible 3pcfs wererecently investigated by schneider &amp; lombardi (2002) and zaldarriaga &amp;scoccimarro (2002). using rotation and parity transformations they addressedthe question: how many non-zero components for the shear 3pcf exist? we addressthis question using an analytical model and measurements from ray-tracingsimulations. we show that all the eight 3pcfs are generally non-zero and havecomparable amplitude. these eight 3pcfs can be used to improve thesignal-to-noise from survey data and their configuration dependence can be usedto separate the contribution from e and b-modes. we estimate thesignal-to-noise for measuring the shear 3pcf from weak lensing surveys usingsimulated maps that include the noise due to intrinsic ellipticities. a deeplensing survey with area exceeding 10 square degrees would allow for thedetection of the shear 3pcfs, but a survey area of order 100 square degrees isneeded for accurate measurements.

astro-ph;0212417	the last stand before map: cosmological parameters from lensing, cmb and  galaxy clustering	cosmic shear measurements have now improved to the point where they deserveto be treated on par with cmb and galaxy clustering data for cosmologicalparameter analysis, using the full measured aperture mass variance curve ratherthan a mere phenomenological parametrization thereof. we perform a detailed9-parameter analysis of recent lensing (rcs), cmb (up to archeops) and galaxyclustering (2df) data, both separately and jointly. cmb and 2df data areconsistent with a simple flat adiabatic scale-invariant model withomega_lambda=0.72+/-0.09, omega_cdm=0.115+/- 0.013, omega_b=0.024+/-0.003, anda hint of reionization around z~8. lensing helps further tighten theseconstraints, but reveals tension regarding the power spectrum normalization:including the rcs survey results raises sigma8 significantly and forces otherparameters to uncomfortable values. indeed, sigma8 is emerging as the currentlymost controversial cosmological parameter, and we discuss possible resolutionsof this sigma8 problem. we also comment on the disturbing fact that many recentanalyses (including this one) obtain error bars smaller than the fisher matrixbound. we produce a cmb power spectrum combining all existing experiments, andusing it for a "map versus world" comparison next month will provide a powerfultest of how realistic the error estimates have been in the cosmology community.

astro-ph;0304034	three-point correlations in weak lensing surveys: model predictions and  applications	we use the halo model of clustering to compute two- and three-pointcorrelation functions for weak lensing, and apply them in a new statisticaltechnique to measure properties of massive halos. we present analytical resultson the eight shear three-point correlation functions constructed usingcombination of the two shear components at each vertex of a triangle. wecompare the amplitude and configuration dependence of the functions withray-tracing simulations and find excellent agreement for different scales andmodels. these results are promising, since shear statistics are easier tomeasure than the convergence. in addition, the symmetry properties of the shearthree-point functions provide a new and precise way of disentangling thelensing e-mode from the b-mode due to possible systematic errors.  we develop an approach based on correlation functions to measure theproperties of galaxy-group and cluster halos from lensing surveys. shearcorrelations on small scales arise from the lensing matter within halos of massm &gt; 10^13 solar masses. thus the measurement of two- and three-pointcorrelations can be used to extract information on halo density profiles,primarily the inner slope and halo concentration. we demonstrate thefeasibility of such an analysis for forthcoming surveys. we include covariancesin the correlation functions due to sample variance and intrinsic ellipticitynoise to show that 10% accuracy on profile parameters is achievable withsurveys like the cfht legacy survey, and significantly better with futuresurveys. our statistical approach is complementary to the standard approach ofidentifying individual objects in survey data and measuring their properties.

astro-ph;0304203	quasar-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy cross-correlations: model predictions  with realistic galaxies	several measurements of qso-galaxy correlations have reported signals muchlarger than predictions of magnification by large-scale structure. we find thatthe expected signal depends stronly on the properties of the foreground galaxypopulation. on arcminute scales it can be either larger or smaller by a factorof two for different galaxy types in comparison with a linearly biased versionof the mass distribution. thus the resolution of some of the excessmeasurements may lie in examining the halo occupation properties of the galaxypopulation sampled by a given survey; this is also the primary information suchmeasurements will provide.  we use the halo model of clustering and simulations to predict themagnification induced cross-correlations and errors for forthcoming surveys.with the full sloan digital sky survey the statistical errors will be below 1percent for the galaxy-galaxy correlations and significantly larger forqso-galaxy correlations. thus accurate constraints on parameters of the galaxyhalo occupation distribution can be obtained from small scale measurements andon the bias parameter from large scales. since the lensing inducedcross-correlation measures the first moment of the halo occupation number ofgalaxies, these measurements can provide the basis for interpreting galaxyclustering measurements which measure the second and higher order moments.

astro-ph;0306046	cross-correlation tomography: measuring dark energy evolution with weak  lensing	a cross-correlation technique of lensing tomography is presented to measurethe evolution of dark energy in the universe. the variation of the weak lensingshear with redshift around massive foreground objects like bright galaxies andclusters depends solely on ratios of angular diameter distances. use of themassive foreground halos allow us to compare relatively high, linear shearvalues in the same part of the sky, thus largely eliminating the dominantsource of systematic error in cosmological weak lensing measurements. thestatistic we use does not rely on knowledge of the foreground mass distributionand is only shot-noise limited. we estimate the constraints that deep lensingsurveys with photometric redshifts can provide on the dark energy densityomega, the equation of state parameter w and its redshift derivative w'. theaccuracies on w and w' are: sigma(w) ~ 0.02 fsky^{-1/2} and sigma(w') ~ 0.05fsky^{-1/2}, where fsky is the fraction of sky covered by the survey andsigma(omega)=0.03 is assumed in the marginalization. combining ourcross-correlation method with standard lensing tomography, which hascomplementary degeneracies, will allow measurement of the dark energyparameters with significantly better accuracy.

astro-ph;0310125	cosmological parameters from lensing power spectrum and bispectrum  tomography	we examine how lensing tomography with the bispectrum and power spectrum canconstrain cosmological parameters and the equation of state of dark energy. ouranalysis uses the full information at the two- and three-point level fromangular scales of a few degrees to 5 arcminutes (50 &lt; l &lt; 3000), which will beprobed by lensing surveys. we use all triangle configurations, cross-powerspectra and bispectra constructed from up to three redshift bins withphotometric redshifts, and relevant covariances in our analysis.  we find that the parameter constraints from bispectrum tomography arecomparable to those from power spectrum tomography. combining the two improvesparameter accuracies by a factor of three due to their complementarity. for thedark energy parameterization w(a) = w0 + wa(1-a), the marginalized errors fromlensing alone are sigma(w0) = 0.03 fsky^{-1/2} and sigma(wa) = 0.1 fsky^{-1/2}.we show that these constraints can be further improved when combined withmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background or type ia supernovae. theamplitude and shape of the mass power spectrum are also shown to be preciselyconstrained. we use hyper-extended perturbation theory to compute the nonlinearlensing bispectrum for dark energy models. accurate model predictions of thebispectrum in the moderately nonlinear regime, calibrated with numericalsimulations, will be needed to realize the parameter accuracy we haveestimated. finally, we estimate how well the lensing bispectrum can constrain amodel with primordial non-gaussianity.

astro-ph;0312395	joint galaxy-lensing observables and the dark energy	deep multi-color galaxy surveys with photometric redshifts will provide alarge number of two-point correlation observables: galaxy-galaxy angularcorrelations, galaxy-shear cross correlations, and shear-shear correlationsbetween all redshifts. these observables can potentially enable a jointdetermination of the dark energy dependent evolution of the dark matter anddistances as well as the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos.with recent cmb determinations of the initial power spectrum, a measurement ofthe mass clustering at even a_single_ redshift will constrain a well-specifiedcombination of dark energy parameters in a flat universe; we provide convenientfitting formulae for such studies. the combination of galaxy-shear andgalaxy-galaxy correlations can determine this amplitude at_multiple_ redshifts.we illustrate this ability in a description of the galaxy clustering with 5free functions of redshift which can be fitted from the data. the galaxymodeling is based on a mapping onto halos of the same abundance that models aflux-limited selection. in this context, a 4000 deg2 galaxy-lensing survey canachieve a_statistical_ precision of sigma(omega_de)=0.005 for the dark energydensity, sigma(w_de)=0.02 and sigma(w_a)=0.17 for its equation of state andevolution, evaluated at dark energy matter equality z~0.4, as well asconstraints on the 5 halo functions out to z=1. more importantly, a jointanalysis can make dark energy constraints robust against systematic errors inthe shear-shear correlation and halo modeling.

astro-ph;0409030	constraints on dark energy models from galaxy clusters with multiple  arcs	we make an exploratory study of how well dark energy models can beconstrained using lensed arcs at different redshifts behind cluster lenses.arcs trace the critical curves of clusters, and the growth of critical curveswith source redshift is sensitive to the dark-energy equation of state. usinganalytical models and numerically simulated clusters, we explore the keyfactors involved in using cluster arcs as a probe of dark energy. we quantifythe sensitivity to lens mass, concentration and ellipticity with analyticalmodels that include the effects of dark energy on halo structure. we show withsimple examples how degeneracies between mass models and cosmography may bebroken using arcs at multiple redshifts or additional constraints on the lensdensity profile. however we conclude that the requirements on the data are sostringent that it is very unlikely that robust constraints can be obtained fromindividual clusters. we argue that surveys of clusters, analyzed in conjunctionwith numerical simulations, are a more promising prospect for arc-cosmography.  we use such numerically simulated clusters to estimate how large a sample ofclusters/arcs could provide interesting constraints on dark energy models. wefocus on the scatter produced by differences in the mass distribution ofindividual clusters. we find from our sample of simulated clusters that atleast 1000 pairs of arcs are needed to obtain constraints if the massdistribution of individual clusters is taken to be undetermined. we discussseveral unsolved problems that need study to fully develop this method forprecision studies with future surveys.

astro-ph;0412234	principal component analysis of psf variation in weak lensing surveys	we introduce a new algorithm for interpolating measurements of thepoint-spread function (psf) using stars from many exposures. the principalcomponents of the variation in the psf pattern from multiple exposures are usedto solve for better fits for each individual exposure. these improved fits arethen used to correct the weak lensing shapes. since we expect some degree ofcorrelation in the psf anisotropy across exposures, using information fromstars in all exposures leads to a significant gain in the accuracy of theestimated psf. it means that in general, the accuracy of psf reconstruction islimited not by the number density of stars per exposure, but by the stackednumber density across all exposures in a given survey. this technique isapplied to the 75 square degree ctio lensing survey, and we find that the psfvariation is well described by a small number of components. there is asignificant improvement in the lensing measurements: the residual stellar psfcorrelations are reduced by several orders of magnitude, and the measuredb-mode in the two-point correlation is consistent with zero down to 1arcminute. we also discuss the applications of the pca technique to futuresurveys.

astro-ph;0504510	detection of cosmic magnification with the sloan digital sky survey	we present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by thevariation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground largescale structure. to make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees ofphotometric observations from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containing\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. our measurement of the galaxy-quasarcross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence andchange in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number countsthat is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. weshow that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, galactic dustextinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are wellcontrolled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. by weighting thequasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation ofquasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at &gt;4 sigmain all five sdss filters. our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scalesranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoreticalpredictions based on the wmap concordance cosmology. as with galaxy-galaxylensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide usefulconstraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.

astro-ph;0510231	psf anisotropy and systematic errors in weak lensing surveys	given the basic parameters of a cosmic shear weak lensing survey, how wellcan systematic errors due to anisotropy in the point spread function (psf) becorrected? the largest source of error in this correction to date has been theinterpolation of the psf to the locations of the galaxies. to address thiserror, we separate the psf patterns into components that recur in multipleexposures/pointings and those that vary randomly between different exposures(such as those due to the atmosphere). in an earlier study we developed aprincipal component approach to correct the recurring psf patterns (jarvis andjain 2004). in this paper we show how randomly varying psf patterns can also becircumvented in the measurement of shear correlations. for the two-pointcorrelation function this is done by simply using pairs of galaxy shapesmeasured in different exposures. combining the two techniques allows us totackle generic combinations of psf anisotropy patterns. the second goal of thispaper is to give a formalism for quantifying residual systematic errors due topsf patterns. we show how the main psf corrections improve with increasingsurvey area (and thus can stay below the reduced statistical errors), and weidentify the residual errors which do not scale with survey area. our formalismcan be applied both to planned lensing surveys to optimize instrumental andsurvey parameters and to actual lensing data to quantify residual errors.

astro-ph;0604038	n-body simulations of alternate gravity models	theories in which gravity is weaker on cosmological scales have been proposedto explain the observed acceleration of the universe. the nonlinear regime insuch theories is not well studied, though it is likely that observational testsof structure formation will lie in this regime. a class of alternate gravitytheories may be approximated by modifying poisson's equation. we have runn-body simulations of a set of such models to study the nonlinear clustering ofmatter on 1-100 mpc scales. we find that nonlinear gravity enhances thedeviations of the power spectrum of these models from standard gravity. thisoccurs due to mode-coupling, so that models with an excess or deficit oflarge-scale power (at k &lt; 0.2/mpc) lead to deviations in the power spectrum atsmaller scales as well (up to k ~ 1/mpc), even though the linear spectra matchvery closely on the smaller scales. this makes it easier to distinguish suchmodels from general relativity using the three-dimensional power spectrumprobed by galaxy surveys and the weak lensing power spectrum. if the potentialfor light deflection is modified in the same way as the potential that affectsthe dark matter, then weak lensing constrains deviations from gravity even morestrongly. our simulations show that even with a modified potential,gravitational evolution is approximately universal. based on this, thepeacock-dodds approach can be adapted to get an analytical fit for thenonlinear power spectra of alternate gravity models, though the recent smith etal formula is less successful. our conclusions extend to models withmodifications of gravity on scales of 1-20 mpc. we also use a way of measuringprojected power spectra from simulations that lowers the sample variance, sothat fewer realizations are needed to reach a desired level of accuracy.

astro-ph;9307033	gravitational instability of cold matter	we solve the nonlinear evolution of pressureless, irrotational densityfluctuations in a perturbed robertson-walker spacetime using a new lagrangianmethod based on the velocity gradient and gravity gradient tensors. borrowingresults from general relativity, we obtain a set of newtonian ordinarydifferential equations for these quantities following a given mass element.using these lagrangian fluid equations we prove the following results: (1) thespherical tophat perturbation, having zero shear, is the slowest configurationto collapse for a given initial density and growth rate. (2) initial densitymaxima are not generally the sites where collapse first occurs. (3) initiallyunderdense regions may undergo collapse if the shear is not too small. if themagnetic part of the weyl tensor vanishes, the nonlinear evolution is describedpurely locally by our equations; this condition holds for spherical,cylindrical, and planar perturbations and may be a good approximation in othercircumstances. assuming the vanishing of the magnetic part of the weyl tensor,we compute the exact nonlinear gravitational evolution of cold matter. we findthat 56\% of initially underdense regions collapse in an einstein-de sitteruniverse for a homogeneous and isotropic random field. we also show that, giventhis assumption, the final stage of collapse is generically two-dimensional,leading to strongly prolate filaments rather than zel'dovich pancakes. whilethis result may explain the prevalence of filamentary collapses in n-bodysimulations, it is not true in general, suggesting that the magnetic part ofthe weyl tensor need not vanish in the newtonian limit.

astro-ph;9309040	nonlinear effects due to the coupling of long-wave modes	the cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinear modecoupling of density fluctuations. we find that for realistic cosmologicalspectra there is a significant contribution to the nonlinear evolution onscales of interest to large-scale structure from the long-wave part of theinitial spectrum. a consequence of this mode coupling is that at high redshift,$z$, the nonlinear scale [defined by $\sigma(z)=1$] can be significantly largerthan a linear extrapolation would indicate. for the standard cdm spectrum witha $\sigma_8=1$ normalization the mass corresponding to the nonlinear scale at$z=20, 10, 5$ is about $100, 10, 3$ times (respectively) larger than thelinearly extrapolated value. we also investigate the possibility of divergentcontributions to the density field from long-wave modes if the spectral indexof the power spectrum $\ n&lt;-1$. using an approximate non-perturbative approachwe find that for $n&gt;-3\,$ the divergent contribution appears only in the phase.this can be related to the large-scale bulk velocity, and clarifies previousresults from n-body simulations.

astro-ph;9311070	second order power spectrum and nonlinear evolution at high redshift	the eulerian cosmological fluid equations are used to study the nonlinearmode coupling of density fluctuations. we evaluate the second-order powerspectrum including all four-point contributions. in the weakly nonlinear regimewe find that the dominant nonlinear contribution for realistic cosmologicalspectra is made by the coupling of long-wave modes and is well estimated bysecond order perturbation theory. for a linear spectrum like that of the colddark matter model, second order effects cause a significant enhancement of thehigh $k$ part of the spectrum and a slight suppression at low $k$ near the peakof the spectrum. our perturbative results agree well in the quasilinear regimewith the nonlinear spectrum from high-resolution n-body simulations.  we find that due to the long-wave mode coupling, characteristic nonlinearmasses grow less slowly in time (i.e., are larger at higher redshifts) thanwould be estimated using the linear power spectrum. for the cold dark mattermodel at $(1+z)=(20,10,5,2)$ the nonlinear mass is about $(180,8,2.5,1.6)$times (respectively) larger than a linear extrapolation would indicate, if thecondition rms $\delta\rho/\rho =1$ is used to define the nonlinear scale. athigh redshift the press-schechter mass distribution significantlyunderestimates the abundance of high-mass objects for the cold dark mattermodel. although the quantitative results depend on the definition of thenonlinear scale, these basic consequences hold for any initial spectrum whosepost-recombination spectral index $n$ decreases sufficiently rapidly withincreasing $k$, a feature which arises quite generally during the transitionfrom a radiation- to matter-dominated universe.

astro-ph;9509033	aspects of scaling in gravitational clustering	the scaling ansatz of hamilton et al. effectively extends the idea ofself-similar scaling to initial power spectra of any generic shape.applications of this ansatz have provided a semi-empirical analyticaldescription of gravitational clustering which is extremely useful. thiscontribution examines the two theoretical ingredients that form the basis ofthese applications: self-similar evolution and the stable clusteringhypothesis. a brief summary of work verifying self-similar scaling for scalefree spectra $p(k) \propto k^n$, with $n &lt; -1$ is given. the main resultspresented here examine the hypothesis that clustering is statistically stablein time on small scales, or equivalently that the mean pair velocity inphysical coordinates is zero. the mean pair velocity of particles can becomputed accurately from n-body simulations via the pair conservation equation,by using the evolution of the autocorrelation function $\xi(x,t)$. the resultsthus obtained for scale free spectra with $n = 0, -1, -2$ and for the cdmspectrum are consistent with the stable clustering prediction on the smallestresolved scales, on which the amplitude of $\xi \gsim 200-1000$ for $n = -2$and $n = 0$, respectively.

astro-ph;9602103	the non-linear correlation function and the shapes of virialized halos	the correlation function xi(r) of matter in the non-linear regime is assumedto be determined by the density profiles rho(r) and the mass distribution n(m)of virialized halos. the press--schechter approach is used to compute n(m), andthe stable clustering hypothesis is used to determine the density profiles ofthese press--schechter halos. thus, the shape and amplitude of xi(r) on smallscales is related to the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations.  the case of clustering from scale-free initial conditions is treated indetail. if n is the slope of the initial power spectrum of densityfluctuations, then stable clustering requires that xi(r)\propto r^{-gamma},where gamma is a known function of n. if halo--halo correlations can beneglected, then rho(r)\propto r^{-epsilon}, where epsilon = (gamma+3)/2 =3(4+n)/(5+n). for all values of n of current interest, this slope is steeperthan the value 3(3+n)/(4+n) that was obtained by hoffman &amp; shaham in theirtreatment of the shapes of the outer regions of collapsed halos. our mainresult is a prediction for the amplitude of the non-linear correlationfunction. the predicted amplitude and its dependence on n are in goodquantitative agreement with n-body simulations of self-similar clustering.  if stable clustering is a good approximation only inside the half-mass radiiof press--schechter halos, then the density contrast required for the onset ofstable clustering can be estimated. this density contrast is in the range~300-600 and increases with the initial slope n, in agreement with estimatesfrom n-body simulations.

astro-ph;9605192	does gravitational clustering stabilize on small scales?	the stable clustering hypothesis is a key analytical anchor on the nonlineardynamics of gravitational clustering in cosmology. it states that onsufficiently small scales the mean pair velocity approaches zero, orequivalently, that the mean number of neighbours of a particle remains constantin time at a given physical separation. in this paper we use n-body simulationsof scale free spectra p(k) \propto k^n with -2 \leq n \leq 0 and of the cdmspectrum to test for stable clustering using the time evolution and shape ofthe correlation function \xi(x,t), and the mean pair velocity on small scales.for all spectra the results are consistent with the stable clusteringpredictions on the smallest scales probed, x &lt; 0.07 x_{nl}(t), where x_{nl}(t)is the correlation length. the measured stable clustering regime corresponds toa typical range of 200 \lsim \xi \lsim 2000, though spectra with more smallscale power approach the stable clustering asymptote at larger values of \xi.  we test the amplitude of \xi predicted by the analytical model of sheth \&amp;jain (1996), and find agreement to within 20\% in the stable clustering regimefor nearly all spectra. for the cdm spectrum the nonlinear \xi is accuratelyapproximated by this model with n \simeq -2 on physical scales \lsim 100-300h^{-1} kpc for \sigma_8 = 0.5-1, and on smaller scales at earlier times. thegrowth of \xi for cdm-like models is discussed in the context of a power lawparameterization often used to describe galaxy clustering at high redshifts.the growth parameter \epsilon is computed as a function of time and lengthscale, and found to be larger than 1 in the moderately nonlinear regime -- thusthe growth of \xi is much faster on scales of interest than is commonlyassumed.

astro-ph;9611077	cosmological model predictions for weak lensing: linear and nonlinear  regimes	weak lensing by large scale structure induces correlated ellipticities in theimages of distant galaxies. the two-point correlation is determined by thematter power spectrum along the line of sight. we use the fully nonlinearevolution of the power spectrum to compute the predicted ellipticitycorrelation. we present results for different measures of the second moment forangular scales \theta \simeq 1'-3 degrees and for alternative normalizations ofthe power spectrum, in order to explore the best strategy for constraining thecosmological parameters. normalizing to observed cluster abundance the rmsamplitude of ellipticity within a 15' radius is \simeq 0.01 z_s^{0.6}, almostindependent of the cosmological model, with z_s being the median redshift ofbackground galaxies.  nonlinear effects in the evolution of the power spectrum significantlyenhance the ellipticity for \theta &lt; 10' -- on 1' the rms ellipticity is \simeq0.05, which is nearly twice the linear prediction. this enhancement means thatthe signal to noise for the ellipticity is only weakly increasing with anglefor 2'&lt; \theta &lt; 2 degrees, unlike the expectation from linear theory that itis strongly peaked on degree scales. the scaling with cosmological parametersalso changes due to nonlinear effects. by measuring the correlations on small(nonlinear) and large (linear) angular scales, different cosmologicalparameters can be independently constrained to obtain a model independentestimate of both power spectrum amplitude and matter density \omega_m.nonlinear effects also modify the probability distribution of the ellipticity.using second order perturbation theory we find that over most of the range ofinterest there are significant deviations from a normal distribution.

astro-ph;9708143	a new measure for cosmic shear	we consider here a new statistical measure for cosmic shear, the aperturemass map, which is defined as a spatially filtered projected density field andwhich can be measured directly from the image distortions of high-redshiftgalaxies. by selecting an appropriate spatial filter function, the dispersionof the aperture mass is a convolution of the power spectrum of the projecteddensity field with a narrow kernel, so that &lt;map**2(theta)&gt; provides a welllocalized estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers s~5/theta. we calculate&lt;map**2(theta)&gt; for various cosmological models, using the fully non-linearpower spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. the non-linear evolutionyields a significant increase of &lt;map**2&gt; relative to the linear growth onscales below ~0.5 degree. the third-order moment of map can be used to define askewness, which is a measure of the non-gaussianity of the density field. wepresent the first calculation of the skewness of the shear in the frame ofquasi-linear theory of structure growth. we show that it yields a sensitivemeasure of the cosmological model; in particular, it is independent of thenormalization of the power spectrum. several practical estimates for &lt;map**2&gt;are constructed and their dispersions calculated. we show that one sq.deg. of ahigh-quality image is sufficient to detect the cosmic shear with themap-statistics on scales below ~10 arcmin, and to estimate its amplitude withan accuracy of ~30% on scales below ~5 arcmin.

astro-ph;9709159	angular cross-correlation of galaxies: a probe of gravitational lensing  by large-scale structure	the angular cross-correlation between two galaxy samples separated inredshift is shown to be a useful measure of weak lensing by large-scalestructure. angular correlations in faint galaxies arise due to spatialclustering of the galaxies as well as gravitational lensing by dark matteralong the line-of-sight. the lensing contribution to the 2-pointauto-correlation function is typically small compared to the gravitationalclustering. however the cross-correlation between two galaxy samples is nearlyunaffected by gravitational clustering provided their redshift distributions donot overlap. the cross-correlation is then induced by magnification bias due tolensing by large-scale structure. we compute the expected amplitude of thecross-correlation for popular theoretical models of structure formation. fortwo populations with mean redshifts of $\simeq 0.3$ and 1, we find across-correlation signal of $\simeq 1%$ on arcminute scales and $\simeq 3%$ ona few arcseconds. the dependence on the cosmological parameters $\omega$ and$\lambda$, on the dark matter power spectrum and on the bias factor of theforeground galaxy population is explored.

astro-ph;9803117	how universal are the density profiles of dark halos?	we investigate the formation of virialized halos due to the gravitationalcollapse of collisionless matter using high-resolution n-body simulations. avariety of formation scenarios are studied, ranging from hierarchicalclustering to monolithic radial collapse. the goal of these experiments was tostudy departures from the universal density profiles recently found to arise incosmological settings. however, we found that even for models which exhibitquite a different formation history, the density and velocity dispersionprofiles of the virialized halos are strikingly similar.  power law density profiles do not result even in models with initial powerlaw profiles and no initial substructure or non-radial motions. such initialconditions give rise to a radial orbit instability which leads to curvedvelocity dispersion and density profiles. the shapes of the density profiles inall our models are well parameterized by the profiles of halos formed in ageneric cosmological setting. our results show that the universality of darkhalo density profiles does not depend crucially on hierarchical merging as hasbeen suggested recently in the literature. rather it arises because apparentlydifferent collapse histories produces a near universal angular momentumdistribution among the halo particles. we conclude that the density andvelocity dispersion profiles of virialized halos in an expanding universe arerobust outcomes of gravitational collapse, nearly independent of the initialconditions and the formation history.

astro-ph;9804238	numerical investigations of weak lensing by large-scale structure	we use numerical simulations of ray tracing through n-body simulations toinvestigate weak lensing by large-scale structure. these are needed for testingthe analytic predictions of two-point correlators, to set error estimates onthem and to investigate nonlinear gravitational effects in the weak lensingmaps. on scales larger than 1 degree gaussian statistics suffice and can beused to estimate the sampling, noise and aliasing errors on the measured powerspectrum. for this case we describe a minimum variance inversion procedure fromthe 2-d to 3-d power spectrum and discuss a sparse sampling strategy whichoptimizes the signal to noise on the power spectrum. on degree scales andsmaller the shear and convergence statistics lie in the nonlinear regime andhave a non-gaussian distribution. for this regime ray tracing simulations areuseful to provide reliable error estimates and calibration of the measurements.we show how the skewness and kurtosis can in principle be used to probe themean density in the universe, but are sensitive to sampling errors and requirelarge observed areas. the probability distribution function is likely to bemore useful as a tool to investigate nonlinear effects. in particular, it showsstriking differences between models with different values of the mean density$\omega_m$.

astro-ph;9808314	self-similar evolution of gravitational clustering: n-body simulations  of the n=-2 spectrum	the power spectrum p(k)\propto k^n with n=-2 is close to the shape of themeasured galaxy spectrum on small scales. unfortunately this spectrum hasproven rather difficult to simulate. further, 2-dimensional simulations havesuggested a breakdown of self-similar scaling for spectra with n&lt;-1 due todivergent contributions from the coupling of long wave modes. this paper is thesecond (numerical) part of our investigation into the nonlinear gravitationalclustering of scale-free spectra. using high-resolution n-body simulations wefind that the n=-2 power spectrum, as well as trajectories of the amplitude andphase of fourier modes, display self-similar scaling. the evolution of thephase shift does show a different scaling at late times, but this was shownanalytically to arise from the purely kinematical effect of bulk flows. thusour analytical and n-body results verify that self-similarity in gravitationalclustering holds for -3&lt;n&lt;1. the n-body spectrum is also compared with analyticfitting formulae, which are found to slightly underestimate the power in thenonlinear regime. the asymptotic shape of the spectrum at high-k is a power lawwith the same slope as predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis.

astro-ph;9901191	ray tracing simulations of weak lensing by large-scale structure	we investigate weak lensing by large-scale structure using ray tracingthrough n-body simulations. photon trajectories are followed through highresolution simulations of structure formation to make simulated maps of shearand convergence on the sky. tests with varying numerical parameters are used tocalibrate the accuracy of computed lensing statistics on angular scales fromabout 1 arcminute to a few degrees. various aspects of the weak lensingapproximation are also tested. for fields a few degrees on a side the shearpower spectrum is almost entirely in the nonlinear regime and agrees well withnonlinear analytical predictions. sampling fluctuations in power spectrumestimates are investigated by comparing several ray tracing realizations of agiven model. for survey areas smaller than a degree on a side the main sourceof scatter is nonlinear coupling to modes larger than the survey. we develop amethod which uses this effect to estimate the mass density parameter omega fromthe scatter in power spectrum estimates for subregions of a larger survey. weshow that the power spectrum can be measured accurately from realisticallynoisy data on scales corresponding to 1-10 mpc/h. non-gaussian features in theone point distribution function of the weak lensing convergence (reconstructedfrom the shear) are also sensitive to omega. we suggest several techniques forestimating omega in the presence of noise and compare their statistical power,robustness and simplicity. with realistic noise omega can be determined towithin 0.1-0.2 from a deep survey of several square degrees.

astro-ph;9907250	cosmic shear and halo abundances: analytical versus numerical results	the aperture mass has been shown in a series of recent publications to be auseful quantitative tool for weak lensing studies, ranging from cosmic shear tothe detection of a mass-selected sample of dark matter haloes. quantitativeanalytical predictions for the aperture mass have been based on a number ofsimplifying assumptions. in this paper, we test the reliability of theseassumptions and the quality of the analytic approximations, using ray-tracingsimulations through a cosmological density field generated by very large n-bodysimulations. we find that those analytic predictions which take into accountthe non-linear evolution of the matter distribution, such as the dispersion ofthe aperture mass and the halo abundance, are surprisingly accuratelyreproduced with our numerical results, whereas the predictions for theskewness, based on quasi-linear theory, are rather imprecise. in particular, weverify numerically that the probability distribution of the aperture massdecreases exponentially for values much larger than the rms. given the goodoverall agreement, comparisons between the observed distribution of theaperture mass and the theoretical values provide a powerful tool for testingcosmological models.

astro-ph;9910459	statistics of dark matter halos from gravitational lensing	we present a new approach to measure the mass function of dark matter halosand to discriminate models with differing values of omega through weakgravitational lensing. we measure the distribution of peaks from simulatedlensing surveys and show that the lensing signal due to dark matter halos canbe detected for a wide range of peak heights. even when the signal-to-noise iswell below the limit for detection of individual halos, projected halostatistics can be constrained for halo masses spanning galactic to clusterhalos. the use of peak statistics relies on an analytical model of the noisedue to the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies. the noise model has beenshown to accurately describe simulated data for a variety of input ellipticitydistributions. we show that the measured peak distribution has distinctsignatures of gravitational lensing, and its non-gaussian shape can be used todistinguish models with different values of omega. the use of peak statisticsis complementary to the measurement of field statistics, such as theellipticity correlation function, and possibly not susceptible to the samesystematic errors.

astro-ph;9912330	statistics of weak lensing at small angular scales: analytical  predictions for lower order moments	weak lensing surveys are expected to provide direct measurements of thestatistics of the projected dark matter distribution. most analytical studiesof weak lensing statistics have been limited to quasilinear scales as theyrelied on perturbative calculations. on the other hand, observational surveysare likely to probe angular scales less than 10 arcminutes, for which therelevant physical length scales are in the nonlinear regime of gravitationalclustering. we use the hierarchical ansatz to compute the multi-pointstatistics of the weak lensing convergence for these small smoothing angles. wepredict the multi-point cumulants and cumulant correlators up to fourth orderand compare our results with high resolution ray tracing simulations. averagingover a large number of simulation realizations for four different cosmologicalmodels, we find close agreement with the analytical calculations. incombination with our work on the probability distribution function, theseresults provide accurate analytical models for the full range of weak lensingstatistics. the models allow for a detailed exploration of cosmologicalparameter space and of the dependence on angular scale and the redshiftdistribution of source galaxies. we compute the dependence of the highermoments of the convergence on the parameters omega and lambda and on the natureof gravitational clustering.

0810.4170	the impact of non-gaussian errors on weak lensing surveys	the weak lensing power spectrum carries cosmological information via itsdependence on the growth of structure and on geometric factors. since much ofthe cosmological information comes from scales affected by nonlinearclustering, measurements of the lensing power spectrum can be degraded bynon-gaussian covariances. recently there have been conflicting studies aboutthe level of this degradation. we use the halo model to estimate it and includenew contributions related to the finite size of lensing surveys, followingrimes and hamilton's study of 3d simulations. we find that non-gaussiancorrelations between different multipoles can degrade the cumulativesignal-to-noise for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 (or 5for a worst-case model that exceeds current n-body simulation predictions).however, using an eight-parameter fisher analysis we find that the marginalizederrors on individual parameters are degraded by less than 10% (or 20% for theworst-case model). the smaller degradation in parameter accuracy is primarilybecause: individual parameters in a high-dimensional parameter space aredegraded much less than the volume of the full fisher ellipsoid; lensinginvolves projections along the line of sight, which reduce the non-gaussianeffect; some of the cosmological information comes from geometric factors whichare not degraded at all. we contrast our findings with those of lee &amp; pen(2008) who suggested a much larger degradation in information content. finally,our results give a useful guide for exploring survey design by giving thecosmological information returns for varying survey area, depth and the levelof some systematic errors.

(our method exploits thefact that, although we do not know the redshifts of the neighbors, we do knowthe redshift of the absorbers.) the absolute magnitude distribution we find iswell described by a bell-shaped curve peaking at about rest-frame m_b = -20,corresponding to l/l* = 1.4. a comparison of this observed distribution to onesin the literature suggests that it is unlikely to be drawn from a populationdominated by late-type galaxies. however, the strong equivalent width systemsmay be associated with later galaxy types. finally we use the absolutemagnitude distribution, along with the observed covering fraction of about 8percent, to estimate the extent of the mgii absorbing gas around a galaxy. foran l* galaxy, this scale is about 70 kpc/h. we provide an analytic descriptionof our method, which is generally applicable to any dataset in which redshiftsare only available for a small sub-sample. hence, we expect it to aid in theanalysis of galaxy scaling relations from photometric redshift datasets.

0812.0013	three-point correlations in f(r) models of gravity	modifications of general relativity provide an alternative explanation todark energy for the observed acceleration of the universe. we calculatequasilinear effects in the growth of structure in f(r) models of gravity usingperturbation theory. we find significant deviations in the bispectrum thatdepend on cosmic time, length scale and triangle shape. however the deviationsin the reduced bispectrum q for f(r) models are at the percent level, muchsmaller than the deviations in the bispectrum itself. this implies thatthree-point correlations can be predicted to a good approximation simply byusing the modified linear growth factor in the standard gravity formalism. ourresults suggest that gravitational clustering in the weakly nonlinear regime isnot fundamentally altered, at least for a class of gravity theories that arewell described in the newtonian regime by the parameters g_eff and phi/psi.this approximate universality was also seen in the n-body simulationmeasurements of the power spectrum by stabenau and jain (2006), and in otherrecent studies based on simulations. thus predictions for such modified gravitymodels in the regime relevant to large-scale structure observations may be lessdaunting than expected on first principles. we discuss the caveats that applyto such predictions.
