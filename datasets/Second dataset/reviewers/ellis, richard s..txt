0902.1188	the greater impact of mergers on the growth of massive galaxies:  implications for mass assembly and evolution since z~1	using deep infrared observations conducted with the moircs on the subarutelescope in goods-n combined with public surveys in goods-s, we investigatethe dependence on stellar mass, m_*, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction(5 kpc &lt; r &lt; 20 kpc) and implied merger rate. in common with some recentstudies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in majormergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift toz~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \pm 1.6}. our key finding is that massive galaxies withm_* &gt; 1e11 msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massivesystems (m_* ~ 1e10 msun). we find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectationsbased on clustering at small scales. so-called "dry" mergers between early-typegalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with m_* &gt; 3e10 msun at z~0.5, butless than 30% at z~1. this result can be explained by the increasing abundanceof red, early-type galaxies at these masses. we compare the volumetric mergerrate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxyevolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation ofspheroidal galaxies since z~1. in terms of mass assembly, major mergerscontribute little to galaxy growth below m_* ~ 3e10 msun but are moresignificant among galaxies with m_* &gt; 1e11 msun, 30% of which have undergonemostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. overall, the relativelymore rapid coalescence of high mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchicalgrowth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if thedownsizing of star formation and morphological evolution involves additionalphysical processes.

0902.2780	co interferometry of gas-rich spiral galaxies in the outskirts of an  intermediate redshift cluster	we present iram plateau de bure interferometer 3mm observations of co(1-0)emission in two 24um-selected starburst galaxies in the outskirts(2-3xr_virial) of the rich cluster cl0024+16 (z=0.395). the galaxies' inferredfar-infrared luminosities place them in the luminous infrared galaxy class(lirgs, l_fir&gt;10^11 l_sun), with star formation rates of ~60 m_sun/yr. strongco(1-0) emission is detected in both galaxies, and we use the co lineluminosity to estimate the mass of cold molecular gas, m(h_2). assumingm(h_2)/l'_co = 0.8 m_sun/(k km^-1 pc^2), we estimate m(h_2) = (5.4-9.1)x10^9m_sun for the two galaxies. we estimate the galaxies' dynamical masses fromtheir co line-widths, m_dyn~1-3x10^10 m_sun, implying large cold gas fractionsin the galaxies' central regions. at their current rates they will complete theassembly of m_stars~10^10 m_sun and double their stellar mass within as littleas ~150myr. if these galaxies are destined to evolve into s0s, then the shorttime-scale for stellar mass assembly implies that their major episode of bulgegrowth occurs while they are still in the cluster outskirts, long before theyreach the core regions. subsequent fading of the disc component relative to thestellar bulge after the gas reservoirs have been exhausted could complete thetransformation of spiral-to-s0.

0902.2907	the evolutionary history of lyman break galaxies between redshift 4 and  6: observing successive generations of massive galaxies in formation	we present new measurements of the evolution in the lyman break galaxy (lbg)population between z~4 and z~6. by utilizing the extensive multiwavelengthdatasets available in the goods fields, we identify 2443 b, 506 v, and 137i'-band dropout galaxies likely to be at z~4, 5, and 6. with the goal ofunderstanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies atz&gt;4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function ofcosmic time. we find that at a fixed rest-uv luminosity, the average stellarmasses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z~6 and 4. inorder to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of highredshift lbgs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young,newly-luminous objects at each successive redshift. when considered along withthe short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results maysuggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting onlyseveral hundred million years. in contrast to the unchanging relationshipbetween the average stellar mass and rest-uv luminosity, we find that thenumber density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4&lt;z&lt;6.given this rapid increase of uv luminous massive galaxies, we explore thepossibility that a significant fraction of massive (m*&gt;1e11 msun) z~2-3 distantred galaxies (drgs) were in part assembled in an lbg phase at earlier times.integrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming lbgsover 4&lt;z&lt;6 down to z~2, we find that z&gt;3 lbgs could have contributedsignificantly to the quiescent drg population, indicating that the intensestar-forming systems probed by current sub-millimeter observations are not theonly route toward the assembly of drgs at z~2.

0904.1742	detection of pah and far-infrared emission from the cosmic eye: probing  the dust and star formation of lyman break galaxies	we report the results of a spitzer infrared study of the cosmic eye, astrongly lensed, l*_uv lyman break galaxy (lbg) at z=3.074. we obtained spitzerirs spectroscopy as well as mips 24 and 70 micron photometry. the eye isdetected with high significance at both 24 and 70 microns and, when including aflux limit at 3.5 mm, we estimate an infrared luminosity of l_ir = 8.3(+4.7-4.4) x10^11 l_sun assuming a magnification of 28+-3. this l_ir is eighttimes lower than that predicted from the rest-frame uv properties assuming acalzetti reddening law. this has also been observed in other young lbgs, andindicates that the dust reddening law may be steeper in these galaxies. themid-ir spectrum shows strong pah emission at 6.2 and 7.7 microns, withequivalent widths near the maximum values observed in star-forming galaxies atany redshift. the l_pah-to-l_ir ratio lies close to the relation measured inlocal starbursts. therefore, l_pah or l_mir may be used to estimate l_ir andthus, star formation rate, of lbgs, whose fluxes at longer wavelengths aretypically below current confusion limits. we also report the highest redshiftdetection of the 3.3 micron pah emission feature. the pah ratio,l_6.2/l_3.3=5.1+- 2.7, and the pah-to-l_ir ratio, l_3.3/l_ir = 8.5 +- 4.7x10^-4, are both in agreement with measurements in local starbursts and ulirgs,suggesting that this line may serve as a good proxy for l_pah or l_ir at z &gt; 3with the james webb space telescope.

(2) the spin temperature of ch4 is &gt;35-38 k, an estimate consistent with the more robust spin temperature found forh2o. (3) we obtained a 3s upper limit of ch3d/ch4 &lt; 0.020 (d/h &lt; 0.005). thislimit suggests that methane released from the nucleus of c/2004 q2 is notdominated by a component formed in extremely cold (near 10 k) environments.formation pathways of both interstellar and nebular origin consistent with themeasured d/h in methane are discussed. evaluating the relative contributions ofthese pathways requires further modeling of chemistry including both gas-phaseand gas-grain processes in the natal interstellar cloud and in theprotoplanetary disk.

0910.1098	probing $\sim l_{*}$ lyman-break galaxies at $z\approx 7$ in goods-south  with wfc3 on hst	we analyse recently acquired near-infrared hubble space telescope imaging ofthe goods-south field to search for star forming galaxies at z~7.0. bycomparing wfc 3 0.98 micron y-band images with acs z-band (0.85 micron) images,we identify objects with colours consistent with lyman break galaxies atz~6.4-7.4. this new data covers an area five times larger than that previouslyreported in the wfc3 imaging of the hubble ultra deep field, and affords avaluable constraint on the bright end of the luminosity function. usingadditional imaging of the region in the acs b, v and i-bands from goods v2.0and the wfc3 j-band we attempt to remove any low-redshift interlopers. ourselection criteria yields 6 candidates brighter than y_ab = 27.0, of which allexcept one are detected in the acs z-band imaging and are thus unlikely to betransients. assuming all 6 candidates are at z~7 this implies a surface densityof objects brighter than y_ab = 27.0 of 0.30\pm0.12 arcmin-2, a valuesignificantly smaller than the prediction from the z ~ 6 luminosity function.this suggests continued evolution of the bright end of the luminosity functionbetween z = 6 to 7, with number densities lower at higher redshift.

0707.2249	a subaru weak lensing survey i: cluster candidates and spectroscopic  verification	we present the results of an ongoing weak lensing survey conducted with thesubaru telescope whose initial goal is to locate and study the distribution ofshear-selected structures or halos. using a suprime-cam imaging survey spanning21.82 square degree, we present a catalog of 100 candidate halos located fromlensing convergence maps. our sample is reliably drawn from that subset of oursurvey area, (totaling 16.72 square degree) uncontaminated by bright stars andedge effects and limited at a convergence signal to noise ratio of 3.69. tovalidate the sample detailed spectroscopic measures have been made for 26candidates using the subaru multi-object spectrograph, focas. all are confirmedas clusters of galaxies but two arise as the superposition of multiple clustersviewed along the line of sight. including data available in the literature andan ongoing keck spectroscopic campaign, a total of 41 halos now have reliableredshifts. for one of our survey fields, the xmm lss (pierre et al. 2004)field, we compare our lensing-selected halo catalog with its x-ray equivalent.of 15 halos detected in the xmm-lss field, 10 match with published x-rayselected clusters and a further 2 are newly-detected and spectroscopicallyconfirmed in this work. although three halos have not yet been confirmed, thehigh success rate within the xmm-lss field (12/15) confirms that weak lensingprovides a reliable method for constructing cluster catalogs, irrespective ofthe nature of the constituent galaxies or the intracluster medium.

0912.1605	environmental effects in the evolution of galactic bulges	we investigate possible environmental trends in the evolution of galacticbulges over the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;0.6. for this purpose, we construct thefundamental plane (fp) for cluster and field samples at redshifts &lt;z&gt;=0.4 and&lt;z&gt;=0.54 using surface photometry based on hst imaging and velocity dispersionsbased on keck spectroscopy. as a reference point for our study we include datafor pure ellipticals, which we model as single-component sersic profiles;whereas for multi-component galaxies we undertake decompositions using sersicand exponential models for the bulge and disk respectively. although the fp forboth distant cluster and field samples are offset from the local relation,consistent with evolutionary trends found in earlier studies, we detectsignificant differences in the zero point of ~=0.2 dex between the field andcluster samples at a given redshift. for both clusters, theenvironmentally-dependent offset is in the sense expected for an acceleratedevolution of bulges in dense environments. by matching the mass range of oursamples, we confirm that this difference does not arise as a result of themass-dependent downsizing effects seen in larger field samples. our result isalso consistent with the hypothesis that - at fixed mass and environment - thestar formation histories of galactic bulges and pure spheroids areindistinguishable, and difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby themajority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiralgalaxies.

1001.2141	a coincidence of disturbed morphology and blue uv colour: minor-merger  driven star formation in early-type galaxies at z~0.6	we exploit multi-wavelength photometry of early-type galaxies (etgs) in thecosmos survey to demonstrate that the low-level star formation activity in theetg population at intermediate redshift is likely to be driven by minormergers. splitting the etgs into galaxies that show disturbed morphologiesindicative of recent merging and those that appear relaxed, we find that ~32%of the etg population appears to be morphologically disturbed. while therelaxed objects are almost entirely contained within the uv red sequence, theirmorphologically disturbed counterparts dominate the scatter to blue uv colours,regardless of luminosity. empirically and theoretically determined major-mergerrates in the redshift range z&lt;1 are several times too low to account for thefraction of disturbed etgs in our sample, suggesting that minor mergersrepresent the principal mechanism driving the observed star formation activityin our sample. the young stellar components forming in these events have agesbetween 0.03 and 0.3 myrs and typically contribute &lt;10% of the stellar mass ofthe remnant. together with recent work which demonstrates that the structuralevolution of nearby etgs is consistent with one or more minor mergers, ourresults indicate that the overall evolution of massive etgs may be heavilyinfluenced by minor merging at late epochs and highlights the need tosystematically study this process in future observational surveys.

0707.4173	a wide-field survey of two z~0.5 galaxy clusters: identifying the  physical processes responsible for the observed transformation of spirals  into s0s	we present new results from our comprehensive comparative survey of twomassive, intermediate redshift galaxy clusters, cl0024+17 (z=0.39) andms0451-03 (z=0.54). we identify and study several key classes of `transitionobjects' whose stellar populations or dynamical states indicate a recent orongoing change in morphology and star formation rate. for the first time, wehave been able to conclusively identify spiral galaxies in the process oftransforming into s0 galaxies. this has been accomplished by locating bothspirals whose star formation is being quenched as well as their eventualsuccessors, the recently created s0s. differences between the two clusters inboth the timescales and spatial location of this conversion process allow us toevaluate the relative importance of several proposed physical mechanisms thatcould be responsible for the transformation. combined with other diagnosticsthat are sensitive to either icm-driven galaxy evolution or galaxy-galaxyinteractions, we describe a self-consistent picture of galaxy evolution inclusters. we find that spiral galaxies within infalling groups have alreadybegun a slow process of conversion into s0s primarily via gentle galaxy-galaxyinteractions. the fates of spirals upon reaching the core of the cluster dependheavily on the cluster icm, with rapid conversion of all remaining spirals intos0s via ram-pressure stripping in clusters where the icm is dense. in thepresence of a less-dense icm, the conversion continues at a slower pace, withgalaxy-galaxy interactions continuing to play a role along with `starvation' bythe icm. we conclude that the buildup of the local s0 population through thetransformation of spiral galaxies is a heterogeneous process that neverthelessproceeds robustly across a variety of different environments.

1003.5244	keck spectroscopy of faint 3&lt;z&lt;7 lyman break galaxies: - i. new  constraints on cosmic reionisation from the luminosity and redshift-dependent  fraction of lyman-alpha emission	we present results from a new keck spectroscopic survey of uv-faint lbgs inthe redshift range 3&lt;z&lt;7. combined with earlier keck and published eso vltdata, our sample contains more than 600 dropouts, offering new insight into thenature of sub-l* sources typical of those likely to dominate the cosmicreionisation process. here we use this sample to characterise the fraction ofstrong lya emitters within the continuum-selected dropouts. by quantifying howthe "lya fraction" varies with redshift, we seek to constrain changes in lyatransmission associated with reionisation. in order to distinguish the effectsof reionisation from other factors which affect the lya fraction (e.g. dust,ism kinematics), we study the luminosity and redshift-dependence of the lyafraction over 3&lt;z&lt;6, when the igm is known to be ionised. these results revealthat low luminosity galaxies show strong lya emission much more frequently thanluminous systems, and that at fixed luminosity, the prevalence of strong lyaemission increases moderately with redshift over 3 &lt; z &lt; 6. based on thecorrelation between blue uv slopes and strong lya emitting galaxies in ourdataset, we argue that the lya fraction trends are governed by redshift andluminosity-dependent variations in the dust obscuration, with likely additionalcontributions from trends in the kinematics and covering fraction of neutralhydrogen. we find a tentative decrease in the lya fraction at z~7 based on thelimited ir spectra for candidate z~7 lensed lbgs, a result which, if confirmedwith future surveys, would suggest an increase in the neutral fraction by thisepoch. given the supply of z and y-drops now available from hubble wfc3/irsurveys, we show it will soon be possible to significantly improve estimates ofthe lya fraction using optical and near-ir spectrographs, thereby extending thestudy conducted in this paper to 7&lt;z&lt;8.

1004.1331	keck spectroscopy of z&gt;1 field spheroidals: dynamical constraints on the  growth rate of red "nuggets"	we present deep keck spectroscopy for 17 morphologically-selected fieldspheroidals in the redshift range 1.05&lt;z&lt;1.60 in order to investigate thecontinuity in physical properties between the claimed massive compact redgalaxies ("nuggets") at z~2 and well-established data for massive spheroidalgalaxies below z~1. by combining keck-based stellar velocity dispersions withhst-based sizes, we find that the most massive systems (mdyn &gt; 10^11 msol) grewin size over 0&lt;z&lt;1.6 as (1+z)^(-0.75 +- 0.10) (i.e., x2 since z=1.5) whereasintermediate mass systems (10^11 msol &gt; mdyn &gt; 10^10 msol) did not growsignificantly. these trends are consistent with a picture in which more massivespheroidals formed at higher redshift via "wetter" mergers involving greaterdissipation. to examine growth under the favored "dry" merger hypothesis, wealso examine size growth at a fixed velocity dispersion. this test, uniquelypossible with our dynamical data, allows us to consider the effects of"progenitor bias." above our completeness limit (sigma &gt; 200 km/s), we findsize growth consistent with that inferred for the mass-selected sample, thusruling out strong progenitor bias. to maintain continuity in the growth ofmassive galaxies over the past 10 gyr, our new results imply that sizeevolution over 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.3, a period of 1.9 gyr, must have been even moredramatic than hitherto claimed if the red sources at z&gt;2 are truly massive andcompact.

1009.5471	keck spectroscopy of faint 3&lt;z&lt;7 lyman break galaxies:- ii. a high  fraction of line emitters at redshift six	as lyman-alpha photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen, a change withredshift in the lyman-alpha equivalent width distribution of distant galaxiesoffers a promising probe of the degree of ionization in the intergalacticmedium and hence when cosmic reionization ended. this simple test iscomplicated by the fact that lyman-alpha emission can also be affected by theevolving astrophysical details of the host galaxies. in the first paper in thisseries, we demonstrated both a luminosity and redshift dependent trend in thefraction of lyman-alpha emitters seen within color-selected lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) over the range 3&lt;z&lt;6; lower luminosity galaxies and those athigher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission. here wepresent the results from much deeper 12.5 hour exposures with the keck deimosspectrograph focused primarily on lbgs at z~6 which enable us to confirm theredshift dependence of line emission more robustly and to higher redshift thanwas hitherto possible. we find 54+/-11% of faint z~6 lbgs show strong (w_0&gt;25a) emission, an increase of 1.6x from a similar sample observed at z~4. with atotal sample of 74 z~6 lbgs, we determine the luminosity-dependent lyman-alphaequivalent width distribution. assuming continuity in these trends to the newpopulation of z~7 sources located with the hubble wfc3/ir camera, we predictthat unless the neutral fraction rises in the intervening 200 myr, the successrate for spectroscopic confirmation using lyman-alpha emission should be high.

1109.0990	connecting the gamma ray burst rate and the cosmic star formation  history: implications for reionization and galaxy evolution	(abridged) the contemporary discoveries of galaxies and gamma ray bursts(grbs) at high redshift have supplied the first direct information on starformation when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. theprobable origin of long duration grbs in the deaths of massive stars would linkthe universal grb rate to the redshift-dependent star formation rate density,although exactly how is currently unknown. as the most distant grbs andstar-forming galaxies probe the reionization epoch, the potential rewards ofunderstanding the redshift-dependent ratio psi(z) of the grb rate to starformation rate are significant and include addressing fundamental questionssuch as incompleteness in rest-frame uv surveys for determining the starformation rate at high redshift and time variations in the stellar initial massfunction. using an extensive sample of 112 grbs above a fixed luminosity limitdrawn from the second swift burst alert telescope catalog, we compare thecumulative redshift distribution n(&lt; z) of grbs with the star formation densityrho_sfr(z) measured from uv-selected galaxies over 0 &lt; z &lt; 4. strong evolution(e.g., psi(z) \propto (1+z)^{1.5}) is disfavored, while more modest evolution(e.g., psi(z) \propto (1+z)^{0.5}) is consistent with the data. if such trendscontinue beyond z ~ 4, we find the discovery rate of distant grbs implies astar formation rate density much higher than that inferred from uv-selectedgalaxies. we show that such a star formation history would over-predict theobserved stellar mass density at z &gt; 4 measured from rest-frame opticalsurveys. the resolution of this important disagreement is currently unclear,and the grb production rate at early times is likely more complex than a simplefunction of star formation rate and progenitor metallicity.

0710.2105	aegis: new evidence linking active galactic nuclei to the quenching of  star formation	utilizing chandra x-ray observations in the all-wavelength extended grothstrip international survey (aegis) we identify 241 x-ray selected activegalactic nuclei (agns, l &gt; 10^{42} ergs/s) and study the properties of theirhost galaxies in the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4. by making use of infrared photometryfrom palomar observatory and bri imaging from the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, we estimate agn host galaxy stellar masses and show that bothstellar mass and photometric redshift estimates (where necessary) are robust tothe possible contamination from agns in our x-ray selected sample. accountingfor the photometric and x-ray sensitivity limits of the survey, we constructthe stellar mass function of x-ray selected agn host galaxies and find thattheir abundance decreases by a factor of ~2 since z~1, but remains roughly flatas a function of stellar mass. we compare the abundance of agn hosts to therate of star formation quenching observed in the total galaxy population. ifthe timescale for x-ray detectable agn activity is roughly 0.5-1 gyr--assuggested by black hole demographics and recent simulations--then we deducethat the inferred agn "trigger" rate matches the star formation quenching rate,suggesting a link between these phenomena. however, given the large range ofnuclear accretion rates we infer for the most massive and red hosts, x-rayselected agns may not be directly responsible for quenching star formation.

1110.1637	can minor merging account for the size growth of quiescent galaxies? new  results from the candels survey	the presence of extremely compact galaxies at z~2 and their subsequent growthin physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. we revisit the questionusing deep infrared wide field camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame opticalstructure of 935 host galaxies selected with 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 and stellar masses m* &gt;10^10.7 msol using optical and near-infrared photometry in the ukirt ultra deepsurvey and goods-south fields of the candels survey. at each redshift, the mostcompact sources are those with little or no star formation, and we find thatthe mean size of these systems grows by a factor of 3.5 +- 0.3 over thisredshift interval. the new data are sufficiently deep to enable us to identifycompanions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller, whilestill yielding suitably accurate photometric redshifts to define a likelyphysical association. by searching for faint companions around 404 quiescenthosts within a projected physical annulus 10 &lt; r &lt; 30 kpc/h, we estimate theminor merger rate over the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2. after correcting forcontamination from projected pairs, we find that 13-18% of quiescent hosts havelikely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. mergersof these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6+-2% per mergertimescale. we estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain thedeclining abundance of compact galaxies. using a simple model of mergingmotivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers ofthe faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimalrate. we find that mergers with mass ratios &gt; 0.1 may explain most of the sizeevolution observed at z &gt;~ 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed,but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additionalphysical processes.

1111.5102	keck spectroscopy of faint 3 &lt; z &lt; 7 lyman break galaxies: iii. the mean  ultraviolet spectrum at z=4	we present and discuss the mean rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum for a sampleof 81 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) selected to be b-band dropouts with a meanredshift of z=3.9 and apparent magnitudes z_ab&lt;26. most of the individualspectra are drawn from our ongoing survey in the goods fields with the keckdeimos spectrograph, and we have augmented our sample with published data takenwith fors2 on the vlt. in general we find similar trends in the spectraldiagnostics to those found in the earlier, more extensive survey of lbgs at z=3undertaken by shapley et al (2003). specifically, we find low-ionizationabsorption lines which trace the presence of neutral outflowing gas are weakerin galaxies with stronger lyman-alpha emission, bluer uv spectral slopes, lowerstellar masses, lower uv luminosities and smaller half-light radii. this isconsistent with a physical picture whereby star formation drives outflows ofneutral gas which scatters lyman-alpha and gives rise to strong low-ionizationabsorption lines, while increasing the stellar mass, size, metallicity, anddust content of galaxies. typical galaxies are thus expected to have strongerlyman-alpha emission and weaker low-ionization absorption at earlier times(higher redshifts). indeed, our mean spectrum at z=4 shows somewhat weakerlow-ionization absorption lines than at z=3 and available data at higherredshift indicates a rapid decrease in low-ionization absorption strength withredshift. we argue that the reduced low-ionization absorption is likely causedby a decrease in the covering fraction and/or velocity range of outflowingneutral gas at earlier epochs. our continuing survey will enable us to extendthese diagnostics more reliably to higher redshift and determine theimplications for the escape fraction of ionizing photons which governs the roleof early galaxies in cosmic reionization.

0710.3588	a comparison of weak lensing measurements from ground- and space-based  facilities	we assess the relative merits of weak lensing surveys, using overlappingimaging data from the ground-based subaru telescope and the hubble spacetelescope (hst). our tests complement similar studies undertaken with simulateddata. from observations of 230,000 matched objects in the 2 square degreecosmos field, we identify the limit at which faint galaxy shapes can bereliably measured from the ground. our ground-based shear catalog achievessub-percent calibration bias compared to high resolution space-based data, forgalaxies brighter than i'~24.5 and with half-light radii larger than 1.8". thisselection corresponds to a surface density of ~15 galaxies per sq arcmincompared to ~71 per sq arcmin from space. on the other hand the survey speed ofcurrent ground-based facilities is much faster than that of hst, although thisgain is mitigated by the increased depth of space-based imaging desirable fortomographic (3d) analyses. as an independent experiment, we also reconstructthe projected mass distribution in the cosmos field using both data sets, andcompare the derived cluster catalogs with those from x-ray observations. theground-based catalog achieves a reasonable degree of completeness, with minimalcontamination and no detected bias, for massive clusters at redshifts0.2&lt;z&lt;0.5. the space-based data provide improved precision and a greatersensitivity to clusters of lower mass or at higher redshift.

0710.4552	evolution of the bar fraction in cosmos: quantifying the assembly of the  hubble sequence	we have analyzed the redshift-dependent fraction of galactic bars over0.2&lt;z&lt;0.84 in 2,157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the cosmos 2-squaredegree field. our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in anyprevious investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data thanthat available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxymorphology. we find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly withredshift. whereas in the local universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxiescontain bars (sb+sab), at z ~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. over thisredshift range the fraction of strong (sb) bars drops from about 30% to under10%. it is clear that when the universe was half its present age, the census ofgalaxies on the hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of thepresent day. a major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emergedfrom our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is astrong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. the barfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84whereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshiftbeyond z=0.3. there is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominatedsystems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards theco-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes. our results thus have importantramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggestingthat massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as aresult of the regulation of their star formation rate.

0711.0238	the evolutionary history of galactic bulges: photometric and  spectroscopic studies of distant spheroids in the goods fields	we report on the first results of a new study aimed at understanding thediversity and evolutionary history of distant galactic bulges in the context ofnow well-established trends for pure spheroidal galaxies. to this end, bulgeshave been isolated for a sample of 137 spiral galaxies within the redshiftrange 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2 in the goods fields. using proven photometric techniques wedetermine the characteristic parameters (size, surface brightness, profileshape) of both the disk and bulge components in our sample. in agreement withearlier work which utilized aperture colors, distant bulges show a broaderrange of optical colors than would be the case for passively-evolvingpopulations. to quantify the amount of recent star formation necessary toexplain this result, we used the deimos spectrograph to secure stellar velocitydispersions for a sizeable fraction of our sample. this has enabled us tocompare the fundamental plane of our distant bulges with that for spheroidalgalaxies in a similar redshift range. bulges of spiral galaxies with abulge-to-total luminosity ratio (b/t)&gt;0.2 show very similar patterns ofevolution to those seen for pure spheroidals such that the stellar populationsof all spheroids with m&gt;10^{11}msun are homogeneously old, consistent with asingle major burst of star formation at high redshift (z_f&lt;~2), while bulgeswith m&lt;10^{11}msun must have had more recent stellar mass growth (~10% in masssince z~1). although further data spanning a wider range of redshift and massis desirable, the striking similarity between the assembly histories of bulgesand low mass spheroidals is difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby themajority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiralgalaxies.

1205.0970	refined asymptotics of the finite-size magnetization via a new  conditional limit theorem for the spin	we study the fluctuations of the spin per site around the thermodynamicmagnetization in the mean-field blume-capel model. our main theorem generalizesthe main result in a previous paper (ellis, machta, and otto) in which thefirst rigorous confirmation of the statistical mechanical theory of finite-sizescaling for a mean-field model is given. in that paper our goal is to determinewhether the thermodynamic magnetization is a physically relevant estimator ofthe finite-size magnetization. this is done by comparing the asymptoticbehaviors of these two quantities along parameter sequences converging toeither a second-order point or the tricritical point in the mean-fieldblume-capel model. the main result is that the thermodynamic magnetization andthe finite-size magnetization are asymptotic when the parameter $\alpha$governing the speed at which the sequence approaches criticality is below acertain threshold $\alpha_0$. our main theorem in the present paper on thefluctuations of the spin per site around the thermodynamic magnetization isbased on a new conditional limit theorem for the spin, which is closely relatedto a new conditional central limit theorem for the spin.

1208.3529	keck spectroscopy of 3&lt;z&lt;7 faint lyman break galaxies: the importance of  nebular emission in understanding the specific star formation rate and  stellar mass density	the physical properties inferred from the seds of z&gt;3 galaxies have beeninfluential in shaping our understanding of early galaxy formation and the rolegalaxies may play in cosmic reionization. of particular importance is thestellar mass density at early times which represents the integral of earlierstar formation. an important puzzle arising from the measurements so farreported is that the specific star formation rates (ssfr) evolve far lessrapidly than expected in most theoretical models. yet the observationsunderpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possiblecontamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emissionlines. to quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broad-band fluxes,we investigate the seds of 92 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in theredshift range 3.8&lt;z&lt;5.0 chosen because the h-alpha line lies within thespitzer/irac 3.6 um filter. we demonstrate that the 3.6 um flux issystematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum, which wederive by fitting the sed with population synthesis models. no such excess isseen in a control sample at 3.1&lt;z&lt;3.6 in which there is no nebularcontamination in the irac filters. from the distribution of our 3.6 um fluxexcesses, we derive an h-alpha equivalent width (ew) distribution. the meanrest-frame h-alpha ew we infer at 3.8&lt;z&lt;5.0 (270 a) indicates that nebularemission contributes at least 30% of the 3.6 um flux. via ourempirically-derived ew distribution we correct the available stellar massdensities and show that the ssfr evolves more rapidly at z&gt;4 than previouslythought, supporting up to a 5x increase between z~2 and 7. such a trend is muchcloser to theoretical expectations. given our findings, we discuss theprospects for verifying quantitatively the nebular emission line strengthsprior to the launch of the james webb space telescope.

1209.1391	the density profiles of massive, relaxed galaxy clusters. i. the total  density over three decades in radius	clusters of galaxies are excellent locations to probe the distribution ofbaryons and dark matter (dm) over a wide range of scales. we study a sample ofseven massive, relaxed galaxy clusters with centrally-located brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) at z=0.2-0.3. using the observational tools of strong and weakgravitational lensing, combined with resolved stellar kinematics within thebcg, we measure the total radial density profile, comprising both dark andbaryonic matter, over scales of ~3-3000 kpc. lensing-derived mass profilestypically agree with independent x-ray estimates within ~15%, suggesting thatdepartures from hydrostatic equilibrium are small and that the clusters in oursample (except a383) are not strongly elongated along the line of sight. theinner logarithmic slope gamma_tot of the total density profile measured overr/r200=0.003-0.03, where rho_tot ~ r^(-gamma_tot), is found to be nearlyuniversal, with a mean &lt;gamma_tot&gt; = 1.16 +- 0.05 (random) +0.05-0.07(systematic) and an intrinsic scatter of &lt; 0.13 (68% confidence). this isfurther supported by the very homogeneous shape of the observed velocitydispersion profiles, obtained via keck spectroscopy, which are mutuallyconsistent after a simple scaling. remarkably, this slope agrees closely withnumerical simulations that contain only dark matter, despite the significantcontribution of stellar mass on the scales we probe. the navarro-frenk-whiteprofile characteristic of collisionless cold dark matter is a betterdescription of the total mass density at radii &gt;~ 5-10 kpc than that of darkmatter alone. hydrodynamical simulations that include baryons, cooling, andfeedback currently provide a poorer match. we discuss the significance of ourfindings for understanding the assembly of bcgs and cluster cores, particularlythe influence of baryons on the inner dm halo.

1302.3614	testing the universality of the fundamental metallicity relation at high  redshift using low-mass gravitationally lensed galaxies	we present rest-frame optical spectra for a sample of 9 low-mass star-forminggalaxies in the redshift range 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 which are gravitationally lensed byforeground clusters. we used triplespec, an echelle spectrograph at the palomar200-inch telescope that is very effective for this purpose as it samples theentire near-infrared spectrum simultaneously. by measuring the flux of nebularemission lines we derive gas phase metallicities and star formation rates, andby fitting the optical to infrared spectral energy distributions we obtainstellar masses. taking advantage of the high magnification due to stronglensing we are able to probe the physical properties of galaxies with stellarmasses in the range 7.8 &lt; log m/msun &lt; 9.4 whose star formation rates aresimilar to those of typical star-forming galaxies in the local universe. wecompare our results with the locally determined relation between stellar mass,gas metallicity and star formation rate. our data are in excellent agreementwith this relation, with an average offset &lt;delta log o/h&gt; = 0.01 +/- 0.08,suggesting a universal relationship. remarkably, the scatter around thefundamental metallicity relation is only 0.24 dex, smaller than that observedlocally at the same stellar masses, which may provide an important additionalconstraint for galaxy evolution models.

1304.7015	keck spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed z=4 galaxies: improved  constraints on the escape fraction of ionizing photons	the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from young star-forming galaxiesis one of the largest uncertainties in determining the role of galaxies incosmic reionization. yet traditional techniques for measuring this fraction areinapplicable at the redshifts of interest due to foreground screening by thelyman alpha forest. in an earlier study, we demonstrated a reduction in theequivalent width of low-ionization absorption lines in composite spectra oflyman break galaxies at z=4 compared to similar measures at z=3. this mightimply a lower covering fraction of neutral gas and hence an increase withredshift in the escape fraction of ionizing photons. however, our spectralresolution was inadequate to differentiate between several alternativeexplanations, including changes with redshift in the outflow kinematics. herewe present higher quality spectra of 3 gravitationally lensed lyman breakgalaxies at z=4 with a spectral resolution sufficient to break this degeneracyof interpretation. we present a method for deriving the covering fraction oflow-ionization gas as a function of outflow velocity and compare the resultswith similar quality data taken for galaxies at lower redshift. we find asignificant trend of lower covering fractions of low-ionization gas forgalaxies with strong \lya emission. in combination with the demographic trendsof \lya emission with redshift from our earlier work, our results provide newevidence for a reduction in the average h i covering fraction, and hence anincrease in the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from lyman breakgalaxies, with redshift.

1306.1518	contamination of broad-band photometry by nebular emission in high  redshift galaxies: investigations with keck's mosfire near-infrared  spectrograph	earlier work has raised the potential importance of nebular emission in thederivation of the physical characteristics of high redshift lyman breakgalaxies. within certain redshift ranges, and especially at z ~ 6-7, such linesmay be strong enough to reduce estimates of the stellar masses and ages ofgalaxies compared those derived assuming broad-band photometry representsstellar light alone. to test this hypothesis at the highest redshifts wheresuch lines can be probed with ground-based facilities, we examine thenear-infrared spectra of a representative sample of 20 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.8 lymanbreak galaxies using the newly-commissioned mosfire near-infrared spectrographat the keck i telescope. we use this data to derive the rest-frame equivalentwidths (ew) of [o iii] emission and show that these are comparable to estimatesderived using the sed fitting technique introduced for sources of knownredshift by stark et al (2013). although our current sample is modest, its [oiii] ew distribution is consistent with that inferred for h\alpha\ based on sedfitting of stark et al's larger sample of 3.8 &lt; z &lt; 5 galaxies. for a subset ofsurvey galaxies, we use the combination of optical and near-infraredspectroscopy to quantify kinematics of outflows in z ~ 3.5 star-forminggalaxies, and discuss the implications for reionization measurements. thetrends we uncover underline the dangers of relying purely on broad-bandphotometry to estimate the physical properties of high redshift galaxies andemphasize the important role of diagnostic spectroscopy.

1310.1079	the dwarfs beyond: the stellar-to-halo mass relation for a new sample of  intermediate redshift low mass galaxies	a number of recent challenges to the standard lambda-cdm paradigm relate todiscrepancies that arise in comparing the abundance and kinematics of localdwarf galaxies with the predictions of numerical simulations. such argumentsrely heavily on the assumption that the local dwarf and satellite galaxies forma representative distribution in terms of their stellar-to-halo mass ratios. toaddress this question, we present new, deep spectroscopy using deimos on keckfor 82 low mass (10^7-10^9 solar masses) star-forming galaxies at intermediateredshift (z=0.2-1). for 50 percent of these we are able to determine resolvedrotation curves using nebular emission lines and thereby construct the stellarmass tully-fisher relation to masses as low as 10^7 solar masses. using scalingrelations determined from weak lensing data, we convert this to astellar-to-halo mass (shm) relation for comparison with abundance matchingpredictions. we find a discrepancy between the propagated predictions fromsimulations compared to our observations, and suggest possible reasons for thisas well as future tests that will be more effective.

1311.3317	velocity dispersions and dynamical masses for a large sample of  quiescent galaxies at z &gt; 1: improved measures of the growth in mass and size	we present keck lris spectroscopy for a sample of 103 massive galaxies withredshifts 0.9 &lt; z &lt; 1.6. of these, 56 are quiescent with high signal-to-noiseabsorption line spectra, enabling us to determine robust stellar velocitydispersions for the largest sample yet available beyond a redshift of 1.together with effective radii measured from deep hubble space telescope images,we calculate dynamical masses and address key questions relating to thepuzzling size growth of quiescent galaxies over 0 &lt; z &lt; 2. we examine therelationship between stellar and dynamical masses at high redshift, findingthat it closely follows that determined locally. we also confirm the utility ofthe locally-established empirical calibration which enables high-redshiftvelocity dispersions to be estimated photometrically, and we determine itsaccuracy to be 35%. to address recent suggestions that progenitor bias - thecontinued arrival of recently-quenched larger galaxies - can largely explainthe size evolution of quiescent galaxies, we examine the growth at fixedvelocity dispersion assuming this quantity is largely unaffected by the mergerhistory. we demonstrate that significant size and mass growth have clearlyoccurred in individual systems. parameterizing the relation between mass andsize growth over 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 as r \propto m^alpha, we find alpha = 1.6 +- 0.3,in agreement with theoretical expectations from simulations of minor mergers.relaxing the assumption that the velocity dispersion is unchanging, we examinegrowth assuming a constant ranking in galaxy velocity dispersion. this approachis applicable only to the large-dispersion tail of the distribution, but yieldsa consistent growth rate of alpha = 1.4 +- 0.2. both methods confirm thatprogenitor bias alone is insufficient to explain our new observations and thatquiescent galaxies have grown in both size and stellar mass over 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6.

1404.4632	line emitting galaxies beyond a redshift of 7: an improved method for  estimating the evolving neutrality of the intergalactic medium	the redshift-dependent fraction of color-selected galaxies revealing lymanalpha emission has become the most valuable constraint on the evolvingneutrality of the early intergalactic medium. however, in addition to resonantscattering by neutral gas, the visibility of lyman alpha is also dependent onthe intrinsic properties of the host galaxy, including its stellar population,dust content and the nature of outflowing gas. taking advantage of significantprogress we have made in determining the line emitting properties of $z \simeq4-6$ galaxies, we propose an improved method, based on using the measuredslopes of the rest-frame ultraviolet continua of galaxies, to interpret thegrowing body of near-infrared spectra of $z&gt;7$ galaxies in order to take intoaccount these host galaxy dependencies. in a first application of our newmethod, we demonstrate its potential via a new spectroscopic survey of $7&lt;z&lt;8$galaxies undertaken with the keck mosfire spectrograph. together with earlierpublished data our data provides improved estimates of the evolving visibilityof lyman alpha, particularly at redshift $z\simeq 8$. as a byproduct, we alsopresent a new line emitting galaxy at a redshift $z=7.62$ which supersedes anearlier redshift record. we discuss the improving constraints on the evolvingneutral fraction over $6&lt;z&lt;8$ and the implications for cosmic reionization.

1404.4872	mosfire absorption line spectroscopy of z &gt; 2 quiescent galaxies:  probing a period of rapid size growth	using the mosfire near-infrared multi-slit spectrograph on the keck 1telescope, we have secured high signal-to-noise ratio absorption line spectrafor six massive galaxies with redshift 2 &lt; z &lt; 2.5. five of these galaxies lieon the red sequence and show signatures of passive stellar populations in theirrest-frame optical spectra. by fitting broadened spectral templates we havedetermined stellar velocity dispersions and, with broad-band hst and spitzerphotometry and imaging, stellar masses and effective radii. using this enlargedsample of galaxies we confirm earlier suggestions that quiescent galaxies at z&gt; 2 have small sizes and large velocity dispersions compared to local galaxiesof similar stellar mass. the dynamical masses are in very good agreement withstellar masses (log mstar/mdyn = -0.02 +/- 0.03), although the averagestellar-to-dynamical mass ratio is larger than that found at lower redshift(-0.23 +/- 0.05). by assuming evolution at fixed velocity dispersion, not onlydo we confirm a surprisingly rapid rate of size growth but we also consider thenecessary evolutionary track on the mass-size plane and find a slope alpha =dlogr / dlogm &gt; ~2 inconsistent with most numerical simulations of minormergers. both results suggest an additional mechanism may be required toexplain the size growth of early galaxies.

0803.0178	ginzburg-landau polynomials and the asymptotic behavior of the  magnetization near critical and tricritical points	for the mean-field version of an important lattice-spin model due to blumeand capel, we prove unexpected connections among the asymptotic behavior of themagnetization, the structure of the phase transitions, and a class ofpolynomials that we call the ginzburg-landau polynomials. the model depends onthe parameters n, beta, and k, which represent, respectively, the number ofspins, the inverse temperature, and the interaction strength. our main focus ison the asymptotic behavior of the magnetization m(beta_n,k_n) for appropriatesequences (beta_n,k_n) that converge to a second-order point or to thetricritical point of the model and that lie inside various subsets of thephase-coexistence region. the main result states that as (beta_n,k_n) convergesto one of these points (beta,k), m(beta_n,k_n) ~ c |beta - beta_n|^gamma --&gt; 0.in this formula gamma is a positive constant, and c is the unique positive,global minimum point of a certain polynomial g that we call the ginzburg-landaupolynomial. this polynomial arises as a limit of appropriately scaledfree-energy functionals, the global minimum points of which define thephase-transition structure of the model. for each sequence (beta_n,k_n) understudy, the structure of the global minimum points of the associatedginzburg-landau polynomial mirrors the structure of the global minimum pointsof the free-energy functional in the region through which (beta_n,k_n) passesand thus reflects the phase-transition structure of the model in that region.the properties of the ginzburg-landau polynomials make rigorous the predictionsof the ginzburg-landau phenomenology of critical phenomena, and the asymptoticformula for m(beta_n,k_n) makes rigorous the heuristic scaling theory of thetricritical point.

1405.5091	detailed large deviation analysis of a droplet model having a poisson  equilibrium distribution	one of the main contributions of this paper is to illustrate how largedeviation theory can be used to determine the equilibrium distribution of abasic droplet model that underlies a number of important models in materialscience and statistical mechanics. the model is simply defined. $k$distinguishable particles are placed at random onto the $n$ sites of a lattice,where the ratio $k/n$, the average number of particles per site, equals aconstant $c \in (1,\infty)$. we focus on configurations for which each site isoccupied by at least one particle. the main result is the large deviationprinciple (ldp), in the limit where $k \rightarrow \infty$ and $n \rightarrow\infty$ with $k/n = c$, for a sequence of random, number-density measures,which are the empirical measures of dependent random variables that count thedroplet sizes. the rate function in the ldp is the relative entropy $r(\theta |\rho^*)$, where $\theta$ is a possible asymptotic configuration of thenumber-density measures and $\rho^*$ is a poisson distribution restricted tothe set of positive integers. this ldp reveals that $\rho^*$ is the equilibriumdistribution of the number-density measures, which in turn implies that$\rho^*$ is the equilibrium distribution of the random variables that count thedroplet sizes. we derive the ldp via a local large deviation estimate of theprobability that the number-density measures equal $\theta$ for any probabilitymeasure $\theta$ in the range of these random measures.

1412.6916	gravitational lensing - einstein's unfinished symphony	gravitational lensing - the deflection of light rays by gravitating matter -has become a major tool in the armoury of the modern cosmologist. proposednearly a hundred years ago as a key feature of einstein's theory of generalrelativity, we trace the historical development since its verification at asolar eclipse in 1919. einstein was apparently cautious about its practicalutility and the subject lay dormant observationally for nearly 60 years.nonetheless there has been rapid progress over the past twenty years. thetechnique allows astronomers to chart the distribution of dark matter on largeand small scales thereby testing predictions of the standard cosmological modelwhich assumes dark matter comprises a massive weakly-interacting particle. bymeasuring distances and tracing the growth of dark matter structure over cosmictime, gravitational lensing also holds great promise in determining whether thedark energy, postulated to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion, is avacuum energy density or a failure of general relativity on large scales. weillustrate the wide range of applications which harness the power ofgravitational lensing, from searches for the earliest galaxies magnified bymassive clusters to those for extrasolar planets which temporarily brighten abackground star. we summarise the future prospects with dedicated ground andspace-based facilities designed to exploit this remarkable physical phenomenon.

1509.04345	discovery of a strongly lensed massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.636:  spatially resolved spectroscopy and indications of rotation	we report the discovery of rg1m0150, a massive, recently quenched galaxy atz=2.636 that is multiply imaged by the cluster macsj0150.3-1005. we derive astellar mass of log m_*=11.49+0.10-0.16 and a half-light radius of r_e,maj=1.8+-0.4 kpc. taking advantage of the lensing magnification, we are able tospatially resolve a remarkably massive yet compact quiescent galaxy at z&gt;2 inground-based near-infrared spectroscopic observations using magellan/fire andkeck/mosfire. we find no gradient in the strength of the balmer absorptionlines over 0.6 r_e - 1.6 r_e, which are consistent with an age of 760 myr. gasemission in [nii] broadly traces the spatial distribution of the stars and iscoupled with weak halpha emission (log [nii]/halpha = 0.6+-0.2), indicatingthat ob stars are not the primary ionizing source. the velocity dispersionwithin the effective radius is sigma_e = 271+-41 km/s. we detect rotation inthe stellar absorption lines for the first time beyond z~1. using atwo-integral jeans model that accounts for observational effects, we measure adynamical mass of log m_dyn =11.24+-0.14 and v/sigma=0.70+-0.21. this is a highdegree of rotation considering the modest observed ellipticity of 0.12+-0.08,but it is consistent with predictions from dissipational merger simulationsthat produce compact remnants. the mass of rg1m0150 implies that it is likelyto become a slowly rotating elliptical. if it is typical, this suggests thatthe progenitors of massive ellipticals retain significant net angular momentumafter quenching which later declines, perhaps through accretion of satellites.

astro-ph;0007114	evidence for evolving spheroidals in the hubble deep fields north and  south	we investigate the dispersion in the internal colours of faint spheroidals inthe hdfs north and south. we find that a remarkably large fraction ~30% of themorphologically classified spheroidals with i&lt;24 mag show strong variations ininternal colour, which we take as evidence for recent episodes ofstar-formation. in most cases these colour variations manifest themselves viathe presence of blue cores, an effect of opposite sign to that expected frommetallicity gradients. examining similarly-selected ellipticals in five richclusters with 0.37&lt;z&lt;0.83 we find a significant lower dispersion in theirinternal colours. this suggests that the colour inhomogeneities have a strongenvironmental dependence being weakest in dense environments where spheroidalformation was presumably accelerated at early times. we use the trends definedby the cluster sample to define an empirical model based on a high-redshift offormation and estimate that at z~1 about half the field spheroidals must beundergoing recent episodes of star-formation. using spectral synthesis models,we construct the time dependence of the density of star-formation. although thesamples are currently small, we find evidence for an increase in $\rho_{sfr}$between z=0 to z=1. we discuss the implications of this rise in the context ofthat observed in the similar rise in the abundance of galaxies with irregularmorphology. regardless of whether there is a connection our results providestrong evidence for the continued formation of field spheroidals over 0&lt;z&lt;1.

astro-ph;0010401	the relative star formation histories of spiral bulges and elliptical  galaxies in the hubble deep fields	hierarchical galaxy formation models make specific predictions concerning therelative assembly rates and star formation histories of spiral bulges and fieldellipticals. independently of the cosmological model and initial power spectrumof fluctuations, at all epochs the stellar populations in spiral bulges shouldbe older and redder than those in typical ellipticals selected at the sameredshift. to test this simple prediction, we analyze the internal opticalcolors of a complete sample of i&lt;24 mag early-type and spiral galaxies from thenorthern and southern hubble deep fields (hdf). the subset of galaxies in thenorthern hdf are also investigated in the near-infrared using nicmosphotometry. we compare the central (inner 5% radius) colors of those spiralswith clearly visible bulges with the integrated colors of ellipticals in oursample. comparisons are possible to a redshift z~1 at which point well-definedbulges become difficult to locate. while spiral bulges are systematicallyredder in their optical colors than their associated disks at all redshifts, wefind that the majority are significantly bluer than the red locus occupied bymost field ellipticals at similar redshifts. in the near-infrared, similartrends are found at redshifts z&lt;0.6, but at higher redshifts some bulges as redas the reddest ellipticals are found. we conclude that a significantrejuvenation may have occurred in the inner stellar populations of many spiralgalaxies at intermediate redshifts.

astro-ph;0109152	evidence for a non-zero lambda and a low matter density from a combined  analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey and cosmic microwave background  anisotropies	we perform a joint likelihood analysis of the power spectra of the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs) and the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropiesunder the assumptions that the initial fluctuations were adiabatic, gaussianand well described by power laws with scalar and tensor indices of n_s and n_t.on its own, the 2dfgrs sets tight limits on the parameter combination omega_mh, but relatively weak limits on the fraction of the cosmic matter density inbaryons omega_b/omega_m. the cmb anisotropy data alone set poor constraints onthe cosmological constant and hubble constant because of a `geometricaldegeneracy' among parameters. furthermore, if tensor modes are allowed, the cmbdata allow a wide range of values for the physical densities in baryons andcold dark matter. combining the cmb and 2dfgrs data sets helps to break boththe geometrical and tensor mode degeneracies. the values of the parametersderived here are consistent with the predictions of the simplest models ofinflation, with the baryon density derived from primordial nucleosynthesis andwith direct measurements of the hubble parameter. in particular, we find strongevidence for a positive cosmological constant with a pm 2sigma range of 0.65 &lt;omega_lambda &lt; 0.85, completely independently of constraints on omega_\lambdaderived from type ia supernovae.

astro-ph;0112162	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the amplitudes of fluctuations in the  2dfgrs and the cmb, and implications for galaxy biasing	we compare the amplitudes of fluctuations probed by the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey and by the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave backgroundanisotropies. by combining the 2dfgrs and cmb data we find the linear-theoryrms mass fluctuations in 8 mpc/h spheres to be sigma_8 = 0.73 +-0.05 (aftermarginalization over the matter density parameter omega_m and three other freeparameters). this normalization is lower than the cobe normalization andprevious estimates from cluster abundance, but it is in agreement with somerevised cluster abundance determinations. we also estimate thescale-independent bias parameter of present-epoch l_s = 1.9l_* apm-selectedgalaxies to be b(l_s,z=0) = 1.10 +- 0.08 on comoving scales of 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.15h/mpc. if luminosity segregation operates on these scales, l_* galaxies wouldbe almost un-biased, b(l_*,z=0) = 0.96. these results are derived by assuming aflat lambda-cdm universe, and by marginalizing over other free parameters andfixing the spectral index n=1 and the optical depth due to reionization tau=0.we also study the best fit pair (omega_m,b), and the robustness of the resultsto varying n and tau. various modelling corrections can each change theresulting b by 5-15 per cent. the results are compared with other independentmeasurements from the 2dfgrs itself, and from the sdss, cluster abundance andcosmic shear.

astro-ph;0206256	parameter constraints for flat cosmologies from cmb and 2dfgrs power  spectra	we constrain flat cosmological models with a joint likelihood analysis of anew compilation of data from the cosmic microwave background (cmb) and from the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). fitting the cmb alone yields a knowndegeneracy between the hubble constant h and the matter density omega_m, whicharises mainly from preserving the location of the peaks in the angular powerspectrum. this `horizon-angle degeneracy' is considered in some detail andshown to follow a simple relation omega_m h^{3.4} = constant. adding the 2dfgrspower spectrum constrains omega_m h and breaks the degeneracy. if tensoranisotropies are assumed to be negligible, we obtain values for the hubbleconstant h=0.665 +/- 0.047, the matter density omega_m=0.313 +/- 0.055, and thephysical cdm and baryon densities omega_c h^2 = 0.115 +/- 0.009, omega_b h^2 =0.022 +/- 0.002 (standard rms errors). including a possible tensor componentcauses very little change to these figures; we set a upper limit to thetensor-to-scalar ratio of r&lt;0.7 at 95% confidence. we then show how these datacan be used to constrain the equation of state of the vacuum, and find w&lt;-0.52at 95% confidence. the preferred cosmological model is thus very wellspecified, and we discuss the precision with which future cmb data can bepredicted, given the model assumptions. the 2dfgrs power-spectrum data andcovariance matrix, and the cmb data compilation used here, are available fromhttp://www.roe.ac.uk/~wjp/

astro-ph;0302401	a star-forming galaxy at z=5.78 in the chandra deep field south	we report the discovery of a luminous z=5.78 star-forming galaxy in thechandra deep field south. this galaxy was selected as an `i-drop' from thegoods public survey imaging with hst/acs (object 3 in stanway, bunker &amp; mcmahon2003, astro-ph/0302212). the large colour of (i'-z')_ab=1.6 indicated aspectral break consistent with the lyman-alpha forest absorption short-ward oflyman-alpha at z~6. the galaxy is very compact (marginally resolved with acswith a half-light radius of 0.08arcsec, so r_hl&lt;0.5kpc/h_70). we have obtaineda deep (5.5-hour) spectrum of this z'(ab)=24.7 galaxy with the deimos opticalspectrograph on keck, and here we report the discovery of a single emissionline centred on 8245ang detected at 20sigma with a flux of f~2e-17 ergs/s/cm^2.the line is clearly resolved with detectable structure at our resolution ofbetter than 55km/s, and the only plausible interpretation consistent with theacs photometry is that we are seeing lyman-alpha emission from a z=5.78 galaxy.this is the highest redshift galaxy to be discovered and studied using hstdata. the velocity width delta(v)_fwhm=260km/s and rest-frame equivalent width(w=20ang) indicate that this line is most probably powered by star formation,as an agn would typically have larger values. the starburst interpretation issupported by our non-detection of the high-ionization nv1240ang emission line,and the absence of this source from the deep chandra x-ray images. the starformation rate inferred from the rest-frame uv continuum is 34m_sun/yr/h^2_70(omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7). this is the most luminous starburst known atz&gt;5. our spectroscopic redshift for this object confirms the validity of thei'-drop technique of stanway, bunker &amp; mcmahon (2003) to select star-forminggalaxies at z~6.

astro-ph;0309465	the dark matter distribution in the central regions of galaxy clusters:  implications for cdm	we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey of gravitational arcs in acarefully chosen sample of six clusters each containing a dominant brightestcluster galaxy. we use these systems to study the relative distributions ofdark and baryonic material in the central regions. three clusters present bothradial and tangential arcs and provide particularly strong constraints on themass profiles, whereas the other three display only tangential arcs and act asa control set. we analyze stellar velocity dispersion data for the brightestcluster galaxies in conjunction with the arc redshifts and lens models toconstrain the dark and baryonic mass profiles jointly. for the systemscontaining radial arcs we find that the inner dark matter density profile isconsistent with a 3-d distribution, rho_{dm} propto r^-beta, with logarithmicslope &lt;beta&gt;=0.52^{+0.05}_{-0.05} (68% cl). similarly, we find that thetangential arc sample gives an upper limit, beta&lt;0.57 (99% cl). taking the 6clusters together, the mean dark matter distribution is quite inconsistent withthe standard navarro, frenk &amp; white (1997) value, beta=1.0, at &gt;99% confidence.in addition, we find considerable cosmic scatter in the beta (delta beta ~0.3)values of the radial arc sample. we find no evidence that systems with radialarcs preferentially yield flatter dark matter profiles as might be expected ifthey were a biased subset. we discuss the validity of our 1-d massreconstruction method and verify its conclusions by comparing with results of amore rigorous ray-tracing lensing code. our results extend and strengthen theearlier conclusions presented by sand et al.

astro-ph;0403455	evolution since z=1 of the morphology-density relation of galaxies	we measure the morphology-density relation of galaxies at z=1 across the fullthree orders of magnitude in projected galaxy density available in low-redshiftstudies. our study adopts techniques that are comparable with those applied atlower redshifts, allowing a direct investigation of how the morphologicalsegregation of galaxies has evolved over the last 8 gyr. although themorphology-density relation, as described by the fraction of early-type (e+s0)galaxies, was in place at z=1, its form differs from that observed at both z=0and z=0.5. in the highest density regions the early-type fraction has increasedsteadily with time from f(e+s0)=0.7+/-0.1 at z=1 to f(e+s0)=0.9+/-0.1 at thepresent epoch. however, in intermediate density regions corresponding to groupsand the accretion regions of rich clusters, significant evolution appears tobegin only after z=0.5. finally, at the lowest densities, no evolution isobserved for the early-type fraction of field galaxies which remains constantat f(e+s0)=0.4+/-0.1 at all epochs. we examine a simple picture consistent withthese observations where the early-type population at z=1 is comprised largelyof elliptical galaxies. subsequent evolution in both intermediate and denseregions is attributed to the transformation of spirals into lenticulars.further progress in verifying our hypothesis may be achieved throughdistinguishing ellipticals and lenticulars at these redshifts through resolveddynamical studies of representative systems.

astro-ph;0601621	observational evidence for the co-evolution of galaxy mergers, quasars,  and the blue/red galaxy transition	we compile a number of observations to estimate the time-averaged rate offormation or buildup of red sequence galaxies, as a function of mass andredshift. comparing this with the mass functions of mergers and quasar hosts,and independently comparing their clustering properties as a function ofredshift, we find that these populations trace the same mass distribution, withsimilar evolution, at redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;~1.5. knowing one of the quasar, merger, orelliptical mass/luminosity functions, it is possible to predict the others.allowing for greater model dependence, we compare the rate of early-typebuildup with the implied merger and quasar triggering rates as a function ofmass and redshift and find agreement. over this redshift range, observed mergerfractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function andbuildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift(&gt;~10^11 m_solar at z&lt;~0.3) where 'dry' mergers appear to dominate. thissupports a necessary prediction of theories where mergers between gas-richgalaxies produce ellipticals with an associated phase of quasar activity, afterwhich the remnant becomes red. these populations trace a similar characteristictransition mass, possibly reflecting the mass above which the ellipticalpopulation is mostly (&gt;~50%) assembled at a given redshift, which increaseswith redshift over the observed range in a manner consistent with suggestionsthat cosmic downsizing may apply to red galaxy assembly as well as starformation. these mass distributions as a function of redshift do not uniformlytrace the all/red/blue galaxy population, ruling out models in which quasaractivity is generically associated with star formation or is long lived in'old' systems.

astro-ph;0603182	galex observations of "passive spirals" in the cluster cl 0024+17: clues  to the formation of s0 galaxies	we present new results from deep galex uv imaging of the cluster cl 0024+17at z~0.4. rest-frame far uv emission is detected from a large fraction ofso-called ``passive spiral galaxies'' -a significant population which exhibitsspiral morphology with little or no spectroscopic evidence for ongoing starformation. this population is thought to represent infalling galaxies whosestar formation has been somehow truncated by environmental processes, possiblyin morphological transition to s0 galaxies. compared to normal cluster spirals,we find that passive spirals are redder in fuv-optical color, while exhibitingmuch stronger uv emission than cluster e/s0s - as expected forrecently-truncated star formation. by modeling the different temporalsensitivities of uv and spectroscopic data to recent activity, we show thatstar formation in passive spirals decayed on timescales of less than 1 gyr,consistent with `gas starvation' - a process where the cluster environmentprevents cold gas from accreting onto the spiral disk. intriguingly, thefraction of spirals currently observed in the passive phase is consistent withthe longer period expected for the morphological transformation and thesubsequent build-up of cluster s0s observed since z=0.4.

astro-ph;9607154	the homogeneity of spheroidal populations in distant clusters	the small scatter observed for the u-v colors of spheroidal galaxies innearby clusters of galaxies provides a powerful constraint on the history ofstar formation in dense environments. however, with local data alone, it is notpossible to separate models where galaxies assembled synchronously overredshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 from ones where galaxies formed stochastically at much earliertimes. here we attempt to resolve this ambiguity via high precision rest-frameuv-optical photometry of a large sample of morphologically-selected spheroidalgalaxies in three z~0.54 clusters which have been observed with hst. wedemonstrate the robustness of using hst to conduct the morphological separationof spheroidal and disk galaxies at this redshift and use our new data to repeatthe analysis conducted locally at a significant look-back time. we find a smallscatter (&lt; 0.1 mag rms) for galaxies classed as es and e/s0s, both internallywithin each of the three clusters and externally from cluster to cluster. we donot find any trend for the scatter to increase with decreasing luminosity downto l = l*+3, other than can be accounted for by observational error. neither isthere evidence for a distinction between the scatter observed for galaxiesclassified as ellipticals and s0. our result provides a new constraint on thestar formation history of cluster spheroidals prior to z=0.5 confirming andconsiderably strengthening the earlier conclusions. most of the star formationin the elliptical galaxies in dense clusters was completed before z~3 inconventional cosmologies. although we cannot rule out the continued productionof some ellipticals, our results do indicate an era of initial star formationconsistent with the population of star-forming galaxies recently detectedbeyond z~3.

(ii) early-type spirals show modest evolution, characterised bya gradual steepening of the faint end of their lf with redshift. (iii) out to z~ 0.5, the overall evolution of the galaxy population is dominated by changesseen in late-type spirals. the characteristic luminosity (l^*) of thesegalaxies appears to brighten with redshift and there are signs of strongdensity evolution (a rapid increase in \phi^*). these effects appear to beluminosity dependent so that the lf steepens at higher redshift. these trendsare accompanied by a steep increase in the median [oii] equivalent width,implying a rapid increase in the star-formation rate with redshift at fixedluminosity---a given star-formation rate is found at higher redshift ingalaxies of higher luminosity. we find that these conclusions are robust withrespect to spectral classification errors and the luminosity functionestimator.

astro-ph;9610199	the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function in moderate redshift  clusters	we present deep two-colour photometry of two rich clusters at z=0.18, a665and a1689. we use these data to construct number counts as a function ofmagnitude in the two fields. by combining these counts with similarobservations from a large area field survey we subtract the field contaminationstatistically to produce luminosity functions for the two clusters. great carehas been taken to achieve agreement between the photometry of these twosamples. the cluster data are complete to a limiting magnitude of i=22.5 or anabsolute magnitude in the cluster of i= -18.0 ($m^\star+5$). the luminosityfunctions of both clusters are well described by a gaussian function for thebright galaxies, combined with a schechter function at the faint end, similarto that required to fit the luminosity function in local clusters. the slope atthe faint end of the schechter function in both clusters is extremely steep inv, alpha ~ -2. a shallower slope is seen to the limit of the i data, indicatingthat the cluster population is rapidly blueing as we reach fainter. theexcellent agreement between the form of the luminosity function in our twodistant clusters, as well as agreement with the luminosity function given bydriver et al (1994) for a single z=0.21 cluster, indicates that this faint bluepopulation is a general constituent of distant clusters. we compare our resultswith those from studies of local clusters. depending upon the degree of fading(or disruption) of these faint blue galaxies,we tentatively identify theirremnants with the low surface brightness dwarf galaxies which are the dominantpopulation in local clusters. we discuss the possible role of this populationas the source of most of the x-ray gas in rich clusters.

astro-ph;9610270	a comparison of direct and indirect mass estimates for distant clusters  of galaxies	we present weak lensing results for 12 distant clusters determined fromimages obtained with the refurbished hst. we detect the signature ofgravitational lensing in 11 of the 12 clusters; the clusters span nearly anorder of magnitude in lensing strength. the sample thus provides an excellentdatabase for correlating direct mass estimates from lensing with indirect oneswhich rely on baryonic tracers. we examine the correlation between the clusterx-ray luminosities and the mean gravitational shear strengths and develop amodel which predicts the relationship expected from the properties of localclusters. after allowing for various observational effects, we find that thepredicted correlation is a reasonable match to the available data, indicatingthat there has been little evolution in the x-ray luminosity-central massrelationship between z=0.4 and now. we discuss the implications of this resultin the context of the evolution of the x-ray luminosity function found byearlier workers. the comparison between shear amplitudes and velocitydispersions, estimated from a modest sample of members, reveals a discrepancyin the sense that these velocity dispersions are typically over-estimated byfactors of ~50%. this supports earlier suggestions that high dispersionsmeasured for distant clusters may be seriously affected by both unidentifiedsubstructure and outliers. combining our lensing masses withmorphologically-based luminosity estimates, we determine mass/light ratios insolar units of m/l_v=180+/-160 h for the entire population and 620+/-250 h forthe spheroidal galaxies where the evolutionary effects can be best treated. weargue that this provides an upper bound to the local cluster m/l correspondingto omega~0.4.

astro-ph;9706129	the mass/light ratio of early-type galaxies: constraints from  gravitational lensing in the rich cluster ac114	we present a new wide field image of the distant cluster ac114 ($z=0.31$)obtained with wide field and planetary camera ii onboard the hubble spacetelescope. this image considerably extends our knowledge of the lensingproperties of the cluster beyond those derived by smail \et (1995a) from asingle wf/pc-1 pointing. in conjunction with published ground-basedspectroscopy, we utilise several newly-discovered multiple images to constructan improved mass model for the central regions of the cluster. using thismodel, we apply the methodology introduced by natarajan &amp; kneib (1997) tointerpret local perturbations to the cluster shear field on small scalesresulting from mass associated with individual cluster galaxies. we use thelensing signal to place new constraints on the average mass-to-light ratio andspatial extents of the dark matter halos associated withmorphologically-classified early-type cluster members. we find that the totalmass of a fiducial $l^*$ cluster spheroidal galaxy is largely contained within$\sim$ 15 kpc radius halo ($\sim$~8--10 $r_e$) with a mass-to-light ratio${m/l_v} \sim {15^{+10}_{-4}} $ (90% c.l., $h=0.5$) in solar units within thisradius. comparisons with similar estimates for fieldgalaxies indicates that thecluster galaxies in ac114 may possess less extensive and less massive halos. wediscuss the consequences of our result in the context of models for thedynamical evolution of cluster galaxies and the observational prospects forextending this analysis.

astro-ph;9707231	a statistical analysis of the galaxy populations of distant luminous  x-ray clusters	we present a deep ubi ccd survey using the palomar 5-m telescope of a sampleof high x-ray luminosity, distant clusters selected from the rosat all-skysurvey. the 10 clusters lie at z=0.22-0.28, an era where evolutionary effectshave been reported in the properties of cluster galaxy populations. ourclusters thus provide a well-defined sample of the most massive systems atthese redshifts to quantify the extent and variability of these evolutionaryeffects. moreover, by concentrating on a narrow redshift range, we can takeadvantage of the homogeneity of our sample to combine the catalogues from allthe clusters to analyse the bulk properties of their populations. the coreregions of these clusters ontain only a small proportion of star-forminggalaxies, and they therefore do not exhibit a `butcher-oemler' effect. focusingon the redder cluster galaxies we find that their integrated luminosity is wellcorrelated with the cluster x-ray temperatures, and hence with cluster mass.furthermore, the typical uv-optical colours of the elliptical sequences in theclusters exhibit a small cluster-to-cluster scatter, &lt;=2%, indicating thatthese galaxies are highly homogeneous between clusters. however, at faintermagnitudes we observe an increase in the range of mid-uv colours of galaxiespossessing strong 4000a breaks. in the light of the apparent decline in the s0populations of z&gt;=0.4 clusters (dressler et al. 1997), and in view of theluminosities and colours of this population, we propose that they may be theprogenitors of the s0 population of local rich clusters, caught in the finalstage before they become completely quiescent.

astro-ph;9707232	evolution since z = 0.5 of the morphology-density relation for clusters  of galaxies	using traditional morphological classifications of galaxies in 10intermediate-redshift (z~0.5) clusters observed with wfpc-2 on the hubble spacetelescope, we derive relations between morphology and local galaxy densitysimilar to that found by dressler for low-redshift clusters. takencollectively, the `morphology-density' relationship, m-d, for these moredistant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found forthe local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences:(1) for the clusters in our sample, the m-d relation is strong in centrallyconcentrated ``regular'' clusters, those with a strong correlation of radiusand surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentratedand irregular, in contrast to the situation for low redshift clusters where astrong relation has been found for both. (2) in every cluster the fraction ofelliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, butthe s0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of thespiral fraction. straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretationsof these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceedshierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2)the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters,and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but s0's aregenerated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.

0809.4260	the nature of dusty starburst galaxies in a rich cluster at z=0.4: the  progenitors of lenticulars?	we present the results of a spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) survey of24um-selected luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs, l_ir &gt; 10^11 l_sun) in therich cluster cl0024+16 at z=0.4. optically, these lirgs resemble unremarkablespiral galaxies with e(a)/e(c) spectral classifications and [oii]-derived starformation rates (sfrs) of &lt;2 m_sun/yr, generally indistinguishable from the'quiescent' star forming population in the cluster. our irs spectra show thatthe majority of the 24um-detected galaxies exhibit polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission with implied sfrs ~30-60 m_sun/yr, with only one(&lt;10%) of the sample displaying unambiguous evidence of an active galacticnucleus in the mid-infrared. this confirms the presence of a large populationof obscured starburst galaxies in distant clusters, which comprise the bulk ofthe star formation occurring in these environments at z~0.5. we suggest that,although several mechanisms could be at play, these dusty starbursts could bethe signature of an important evolutionary transition converting gas-richspiral galaxies in distant clusters into the passive, bulge-dominatedlenticular galaxies that become increasingly abundant in the cores of richclusters in the ~4gyr to the present day.

0810.1471	the formation and assembly of a typical star-forming galaxy at z~3	recent studies of galaxies ~2-3 gyr after the big bang have revealed large,turbulent rotating systems. the existence of well-ordered rotation in galaxiesduring this peak epoch of cosmic star formation may suggest that gas accretionthrough cold streams is likely to be the dominant mode by which moststar-forming galaxies at high redshift since major mergers can completelydisrupt the observed velocity fields. however poor spatial resolution andsensitivity have hampered this interpretation, limiting the study to thelargest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally differentmodes of assembly than more typical star forming galaxies. here we reportobservations of a typical star forming galaxy at z=3.07 with a linearresolution of ~100 parsec. this spatial sampling is made possible by thecombination of gravitational lensing and laser guide star adaptive optics. wefind a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being convertedefficiently into stars, likely assembling a spheroidal bulge and disk similarto those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day.

cond-mat;0307007	thermodynamic versus statistical nonequivalence of ensembles for the  mean-field blume-emery-griffiths model	we illustrate a novel characterization of nonequivalent statisticalmechanical ensembles using the mean-field blume-emery-griffiths (beg) model asa test model. the novel characterization takes effect at the level of themicrocanonical and canonical equilibrium distributions of states. for thisreason it may be viewed as a statistical characterization of nonequivalentensembles which extends and complements the common thermodynamiccharacterization of nonequivalent ensembles based on nonconcave anomalies ofthe microcanonical entropy. by computing numerically both the microcanonicaland canonical sets of equilibrium distributions of states of the beg model, weshow that for values of the mean energy where the microcanonical entropy isnonconcave, the microcanonical distributions of states are nowhere realized inthe canonical ensemble. moreover, we show that for values of the mean energywhere the microcanonical entropy is strictly concave, the equilibriummicrocanonical distributions of states can be put in one-to-one correspondencewith equivalent canonical equilibrium distributions of states. our numericalcomputations illustrate general results relating thermodynamic and statisticalequivalence and nonequivalence of ensembles proved by ellis, haven, andturkington [j. stat. phys. 101, 999 (2000)].

cond-mat;0609469	multiple critical behavior of probabilistic limit theorems in the  neighborhood of a tricritical point	we derive probabilistic limit theorems that reveal the intricate structure ofthe phase transitions in a mean-field version of the blume-emery-griffithsmodel. these probabilistic limit theorems consist of scaling limits for thetotal spin and moderate deviation principles (mdps) for the total spin. themodel under study is defined by a probability distribution that depends on theparameters $n$, $\beta$, and $k$, which represent, respectively, the number ofspins, the inverse temperature, and the interaction strength. the intricatestructure of the phase transitions is revealed by the existence of 18 scalinglimits and 18 mdps for the total spin. these limit results are obtained as$(\beta,k)$ converges along appropriate sequences to points belonging tovarious subsets of the phase diagram, which include a curve of second-orderpoints and a tricritical point. the forms of the limiting densities in thescaling limits and of the rate functions in the mdps reflect the influence ofone or more sets that lie in neighborhoods of the critical points and thetricritical point. of all the scaling limits, the structure of those near thetricritical point is by far the most complex, exhibiting new types of criticalbehavior when observed in a limit-theorem phase diagram in the space of the twoparameters that parametrize the scaling limits.
