0907.0708	the diversity of type ia supernovae from broken symmetries	type ia supernovae result when carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systemsaccrete mass from companion stars, reach a critical mass, and explode. the nearuniformity of their light curves makes these supernovae good standard candlesfor measuring cosmic expansion, but a correction must be applied to account forthe fact that the brighter supernovae have broader light curves.one-dimensional modelling, with a certain choice of parameters, can reproducethis general trend in the width-luminosity relation, but the processes ofignition and detonation have recently been shown to be intrinsicallyasymmetric. here we report on multi-dimensional modelling of the explosionphysics and radiative transfer that reveals that the breaking of sphericalsymmetry is a critical factor in determining both the width luminosity relationand the observed scatter about it. the deviation from sphericity can alsoexplain the finite polarization detected in the light from some supernovae. theslope and normalization of the width-luminosity relation has a weak dependenceon certain properties of the white dwarf progenitor, in particular the traceabundances of elements other than carbon and oxygen. failing to correct forthis effect could lead to systematic overestimates of up to 2% in the distanceto remote supernovae.

0907.3885	the nucleosynthetic imprint of 15-40 solar mass primordial supernovae on  metal-poor stars	the inclusion of rotationally-induced mixing in stellar evolution can alterthe structure and composition of presupernova stars. we survey the effects ofprogenitor rotation on nucleosynthetic yields in population iii and iisupernovae using the new adaptive mesh refinement (amr) code castro. we examinespherical explosions in 15, 25 and 40 solar mass stars at z = 0 and 10^-4 solarmetallicity with three explosion energies and two rotation rates. rotation inthe z = 0 models resulted in primary nitrogen production and a strongerhydrogen burning shell which led all models to die as red supergiants. on theother hand, the z=10^-4 solar metallicity models that included rotation endedtheir lives as compact blue stars. because of their extended structure, thehydrodynamics favors more mixing and less fallback in the metal free stars thanthe z = 10^-4 models. as expected, higher energy explosions produce moreenrichment and less fallback than do lower energy explosions, and less massivestars produce more enrichment and leave behind smaller remnants than do moremassive stars. we compare our nucleosynthetic yields to the chemical abundancesin the three most iron-poor stars yet found and reproduce the abundance patternof one, he 0557-4840, with a zero metallicity 15 solar mass, 2.4 x 10^51 ergsupernova. a salpeter imf averaged integration of our yields for z=0 modelswith explosion energies of 2.4x10^51 ergs or less is in good agreement with theabundances observed in larger samples of extremely metal-poor stars, provided15 solar mass stars are included. since the abundance patterns of extremelymetal-poor stars likely arise from a representative sample of progenitors, ouryields suggest that low-mass supernovae contributed the bulk of the metals tothe early universe.

0910.1590	type ii supernovae: model light curves and standard candle relationships	a survey of type ii supernovae explosion models has been carried out todetermine how their light curves and spectra vary with their mass, metallicity,and explosion energy. the presupernova models are taken from a recent survey ofmassive stellar evolution at solar metallicity supplemented by new calculationsat subsolar metallicity. explosions are simulated by the motion of a pistonnear the edge of the iron core and the resulting light curves and spectra arecalculated using full multi-wavelength radiation transport. formulae aredeveloped that describe approximately how the model observables (light curveluminosity and duration) scale with the progenitor mass, explosion energy, andradioactive nucleosynthesis. comparison with observational data shows that theexplosion energy of typical supernovae (as measured by kinetic energy atinfinity) varies by nearly an order of magnitude -- from 0.5 to 4.0 x 10^51ergs, with a typical value of ~0.9 x 10^51 ergs. despite the large variation,the models exhibit a tight relationship between luminosity and expansionvelocity, similar to that previously employed empirically to make sne iipstandardized candles. this relation is explained by the simple behavior ofhydrogen recombination in the supernova envelope, but we find a sensitivity toprogenitor metallicity and mass that could lead to systematic errors.additional correlations between light curve luminosity, duration, and colormight enable the use of sne iip to obtain distances accurate to ~20% using onlyphotometric data.

1004.4916	integrated nucleosynthesis in neutrino driven winds	although they are but a small fraction of the mass ejected in core-collapsesupernovae, neutrino-driven winds (ndws) from nascent proto-neutron stars(pnss) have the potential to contribute significantly to supernovanucleosynthesis. in previous works, the ndw has been implicated as a possiblesource of r-process and light p-process isotopes. in this paper we presenttime-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the ndw whichinclude accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reactionnetwork. using two published models of pns neutrino luminosities, we predictthe contribution of the ndw to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of theentire supernova. for the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no truer-process occurs in the most basic scenario. the wind driven from an older $1.4m_\odot$ model for a pns is moderately neutron-rich at late times however, andproduces $^{87}$rb, $^{88}$sr, $^{89}$y, and $^{90}$zr in near solarproportions relative to oxygen. the wind from a more recently studied $1.27m_\odot$ pns is proton-rich throughout its entire evolution and does notcontribute significantly to the abundance of any element. it thus seems veryunlikely that the simplest model of the ndw can produce the r-process. at most,it contributes to the production of the n = 50 closed shell elements and somelight p-nuclei. in doing so, it may have left a distinctive signature on theabundances in metal poor stars, but the results are sensitive to both uncertainmodels for the explosion and the masses of the neutron stars involved.

1009.3336	3d simulations of rayleigh-taylor mixing in core-collapse sne with  castro	we present multidimensional simulations of the post-explosion hydrodynamicsin three different 15 solar mass supernova models with zero, 10^{-4} solarmetallicity, and solar metallicities. we follow the growth of therayleigh-taylor instability that mixes together the stellar layers in the wakeof the explosion. models are initialized with spherically symmetric explosionsand perturbations are seeded by the grid. calculations are performed intwo-dimensional axisymmetric and three-dimensional cartesian coordinates usingthe new eulerian hydrodynamics code, castro. we find as in previous work, thatrayleigh-taylor perturbations initially grow faster in 3d than in 2d. as therayleigh-taylor fingers interact with one another, mixing proceeds to a greaterdegree in 3d than in 2d, reducing the local atwood number and slowing thegrowth rate of the instability in 3d relative to 2d. by the time mixing hasstopped, the width of the mixed region is similar in 2d and 3d simulationsprovided the rayleigh-taylor fingers show significant interaction. our resultsimply that 2d simulations of light curves and nucleosynthesis in supernovae(sne) that die as red giants may capture the features of an initiallyspherically symmetric explosion in far less computational time than required bya full 3d simulation. however, capturing large departures from sphericalsymmetry requires a significantly perturbed explosion. large scale asymmetriescannot develop through an inverse cascade of merging rayleigh-taylorstructures; they must arise from asymmetries in the initial explosion.

1110.3842	long gamma-ray transients from collapsars	in the collapsar model for common gamma-ray bursts, the formation of acentrifugally supported disk occurs during the first $\sim$10 seconds followingthe collapse of the iron core in a massive star. this only occurs in a smallfraction of massive stellar deaths, however, and requires unusual conditions. amuch more frequent occurrence could be the death of a star that makes a blackhole and a weak or absent outgoing shock, but in a progenitor that only hasenough angular momentum in its outermost layers to make a disk. we considerseveral cases where this is likely to occur - blue supergiants with low massloss rates, tidally-interacting binaries involving either helium stars or giantstars, and the collapse to a black hole of very massive pair-instabilitysupernovae. these events have in common the accretion of a solar mass or so ofmaterial through a disk over a period much longer than the duration of a commongamma-ray burst. a broad range of powers is possible, $10^{47}$ to$10^{50}\,$erg s$^{-1}$, and this brightness could be enhanced by beaming. suchevents were probably more frequent in the early universe where mass loss rateswere lower. indeed this could be one of the most common forms of gamma-raytransients in the universe and could be used to study first generation stars.several events could be active in the sky at any one time. a recent example ofthis sort of event may have been the swift transient sw-1644+57.

0710.3314	pulsational pair instability as an explanation for the most luminous  supernovae	the extremely luminous supernova sn 2006gy challenges the traditional viewthat the collapse of a stellar core is the only mechanism by which a massivestar makes a supernova, because it seems too luminous by more than a factor often. here we report that the brightest supernovae in the modern universe arisefrom collisions between shells of matter ejected by massive stars that undergoan interior instability arising from the production of electron-positron pairs.this "pair instability" leads to explosive burning that is insufficient tounbind the star, but ejects many solar masses of the envelope. after the firstexplosion, the remaining core contracts and searches for a stable burningstate. when the next explosion occurs, several solar masses of material areagain ejected, which collide with the earlier ejecta. this collision canradiate 1e50 erg of light, about a factor of ten more than an ordinarysupernova. our model is in good agreement with the observed light curve for sn2006gy and also shows that some massive stars can produce more than onesupernova-like outburst.

1302.6973	nucleosynthetic constraints on the mass of the heaviest supernovae	assuming a salpeter initial mass function and taking the solar abundances asa representative sample, we explore the sensitivity of nucleosynthesis inmassive stars to the truncation of supernova explosions above a certain mass.it is assumed that stars of all masses contribute to nucleosynthesis by theirpre-explosive winds, but above a certain limiting main sequence mass, thepresupernova star becomes a black hole and ejects nothing more. the solarabundances from oxygen to atomic mass 90 are fit quite well assuming no cut-offat all, i.e., by assuming all stars up to 120 solar masses make successfulsupernovae. little degradation in the fit occurs if the upper limit is reducedto 25 solar masses. the limit can be further reduced, but the required eventrate of supernovae in the remaining range rises rapidly to compensate for thelost nucleosynthesis of the more massive stars. the nucleosynthesis of thes-process declines precipitously and the production of species made in thewinds, e.g., carbon, becomes unacceptably large compared with elements made inthe explosion, e.g., silicon and oxygen. however, by varying uncertain physics,especially the mass loss rate for massive stars and the rate for the neon-22 tomagnesium-25 reaction rate, acceptable nucleosynthesis might still be achievedwith a cutoff as low as 18 solar masses. this would require a supernovafrequency three times greater than the fiducial value obtained when all starsexplode in order to produce the required oxygen-16. the nucleosynthesis ofiron-60 and aluminum-26 is also examined.

1505.06712	the remarkable deaths of 9 - 11 solar mass stars	the post-helium burning evolution of stars from 7 to 11 solar masses iscomplicated by the lingering effects of degeneracy and off-center ignition.here stars in this mass range are studied using a standard set of stellarphysics. two important aspects of the study are the direct coupling of areaction network of roughly 220 nuclei to the structure calculation at allstages and the use of a sub grid model to describe the convective bounded flamethat develops during neon and oxygen burning. below 9.0 solar masses,degenerate oxygen-neon cores form that may become either white dwarfs orelectron-capture supernovae. above 10.3 solar masses the evolution proceeds"normally" to iron-core collapse, without composition inversions or degenerateflashes. emphasis here is upon the stars in between which typically igniteoxygen burning off center. after oxygen burns in a convectively bounded flame,silicon burning ignites in a degenerate flash that commences closer to thestellar center and with increasing violence for stars of larger mass. in somecases the silicon flash is so violent that it could lead to the early ejectionof the hydrogen envelope. this might have interesting observable consequences.for example, the death of a 10.0 solar mass star could produce twosupernova-like displays, a faint low energy event due to the silicon flash, andan unusually bright supernova many months later as the low energy ejecta fromcore collapse collides with the previously ejected envelope. the potentialrelation to the crab supernova is discussed.

astro-ph;0007176	pair-instability supernovae, gravity waves, and gamma-ray transients	growing theoretical evidence suggests that the first generation of stars mayhave been quite massive (~100-300 solar masses). if they retain their high massuntil death, such stars will, after about 3myr, make pair-instabilitysupernovae. we consider the complete evolution of two zero-metallicity stars of250 and 300 solar masses. explosive oxygen and silicon burning cause the 130solar mass helium core to explode, but explosive burning is unable to drive anexplosion in the 300 solar mass star and it collapses to a black hole. for thisstar, the calculated angular momentum in the presupernova model is sufficientto delay black hole formation and the star initially forms a 50 solar mass,1000km core within which neutrinos are trapped. although the star does notbecome dynamically unstable, the calculated growth time of secular rotationalinstabilities is shorter than the black hole formation time, and suchinstabilities may develop. we estimate the energy and amplitude of thegravitational waves emitted during this collapse. after the black hole forms,accretion continues through a disk. although the disk is far too large and coolto transport energy efficiently to the rotational axis by neutrinoannihilation, it has ample potential energy to produce a 1e54erg jet driven bymagnetic fields. the interaction of this jet with surrounding circumstellar gasmay produce an energetic gamma-ray transient, but given the redshift and timescale, this is probably not a model for typical gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;0009410	on the stability of very massive primordial stars	the stability of metal-free very massive stars ($z$ = 0; $m = 120 - 500\msol$) is analyzed and compared with metal-enriched stars. such zero-metalstars are unstable to nuclear-powered radial pulsations on the main sequence,but the growth time scale for these instabilities is much longer than for theirmetal-rich counterparts. since they stabilize quickly after evolving off thezams, the pulsation may not have sufficient time to drive appreciable mass lossin z = 0 stars. for reasonable assumptions regarding the efficiency ofconverting pulsational energy into mass loss, we find that, even for the largermasses considered, the star may die without losing a large fraction of itsmass. we find a transition between the $\epsilon$- and $\kappa$-mechanisms forpulsational instability at $z\sim 2\e{-4} - 2\e{-3}$. for the most metal-richstars, the $\kappa$-mechanism yields much shorter $e$-folding times, indicatingthe presence of a strong instability. we thus stress the fundamental differenceof the stability and late stages of evolution between very massive stars bornin the early universe and those that might be born today.

astro-ph;0011507	presupernova evolution with improved rates for weak interactions	recent shell-model calculations of weak-interaction rates for nuclei in themass range a = 45 - 65 have resulted in substantial revisions to the hithertostandard set of fuller, fowler, &amp; newman (ffn). in particular, keyelectron-capture rates, such as that for co60 are much smaller. we considerhere the effects of these revised rates on the presupernova (post-oxygenburning) evolution of massive stars in the mass range 11 to 40 m_sun. moreover,we include, for the first time in models by our group, the effects of modernrates for beta-decay in addition to electron capture and positron emission.values for the central electron mole number at the time of iron core collapsein the new models are typically larger, by delta y_e = 0.005 to 0.015, thanthose of woosley &amp; weaver 1995, with a tendency for the more massive models todisplay larger differences. about half of this change is a consequence ofincluding beta-decay; the other half, result of the smaller rates for electroncapture. unlike what might be expected solely on basis of the larger y_e's, thenew iron core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in theentropy in the outer iron core. the changes in iron core mass range from zeroto 0.1 m_sun. we also observe, as predicted by aufderheide et al. (1994), atendency towards beta-equilibrium just prior to the collapse of the core, andthe subsequent loss of that equilibrium as core collapse proceeds. we discussthe key weak reaction rates, both beta-decay and electron-capture, responsiblefor the evolution of y_e and make suggestions for future measurements.

astro-ph;0107037	the nucleosynthetic signature of population iii	growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have beenquite massive (~100-300 m_sun). could these stars have left a distinctnucleosynthetic signature? we explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores inthe mass range m_he=64 to 133 msun, corresponding to main-sequence star massesof approximately 140 to 260 m_sun. above m_he=133 m_sun, without rotation andusing current reaction rates, a black hole is formed and no nucleosynthesis isejected. for lighter helium core masses, ~40 to 63 m_sun, violent pulsationsoccur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like massejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostaticequilibrium. it is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thuscleanly separating the heavy element nucleosynthesis of pair instabilitysupernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. indeed, black holeformation is a likely outcome for all population iii stars with main sequencemasses between about 25 m_sun and 140 m_sun (m_he = 9 to 63 m_sun) as well asthose above 260 m_sun. nucleosynthesis in pair-instability supernovae variesgreatly with the mass of the helium core which determines the maximumtemperature reached during the bounce. at the upper range of exploding coremasses, a maximum of 57 m_sun of ni56 is produced making these the mostenergetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe.integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instabilitysupernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclearcharge, but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclearcharge. also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced due to alack of s- and r-processes.

astro-ph;0207436	relativistic jets in collapsars	we examine the propagation of 2-dimensional relativistic jets through thestellar progenitor in the collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts. in agreementwith previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by theirpassage through the stellar mantle. interaction of these jets with the star andtheir own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. wespeculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variablelorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex lightcurves seen in many grbs. in all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep insidethe star following a brief period of adiabatic expansion. the jet that finallyemerges from the star thus has a moderate lorentz factor, modulated by mixing,and a very large internal energy. in a second series of calculations, we followthe escape of that sort of jet. because of the large ratio of internal tokinetic energy in both the jet and its cocoon, the opening angle of the finaljet is significantly greater than at breakout. a small amount of materialemerges at large angles, but with a lorentz factor still sufficiently large tomake a weak grb. this leads us to propose a "unified model" in which a varietyof high energy transients, ranging from x-ray flashes to "classic" grbs, may beseen depending upon the angle at which a standard collapsar is observed. wealso speculate that the breakout of a relativistic jet and its collision withthe stellar wind will produce a brief transient with properties similar to theclass of "short-hard" grbs. implications of our calculations for grb lightcurves, the luminosity-variability relation, and the grb-supernova associationare also discussed.

astro-ph;0307425	models for type i x-ray bursts with improved nuclear physics	multi-zone models of type i x-ray bursts are presented that use an adaptivenuclear reaction network of unprecedented size, up to 1300 isotopes. sequencesof up to 15 bursts are followed for two choices of accretion rate andmetallicity. at 0.1 eddington (and 0.02 eddington for low metallicity),combined hydrogen-helium flashes occur. the rise times, shapes, and tails ofthese light curves are sensitive to the efficiency of nuclear burning atvarious waiting points along the rp-process path and these sensitivities areexplored. the bursts show "compositional inertia", in that their propertiesdepend on the fact that accretion occurs onto the ashes of previous burstswhich contain left-over hydrogen, helium and cno nuclei. this acts to reducethe sensitivity of burst properties to metallicity. for the accretion ratesstudied, only the first anomalous burst in one model produces nuclei as heavyas a=100, other bursts make chiefly nuclei with a~64. the amount of carbonremaining after hydrogen-helium bursts is typically &lt;1% by mass, and decreasesfurther as the ashes are periodically heated by subsequent bursts. at the loweraccretion rate of 0.02 eddington and solar metallicity, the bursts ignite in ahydrogen-free helium layer. at the base of this layer, up to 90% of the heliumhas already burned to carbon prior to the unstable ignition. thesehelium-ignited bursts have briefer, brighter light curves with shorter tails,very rapid rise times (&lt;0.1 s), and ashes lighter than the iron group.

astro-ph;0409446	nucleosynthesis in the hot convective bubble in core-collapse supernovae	as an explosion develops in the collapsed core of a massive star, neutrinoemission drives convection in a hot bubble of radiation, nucleons, and pairsjust outside a proto-neutron star. shortly thereafter, neutrinos drive awind-like outflow from the neutron star. in both the convective bubble and theearly wind, weak interactions temporarily cause a proton excess (ye &gt; 0.5) todevelop in the ejected matter. this situation lasts for at least the firstsecond, and the approximately 0.05 - 0.1 solar masses that is ejected has anunusual composition that may be important for nucleosynthesis. using tracerparticles to follow the conditions in a two-dimensional model of a successfulsupernova explosion calculated by janka, buras &amp; rampp (2003), we determine thecomposition of this material. most of it is helium and 56ni. the rest isrelatively rare species produced by the decay of proton-rich isotopes unstableto positron emission. in the absence of pronounced charged-current neutrinocapture, nuclear flow will be held up by long-lived waiting point nuclei in thevicinity of 64ge. the resulting abundance pattern can be modestly rich in a fewinteresting rare isotopes like 45sc, 49ti, and 64zn. the present calculationsimply yields that, when compared with the production of major species in therest of the supernova, are about those needed to account for the solarabundance of 45sc and 49ti. since the synthesis will be nearly the same instars of high and low metallicity, the primary production of these species mayhave discernible signatures in the abundances of low metallicity stars. we alsodiscuss uncertainties in the nuclear physics and early supernova evolution towhich abundances of interesting nuclei are sensitive.

astro-ph;0509731	sn 2005bf: a possible transition event between type ib/c supernovae and  gamma ray bursts	we present u'g'r'i'bv photometry and optical spectroscopy of the type ib/icsn 2005bf covering the first ~100 days following discovery. the u'g'bv lightcurves displayed a double-peaked morphology, which is among type ib/icsupernovae. the bolometric light curve indicates that sn 2005bf was aremarkably luminous event. spectroscopically, sn 2005bf underwent a uniquetransformation from a type ic-like event at early times to a typical type ibsupernova at later phases. the initial maximum in u'g'bv was accompanied by thepresence in the spectrum of high velocity absorption lines of fe ii, ca ii, andh i. the photospheric velocity derived from spectra at early epochs wasunusually low compared with ordinary type ib supernovae. we describeone-dimensional computer simulations which attempt to account for theseremarkable properties. the most favored model is that of a very energetic (2 x10^{51} erg), asymmetric explosion of a massive (8.3 m_sun) wolf-rayet wn starthat had lost most of its hydrogen envelope. we speculate that an unobservedrelativistic jet was launched producing a two-component explosion consisting of1) a polar explosion containing a small fraction of the total mass and movingat high velocity, and 2) the explosion of the rest of the star. at first, onlythe polar explosion is observed, producing the initial maximum and the highvelocity absorption-line spectrum resembling a type ic event. at late times,this fast-moving component becomes optically-thin, revealing the slower-movingexplosion of the rest of the star and transforming the observed spectrum tothat of a typical type ib supernova. if this scenario is correct, then sn2005bf is the best example to date of a transition object between normal typeib/ic supernovae and gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0511194	nucleosynthesis in early supernova winds ii: the role of neutrinos	one of the outstanding unsolved riddles of nuclear astrophysics is the originof the so called ``p-process'' nuclei from a = 92 to 126. both the lighter andheavier p-process nuclei are adequately produced in the neon and oxygen shellsof ordinary type ii supernovae, but the origin of these intermediate isotopes,especially 92,94mo and 96,98ru, has long been mysterious. here we explore theproduction of these nuclei in the neutrino-driven wind from a young neutronstar. we consider such early times that the wind still contains a proton excessbecause the rates for electron neutrino and positron captures on neutrons arefaster than those for the inverse captures on protons. following a suggestionby frohlich et al. 2005, we also include the possibility that, in addition tothe protons, alpha-particles, and heavy seed, a small flux of neutrons ismaintained by the reaction p(bar(nu_e),e+)n. this flux of neutrons is criticalin bridging the long waiting points along the path of the rp-process by (n,p)and (n,gamma) reactions. using the unmodified ejecta histories from a recenttwo-dimensional supernova model by janka et al. 2003, we find synthesis ofp-rich nuclei up to 102pd. however, if the entropy of these ejecta is increasedby a factor of two, the synthesis extends to 120te. still larger increases inentropy, that might reflect the role of magnetic fields or vibrational energyinput neglected in the hydrodynamical model, result in the production ofnumerous r-, s-, and p-process nuclei up to a approximately 170, even in windsthat are proton-rich.

astro-ph;0602163	evidence for a supernova associated with the x-ray flash 020903	we present ground-based and hubble space telescope optical observations ofthe x-ray flash (xrf) 020903, covering 300 days. the afterglow showed a veryrapid rise in the first day, followed by a relatively slow decay in the nextfew days. there was a clear bump in the light curve after ~25 days, accompaniedby a drastic change in the spectral energy distribution. the light curve andthe spectral energy distribution are naturally interpreted as the emergence --and subsequent decay -- of a supernova (sn), similar to sn 1998bw. at peakluminosity, the sn is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 mag fainter than sn1998bw.this argues in favor of the existence of a supernova associated with this x-rayflash. a spectrum obtained 35 days after the burst shows emission lines fromthe host galaxy. we use this spectrum to put an upper limit on the oxygenabundance of the host at [o/h] &lt; -0.6 dex. we also discuss a possible trendbetween the softness of several bursts and the early behavior of the opticalafterglow, in the sense that xrfs and x-ray rich grbs seem to have a plateauphase or even a rising light curve. this can be naturally explained in modelswhere xrfs are similar to grbs but seen off the jet axis.

astro-ph;0607110	prompt and afterglow emission properties of gamma-ray bursts with  spectroscopically identified supernovae	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the prompt and afterglow emissionof four nearby long-soft gamma-ray bursts (grbs 980425, 030329, 031203, and060218) that were spectroscopically found to be associated with type icsupernovae, and compare them to the general grb population. for each event, weinvestigate the spectral and luminosity evolution, and estimate the totalenergy budget based upon broadband observations. the observational inventoryfor these events has become rich enough to allow estimates of their energycontent in relativistic and sub-relativistic form. the result is a globalportrait of the effects of the physical processes responsible for producinglong-soft grbs. in particular, we find that the values of the energy releasedin mildly relativistic outflows appears to have a significantly smaller scatterthan those found in highly relativistic ejecta. this is consistent with apicture in which the energy released inside the progenitor star is roughlystandard, while the fraction of that energy that ends up in highly relativisticejecta outside the star can vary dramatically between different events.

astro-ph;0609088	off-center ignition in type ia supernova: i. initial evolution and  implications for delayed detonation	the explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf as a type ia supernova is knownto be sensitive to the manner in which the burning is ignited. studies of thepre-supernova evolution suggest asymmetric, off-center ignition, and here weexplore its consequences in two- and three-dimensional simulations. comparedwith centrally ignited models, one-sided ignitions initially burn less andrelease less energy. for the distributions of ignition points studied, ignitionwithin two hemispheres typically leads to the unbinding of the white dwarf,while ignition within a small fraction of one hemisphere does not. we alsoexamine the spreading of the blast over the surface of the white dwarf thatoccurs as the first plumes of burning erupt from the star. in particular, ourstudies test whether the collision of strong compressional waves can trigger adetonation on the far side of the star as has been suggested by plewa et al.(2004). the maximum temperature reached in these collisions is sensitive to howmuch burning and expansion has already gone on, and to the dimensionality ofthe calculation. though detonations are sometimes observed in 2d models, noneever happens in the corresponding 3d calculations. collisions between theexpansion fronts of multiple bubbles also seem, in the usual case, unable toignite a detonation. "gravitationally confined detonation" is therefore not arobust mechanism for the explosion. detonation may still be possible in thesemodels however, either following a pulsation or by spontaneous detonation ifthe turbulent energy is high enough.

astro-ph;0609431	constraining deflagration models of type ia supernovae through  intermediate-mass elements	the physical structure of a nuclear flame is a basic ingredient of the theoryof type ia supernovae (snia). assuming an exponential density reduction withseveral characteristic times we have followed the evolution of a planar nuclearflame in an expanding background from an initial density 6.6 10^7 g/cm3 down to2 10^6 g/cm3. the total amount of synthesized intermediate-mass elements (ime),from silicon to calcium, was monitored during the calculation. we have made useof the computed mass fractions, x_ime, of these elements to give an estimationof the total amount of ime synthesized during the deflagration of a massivewhite dwarf. using x_ime and adopting the usual hypothesis that turbulencedecouples the effective burning velocity from the laminar flame speed, so thatthe relevant flame speed is actually the turbulent speed on the integrallength-scale, we have built a simple geometrical approach to model the regionwhere ime are thought to be produced. it turns out that a healthy production ofime involves the combination of not too short expansion times, t_c &gt; 0.2 s, andhigh turbulent intensities. according to our results it could be difficult toproduce much more than 0.2 solar masses of intermediate-mass elements withinthe deflagrative paradigma. the calculations also suggest that the mass of imescales with the mass of fe-peak elements, making it difficult to conciliateenergetic explosions with low ejected nickel masses, as in the well observedsn1991bg or in sn1998de. thus a large production of si-peak elements,especially in combination with a low or a moderate production of iron, could bebetter addressed by either the delayed detonation route in standardchandrasekhar-mass models or, perhaps, by the off-center helium detonation inthe sub chandrasekhar-mass scenario.

astro-ph;0609540	on the origin of the type ia supernova width-luminosity relation	brighter type ia supernovae (sne ia) have broader, more slowly decliningb-band light curves than dimmer sne ia. we study the physical origin of thiswidth-luminosity relation (wlr) using detailed radiative transfer calculationsof chandrasekhar mass sn ia models. we find that the luminosity dependence ofthe diffusion time (emphasized in previous studies) is in fact of secondaryrelevance in understanding the model wlr. instead, the essential physicsinvolves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of sneia. following maximum-light, the sn colors are increasingly affected by thedevelopment of numerous fe ii/co ii lines which blanket the b-band and, at thesame time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. because dimmer sne iaare generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of fe iii to fe iirecombination in the iron-group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a morerapid evolution of the sn colors to the red. the faster b-band decline rate ofdimmer sne ia thus reflects their faster ionization evolution.

astro-ph;0609562	type ia supernova light curves	the diversity of type ia supernova (sn ia) photometry is explored using agrid of 130 one-dimensional models. it is shown that the observable propertiesof sne ia resulting from chandrasekhar-mass explosions are chiefly determinedby their final composition and some measure of ``mixing'' in the explosion. agrid of final compositions is explored including essentially all combinationsof 56ni, stable ``iron'', and intermediate mass elements that result in anunbound white dwarf. light curves (and in some cases spectra) are calculatedfor each model using two different approaches to the radiation transportproblem. within the resulting templates are models that provide goodphotometric matches to essentially the entire range of observed sne ia. on thewhole, the grid of models spans a wide range in b-band peak magnitudes anddecline rates, and does not obey a phillips relation. in particular, modelswith the same mass of 56ni show large variations in their light curve declinerates. we identify the physical parameters responsible for this dispersion, andconsider physically motivated ``cuts'' of the models that agree better with thephillips relation. for example, models that produce a constant total mass ofburned material of 1.1 +/- msun do give a crude phillips relation, albeit withmuch scatter. the scatter is further reduced if one restricts that set tomodels that make 0.1 to 0.3 msun of stable iron and nickel isotopes, and thenmix the ejecta strongly between the center and 0.8 msun. we conclude that thesupernovae that occur most frequently in nature are highly constrained by thephillips relation and that a large part of the currently observed scatter inthe relation is likely a consequence of the intrinsic diversity of theseobjects.

astro-ph;0609691	surface detonation in type ia supernova explosions?	we explore the evolution of thermonuclear supernova explosions when theprogenitor white dwarf star ignites asymmetrically off-center. severalnumerical simulations are carried out in two and three dimensions to test theconsequences of different initial flame configurations such as sphericalbubbles displaced from the center, more complex deformed configurations, andteardrop-shaped ignitions. the burning bubbles float towards the surface whilereleasing energy due to the nuclear reactions. if the energy release is toosmall to gravitationally unbind the star, the ash sweeps around it, once theburning bubble approaches the surface. collisions in the fuel on the oppositeside increase its temperature and density and may -- in some cases -- initiatea detonation wave which will then propagate inward burning the core of the starand leading to a strong explosion. however, for initial setups in twodimensions that seem realistic from pre-ignition evolution, as well as for allthree-dimensional simulations the collimation of the surface material is foundto be too weak to trigger a detonation.

astro-ph;0610635	swift detects a remarkable gamma-ray burst, grb 060614, that introduces  a new classification scheme	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are known to come in two duration classes, separatedat ~2 s. long bursts originate from star forming regions in galaxies, haveaccompanying supernovae (sne) when near enough to observe and are likely causedby massive-star collapsars. recent observations show that short burstsoriginate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation ratesconsistent with binary neutron star (ns) or ns - black hole (bh) mergers.moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no sne havebeen so far associated with short grbs. we report here on the bright, nearbygrb 060614 that does not fit in either class. its ~102 s duration groups itwith long grbs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely withinthe short grb subclass. moreover, very deep optical observations exclude anaccompanying supernova, similar to short grbs. this combination of a longduration event without accompanying sn poses a challenge to both a collapsarand merging ns interpretation and opens the door on a new grb classificationscheme that straddles both long and short bursts.

astro-ph;0701083	fallback and black hole production in massive stars	the compact remnants of core collapse supernovae - neutron stars and blackholes - have properties that reflect both the structure of their stellarprogenitors and the physics of the explosion. in particular, the masses ofthese remnants are sensitive to the density structure of the presupernova starand to the explosion energy. to a considerable extent, the final mass isdetermined by the ``fallback'', during the explosion, of matter that initiallymoves outwards, yet ultimately fails to escape. we consider here the simulatedexplosion of a large number of massive stars (10 to 100 \msun) of population i(solar metallicity) and iii (zero metallicity), and find systematic differencesin the remnant mass distributions. as pointed out by chevalier(1989),supernovae in more compact progenitor stars have stronger reverse shocks andexperience more fallback. for population iii stars above about 25 \msun andexplosion energies less than $1.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg, black holes are a commonoutcome, with masses that increase monotonically with increasing main sequencemass up to a maximum hole mass of about 35 \msun. if such stars produce primarynitrogen, however, their black holes are systematically smaller. for modernsupernovae with nearly solar metallicity, black hole production is much lessfrequent and the typical masses, which depend sensitively on explosion energy,are smaller. we explore the neutron star initial mass function for bothpopulations and, for reasonable assumptions about the initial mass cut of theexplosion, find good agreement with the average of observed masses of neutronstars in binaries. we also find evidence for a bimodal distribution of neutronstar masses with a spike around 1.2 \msun (gravitational mass) and a broaderdistribution peaked around 1.4 \msun.

astro-ph;0701320	models for gamma-ray bursts and diverse transients	the observational diversity of ``gamma-ray bursts'' (grbs) has beenincreasing, and the natural inclination is a proliferation of models. weexplore the possibility that at least part of this diversity is a consequenceof a single basic model for the central engine operating in a massive star ofvariable mass, differential rotation rate, and mass loss rate. whatever thatcentral engine may be - and here the collapsar is used as a reference point -it must be capable of generating both a narrowly collimated, highlyrelativistic jet to make the grb, and a wide angle, sub-relativistic outflowresponsible for exploding the star and making the supernova bright. to someextent, the two components may vary independently, so it is possible to producea variety of jet energies and supernova luminosities. we explore, inparticular, the production of low energy bursts and find a lower limit,$\sim10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to the power required for a jet to escape a massivestar before that star either explodes or is accreted. lower energy bursts andand ``suffocated'' bursts may be particularly prevalent when the metallicity ishigh, i.e., in the modern universe at low redshift.

astro-ph;9711055	a comparative modeling of supernova 1993j	the light curve of supernova (sn) 1993j is calculated using two approaches toradiation transport as exemplified by the two computer codes, stella andeddington. particular attention is paid to shock breakout and the photometry inthe u, b, and v bands during the first 120 days. the hydrodynamical model, theexplosion of a 13 msun star which had lost most of its hydrogenic envelope to acompanion, is the same in each calculation. the comparison elucidatesdifferences between the approaches and also serves to validate the results ofboth. stella includes implicit hydrodynamics and is able to model supernovaevolution at early times, before the expansion is homologous. stella alsoemploys multi-group photonics and is able to follow the radiation as itdecouples from the matter. eddington uses a different algorithm for integratingthe transport equation, assumes homologous expansion, and uses a finerfrequency resolution. good agreement is achieved between the two codes onlywhen compatible physical assumptions are made about the opacity. a new resultfor sn 1993j is a prediction of the continuum spectrum near the shock breakout(calculated by stella) which is superior to the results of other standardsingle energy group hydrocodes such as visphot or titan. based on the resultsof our independent codes, we discuss the uncertainties involved in the currenttime dependent models of supernova light curves.

astro-ph;9802112	gamma-ray bursts from neutron star phase transitions	the phase-transition induced collapse of a neutron star to a more compactconfiguration (typically a ``strange'' star) and the subsequent core bounce isoften invoked as a model for gamma-ray bursts. we present the results ofnumerical simulations of this kind of event using realistic neutrino physicsand a high density equation of state. the nature of the collapse itself isrepresented by the arbitrary motion of a piston deep within the star, but ifany shock is to develop, the transition, or at least its final stages, mustoccur in less than a sonic time. fine surface zoning is employed to adequatelyrepresent the acceleration of the shock to relativistic speeds and to determinethe amount and energy of the ejecta. we find that these explosions are far toobaryon-rich (ejected mass &gt; 0.01 solar masses) and have much too low an energyto explain gamma-ray bursts. the total energy of the ejecta having relativisticlorentz factors &gt; 40 is less than 10^46 erg even in our most optimistic models(deep bounce, no neutrino losses or photodisintegration). however, the totalenergy of all the ejecta, mostly mildly relativistic, is roughly 10^51 erg and,if they occur, these events might be observed. they would also contribute togalactic nucleosynthesis, especially the r-process, even though the mostenergetic layers are composed of helium and nucleons, not heavy elements.

astro-ph;9804167	helium star/black hole mergers: a new gamma-ray burst model	we present a model for gamma-ray bursts (grb's) in which a stellar mass blackhole acquires a massive accretion disk by merging with the helium core of itsred giant companion. the black hole enters the helium core after it, or itsneutron star progenitor, first experiences a common envelope phase that carriesit inwards through the hydrogen envelope. accretion of the last several solarmasses of helium occurs on a time scale of roughly a minute and provides aneutrino luminosity of approximately 10^51 - 10^52 erg/s. neutrinoannihilation, 0.01% to 0.1% efficient, along the rotational axis then gives abaryon loaded fireball of electron-positron pairs and radiation (about10$^{50}$ erg total) whose beaming and relativistic interaction withcircumstellar material makes the grb (e.g., rees &amp; meszaros 1992). the usefulenergy can be greatly increased if energy can be extracted from the rotationalenergy of the black hole by magnetic interaction with the disk. such eventsshould occur at a rate comparable to that of merging neutron stars and blackhole neutron star pairs and may be responsible for long complex grb's, but notshort hard ones.

astro-ph;9807028	hyper-accreting black holes and gamma-ray bursts	a variety of current models for gamma-ray bursts (grbs) suggest a commonengine - a black hole of several solar masses accreting matter from a disk at arate 0.01 to 10 solar masses per second. using a numerical model forrelativistic disk accretion, we have studied steady-state accretion at thesehigh rates. inside a radius ~ 10**8 cm, for accretion rates greater than about0.01 solar masses per second, a global state of balanced power comes to existbetween neutrino losses, chiefly pair capture on nucleons, and dissipation.energy emitted in neutrinos is less, and in the case of low accretion rates,very much less, than the maximum efficiency factor for black hole accretion(0.057 for no rotation; 0.42 for extreme kerr rotation) times mdot c**2. theefficiency for producing a pair fireball along the rotational axis by neutrinoannihilation is calculated and found to be highly variable and very sensitiveto the accretion rate. for some of the higher accretion rates studied, it canbe several per cent or more; for accretion rates less than 0.05 solar massesper second, it is essentially zero. the efficiency of the blandford-znajekmechanism in extracting rotational energy from the black hole is alsoestimated. in light of these results, the viability of various gamma-ray burstmodels is discussed and the sensitivity of the results to disk viscosity, blackhole rotation rate, and black hole mass explored. a diverse range of grbenergies seems unavoidable and neutrino annihilation in hyper-accreting blackhole systems can explain bursts up to 10**52 erg. larger energies may beinferred for beaming systems.

astro-ph;9808094	merging white dwarf/black hole binaries and gamma-ray bursts	the merger of compact binaries, especially black holes and neutron stars, isfrequently invoked to explain gamma-ray bursts (grb's). in this paper, wepresent three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the relativelyneglected mergers of white dwarfs and black holes. during the merger, the whitedwarf is tidally disrupted and sheared into an accretion disk. nuclearreactions are followed and the energy release is negligible. peak accretionrates are ~0.05 msun/s (less for lower mass white dwarfs) lasting forapproximately a minute. many of the disk parameters can be explained by asimple analytic model which we derive and compare to our simulations. thismodel can be used to predict accretion rates for white dwarf and black hole (orneutron star) masses which are not simulated in this paper. although themergers studied here create disks with larger radii, and longer accretion timesthan those from the merger of double neutron stars, a larger fraction of themerging star's mass becomes part of the disk. thus the merger of a white dwarfand a black hole could produce a long duration grb. the event rate of thesemergers may be as high as 1/myr per galaxy.

astro-ph;9810274	collapsars - gamma-ray bursts and explosions in "failed supernovae"	using a two-dimensional hydrodynamics code (prometheus), we study thecontinued evolution of rotating massive helium stars whose iron core collapsedoes not produce a successful outgoing shock, but instead forms a black hole.we study the formation of a disk, the associated flow patterns, and theaccretion rate for disk viscosity parameter, alpha ~ 0.001 and 0.1. for thestandard 14 solar mass model the average accretion rate for 15 s is 0.07 solarmasses per second and the total energy deposited along the rotational axes byneutrino annihilation is (1 - 14) x 10**51 erg, depending upon the evolution ofthe kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. simulated deposition ofthis energy in the polar regions results in strong relativistic outflow - jetsbeamed to about 1.5% of the sky. the jets remain highly focused, and arecapable of penetrating the star in 5 - 10 s. after the jet breaks through thesurface of the star, highly relativistic flow can commence. because of thesensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum,and disk viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences withviewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible ranging from bright grbslike grb 971214 to faint grb-supernovae like sn 1998bw. x-ray precursors arealso possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. while only a smallfraction of supernovae make grbs, we predict that all grbs longer than a fewseconds will make supernovae similar to sn 1998bw. however, hard, energeticgrbs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to make in this model.

astro-ph;9904122	formation rates of black hole accretion disk gamma-ray bursts	while many models have been proposed for grbs, those currently favored areall based upon the formation of and/or rapid accretion into stellar mass blackholes. we present population synthesis calculations of these models using amonte carlo approach in which the many uncertain parameters intrinsic to suchcalculations are varied. we estimate the event rate for each class of model aswell as the propagation distance for those having significant delay betweenformation and burst production, i.e., double neutron star (dns) mergers andblack hole-neutron star (bh/ns) mergers. for reasonable assumptions regardingthe many uncertainties in population synthesis, we calculate a daily event ratein the universe for i) merging neutron stars: ~100/day; ii) neutron-star blackhole mergers: ~450/day; iii) collapsars: ~10,000/day; iv) helium star blackhole mergers: ~1000/day; and v) white dwarf black hole mergers: ~20/day. therange of uncertainty in these numbers however, is very large, typically two tothree orders of magnitude. these rates must additionally be multiplied by anyrelevant beaming factor and sampling fraction (if the entire universal set ofmodels is not being observed). depending upon the mass of the host galaxy, halfof the dns and bh/ns mergers will happen within 60kpc (for a milky-way massedgalaxy) to 5mpc (for a galaxy with negligible mass) from the galactic center.because of the delay time, neutron star and black hole mergers will happen at aredshift 0.5 to 0.8 times that of the other classes of models. information isstill lacking regarding the hosts of short hard bursts, but we suggest thatthey are due to dns and bh/ns mergers and thus will ultimately be determined tolie outside of galaxies and at a closer mean distance than long complex bursts(which we attribute to collapsars).

astro-ph;9904132	presupernova evolution of rotating massive stars i: numerical method and  evolution of the internal stellar structure	the evolution of rotating stars with zero-age main sequence (zams) masses inthe range 8 to 25 m_sun is followed through all stages of stable evolution. theinitial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotationalvelocity on the zams ranges from zero to ~ 70 % of break-up. redistribution ofangular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence ofrotationally induced circulation and instablities. the effects of thecentrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. uncertain mixingefficiencies are gauged by observations. we find, as noted in previous work,that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellarenvelopes with products of hydrogen burning. we determine, for the first time,the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along withtheir detailed chemical structure. angular momentum loss due to (non-magnetic)stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogenburning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of thecore. neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from thecore to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. we obtainspecific angular momenta for the iron core and overlaying material of1e16...1e17 erg s. these values are insensitive to the initial angularmomentum. they are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron corebefore it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close tobreak-up. they are also in the range required for the collapsar model ofgamma-ray bursts. the apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates ofyoung pulsars is discussed.

astro-ph;9909034	collapsars, gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae	a diverse range of phenomena is possible when a black hole experiences veryrapid accretion from a disk due to the incomplete explosion of a massivepresupernova star endowed with rotation. in the most extreme case, the outgoingshock fails promptly in a rotating helium star, a black hole and an accretiondisk form, and a strong gamma-ray burst (grb) results. however, there may alsobe more frequently realized cases where the black hole forms after a delay offrom several tens of seconds to several hours as approximately 0.1 to 5 solarmasses falls back into the collapsed remnant following a mildly successfulsupernova explosion. there, the same mhd mechanisms frequently invoked toproduce grbs would also produce jets in stars already in the process ofexploding. the presupernova star could be a wolf-rayet star or a red or bluesupergiant. depending upon its initial pressure, the collimation of the jet mayalso vary since ``hot'' jets will tend to diverge and share their energy withthe rest of the star. from these situations, one expects diverse outcomesranging from grbs with a large range of energies and durations, to asymmetric,energetic supernovae with weak grbs. sn 1998bw may have been the explosion of astar in which fall back produced a black hole and a less collimated jet than inthe case of prompt black hole formation.

astro-ph;9909508	distributed burning in type ia supernovae: a statistical approach	we present a statistical model which shows the influence of turbulence on athermonuclear flame propagating in c+o white dwarf matter. based on a montecarlo description of turbulence, it provides a method for investigating thephysics in the so-called distributed burning regime. using this method weperform numerical simulations of turbulent flames and show that in thisparticular regime the flamelet model for the turbulent flame velocity loses itsvalidity. in fact, at high turbulent intensities burning in the distributedregime can lead to a deceleration of the turbulent flame and thus induces acompeting process to turbulent effects that cause a higher flame speed. it isalso shown that in dense c+o matter turbulent heat transport is describedadequately by the peclet number, pe, rather than by the reynolds number, whichmeans that flame propagation is decoupled from small-scale turbulence. finally,at the onset of our results we argue that the available turbulent energy in anexploding c+o white dwarf is probably too low in order to make a deflagrationto detonation transition possible.

astro-ph;9910034	supernovae, jets, and collapsars	we consider the explosion of supernovae and the possible production of avariety of high energy transients by delayed black hole formation in massivestars endowed with rotation. following the launch of a ``successful'' shock bythe usual neutrino powered mechanism, the inner layers of the star moveoutwards, but lack adequate energy to eject all the matter exterior to theneutron star. over a period of minutes to hours a variable amount of mass,about 0.1 to 5 solar masses falls back into the collapsed remnant, oftenturning it into a black hole and establishing an accretion disk. the accretionrate, about 0.001 to 0.01 solar masses per second, is inadequate to produce ajet mediated by neutrino annihilation, but similar to that invoked inmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) models for gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we thus considerthe effect of jets formed by ``fallback'' in stars that are already in theprocess of exploding. we justify a parameterization of the jet power as aconstant times the mass accretion rate, $\epsilon \dot {\rm m} c^2$, andexplore the consequences of $\epsilon$ = 0.001 and 0.01. in supergiants, shockbreakout produces bright x-ray transients that might be a diagnostic of themodel. jets produced by fallback should be more frequent than those made by theprompt formation of a black hole and may power the most common form ofgamma-ray transient in the universe, although not the most common form seen sofar by batse. those are still attributed to prompt black hole formation, but itmay be that the diverse energies observed for grbs so far reflect chiefly thevariable collimation of the jet inside the star and a consequently highlyvariable fraction of relativistic ejecta. indeed, these events may all have acommon total energy near 10$^{52}$ erg.

astro-ph;9912484	gamma-ray bursts: the central engine	a variety of arguments suggest that the most common form of gamma-ray bursts(grbs), those longer than a few seconds, involve the formation of black holesin supernova-like events. two kinds of ``collapsar'' models are discussed,those in which the black hole forms promptly - a second or so after iron corecollapse - and those in which formation occurs later, following ``fallback''over a period of minutes to hours. in most cases, extraction of energy from arapidly accreting disk (and a rapidly rotating black hole) is achieved bymagnetohydrodynamical processes, although neutrino-powered models remain viablein cases where the accretion rate is &gt;0.05 solar masses per second. grbs arebut one observable phenomenon accompanying black hole birth and otherpossibilities are discussed, some of which (long, faint grbs and soft x-raytransients) may await discovery. since they all involve black holes of similarmass accreting one to several m\sun, collapsars have a nearly standard totalenergy, around 10**52 erg, but both the fraction of that energy ejected ashighly relativistic matter and the distribution of that energy with angle canbe highly variable. an explanation is presented why inferred grb luminositymight correlate inversely with time scales and arguments are given against theproduction of ordinary grbs by supergiant stars.

0810.5142	mixing in zero and solar metallicity supernovae	two-dimensional simulations of mixing and fall back in non-rotating massivestars have been carried out using realistic initial models for the presupernovastar and assuming standard spherically symmetric explosions of 1.2*10^51ergs.stars of 15 and 25 solar masses with both primordial and solar composition weremodeled. the zero metallicity supernova progenitors were compact blue stars andthe amount of rayleigh-taylor induced mixing in them was greatly reducedcompared with what was seen in the red supergiants with solar metallicity. thecompact zero-metal stars also experienced more fallback than their solarmetallicity counterparts. as a result, the ejected nucleosynthesis from the twopopulations was very different. for the simple explosion model assumed, lowmetallicity stars ejected ejected too little iron and intermediate masselements even to explain the abundance patterns in the most iron-poor starsfound to date, suggesting that some important ingredient is missing. rotationis likely to alter these conclusions by producing a greater fraction of redsupergiants among population iii stars. the velocities of the heavy elements inall models considered - both red and blue supergiants - were less than observedin sn 1987a, suggesting that at least occasionally, asymmetric aspects of theexplosion mechanism and fallback play a major role in mixing.

0811.2816	turbulence-flame interactions in type ia supernovae	the large range of time and length scales involved in type ia supernovae (snia) requires the use of flame models. as a prelude to exploring various optionsfor flame models, we consider, in this paper, high-resolution three-dimensionalsimulations of the small-scale dynamics of nuclear flames in the supernovaenvironment in which the details of the flame structure are fully resolved. therange of densities examined, 1 to $8 \times 10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$, spans thetransition from the laminar flamelet regime to the distributed burning regimewhere small scale turbulence disrupts the flame. the use of a low mach numberalgorithm facilitates the accurate resolution of the thermal structure of theflame and the inviscid turbulent kinetic energy cascade, while implicitlyincorporating kinetic energy dissipation at the grid-scale cutoff. for anassumed background of isotropic kolmogorov turbulence with an energycharacteristic of sn ia, we find a transition density between 1 and $3 \times10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$ where the nature of the burning changes qualitatively. by $1\times 10^7$ g cm$^{-3}$, energy diffusion by conduction and radiation isexceeded, on the flame scale, by turbulent advection. as a result, theeffective lewis number approaches unity. that is, the flame resembles a laminarflame, but is turbulently broadened with an effective diffusion coefficient,$d_t \sim u' l$, where $u'$ is the turbulent intensity and $l$ is the integralscale. for the larger integral scales characteristic of a real supernova, theflame structure is predicted to become complex and unsteady. implications for apossible transition to detonation are discussed.

0811.3610	type ia supernova: calculations of turbulent flames using the linear  eddy model	the nature of carbon burning flames in type ia supernovae is explored as theyinteract with kolmogorov turbulence. one-dimensional calculations using thelinear eddy model of kerstein (1991) elucidate three regimes of turbulentburning. in the simplest case, large scale turbulence folds and deforms thinlaminar flamelets to produce a flame brush with a total burning rate givenapproximately by the speed of turbulent fluctuations on the integral scale,u_l. this is the regime where the supernova explosion begins and where most ofits pre-detonation burning occurs. as the density declines, turbulence startsto tear the individual flamelets, making broader structures that move faster.for a brief time, these turbulent flamelets are still narrow compared to theirspacing and the concept of a flame brush moving with an overall speed of u_lremains valid. however, the typical width of the individual flamelets, which isgiven by the condition that their turnover time equals their burning time,continues to increase as the density declines. eventually, mixed regions almostas large as the integral scale itself are transiently formed. at that point, atransition to detonation can occur. the conditions for such a transition areexplored numerically and it is estimated that the transition will occur fordensities near 1 x 10**7 g/cm**3, provided the turbulent speed on the integralscale exceeds about 15% sonic. an example calculation shows the details of adetonation actually developing.
