0901.3269	the non-gaussianity of the cosmic shear likelihood - or: how odd is the  chandra deep field south?	(abridged) we study the validity of the approximation of a gaussian cosmicshear likelihood. we estimate the true likelihood for a fiducial cosmologicalmodel from a large set of ray-tracing simulations and investigate the impact ofnon-gaussianity on cosmological parameter estimation. we investigate how oddthe recently reported very low value of $\sigma_8$ really is as derived fromthe \textit{chandra} deep field south (cdfs) using cosmic shear by taking thenon-gaussianity of the likelihood into account as well as the possibility ofbiases coming from the way the cdfs was selected.  we find that the cosmic shear likelihood is significantly non-gaussian. thisleads to both a shift of the maximum of the posterior distribution and asignificantly smaller credible region compared to the gaussian case. were-analyse the cdfs cosmic shear data using the non-gaussian likelihood.assuming that the cdfs is a random pointing, we find$\sigma_8=0.68_{-0.16}^{+0.09}$ for fixed $\omega_{\rm m}=0.25$. in awmap5-like cosmology, a value equal to or lower than this would be expected in$\approx 5%$ of the times. taking biases into account arising from the way thecdfs was selected, which we model as being dependent on the number of haloes inthe cdfs, we obtain $\sigma_8 = 0.71^{+0.10}_{-0.15}$. combining the cdfs datawith the parameter constraints from wmap5 yields $\omega_{\rm m} =0.26^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.79^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ for a flatuniverse.

math;0603499	first steps towards $p$-adic langlands functoriality	by the theory of colmez and fontaine, a de rham representation of the galoisgroup of a local field roughly corresponds to a representation of theweil-deligne group equipped with an admissible filtration on the underlyingvector space. using a modification of the classical local langlandscorrespondence, we associate with any pair consisting of a weil-deligne grouprepresentation and a type of a filtration (admissible or not) a specificlocally algebraic representation of a general linear group. we advertise theconjecture that this pair comes from a de rham representation if and only ifthe corresponding locally algebraic representation carries an invariant norm.in the crystalline case, the weil-deligne group representation is unramifiedand the associated locally algebraic representation can be studied using theclassical satake isomorphism. by extending the latter to a specific normcompletion of the hecke algebra, we show that the existence of an invariantnorm implies that our pair, indeed, comes from a crystalline representation. wealso show, by using the formalism of tannakian categories, that this latterfact is compatible with classical unramified langlands functoriality andtherefore generalizes to arbitrary split reductive groups.

0905.0393	the removal of shear-ellipticity correlations from the cosmic shear  signal: influence of photometric redshift errors on the nulling technique	cosmic shear is regarded one of the most powerful probes to reveal theproperties of dark matter and dark energy. to fully utilize its potential, onehas to be able to control systematic effects down to below the level of thestatistical parameter errors. particularly worrisome in this respect isintrinsic alignment, causing considerable parameter biases via correlationsbetween the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the gravitational shear,which mimic lensing. in an earlier work we have proposed a nulling techniquethat downweights this systematic, only making use of its well-known redshiftdependence. we assess the practicability of nulling, given realistic conditionson photometric redshift information. for several simplified intrinsic alignmentmodels and a wide range of photometric redshift characteristics we calculate anaverage bias before and after nulling. modifications of the technique areintroduced to optimize the bias removal and minimize the information loss bynulling. we demonstrate that one of the presented versions is close to optimalin terms of bias removal, given high quality of photometric redshifts. forexcellent photometric redshift information, i.e. at least 10 bins with a smalldispersion, a negligible fraction of catastrophic outliers, and preciseknowledge about the redshift distributions, one version of nulling is capableof reducing the shear-intrinsic ellipticity contamination by at least a factorof 100. alternatively, we describe a robust nulling variant which suppressesthe systematic signal by about 10 for a very broad range of photometricredshift configurations. irrespective of the photometric redshift quality, aloss of statistical power is inherent to nulling, which amounts to a decreaseof the order 50% in terms of our figure of merit.

0907.1524	a fitting formula for the non-gaussian contribution to the lensing power  spectrum covariance	weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising tools to investigatethe equation-of-state of dark energy. in order to obtain reliable parameterestimations for current and future experiments, a good theoreticalunderstanding of dark matter clustering is essential. of particular interest isthe statistical precision to which weak lensing observables, such as cosmicshear correlation functions, can be determined. we construct a fitting formulafor the non-gaussian part of the covariance of the lensing power spectrum. thegaussian contribution to the covariance, which is proportional to the lensingpower spectrum squared, and optionally shape noise can be included easily byadding their contributions. starting from a canonical estimator for thedimensionless lensing power spectrum, we model first the covariance in the halomodel approach including all four halo terms for one fiducial cosmology andthen fit two polynomials to the expression found. on large scales, we use afirst-order polynomial in the wave-numbers and dimensionless power spectra thatgoes asymptotically towards $1.1 c_{pt}$ for $\ell \to 0$, i.e., the result forthe non-gaussian part of the covariance using tree-level perturbation theory.on the other hand, for small scales we employ a second-order polynomial in thedimensionless power spectra for the fit. we obtain a fitting formula for thenon-gaussian contribution of the convergence power spectrum covariance that isaccurate to 10% for the off-diagonal elements, and to 5% for the diagonalelements, in the range $50 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 5000$ and can be used forsingle source redshifts $z_{s} \in [0.5,2.0]$ in wmap5-like cosmologies.

0907.2901	bispectrum covariance in the flat-sky limit	to probe cosmological fields beyond the gaussian level, three-pointstatistics can be used, all of which are related to the bispectrum. hence,measurements of cmb anisotropies, galaxy clustering, and weak gravitationallensing alike have to rely upon an accurate theoretical background concerningthe bispectrum and its noise properties. if only small portions of the sky areconsidered, it is often desirable to perform the analysis in the flat-skylimit. we aim at a formal, detailed derivation of the bispectrum covariance inthe flat-sky approximation, focusing on a pure two-dimensional fourier-planeapproach. we define an unbiased estimator of the bispectrum, which takes theaverage over the overlap of annuli in fourier space, and compute its fullcovariance. the outcome of our formalism is compared to the flat-sky sphericalharmonic approximation in terms of the covariance, the behavior under paritytransformations, and the information content. we introduce a geometricalinterpretation of the averaging process in the estimator, thus providing anintuitive understanding. contrary to foregoing work, we find a difference by afactor of two between the covariances of the fourier-plane and the sphericalharmonic approach. we argue that this discrepancy can be explained by thediffering behavior with respect to parity. however, in an exemplary analysis itis demonstrated that the fisher information of both formalisms agrees to highaccuracy. via the geometrical interpretation we are able to link thenormalization in the bispectrum estimator to the area enclosed by the triangleconfiguration at consideration as well as to the wigner symbol, which leads toconvenient approximation formulae for the covariances of both approaches.

1002.0693	controlling intrinsic-shear alignment in three-point weak lensing  statistics	three-point weak lensing statistics provide cosmic information complementaryto that of two-point statistics. however, both statistics suffer fromintrinsic-shear alignment, which is one of their limiting systematics. thenulling technique is a model-independent method developed to eliminateintrinsic-shear alignment at the two-point level. in this paper we demonstratethat the nulling technique can also be naturally generalized to the three-pointlevel, controlling the corresponding ggi systematics. we show that under theassumption of exact redshift information the intrinsic-shear alignmentcontamination can be completely eliminated. to show how well the nullingtechnique performs on data with limited redshift information, we apply thenulling technique to three-point weak lensing statistics from a fictitioussurvey analogous to a typical future deep imaging survey, in which thethree-point intrinsic-shear alignment systematics is generated from a power-lawtoy model. using 10 redshift bins, the nulling technique leads to a factor of10 suppression of the ggi/ggg ratio, and reduces the bias on cosmologicalparameters to less than the original statistical error. more detailed redshiftinformation allowing for finer redshift bins leads to better reduction of bias.the information loss during the nulling procedure doubles the statistical erroron cosmological parameters. a comparison of the nulling technique with anunconditioned compression of the data suggests that part of the informationloss can be retained by considering higher-order nulling weights during thenulling procedure. a combined analysis of two- and three-point statisticsconfirms that the information contained in them is of comparable size and iscomplementary to each other, both before and after nulling.

1003.4211	intrinsic alignment boosting: direct measurement of intrinsic alignments  in cosmic shear data	intrinsic alignments constitute the major astrophysical systematic forcosmological weak lensing surveys. we present a purely geometrical method withwhich one can study gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity correlationsdirectly in weak lensing data. linear combinations of second-order cosmic shearmeasures are constructed such that the intrinsic alignment signal is boostedwhile suppressing the contribution by gravitational lensing. we then assess theperformance of a specific parametrisation of the weights entering these linearcombinations for three representative survey models. moreover a relationbetween this boosting technique and the intrinsic alignment removal via nullingis derived. for future all-sky weak lensing surveys with photometric redshiftinformation the boosting technique yields statistical errors on modelparameters of intrinsic alignments whose order of magnitude is compatible withcurrent constraints determined from indirect measurements. parameter biases dueto a residual cosmic shear signal are negligible in case of quasi-spectroscopicredshifts and remain sub-dominant for typical values of the photometricredshift scatter. we find good agreement between the performance of theintrinsic alignment removal based on the boosting technique and standardnulling methods, possibly indicating a fundamental limit in the separation oflensing and intrinsic alignment signals.

0708.4125	comparing cosmic shear measures - optimizing the information content of  cosmic shear data vectors	we introduce an optimized data vector of cosmic shear measures (n). this datavector has high information content, is not sensitive against b-modecontamination and only shows small correlation between data points of differentangular scales. we show that a data vector of the two-point correlationfunction (2pcf) in general contains more information on cosmological parameterscompared to a data vector of the aperture mass dispersion. reason for this isthe fact that &lt;m_ap^2&gt; lacks the information of the convergence power spectrum(p_\kappa) on large angular scales, which is contained in the 2pcf data vector.therefore we create a combined data vector n, which retains the advantages of&lt;m_ap^2&gt; and in addition is also sensitive to the large-scale information ofp_\kappa. we compare the information content of the three data vectors byperforming a detailed likelihood analysis and use ray-tracing simulations toderive the covariance matrices. in the last part of the paper we contaminateall data vectors with b-modes on small angular scales and examine theirrobustness against this contamination.the combined data vector stronglyimproves constraints on cosmological parameters compared to &lt;m_ap^2&gt;. although,in case of a pure e-mode signal the information content of the 2pcf is higher,in the more realistic case where b-modes are present the 2pcf data vector isstrongly contaminated and yields biased cosmological parameter estimates. nshows to be robust against this contamination. furthermore the individual datapoints of n show a much smaller correlation compared to the 2pcf leading to analmost diagonal covariance matrix.

astro-ph;0002500	detection of correlated galaxy ellipticities on cfht data: first  evidence for gravitational lensing by large-scale structures	we report the detection of a significant (5.5 sigma) excess of correlationsbetween galaxy ellipticities at scales ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 arc-minutes.this detection of a gravitational lensing signal by large-scale structure wasmade using a composite high quality imaging survey of 6300 arcmin^2 obtained atthe canada france hawaii telescope (cfht) with the uh8k and cfh12k panoramicccd cameras. the amplitude of the excess correlation is 2.2\pm 0.2 % at 1arcmin scale, in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lensing effectinduced by large-scale structure.we provide a quantitative analysis ofsystematics which could contribute to the signal and show that the net effectis small and can be corrected for. we show that the measured ellipticitycorrelations behave as expected for a gravitational shear signal. therelatively small size of our survey precludes tight constraints on cosmologicalmodels. however the data are in favor of cluster normalized cosmologicalmodels, and marginally reject cold dark matter models with (omega=0.3,sigma_8&lt;0.6) or (omega=1, sigma_8=1). the detection of cosmic sheardemonstrates the technical feasibility of using weak lensing surveys to measuredark matter clustering and the potential for cosmological parametermeasurements, in particular with upcoming wide field ccd cameras.

astro-ph;0112441	b-modes in cosmic shear from source redshift clustering	weak gravitational lensing by the large scale structure can be used to probethe dark matter distribution in the universe directly and thus to probecosmological models. the recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups hasdemonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. inthe currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that theshear field contains unexpected modes, so-called b-modes, which are thought tobe unaccountable for by lensing. b-modes can in principle be generated by anintrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or maysignify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. in thispaper we show that b-modes in fact {\it are produced} by lensing itself. theeffect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which inparticular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift.after presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field intoe- and b-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlationfunctions for a clustered source distribution. numerical and analyticalestimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resultingb-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but itsrelative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, withcomparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. the relevance of thiseffect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed.

astro-ph;0306238	the signature of substructure on gravitational lensing in the lcdm  cosmological model	we present a study of the lens properties of quadruply imaged systems, lensedby numerically simulated galaxies. we investigate a simulated elliptical anddisc galaxy drawn from high resolution simulations of galaxy formation in aconcordance $\lambda$cdm universe. the simulations include the effects of gasdynamics, star formation and feedback processes. flux-ratio anomalies observedin strong gravitational lensing potentially provide an indicator for thepresence of mass substructure in lens galaxies as predicted from cdmsimulations. we particularly concentrate on the prediction that, for an idealcusp caustic, the sum of the signed magnifications of the three highlymagnified images should vanish when the source approaches the cusp. strongviolation of this cusp relation indicates the presence of substructure,regardless of the global, smooth mass model of the lens galaxy. we draw thefollowing conclusions: (1) the level of substructure present in simulationsproduces violations of the cusp relation comparable to those observed, (2)higher-order catastrophes (e.g. swallowtails) can also cause changes of theorder of 0.6 in the cusp relation as predicted by a smooth model, (3) the fluxanomaly distribution depends on the image parity and flux and both thebrightest minimum and saddle-point images are more affected by substructurethan the fainter images. in addition, the brightest saddle point is demagnifiedw.r.t. the brightest minimum. our results are fully numerical and properlyinclude all mass scales, without making semi-analytic assumptions. they areultimately limited by the mass resolution of single particles in the simulationdetermined by current computational limits, however show that our results arenot affected by shot-noise due to the finite number of particles.

astro-ph;0404527	the influence of redshift information on galaxy-galaxy lensing  measurements	we investigate how galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements depend on the knowledgeof redshifts for lens and source galaxies. galaxy-galaxy lensing allows one tostudy dark matter halos of galaxies statistically using weak gravitationallensing. redshift information is required to reliably distinguish foregroundlens galaxies from background source galaxies and to convert the measured shearinto constraints on the lens model. without spectroscopy or multi-colourinformation, redshifts can be drawn from independently estimated probabilitydistributions. the combo-17 survey provides redshifts for both lens and sourcegalaxies. it thus offers the unique possibility to do this investigation withobservational data. we find that it is of great importance to know theredshifts of individual lens galaxies in order to constrain the properties oftheir dark matter halos. whether the redshifts are derived from $ubvri$ or thelarger number of filters available in combo-17 is not very important. incontrast, knowledge of individual source redshifts improves the measurementsonly very little over the use of statistical source redshift distributions aslong as the source redshift distribution is known accurately.

astro-ph;0606611	cosmic shear analysis of archival hst/acs data: i. comparison of early  acs pure parallel data to the hst/gems survey	this is the first paper of a series describing our measurement of weaklensing by large-scale structure using archival observations from the advancedcamera for surveys (acs) on board the hubble space telescope (hst).  in this work we present results from a pilot study testing the capabilitiesof the acs for cosmic shear measurements with early parallel observations andpresenting a re-analysis of hst/acs data from the gems survey and the goodsobservations of the chandra deep field south (cdfs). we describe our newcorrection scheme for the time-dependent acs psf based on observations ofstellar fields. this is currently the only technique which takes the full timevariation of the psf between individual acs exposures into account. we estimatethat our psf correction scheme reduces the systematic contribution to the shearcorrelation functions due to psf distortions to &lt; 2*10^{-6} for galaxy fieldscontaining at least 10 stars. we perform a number of diagnostic testsindicating that the remaining level of systematics is consistent with zero forthe gems and goods data confirming the success of our psf correction scheme.for the parallel data we detect a low level of remaining systematics which weinterpret to be caused by a lack of sufficient dithering of the data.  combining the shear estimate of the gems and goods observations using 96galaxies arcmin^{-2} with the photometric redshift catalogue of the goods-musicsample, we determine a local single field estimate for the mass power spectrumnormalisation sigma_{8,cdfs}=0.52^{+0.11}_{-0.15} (stat) +/- 0.07 (sys) (68%confidence assuming gaussian cosmic variance) at fixed omega_m=0.3 for alambdacdm cosmology. we interpret this exceptionally low estimate to be due toa local under-density of the foreground structures in the cdfs.

astro-ph;0606622	gabods: the garching-bonn deep survey: vii. probing galaxy bias using  weak gravitational lensing	[abridged] the weak gravitational lensing effect is used to infer matterdensity fluctuations within the field-of-view of the garching-bonn deep survey(gabods). this information is employed for a statistical comparison of thegalaxy distribution to the total matter distribution. the result of thiscomparison is expressed by means of the linear bias factor, b, the ratio ofdensity fluctuations, and the correlation factor $r$ between densityfluctuations. the total galaxy sample is divided into three sub-samples usingr-band magnitudes and the weak lensing analysis is applied separately for eachsub-sample. together with the photometric redshifts from the related combo-17survey we estimate the typical mean redshifts of these samples with$\bar{z}=0.35, 0.47, 0.61$, respectively. for all three samples, a slightgalaxy anti-bias, b~0.8+-0.1, on scales of a few mpc/h is found; the biasfactor shows evidence for a slight scale-dependence. the correlation betweengalaxy and (dark) matter distribution is high, r~0.6+-0.2, indicating anon-linear or/and stochastic biasing relation between matter and galaxies.between the three samples no significant evolution with redshift is found.

astro-ph;9604137	the auto-correlation function of the extragalactic background light: i.  measuring gravitational shear	a new method for measuring the shear induced by gravitational lightdeflection is proposed. it is based on analyzing the anisotropy induced in theauto-correlation function (acf) of the extragalactic background light which isproduced by very faint distant galaxies. the acf can be measured `locally', andits anisotropy is caused by the tidal gravitational field of the deflectingmass distribution in the foreground of these faint background galaxies. sincethe method does not require individual galaxy detection, it can be used tomeasure the shear of extremely faint galaxies which are not detectableindividually, but are present in the noise. the shear estimated from the acf ofthe noise provides an independent measurement which can be compared to theshear obtained from the distortion of individual galaxy images. combining thesetwo independent estimates clearly increases the sensitivity of shearmeasurements. in addition, our method may allow to determine the localmagnification caused by the deflector if the auto-correlation function iscaused by a large number density of faint galaxies; in this case, the intrinsicacf may provide a `standard source' with respect to which shear andmagnification can be obtained. applications to real and synthetic data areshown and the feasibility of our new method is demonstrated. in particular, wepresent the shear maps obtained with our method for the double qso 2345+007 andthe cluster cl0024+16 and compare them to published shear maps.

astro-ph;9705122	detection of shear due to weak lensing by large-scale structure	we present evidence for a coherent shear signal in a field containing thez=1.2 radio-source pks1508-05. since there were no intervening massconcentrations known before targeting this field, we interpret this signal asdue to weak lensing by large-scale structure. this result is the outcome of are-analysis of the observations of fort et al. (1996) in the fields of threehigh redshift qso/radio-sources. several tests of the robustness of the signalwere performed: subdivision of the field and tests using simulated data withrandomized ellipticity orientation; using the pixel-to-pixel autocorrelationfunction method to measure the shear; using the correlation function of thegalaxy ellipticities with bootstrap resampling to estimate errors and to findthe typical angular separation that dominates the signal. we find that thefield of pks1508-05 contains a robust shear signal that is coherent over the 2'by 2' field. the signal is detected at a high level of significance (99.6%)using the tests described above. the amplitude of the shear on a scale of 1' isabout 3%, which is consistent with theoretical expectations from weak lensingby large-scale structure.

astro-ph;9902261	unusual radio variability in the bl lac object 0235+164	we present radio observations at three frequencies and contemporaneousoptical monitoring of the peculiar bl lac object ao 0235+164. during athree-week campaign with the vla we observed intraday variability in thissource and found a distinct peak which can be identified throughout the radiofrequencies and tentatively connected to the r-band variations. this event ischaracterized by unusual properties: its strength increases, and its durationdecreases with wavelength, and it peaks earlier at 20cm than at 3.6 and 6cm. wediscuss several generic models (a `standard' shock-in-jet model, a precessingbeam, free-free-absorption in a foreground screen, interstellar scattering, andgravitational microlensing), and explore whether they can account for ourobservations. most attempts at explaining the data on 0235+164 require anextremely small source size, which can be reconciled with the $10^{12}$ kinverse compton limit only when the doppler factor of the bulk flow is of order100. however, none of the models is completely satisfactory, and we suggestthat the observed variability is due to a superposition of intrinsic andpropagation effects.

astro-ph;9907134	mass-detection of a matter concentration projected near the cluster  abell 1942: dark clump or high-redshift cluster?	a weak-lensing analysis of wide-field $v$- and $i$-band images centered onthe cluster abell 1942 has uncovered a mass concentration $\sim 7$ arcminutessouth of the cluster center. a statistical analysis shows that the detectionsare highly significant. no strong concentration of bright galaxies is seen atthe position of the mass concentration, though a slight galaxy numberoverdensity and a weak extended x-ray source are present about 1' away from itscenter.  from the spatial dependence of the tangential alignment around the center ofthe mass concentration, we inferred a lower bound on the mass inside a sphereof radius $0.5 h^{-1}$\ts mpc of $1\times 10^{14}h^{-1}m_\odot$, much higherthan crude mass estimates based on x-ray data. no firm conclusion can beinferred about the nature of the clump. if it were a high-redshift cluster, theweak x-ray flux would indicate that it had an untypically low x-ray luminosityfor its mass; if the x-ray emission were physically unrelated to the massconcentration, this conclusion would be even stronger.  the search for massive halos by weak lensing enables us for the first time toselect halos based on their mass properties only and to detect new types ofobjects, e.g., dark halos. the mass concentration in the field of a1942 may bethe first example of such a halo.

0809.5035	ray-tracing through the millennium simulation: born corrections and  lens-lens coupling in cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing	(abridged) we study the accuracy of various approximations to cosmic shearand weak galaxy-galaxy lensing and investigate effects of born corrections andlens-lens coupling. we use ray-tracing through the millennium simulation tocalculate various cosmic-shear and galaxy-galaxy-lensing statistics. we comparethe results from ray-tracing to semi-analytic predictions. we find: (i) thelinear approximation provides an excellent fit to cosmic-shear power spectra aslong as the actual matter power spectrum is used as input. common fittingformulae, however, strongly underestimate the cosmic-shear power spectra. halomodels provide a better fit to cosmic shear-power spectra, but there are stillnoticeable deviations. (ii) cosmic-shear b-modes induced by born correctionsand lens-lens coupling are at least three orders of magnitude smaller thancosmic-shear e-modes. semi-analytic extensions to the linear approximationpredict the right order of magnitude for the b-mode. compared to theray-tracing results, however, the semi-analytic predictions may differ by afactor two on small scales and also show a different scale dependence. (iii)the linear approximation may under- or overestimate the galaxy-galaxy-lensingshear signal by several percent due to the neglect of magnification bias, whichmay lead to a correlation between the shear and the observed number density oflenses. we conclude: (i) current semi-analytic models need to be improved inorder to match the degree of statistical accuracy expected for futureweak-lensing surveys. (ii) shear b-modes induced by corrections to the linearapproximation are not important for future cosmic-shear surveys. (iii)magnification bias can be important for galaxy-galaxy-lensing surveys.
