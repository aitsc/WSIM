0901.2241	from outburst to quiescence: the decay of the transient anomalous x-ray  pulsar xte j1810-197	xte j1810-197 is the first transient anomalous x-ray pulsar ever discovered.its highly variable x-ray flux allowed us to study the timing and spectralemission properties of a magnetar candidate over a flux range of about twoorders of magnitude. we analyzed nine xmm-newton observations of xte j1810-197collected over a four years baseline (september 2003 - september 2007). epic pnand mos data were reduced and used for detailed timing and spectral analysis.pulse phase spectroscopic studies were also carried out for observations withsufficiently high signal to noise. we find that: (i) a three blackbodies modelreproduces the spectral properties of the source over the entire outburststatistically better than the two blackbodies model previously used in theliterature, (ii) the coldest blackbody is consistent with the thermal emissionfrom the whole surface, and has temperature and radius similar to thoseinferred from rosat observations before the outburst onset, (iii) there is aspectral feature around 1.1 kev during six consecutive observations (sincemarch 2005); if due to proton resonant cyclotron scattering, it would imply amagnetic field of around 2e14 g. this is in a very good agreement with thevalue from the spin period measurements.

0901.3453	suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr 0501+4516 in  outburst	we present the first suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501+4516, performed on 2008 august 26, four days after the onset of burstingactivity of this new member of the magnetar family. the soft x-ray persistentemission was detected with the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) at a 0.5-10 kevflux of 3.8e-11 erg/s/cm2, with a spectrum well fitted by an absorbed blackbodyplus power-law model. the source pulsation was confirmed at a period of5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 x-ray bursts were detected by the xis, four ofwhich were also detected at higher energies by the hard x-ray detector (hxd).the strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (utc), was so bright that itcaused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 kev range, with a fluence of~2.1e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak intensity of about 89 crab. the entire burst fluenceis estimated to be ~50 times higher. the precursor spectrum was very hard, andwell modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. we discuss the burstingactivity and x/gamma-ray properties of this newly discovered soft gammarepeater in comparison with other members of the class.

0907.4239	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j1037.5-5647 in a low luminosity state	the spectra of several x-ray binary pulsars display a clear soft excess,which in most cases can be described with a blackbody model, above the mainpower-law component. while in the high-luminosity sources it is usuallycharacterized by low temperature (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and large emission radius (r &gt;100 km), in the two persistent and low-luminosity pulsars 4u 0352+309 and rxj0146.9+6121 this component has a high temperature (kt &gt; 1 kev) and a smallerradius (r &lt; 0.5 km), consistent with the estimated size of the neutron-starpolar cap. here we report on the timing and spectral analysis of rxj1037.5-5647, another low-luminosity persistent be binary pulsar, based on thefirst xmm-newton observation of this source. we have found a best-fit period p= 853.4(+/-0.2) s, that implies an average pulsar spin-up dp/dt ~ -2e-8 s/s inthe latest decade. the estimated source luminosity is lx ~ 10^34 erg/s, a valuecomparable to that of the other persistent be binary pulsars and about oneorder of magnitude lower than in most of the previous measurements. the sourcespectrum can be described with a power law plus blackbody model, with ktbb =1.26(+0.16/-0.09) kev and rbb = 128(+13/-21) m, suggesting a polar-cap originof this component. these results strengthen the hypothesis that, in addition tolow luminosities and long periods, this class of sources is characterized alsoby common spectral properties

0907.4616	quiet but still bright: xmm-newton observations of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 0526-66	sgr 0526-66 was the first soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) from which a giantflare was detected in march 1979, suggesting the existence of magnetars, i.e.neutron stars powered by the decay of their extremely strong magnetic field.since then, very little information has been obtained on this object, mainlybecause it has been burst-inactive since 1983 and the study of its persistentx-ray emission has been hampered by its large distance and its location in ax-ray bright supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud. here we report ona comprehensive analysis of all the available xmm-newton observations of sgr0526-66. in particular, thanks to a deep observation taken in 2007, we measuredits pulsation period (p = 8.0544 +/- 0.0002 s) 6 years after its latestdetection by chandra. this allowed us to detect for the first time asignificant reduction of its spin-down rate. from a comparison with two shorterxmm-newton observations performed in 2000 and 2001, we found no significantchanges in the spectrum, which is well modelled by an absorbed power-law withnh = 4.6e+21 cm^-2 and photon index = 3.27. the high luminosity (about 4e+35erg/s, in the 1-10 kev energy band) still observed about 25 years after thelatest detection of bursting activity places sgr 0526-66 in the group of brightand persistent magnetar candidates.

0911.1659	xmm-newton and swift observations prove grb 090709a to be a distant,  standard, long grb	grb 090709a is a long gamma-ray burst (grb) discovered by swift, featuring abright x-ray afterglow as well as a faint infrared transient with very red andpeculiar colors. the burst attracted a large interest because of a possiblequasi-periodicity at p=8.1 s in the prompt emission, suggesting that it couldhave a different origin with respect to standard, long grbs. in order tounderstand the nature of this burst, we obtained a target of opportunityobservation with xmm-newton. x-ray spectroscopy, based on xmm-newton and swiftdata, allowed us to model the significant excess in photoelectric absorptionwith respect to the galactic value as due to a large column density (about6.5e+22 cm^-2) in the grb host, located at z=4.2. such a picture is alsoconsistent with the infrared transient's properties. re-analysis of the promptemission, based on integral and on swift data, excludes any significantmodulation at p=8.1 s. thus, we conclude that grb 090709a is a distant,standard, long grb.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

1112.4602	a time-variable, phase-dependent emission line in the x-ray spectrum of  the isolated neutron star rx j0822-4300	rx j0822-4300 is the central compact object associated with the puppis asupernova remnant. previous x-ray observations suggested rx j0822-4300 to be ayoung neutron star with a weak dipole field and a peculiar surface temperaturedistribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures andsizes. an emission line at 0.8 kev was also detected. we performed a very deep(130 ks) observation with xmm-newton, which allowed us to study in detail thephase-resolved properties of rx j0822-4300. our new data confirm the existenceof a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen inthe `soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the lineof sight. surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older onesyields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can bemodelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 kev in 2001 to ~0.73kev in 2009--2010. the line could be generated via cyclotron scattering ofthermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - itcould originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. in any case, avariation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the lineemitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

1112.5341	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j0440.9+4431	many x-ray accreting pulsars have a soft excess below 10 kev. this featurehas been detected also in faint sources and at low luminosity levels,suggesting that it is an ubiquitous phenomenon. in the case of the highluminosity pulsars (lx &gt; 10^36 erg/s), the fit of this component with thermalemission models usually provides low temperatures (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and largeemission regions (r &gt; a few hundred km); for this reason, it is referred to asa `soft' excess. on the other hand, we recently found that in persistent,low-luminosity (lx ~ 10^34 erg/s) and long-period (p &gt; 100 s) be accretingpulsars the observed excess can be modeled with a rather hot (kt &gt; 1 kev)blackbody component of small area (r &lt; 0.5 km), which can be interpreted asemission from the ns polar caps. in this paper we present the results of arecent xmm-newton observation of the galactic be pulsar rx j0440.9+4431, whichis a poorly studied member of this class of sources. we have found a best-fitperiod p = 204.96(+/-0.02) s, which implies an average pulsar spin-down duringthe last 13 years, with dp/dt ~ 6x10^(-9) s/s. the estimated source luminosityis lx ~ 8x10^(34) erg/s: this value is higher by a factor &lt; 10 compared tothose obtained in the first source observations, but almost two orders ofmagnitude lower than those measured during a few outbursts detected in thelatest years. the source spectrum can be described with a power law plusblackbody model, with ktbb = 1.34(+/-0.04) kev and rbb = 273(+/-16) m,suggesting a polar-cap origin of this component. our results support theclassification of rx j0440.9+4431 as a persistent be/ns pulsar, and confirmthat the hot blackbody spectral component is a common property of this class ofsources.

1203.6449	a new low magnetic field magnetar: the 2011 outburst of swift  j1822.3-1606	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring with swift, rxte, suzaku, chandraand xmm-newton of the outburst of the newly discovered magnetar swiftj1822.3-1606 (sgr 1822-1606), from the first observations soon after thedetection of the short x-ray bursts which led to its discovery, through thefirst stages of its outburst decay (covering the time-span from july 2011,until end of april 2012). we also report on archival rosat observations whichwitnessed the source during its likely quiescent state, and on upper limits onswift j1822.3-1606's radio-pulsed and optical emission during outburst, withthe green bank telescope (gbt) and the gran telescopio canarias (gtc),respectively. our x-ray timing analysis finds the source rotating with a periodof p=8.43772016(2) s and a period derivative \dot{p}=8.3(2)x10^{-14} s s^{-1} ,which entails an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of b~2.7x10^{13} g atthe equator. this measurement makes swift j1822.3-1606 the second lowestmagnetic field magnetar (after sgr 0418+5729; rea et al. 2010). following theflux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find thatthe flux decreased by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening ofthe spectrum, both typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. by modeling thesecular thermal evolution of swift j1822.3-1606, we find that the observedtiming properties of the source, as well as its quiescent x-ray luminosity, canbe reproduced if it was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields ofb_{p}~1.5x10^{14} g and b_{tor}~7x10^{14} g, respectively, and if its currentage is ~550 kyr.

1303.5579	the outburst decay of the low magnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring of the outburst decay of the lowmagnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729, using all the available x-ray dataobtained with rxte, swift, chandra, and xmm-newton observations, from thediscovery of the source in june 2009, up to august 2012. the timing analysisallowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of sgr0418+5729: \dot{p}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidencelevel. this leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of b_dip ~6x 10^{12} g.this measurement confirms sgr 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst upto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsiblefor the x-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 kev. simultaneously,the x-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . deep radio, millimeter, optical andgamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implyingstringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on thepresence of a fossil disk. by modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution ofsgr 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magneticfield at birth of ~10^{14} g. the outburst characteristics suggest the presenceof a thin twisted bundle with a small heated spot at its base. the bundleuntwisted in the first few months following the outburst, while the hot spotdecreases in temperature and size. we estimate the outburst rate of lowmagnetic field magnetars to be about one per year per galaxy, and we brieflydiscuss the consequences of such result in several other astrophysicalcontexts.

1509.02385	a magnetic diverter for charged particle background rejection in the  simbol-x telescope	minimization of charged particle background in x-ray telescopes is a wellknown issue. charged particles (chiefly protons and electrons) naturallypresent in the cosmic environment constitute an important background sourcewhen they collide with the x-ray detector. even worse, a serious degradation ofspectroscopic performances of the x-ray detector was observed in chandra andnewton-xmm, caused by soft protons with kinetic energies ranging between 100kev and some mev being collected by the grazing-incidence mirrors and funneledto the detector. for a focusing telescope like simbol-x, the exposure of thesoft x-ray detector to the proton flux can increase significantly theinstrumental background, with a consequent loss of sensitivity. in the worstcase, it can also seriously compromise the detector duration. a well-knowncountermeasure that can be adopted is the implementation of a properly-designedmagnetic diverter, that should prevent high-energy particles from reaching thefocal plane instruments of simbol-x. although newton-xmm and swift-xrt areequipped with magnetic diverters for electrons, the magnetic fields used areinsufficient to effectively act on protons. in this paper, we simulate thebehavior of a magnetic diverter for simbol-x, consisting ofcommercially-available permanent magnets. the effects of simbol-x optics issimulated through geant4 libraries, whereas the effect of the intense requiredmagnetic fields is simulated along with specifically-written numerical codes inidl.

1512.00467	extras discovery of an 1.2-s x-ray pulsar in m 31	during a search for coherent signals in the x-ray archival data ofxmm-newton, we discovered a modulation at 1.2 s in 3xmm j004301.4+413017 (3xj0043), a source lying in the direction of an external arm of m 31. this shortperiod indicates a neutron star (ns). between 2000 and 2013, the position of 3xj0043 was imaged by public xmm-newton observations 35 times. the analysis ofthese data allowed us to detect an orbital modulation at 1.27 d and study thelong-term properties of the source. the emission of the pulsar was rather hard(most spectra are described by a power law with $\gamma &lt; 1$) and, assuming thedistance to m 31, the 0.3-10 kev luminosity was variable, from$\sim$$3\times10^{37}$ to $2\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the analysis ofoptical data shows that, while 3x j0043 is likely associated to a globularcluster in m 31, a counterpart with $v\gtrsim22$ outside the cluster cannot beexcluded. considering our findings, there are two main viable scenarios for 3xj0043: a peculiar low-mass x-ray binary, similar to 4u 1822-37 or 4u 1626-67,or an intermediate-mass x-ray binary resembling her x-1. regardless of theexact nature of the system, 3x j0043 is the first accreting ns in m 31 in whichthe spin period has been detected.

1512.03241	long term study of the double pulsar j0737-3039 with xmm-newton: pulsar  timing	the relativistic double neutron star binary psr j0737-3039 shows clearevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radioand x-rays. in this paper we present the results of timing analysis of psrj0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 xmm-newton large programs thatcollected ~20,000 x-ray counts from the system. we detected pulsations from psrj0737-3039a (psr a) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained byxmm-newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. psr a's pulseprofile in x-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spinprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. this yields aconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentumaxis delta_a ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radiodata. we confirmed pulsed emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) in x-rays evenafter its disappearance in radio. the unusual phenomenology of psr b's x-rayemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a lossof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. we hypothesize that this isdue to the interaction of psr a's wind with psr b's magnetosphere andorbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto psr b closed field lines.finally, the analysis of the full xmm-newton dataset provided evidences oforbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shockscenario between psr a's wind and psr b's magnetosphere.

astro-ph;0304477	integral and xmm-newton observations of the weak grb 030227	we present integral and xmm-newton observations of the prompt gamma-rayemission and the x-ray afterglow of grb030227, the first grb for which thequick localization obtained with the integral burst alert system (ibas) has ledto the discovery of x-ray and optical afterglows. grb030227 had a duration ofabout 20 s and a peak flux of 1.1 photons cm^-2 s^-1 in the 20-200 kev energyrange. the time averaged spectrum can be fit by a single power law with photonindex about 2 and we find some evidence for a hard to soft spectral evolution.the x-ray afterglow has been detected starting only 8 hours after the promptemission, with a 0.2-10 kev flux decreasing as t^-1 from 1.3x10e-12 to 5x10e-13erg cm^-2 s^-1. the afterglow spectrum is well described by a power law withphoton index 1.94+/-0.05 modified by a redshifted neutral absorber with columndensity of several 10e22 cm^-2. a possible emission line at 1.67 kev could bedue to fe for a redshift z=3, consistent with the value inferred from theabsorption.

astro-ph;0502417	a xmm-newton view of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1806--20: long term  variability in the pre-super giant flare epoch	the low energy (&lt;10 kev) x-ray emission of the soft gamma-ray repeatersgr1806-20 has been studied by means of four xmm-newton observations carriedout in the last two years, the latter performed in response to a strongsequence of hard x-ray bursts observed on 2004 october 5. the source was caughtin different states of activity: over the 2003-2004 period the 2-10 kev fluxdoubled with respect to the historical level observed previously. the long termraise in luminosity was accompanied by a gradual hardening of the spectrum,with the power law photon index decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, and by a growth ofthe bursting activity. the pulse period measurements obtained in the fourobservations are consistent with an average spin-down rate of 5.5x10e-10 s/s,higher than the values observed in the previous years. the long-term behaviorof sgr1806-20 exhibits the correlation between spectral hardness and spin-downrate previously found only by comparing the properties of different sources(both sgrs and anomalous x-ray pulsars). the best quality spectrum (obtained on6 september 2004) cannot be fitted by a single power law, but it requires anadditional blackbody component (kt=0.79 kev, r_bb = 1.9 (d/15 kpc)^2 km),similar to the spectra observed in other sgrs and in anomalous x-ray pulsars.no spectral lines were found in the persistent emission, with equivalent widthupper limits in the range 30-110 ev. marginal evidence for an absorptionfeature at 4.2 kev is present in the cumulative spectrum of 69 bursts detectedin september-october 2004.

astro-ph;0503390	three xmm-newton observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1048.1-5937: long term variations in spectrum and pulsed fraction	we report the results of a recent (july 2004) xmm-newton target ofopportunity observation of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1048.1-5937, togetherwith a detailed re-analysis of previous observations carried out in 2000 and2003. in july 2004 the source had a 2-10 kev flux of 6.2$\times10^{-12}$ ergcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a pulsed fraction p$_f$=0.68. the comparison of thethree data sets shows the presence of an anti-correlation between flux andpulsed fraction, implying that previous estimates of the source energeticsbased on the assumption of a large and constant pulsed fraction might besignificantly underestimated. the source spectrum is well described by a powerlaw plus blackbody model (kt~0.63 kev, photon index $\gamma$~2.7-3.5) or,alternatively, by the sum of two blackbodies of which the hotter is comptonizedby relativistic electrons. in this case the temperatures are kt${_1}$~0.2-0.3kev and kt${_2}$~0.4-0.5 kev and the emitting area of the cooler component isconsistent with the whole neutron star surface. the long term luminosityvariation of a factor &gt;~2 is accompanied by relatively small variations in thespectral shape. phase resolved spectroscopy indicates a harder spectrum incorrespondence of the pulse maximum. no spectral features have been detectedwith 4$\sigma$ limits on the equivalent width in the range ~10-220 ev,depending on line energy and width.
