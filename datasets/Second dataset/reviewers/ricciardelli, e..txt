0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0906.1807	the zcosmos survey. the dependence of clustering on luminosity and  stellar mass at z=0.2-1	we study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar massat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zcosmos 10k sample.  we measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and itsprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass andredshift ranges. we quantify in detail the observational selection biases andwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles ofsemi-analytic mock catalogues. we finally compare our measurements to thecosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.  at odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxyclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. a mild dependence onstellar mass is instead observed. at z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power onlarge scales. we interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominatingthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular tothe line-of-sight. we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of theamplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.  the clustering measured in the zcosmos data at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 for galaxies withlog(m/m_\odot)&gt;=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mocksurveys. on scales larger than ~2 h^-1 mpc, the observed clustering amplitudeis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. thus, if the power spectrum of matteris lcdm with standard normalization and the bias has no unnaturalscale-dependence, this result indicates that cosmos has picked up aparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1mpc^3. these findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z~1 universeto appropriately characterize the level of structure at this epoch.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0907.5416	zcosmos - 10k-bright spectroscopic sample. the bimodality in the galaxy  stellar mass function: exploring its evolution with redshift	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) up to z~1 from thezcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. we investigate the total mf and thecontribution of etgs and ltgs, defined by different criteria (sed, morphologyor star formation). we unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global mf, betterrepresented by 2 schechter functions dominated by etgs and ltgs, respectively.for the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number densityincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. we find that the mfevolution at intermediate-low values of mstar (logm&lt;10.6) is mostly explainedby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formationactivities. the low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger pergalaxy per gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). we find that etgs increasein number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing mstar, with a median"building redshift" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.for ltgs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remainsalmost constant from z~1. instead, the most extreme population of active starforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. we suggest atransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into bluequiescent and successively (1-2 gyr after) into red passive types. the completemorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scalesor follows after 1-2 gyr. a continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expectedby low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. we estimate that on average~25% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per gyr for logm&lt;11. we concludethat the build-up of galaxies and etgs follows the same downsizing trend withmass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted bycurrent sams. we expect a negligible evolution of the global galaxy baryonicmf.

0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0909.1968	k+a galaxies in the zcosmos survey: physical properties of systems in  their post-starburst phase	the identities of the main processes triggering and quenching star-formationin galaxies remain unclear. a key stage in evolution, however, appears to berepresented by post-starburst galaxies. to investigate their impact on galaxyevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectralfeatures in the cosmos field. we examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxiesat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zcosmos sample. k+a galaxies occupy thebrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. they are as massive as quiescentgalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (orstellar mass) distribution. a small percentage (&lt;8%) of these galaxies haveradio and/or x-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the sfr of~8msun/yr). over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxiesis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence ofbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. this distribution does not vary with thestrength of the hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a wayreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. although k+a galaxiesare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in asimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of~2-8mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratiosimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. with the current data set, we do notfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/massdensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the localvalues, or the spectral properties. those galaxies, which are affected by asudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellarmass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0910.5824	the optical spectra of spitzer 24 micron galaxies in the cosmos field:  ii. faint infrared sources in the zcosmos-bright 10k catalogue	we have used the zcosmos-bright 10k sample to identify 3244 spitzer/mips24-micron-selected galaxies with 0.06&lt; s(24um)&lt; 0.50 mjy and i(ab)&lt;22.5, over1.5 deg^2 of the cosmos field, and studied different spectral properties,depending on redshift. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3, we found that different reddening laws ofcommon use in the literature explain the dust extinction properties of around80% of our infrared (ir) sources, within the error bars. for up to 16% ofobjects, instead, the halpha/hbeta ratios are too high for their ir/uvattenuations, which is probably a consequence of inhomogenous dustdistributions. in only a few of our galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3 the ir emission couldbe mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. besides, theline ratios of ~22% of our galaxies suggest that they might bestar-formation/nuclear-activity composite systems. at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.7, we estimatedgalaxy metallicities for 301 galaxies: at least 12% of them are securely belowthe upper-branch mass-metallicity trend, which is consistent with the localrelation. finally, we performed a combined analysis of the hdeltaequivalent-width versus dn(4000) diagram for 1722 faint and bright 24umgalaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0, spanning two decades in mid-ir luminosity. we foundthat, while secondary bursts of star formation are necessary to explain theposition of the most luminous ir galaxies in that diagram, quiescent,exponentially-declining star formation histories can well reproduce thespectral properties of ~40% of the less luminous sources. our results suggest atransition in the possible modes of star formation at total ir luminositiesl(tir)=(3 +/-2)x10^11 lsun.

0911.0523	properties and environment of radio emitting galaxies in the vla-zcosmos  survey	we investigate the properties and the environment of radio sources withoptical counterpart from the combined vla-cosmos and zcosmos samples. theadvantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopicinformation, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.  by comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectralenergy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide theradio sources in three families, passive agn, non-passive agn and star forminggalaxies. these families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infraredcolor--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the correspondingcontrol samples.  only the passive agn have a significantly different environment distributionfrom their control sample. the fraction of radio-loud passive agn increasesfrom ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than10. this trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hostingthe radio sources. passive agn in overdensities tend to have higher radioluminosities than those in lower density environments. since the black holemass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for lowradio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fueldisponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determinedby the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

0911.2252	the zcosmos-bright survey: the clustering of early and late galaxy  morphological types since z~1	we measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of theirmorphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey withfull morphological information. this is obtained by combining high-resolutionhst imaging and vlt spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to i_ab=22.5 withaccurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos-bright redshift survey. atthis epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly strongerclustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. a comparison to thesdss at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early andlate morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at smallseparations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution sincez~0.8. this suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed inintermediate and dense environments at this epoch. our results are consistentwith a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphologicaltypes between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in themorphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-drivenevolution.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1004.3289	geco: galaxy evolution code - a new semi-analytical model of galaxy  formation	we present a new semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, geco (galaxyevolution code), aimed at a better understanding of when and how the twoprocesses of star formation and galaxy assembly have taken place. our model isstructured into a monte carlo algorithm based on the extended press-schechtertheory, for the representation of the merging hierarchy of dark matter halos,and a set of analytic algorithms for the treatment of the baryonic physics,including classical recipes for the gas cooling, the star formationtime-scales, galaxy mergers and sn feedback. together with the galaxies, theparallel growth of bhs is followed in time and their feedback on the hostinggalaxies is modelled. we set the model free parameters by matching with data onlocal stellar mass functions and the bh-bulge relation at z=0. based on suchlocal boundary conditions, we investigate how data on the high-redshiftuniverse constrain our understanding of the physical processes driving theevolution, focusing in particular on the assembly of stellar mass and on thestar formation history. since both processes are currently strongly constrainedby cosmological near- and far-ir surveys, the basic physics of the lambda cdmhierarchical clustering concept of galaxy formation can be effectively testedby us by comparison with the most reliable set of observables. ourinvestigation shows that when the time-scales of the stellar formation and massassembly are studied as a function of dark matter halo mass and the singlegalaxy stellar mass, the 'downsizing' fashion of star formation appears to be anatural outcome of the model, reproduced even in the absence of the agnfeedback. on the contrary, the stellar mass assembly history turns out tofollow a more standard hierarchical pattern progressive in cosmic time, withthe more massive systems assembled at late times mainly through dissipationlessmergers.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

0709.1692	precision photometric redshift calibration for galaxy-galaxy weak  lensing	accurate photometric redshifts are among the key requirements for precisionweak lensing measurements. both the large size of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and the existence of large spectroscopic redshift samples that areflux-limited beyond its depth have made it the optimal data source fordeveloping methods to properly calibrate photometric redshifts for lensing.here, we focus on galaxy-galaxy lensing in a survey with spectroscopic lensredshifts, as in the sdss. we develop statistics that quantify the effect ofsource redshift errors on the lensing calibration and on the weighting scheme,and show how they can be used in the presence of redshift failure and samplingvariance. we then demonstrate their use with 2838 source galaxies withspectroscopy from deep2 and zcosmos, evaluating several public photometricredshift algorithms, in two cases including a full p(z) for each object, andfind lensing calibration biases as low as 1% (due to fortuitous cancellation oftwo types of bias) or as high as 20% for methods in active use (despite thesmall mean photoz bias of these algorithms). our work demonstrates thatlensing-specific statistics must be used to reliably calibrate the lensingsignal, due to asymmetric effects of (frequently non-gaussian) photoz errors.we also demonstrate that large-scale structure (lss) can strongly impact thephotoz calibration and its error estimation, due to a correlation between thelss and the photoz errors, and argue that at least two independent degree-scalespectroscopic samples are needed to suppress its effects. given the size of ourspectroscopic sample, we can reduce the galaxy-galaxy lensing calibration errorwell below current sdss statistical errors.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.1673	a journey from the outskirts to the cores of groups i: color- and  mass-segregation in 20k-zcosmos groups	using the group catalog obtained from zcosmos spectroscopic data and thecomplementary photometric data from the cosmos survey, we explore segregationeffects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. webuilt two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.45) and high (0.45 &lt;z &lt;= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxiesinto three samples according to their distance from the group center. weexplored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins ofstellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the groupcenter. we found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (log(m_gal/m_sun)&gt;= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions ofred/blue objects. for galaxies of lower masses (9.8 &lt;= log(m_gal/m_sun) &lt;=10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and bluegalaxies. this dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groupsdo not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. interestingly, masssegregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as afunction of radius. we suggest a simple scenario where color- andmass-segregation originate from different physical processes. while dynamicalfriction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, bothstarvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench starformation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. in poorer groups theenvironmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxyevolution. their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when movingfrom the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting therecent accretion history of these groups.

1206.1594	systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function with velocity  dispersion in early-type galaxies	an essential component of galaxy formation theory is the stellar initial massfunction (imf), that describes the parent distribution of stellar mass in starforming regions. we present observational evidence in a sample of early-typegalaxies (etgs) of a tight correlation between central velocity dispersion andthe strength of several absorption features sensitive to the presence oflow-mass stars. our sample comprises ~40,000 etgs from the spider survey(z&lt;0.1). the data, extracted from the sloan digital sky survey, are combined,rejecting both noisy data, and spectra with contamination from telluric lines,resulting in a set of 18 stacked spectra at high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n&gt;400 per a). a combined analysis of imf-sensitive line strengths and spectralfitting is performed with the latest state-of the art population synthesismodels (an extended version of the miles models). a significant trend is foundbetween imf slope and velocity dispersion, towards an excess of low-mass starsin the most massive galaxies. although we emphasize that accurate values of theimf slope will require a detailed analysis of chemical composition (such as[a/fe] or even individual element abundance ratios), the observed trendssuggest that low-mass etgs are better fit by a kroupa-like imf, whereas massivegalaxies require bottom-heavy imfs, exceeding the salpeter slope at velocitydispersions above 200km/s.

1210.0334	the cosmic evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances in star-forming  galaxies over the past 10 gyrs	the chemical evolution of galaxies on a cosmological timescale is still amatter of debate despite the increasing number of available data provided byspectroscopic surveys of star-forming galaxies at different redshifts. thefundamental relations involving metallicity, such as the mass-metallicityrelation (mzr) or the fundamental-metallicity relation, give controversialresults about the reality of evolution of the chemical content of galaxies at agiven stellar mass. in this work we shed some light on this issue using thecompleteness reached by the 20k bright sample of the zcosmos survey and usingfor the first time the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (n/o) as a tracer of the gasphase chemical evolution of galaxies that is independent of the star formationrate. emission-line galaxies both in the sdss and 20k zcosmos bright surveywere used to study the evolution from the local universe of the $mzr up to aredshift of 1.32 and the relation between stellar mass and nitrogen-to-oxygenratio (mnor) up to a redshift of 0.42 using the n2s2 parameter. all thephysical properties derived from stellar continuum and gas emission-lines,including stellar mass, star formation rates, metallicity and n/o, werecalculated in a self-consistent way over the full redshift range. we confirmthe trend to find lower metallicities in galaxies of a given stellar mass in ayounger universe. this trend is even observed when taking possible selectioneffects into account that are due to the observed larger median star formationrates for galaxies at higher redshifts. we also find a significant evolution ofthe mnor up to z = 0.4. taking the slope of the o/h vs. n/o relation intoaccount for the secondary-nitrogen production regime, the observed evolution ofthe mnor is consistent with the trends found for both the mzr and itsequivalent relation using new expressions to reduce its dependence on sfr.

1305.2273	spider viii - constraints on the stellar initial mass function of  early-type galaxies from a variety of spectral features	we perform a spectroscopic study to constrain the stellar initial massfunction (imf) by using a large sample of 24,781 early-type galaxies from thesdss-based spider survey. clear evidence is found of a trend between imf andcentral velocity dispersion, sigma0, evolving from a standard kroupa/chabrierimf at 100km/s towards a more bottom-heavy imf with increasing sigma0, becomingsteeper than the salpeter function at sigma0&gt;220km/s. we analyze a variety ofspectral indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empiricalcorrelations, and fitted simultaneously with extended miles (miuscat) stellarpopulation models. our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/fe],drives the imf variation. although our analysis cannot discriminate between asingle power-law (unimodal) and a low-mass (&lt;0.5msun) tapered (bimodal) imf, wecan robustly constrain the fraction in low-mass stars at birth, that is foundto increase from 20% at sigma0~100km/s, up to 80% at sigma0~300km/s. additionalconstraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (m/l) ratios: unimodalmodels predict m/l significantly larger than dynamical m/l, across the wholesigma0 range, whereas a bimodal imf is compatible. our results are robustagainst individual abundance variations. no significant variation is found inna and ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between[alpha/fe] and sigma0.

1306.2955	the structure of cosmic voids in a lcdm universe	eulerian cosmological codes are especially suited to properly describe thelow density regions. this property makes this class of codes excellent tools tostudy the formation and evolution of cosmic voids. following such ideas, wepresent the results of an eulerian adaptive mesh refinement (amr)hydrodynamical and n-body simulation, that contrary to the common practice, hasbeen designed to refine the computational grid in the underdense regions of thesimulated volume. thus, the void regions are better described due to thecombined effect of the eulerian character of the numerical technique and theuse of high numerical resolution from the amr approach. to analyse the outcomeof this simulation, we have constructed a new void finder optimally suited tofind the hierarchy of voids in amr simulations. the algorithm identifies voidsstarting from the cells with least density and highest velocity divergence andthen expanding the underdense volume until reaching the void walls, definedfrom the steepness of the density gradient. at redshift z=0, in a cosmologicalbox of comoving side length 100 mpc/h, we identify hundreds of voids with sizesup to 17 mpc/h and typical density contrast of -0.8, which show a complexmorphology and an intricate hierarchy of nested structures. the analysis oftheir mass density profile leads to the conclusion that a universal densityprofile can be applied to voids of any size, density, morphology and redshift.

1402.2976	on the universality of void density profiles	the massive exploitation of cosmic voids for precision cosmology in theupcoming dark energy experiments, requires a robust understanding of theirinternal structure, particularly of their density profile. we show that thevoid density profile is insensitive to the void radius both in a catalogue ofobserved voids and in voids from a large cosmological simulation. however, theobserved and simulated voids display remarkably different profile shapes, withthe former having much steeper profiles than the latter. sparsity can not bethe main reason for this discrepancy, as we demonstrate that the profile can berecovered with reasonable accuracy even with very sparse samples of tracers. onthe other hand, the observed profile shows a significant dependence on thegalaxy sample used to trace the matter distribution. samples including low-massgalaxies lead to shallower profiles with respect to the samples where onlymassive galaxies are used, as faint galaxies live closer to the void centre. weargue that galaxies are biased tracers when used to probe the matterdistribution within voids.

1403.3441	extreme emission-line galaxies out to z$\sim$1 in zcosmos. i. sample and  characterization of global properties	we present a thorough characterization of a large sample of 183 extremeemission-line galaxies (eelgs) at redshift 0.11 &lt; z &lt; 0.93 selected from the20k zcosmos bright survey because of their unusually large emission lineequivalent widths. we use multiwavelength cosmos photometry, hst-acs i-bandimaging and optical zcosmos spectroscopy to derive the main global propertiesof eelgs, such as sizes, masses, sfrs, reliable metallicities from both"direct" and "strong-line" methods. the eelgs are compact (r_50 ~ 1.3 kpc),low-mass (log(m*/msol)~7-10) galaxies forming stars at unusually high specificsfr (log(ssfr/yr) up to ~ -7) compared to main sequence sfgs of the samestellar mass and redshift. at uv wavelengths, the eelgs are luminous and showhigh surface brightness and include strong ly$\alpha$ emitters, as revealed bygalex spectroscopy. we show that zcosmos eelgs are high-ionization,low-metallicity systems, with median 12+log(o/h)=8.16, including a handful ofextremely metal-deficient galaxies (&lt;10% solar). while ~80% of the eelgs shownon-axisymmetric morphologies, including clumpy and tadpole galaxies, we findthat ~29% of them show additional low surface-brightness features, whichstrongly suggest recent or ongoing interactions. as star-forming dwarfs in thelocal universe, eelgs are most often found in relative isolation. while onlyvery few eelgs belong to compact groups, almost one third of them are found inspectroscopically confirmed loose pairs or triplets. we conclude that eelgs aregalaxies caught in a transient and probably early period of their evolution,where they are efficiently building-up a significant fraction of theirpresent-day stellar mass in an ongoing galaxy-wide starburst. therefore, theeelgs constitute an ideal benchmark for comparison studies between low- andhigh-redshift low-mass star-forming galaxies.
