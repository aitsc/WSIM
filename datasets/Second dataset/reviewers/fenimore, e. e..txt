0707.4626	the first swift bat gamma-ray burst catalog	we present the first swift burst alert telescope (bat) catalog of gamma-raybursts (grbs), which contains bursts detected by the bat between 2004 december19 and 2007 june 16. this catalog (hereafter bat1 catalog) contains bursttrigger time, location, 90% error radius, duration, fluence, peak flux, andtime averaged spectral parameters for each of 237 grbs, as measured by the bat.the bat-determined position reported here is within 1.75' of the swift x-raytelescope (xrt)-determined position for 90% of these grbs. the bat t_90 andt_50 durations peak at 80 and 20 seconds, respectively. from thefluence-fluence correlation, we conclude that about 60% of the observed peakenergies, epeak, of bat grbs could be less than 100 kev. we confirm that grbfluence to hardness and grb peak flux to hardness are correlated for bat burstsin analogous ways to previous missions' results. the correlation between thephoton index in a simple power-law model and epeak is also confirmed. we alsoreport the current status for the on-orbit bat calibrations based onobservations of the crab nebula.

1008.0226	probing the nature of short swift bursts via deep integral monitoring of  grb 050925	we present results from swift, xmm-newton, and deep integral monitoring inthe region of grb 050925. this short swift burst is a candidate for a newlydiscovered soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) with the following observational burstproperties: 1) galactic plane (b=-0.1 deg) localization, 2) 150 msec duration,and 3) a blackbody rather than a simple power-law spectral shape (with asignificance level of 97%). we found two possible x-ray counterparts of grb050925 by comparing the x-ray images from swift xrt and xmm-newton. both x-raysources show the transient behavior with a power-law decay index shallower than-1. we found no hard x-ray emission nor any additional burst from the locationof grb 050925 in ~5 ms of integral data. we discuss about the three batse shortbursts which might be associated with grb 050925, based on their location andthe duration. assuming grb 050925 is associated with the h ii regions (w 58) atthe galactic longitude of l=70 deg, we also discuss the source frame propertiesof grb 050925.

1104.4689	the second swift bat gamma-ray burst catalog	we present the second swift burst alert telescope (bat) catalog of gamma-raybursts (grbs), which contains 476 bursts detected by the bat between 2004december 19 and 2009 december 21. this catalog (hereafter the bat2 catalog)presents burst trigger time, location, 90% error radius, duration, fluence,peak flux, time-averaged spectral parameters and time-resolved spectralparameters measured by the bat. in the correlation study of various observedparameters extracted from the bat prompt emission data, we distinguish amonglong-duration grbs (l-grbs), short-duration grbs (s-grbs), and short-durationgrbs with extended emission (s-grbs with e.e.) to investigate differences inthe prompt emission properties. the fraction of l-grbs, s-grbs and s-grbs withe.e. in the catalog are 89%, 8% and 2% respectively. we compare the bat promptemission properties with the batse, bepposax and hete-2 grb samples. we alsocorrelate the observed prompt emission properties with the redshifts for thegrbs with known redshift. the bat t90 and t50 durations peak at 70 s and 30 s,respectively. we confirm that the spectra of the bat s-grbs are generallyharder than those of the l-grbs. the time-averaged spectra of the bat s-grbswith e.e. are similar to those of the l-grbs. whereas, the spectra of theinitial short spikes of the s-grbs with e.e. are similar to those of thes-grbs. we show that the bat grb samples are significantly softer than thebatse bright grbs, and that the time-averaged epeak of the bat grbs peaks at 80kev which is significantly lower energy than those of the batse sample whichpeak at 320 kev. the time-averaged spectral properties of the bat grb sampleare similar to those of the hete-2 grb samples. by time-resolved spectralanalysis, we find that only 10% of the bat observed photon indices are outsidethe allowed region of the synchrotron shock model.

0801.4319	global properties of x-ray flashes and x-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts  observed by swift	we describe and discuss the spectral and temporal characteristics of theprompt emission and x-ray afterglow emission of x-ray flashes (xrfs) andx-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts (xrrs) detected and observed by swift betweendecember 2004 and september 2006. we compare these characteristics to a sampleof conventional classical gamma-ray bursts (c-grbs) observed during the sameperiod. we confirm the correlation between epeak_obs and fluence noted byothers and find further evidence that xrfs, xrrs and c-grbs form a continuum.we also confirm that our known redshift sample is consistent with thecorrelation between the peak energy in the grb rest frame (epeak_src) and theisotropic radiated energy (eiso), so called the epeak_src-eiso relation. thespectral properties of x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs are similar, but thetemporal properties of xrfs and c-grbs are quite different. we found that thelight curves of c-grb afterglows show a break to steeper indices(shallow-to-steep break) at much earlier times than do xrf afterglows.moreover, the overall luminosity of xrf x-ray afterglows is systematicallysmaller by a factor of two or more compared to that of c-grbs. these distinctdifferences between the x-ray afterglows of xrfs and c-grbs may be the key tounderstanding not only the mysterious shallow-to-steep break in x-ray afterglowlight curves, but also the unique nature of xrfs.

astro-ph;0004176	redshifts for 220 batse gamma-ray bursts determined by variability and  the cosmological consequences	we show that the time variability of a gamma-ray burst (grb) appears to becorrelated with the absolute luminosity of the burst: smooth bursts areintrinsically less luminous. this cepheid-like relationship can be used todetermine the redshift of a grb from parameters measured solely at gamma-rayenergies. the relationship is based on only seven events at present and needsto be further confirmed with more events. we present the details of convertinggrb observables to luminosities and redshifts for 220 bright, long grbs fromthe burst and transient source experiment (batse) and explore the cosmologicalconsequences. in particular, we derive the grb rate as a function of $z$without assuming either a luminosity function or that the grb rate follows thestar formation rate (sfr). we find that the grb formation rate scales as(1+z)^{3.3 \pm 0.3}. the observations used to derive the sfr can be stronglyaffected by dust for z &gt; 2 whereas grb observations are not. if grbs trace starformation, then our results indicate that the sfr does not peak at z\sim 2 butinstead continues to increase until z \sim 10. we have used the burst formationrate to correct the observed grb luminosity function for the incompleteness dueto the detection threshold, resulting in a luminosity function with a power lawindex of \sim -2.3 that slightly rolls over at low luminosities. the reality ofour variability--luminosity relationship requires confirmation but, if valid,will provide a powerful tool for studying both grbs and the early universe.

(2002), a redshift of z=0.38+0.36/-0.18can be determined, in agreement with constraints determined from opticalobservations. we are able to fit the x-ray afterglow spectrum and to measureits temporal fade. although the best-fit fade is shallower than the concurrentfade in the optical, the spectral similarity between the two bands indicatesthat the x-ray fade may actually trace the optical fade. if this is the case,the late time rebrightening observed in the optical cannot be due to asupernova bump. we interpret the prompt and afterglow x-ray emission as arisingfrom a jetted grb observed off-axis and possibly viewed through a complexcircumburst medium due to a progenitor wind.

astro-ph;0408513	swift's ability to detect gamma-ray bursts	the swift satellite will be a self-contained observatory that will bring newcapabilities to the observing of the early afterglow emission of gamma-raybursts. swift is completely autonomous and will do all of the observationswithout help from the ground. there are three instruments on swift. a large(5200 sq cm) coded aperture imager will locate the bursts within about 15seconds. the satellite will be able to slew to point at the location within aminute or two. there are two narrow field of view instruments: an opticaltelescope and an x-ray telescope. thus, swift will provide simultaneousgamma-ray, x-ray, and optical observations of gamma-ray bursts soon after theburst. a key to the success of swift will be its ability to detect and locate alarge number of gamma-ray bursts quick enough that the narrow field of viewinstruments can follow up. the results of simulations show that swift will beable to detect about 300 bursts a year and locate about 150. the number thatswift will be able to slew to depends on constraints built into the satellitebus. preliminary results indicate that we might be able to slew to 100 burstsper year, but that is heavily dependent on satellite operations.

astro-ph;0503030	gamma-ray observations of a giant flare from the magnetar sgr 1806-20	magnetars comprise two classes of rotating neutron stars (soft gammarepeaters (sgrs) and anomalous x-ray pulsars), whose x-ray emission is poweredby an ultrastrong magnetic field, b ~ 10^15 g. occasionally sgrs enter intoactive episodes producing many short x-ray bursts; extremely rarely (about onceper 50 years per source), sgrs emit a giant flare, an event with total energyat least 1000 times higher than their typical bursts. here we report that, on2004 december 27, sgr 1806-20 emitted the brightest extra-solar transient eventever recorded, even surpassing the full moon brightness for 0.2 seconds. thetotal (isotropic) flare energy is 2x10^46 erg, 100 times higher than the onlytwo previous events, making this flare a once in a century event. this colossalenergy release likely occurred during a catastrophic reconfiguration of themagnetar's magnetic field. such an event would have resembled a short, hardgamma ray burst (grb) if it had occurred within 40 mpc, suggesting thatextragalactic sgr flares may indeed form a subclass of grbs.

astro-ph;0503508	a contemporaneous infrared flash from a long gamma-ray burst: an echo  from the central engine	the explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (grb) is thought toproduce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the centralengine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internalshocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the externalenvironment produces long-wavelength afterglow. while afterglow observationscontinue to refine our understanding of grb progenitors and relativisticshocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of theorigin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. only oneconcurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated withemission from an external shock. here we report the discovery of infrared (ir)emission contemporaneous with a grb, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset ofgrb 041219a. our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phaseof the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of anylong-wavelength emission associated with a grb. analysis of an initial ir pulsesuggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. this opens a newpossibility to study the central engine of grbs with ground-based observationsat long wavelengths.

astro-ph;0503521	a link between prompt optical and prompt gamma-ray emission in gamma-ray  bursts	the prompt optical emission that arrives with gamma-rays from a cosmicgamma-ray burst (grb) is a signature of the engine powering the burst, theproperties of the ultra-relativistic ejecta of the explosion, and the ejecta'sinteractions with the surroundings. until now, only grb 990123 had beendetected at optical wavelengths during the burst phase. its prompt opticalemission was variable and uncorrelated with the prompt gamma-ray emission,suggesting that the optical emission was generated by a reverse shock arisingfrom the ejecta's collision with the surrounding material. here we reportprompt optical emission from grb 041219a. it is variable and correlated withthe prompt gamma-rays, indicating a common origin for the optical light and thegamma-rays. within the context of the standard fireball model of grbs, weattribute this new optical component to internal shocks driven into the burstejecta by variations of the inner engine. the correlated optical emission is adirect probe of the jet isolated from the medium. the timing of theuncorrelated optical emission is strongly dependent on the nature of themedium.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0512149	confirmation of the $\eps$ -- $\eiso$ (amati) relation from the x-ray  flash xrf 050416a observed by swift/bat	we report swift burst alert telescope (bat) observations of the x-ray flash(xrf) xrf 050416a. the fluence ratio between the 15-25 kev and 25-50 kev energybands of this event is 1.5, thus making it the softest gamma-ray burst (grb)observed by bat so far. the spectrum is well fitted by the band function withe^{\rm obs}_{\rm peak} of 15.0_{-2.7}^{+2.3} kev. assuming the redshift of thehost galaxy (z = 0.6535), the isotropic-equivalent radiated energy e_{\rm iso}and the peak energy at the grb rest frame (e^{\rm src}_{\rm peak}) of xrf050416a are not only consistent with the correlation found by amati et al. andextended to xrfs by sakamoto et al., but also fill-in the gap of this relationaround the 30 - 80 kev range of e^{\rm src}_{\rm peak}. this result tightensthe validity of the e^{\rm src}_{\rm peak} - e_{\rm iso} relation from xrfs togrbs.  we also find that the jet break time estimated using the empirical relationbetween e^{\rm src}_{\rm peak} and the collimation corrected energy e_{\gamma}is inconsistent with the afterglow observation by swift x-ray telescope. thiscould be due to the extra external shock emission overlaid around the jet breaktime or to the non existence of a jet break feature for xrf, which might be afurther challenging for grb jet emission, models and xrf/grb unificationscenarios.

astro-ph;0512392	swift and xmm observations of the dark grb 050326	we present swift and xmm observations of grb 050326, detected by swift-bat.the fluence was 7.7x10^-6 erg cm^-2 (20-150 kev), and its spectrum was hard,with a power law photon index 1.25. the afterglow light curve did not show anybreak nor flares between ~1 hr and ~6 d after the burst, and decayed with aslope 1.70. the afterglow spectrum is well fitted by a power-law model,suffering absorption both in the milky way and in the host galaxy. therest-frame hydrogen column density is significant, n_h_z &gt; 4x10^21 cm^-2, andthe redshift of the absorber is z &gt; 1.5. there was good agreement between theswift-xrt and xmm results. by comparing the prompt and afterglow fluxes, wefound that an early break occurred before the xrt observation. the propertiesof the grb 050326 afterglow are well described by a spherical fireballexpanding in a uniform external medium, so a further steepening is expected atlater times. the lack of such a break constrains the jet angle to be &gt;7 deg.using the redshift constraints provided by the x-ray analysis, we alsoestimated that the beaming-corrected gamma-ray energy was &gt;3x10^51 erg, at thehigh end of grb energies. despite the brightness in x rays, only deep limitscould be placed by swift-uvot at optical/uv wavelengths. thus, this grb was"truly dark", with the optical-to-x-ray spectrum violating the synchrotronlimit. the optical and x-ray observations are consistent either with anabsorbed event or with a high-redshift one. to obey the ghirlanda relation, amoderate/large redshift z&gt;4.5 is required.

astro-ph;0610157	x-ray flashes or soft gamma-ray bursts? the case of the likely distant  xrf 040912	in this work, we present a multi-wavelength study of xrf 040912, aimed atmeasuring its distance scale and the intrinsic burst properties. we performed adetailed spectral and temporal analysis of both the prompt and the afterglowemission and we estimated the distance scale of the likely host galaxy. we thenused the currently available sample of xrfs with known distance to discuss theconnection between xrfs and classical gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we found thatthe prompt emission properties unambiguously identify this burst as an xrf,with an observed peak energy of e_p=17+/-13 kev and a burst fluence ratios(2-30kev)/s(30-400kev)&gt;1. a non-fading optical source with r~24 mag and withan apparently extended morphology is spatially consistent with the x-rayafterglow, likely the host galaxy. xrf 040912 is a very dark burst since noafterglow optical counterpart is detected down to r&gt;25 mag (3 sigma limitingmagnitude) at 13.6 hours after the burst. the host galaxy spectrum detectedfrom 3800a to 10000a, shows a single emission line at 9552a. the lack of anyother strong emission lines blue-ward of the detected one and the absence ofthe ly alpha cut-off down to 3800a are consistent with the hypothesis of the[oii] line at redshift z=1.563+/-0.001. the intrinsic spectral properties rankthis xrf among the soft grbs in the e_peak-e_iso diagram. similar results wereobtained for most xrfs at known redshift. only xrf 060218 and xrf 020903represent a good example of instrinsic xrf(i-xrf) and are possibly associatedwith a different progenitor population. this scenario may calls for a newdefinition of xrfs.

(2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.

astro-ph;9405031	the x-ray spectrum of soft gamma repeater 1806-20	soft gamma repeaters (sgrs) are a class of rare, high-energy galactictransients that have episodes of short (~0.1 sec), soft (~30 kev), intense(~100 crab), gamma-ray bursts. we report an analysis of the x-ray emission from95 sgr1806-20 events observed by the international cometary explorer. thespectral shape remains remarkably constant for bursts that differ in intensityby a range of 50. below 15 kev the number spectrum falls off rapidly such thatwe can estimate the total intensity of the events. assuming that sgr1806-20 isassociated with the supernova remnant g10.0-0.3 (kulkarni and frail, murakami\etal), the brightest events had a total luminosity of ~1.8 x 10^42 erg sec^-1,a factor of 2 x 10^4 above the eddington limit. a third of the emission wasabove 30 kev. there are at least three processes that are consistent with thespectral rollover below 15 kev. (1)the rollover is consistent with some formsof self absorption. typical thermal temperatures are ~20 kev and require anemitting surface with a radius between 10 and 50 km. the lack of spectralvariability implies that only the size of the emitting surface varies betweenevents. if the process is thermal synchrotron the required magnetic field mightbe too small to confine the plasma against the super eddington flux. (2)the lowenergy rollover could be due to photoelectric absorption by ~10^24 hydrogenatoms cm^-2 of neutral material with a cosmic abundance assuming a continuumsimilar to tb with t= ~22 kev. (3) emission in the two lowest harmonics from a1.3 x 10^12 gauss field would appear as doppler broadened lines and fall offrapidly below 15 kev.

astro-ph;9607163	expanding relativistic shells and gamma-ray burst temporal structure	many models of cosmological gamma-ray bursts involve the sudden release of$\sim 10^{51}$ erg which produce shells which expand at relativistic speeds(lorentz $\gamma$ factors of $10^{2-3}$). we investigate the kinematic limitson the source size due to the observed time structure in three types of bursts:short spikes, freds (fast rise, exponentail decay), and long complex bursts.the emitting shell keeps up with the photons it produces reducing apparentdurations by $\gamma^2$ so that source sizes can be very large ($2c\gamma^2t_{dur}). however, the thickness of the emitting region is not effected by theshell motion so it must always be small, $c\delta t$ where $\delta t$ is thesubpeak time scale. we argue that one can only view the bulk motion head-on soit is inappropriate to treat grbs as viewing the sides of a jet. althoughphotons come from a region within an angle $\gamma^{-1}$, we show that thecurvature of the shell within that angle creates delays comparable to thoseassociated with the duration of the event. as a result, most bursts should belike freds with sharp rises related to how long the shell emits and power lawdecays related to how long the shell expanded before becoming gamma-ray active.few bursts have the long decay phases required for large shells resulting inunacceptable high densities for ism objects to cause the observed subpeaks. tobe consistent with the observations, perhaps very thick shells (which act asparallel slabs) are required to avoid the effects of the curvature, or theduration is dictated by a central engine.

astro-ph;9705028	limits on expanding relativistic shells from gamma-ray burst temporal  structure	we calculate the expected envelope of emission for relativistic shells underthe assumption of local spherical symmetry. gamma-ray burst envelopes rarelyconform to the expected shape, which is similar to a fred; a fast rise andexponential decay. the fast rise is determined by the time that therelativistic shell prodcues gamma rays. the decay has the form of a power lawand arises from the curvature of the shell. the amount of curvature comes fromthe overall size of the shell so the duration of the decay phase is related tothe time the shell expands before converting its energy to gamma rays. from theenvelope of emission, one can estimate when the central explosion occurred and,thus, the energy required for the shell to sweep up the ism. the energy greatlyexceeds 10^{53} erg unless the bulk lorentz factor is less than 75. this putsextreme limits on the "external" shock models. however, the alternative,"internal" shocks from a central engine, has a problem: the entire long complextime history lasting hundreds of seconds must be postulated at the centralsite.

astro-ph;9705052	relativistic shells and gamma-ray bursts	in many models of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) relativistic shells are responsiblefor the overall envelope of emission. we use kinematics and symmetry tocalculate the time history and spectral evolution expected from a relativisticshell including effects from intrinsic variations in the shell's intensity andspectra. we find that the decay phase of an envelope is produced by photonsdelayed by the shell's curvature. these delayed photons are produced by regionsthat are off-axis such that the spectra evolve according to a universalfunction (t^{-1}) regardless of intrinsic variations in the rest frame of theshell. we compare our predictions to the overall envelope of emission of grbs.the observed spectra evolve faster. intrinsic variations cannot make thespectra evolve that fast, which adds strength to the ``shell symmetry''problem: models, in particular, the external shock model, that involverelativistic shells must either confine the material to narrow pencil beams, bevery inefficient, or break the local spherical symmetry so that the shell actslike a parallel slab. in the case of the internal shock models involving winds(i.e., central engines), it will probably be easier to break the localspherical symmetry, but then one must postulate nearly continuous energygeneration at 10^{51} erg s^{-1} lasting up to hundreds of seconds at thecentral site.

astro-ph;9712266	x-ray spectral properties of gamma-ray bursts	we summarize the spectral characteristics of a sample of 22 bright gamma-raybursts detected with the gamma-ray burst sensors aboard the satellite ginga.this instrument employed a proportional and scintillation counter to providesensitivity to photons in the 2 - 400 kev range, providing a unique opportunityto characterize the largely unexplored x-ray properties of gamma-ray bursts.the photon spectra of the ginga bursts are well described by a low energyslope, a bend energy, and a high energy slope. in the energy range where theycan be compared, this result is consistent with burst spectral analysesobtained from the batse experiment aboard the compton observatory. however,below 20 kev we find evidence for a positive spectral number index inapproximately 40% of our burst sample, with some evidence for a strong rolloffat lower energies in a few events. there is a correlation (pearson's r = -0.62)between the low energy slope and the bend energy. we find that the distributionof spectral bend energies extends below 10 kev. the observed ratio of energyemitted in the x-rays relative to the gamma-rays can be much larger than a fewpercent and, in fact, is sometimes larger than unity. the average for oursample is 24%.

astro-ph;9712302	variability in shell models of gamma-ray bursts	many cosmological models of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) assume that a singlerelativistic shell carries kinetic energy away from the source and laterconverts it into gamma rays, perhaps by interactions with the interstellarmedium or by shocks within the shell. we investigate methods of achieving theobserved variability using symmetry. since our model emphasizes geometric andstatistical considerations, rather than the detailed physics of the shell, itis applicable to any theory that relies on relativistic shells. in order toachieve the observed variability in grbs using a single-shell model, we havefound that the gamma-ray emission must occur from small patches on the shell(entities). we have derived two significant characteristics of the timehistories expected from such a model. first, the average number of entitiescontributing to the signal remains constant throughout much of the timehistory, although the overall photon flux decreases due to relativisticeffects. second, the "peaks" in a time history can be ascribed to poissonvariations in the actual number of entities contributing to the signal at anygiven time. taken together, these properties imply that the relative variationsin a grb (i.e. the heights of the peaks relative to the average envelope of thesignal) should remain constant throughout a time history.

astro-ph;9712303	kinematic arguments against single relativistic shell models for  gamma-ray bursts	two main types of models have been suggested to explain the long durationsand multiple peaks of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). in one, there is a very quickrelease of energy at a central site resulting in a single relativistic shellthat produces peaks in the time history through its interactions with theambient material. in the other, the central site sporadically releases energyover hundreds of seconds forming a peak with each burst of energy. we presentthree kinematic arguments against a single relativistic shell. these argumentsare based only on symmetry. we show that the average envelope of emission ofgrbs is a linear function rather than the power law expected for a singlerelativistic shell. we show that presence of gaps in grbs is the strongestargument against a single relativistic shell. we estimate that the fraction ofa single shell that can produce gamma-rays in a grb with multiple peaks isabout 0.001, implying that single relativistic shells require 1000 times moreenergy than previously thought. we conclude that either the central site of agrb must produce 10^{51} erg/s for hundreds of seconds, or the relativisticshell must have structure on a scales the order of sqrt(epsilon)/gamma, wheregamma is the bulk lorentz factor and epsilon is the efficiency.

astro-ph;9712331	the average temporal and spectral evolution of gamma-ray bursts	we have averaged bright batse bursts to uncover the average overall temporaland spectral evolution of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we align the temporalstructure of each burst by setting its duration to a standard duration, whichwe call t_&lt;dur&gt;. the observed average ``aligned $t_&lt;dur&gt;'' profile for 32bright bursts with intermediate durations (16 to 40 s) has a sharp rise (withinthe first 20% of t_&lt;dur&gt;) and then a linear decay. exponentials and power lawsdo not fit this decay. in particular, the power law seen in the x-ray afterglow(t^{-1.4}) is not observed during the bursts, implying that the x-ray afterglowis not just an extension of the x-ray evolution seen during the gamma-rayphase. the average burst spectrum has a low energy slope of -1.03, a highenergy slope of -3.31, and a peak in the \nu f_{\nu} distribution at 390 kev.we determine the average spectral evolution. remarkably, it is also a linearfunction, with the peak of the \nu f_{\nu} distribution given by 680 - 600(t/t_&lt;dur&gt;) kev. since both the temporal profile and the peak energy are linearfunctions, the peak energy is linearly proportional to the intensity. thisbehavior is inconsistent with the external shock model. previously, trends havebeen reported for grb evolution, but our results are quantitative relationshipsthat models should attempt to explain.

astro-ph;9712332	x-ray spectral characteristics of ginga gamma-ray bursts	the proportional counter and scintillator on ginga provided unprecentedspectral coverage of grbs, from 2 - 400 kev. below 20 kev we find evidence fora positive spectral number index in approximately 40% of our burst sample, withsome evidence for a strong rolloff at lower energies in a few events. there isa correlation (pearson's r = -0.62) between the low energy slope and the bendenergy. we find that the distribution of spectral bend energies extends below10 kev. there has been some concern in cosmological models of grbs that thebend energy covers only a small dynamic range. our result extends the observeddynamic range and, since we observe bend energies down to the limit of ourinstrument, perhaps observations have not yet limited the range. the gingatrigger range was virtually the same as batse's, yet we find a different rangeof fit parameters. one possible explanation might be that grbs have two breakenergies, one often in the 50 to 500 kev range and the other near 5 kev. bothbatse and ginga fit with only a single break energy so batse tends to findbreaks near the center of its energy range and we tend to find breaks in ourenergy range. the observed ratio of energy emitted in the x-rays relative tothe gamma-rays can be much larger than a few percent and, in fact, is sometimeslarger than unity. the average for our 22 bursts is 24%. there is one exampleof a strong x-ray excess at low energy.

astro-ph;9802154	gamma-ray burst spectra and time histories from 2 to 400 kev	the gamma-ray burst detector on ginga consisted of a proportional counter toobserve the x-rays and a scintillation counter to observe the gamma-rays. itwas ideally suited to study the x-rays associated with gamma-ray bursts (grbs).ginga detected 120 grbs and 22 of them had sufficient statistics to determinespectra from 2 to 400 kev. although the ginga and batse trigger criteria werevery similar, the distribution of spectral parameters was different. gingaobserved bend energies in the spectra down to 2 kev and had a larger fractionof bursts with low energy power law indexes greater than zero. the averageratio of energy in the x-ray band (2 to 10 kev) compared to the gamma-ray band(50 to 300 kev) was 24%. some events had more energy in the x-ray band than inthe gamma-ray band. one ginga event had a period of time preceding the gammarays that was effectively pure x-ray emission. this x-ray ``preactivity'' mightbe due to the penchant for the grb time structure to be broader at lower energyrather than a different physical process. the x-rays tend to rise and fallslower than the gamma rays but they both tend to peak at about the same time.this argues against models involving the injection of relativistic electronsthat cool by synchrotron radiation.

astro-ph;9802200	gamma-ray burst and relativistic shells: the surface filling factor	the variability observed in many complex gamma-ray bursts (grbs) isinconsistent with causally connected variations in a single, symmetric,relativistic shell interacting with the ambient material ("external shocks").rather, the symmetry of the shell must be broken on an angular scale muchsmaller than gamma^{-1} where gamma is the bulk lorentz factor for the shell.the observed variability in the external shock models arises from the number ofcausally connected regions that (randomly) become active. we define the"surface filling factor" to be the ratio of the area of causally connectedregions that become active to the observable area of the shell. from theobserved variability in 52 batse bursts, we estimate the surface filling factorto be typically 0.005 although some values are near unity. we find that thesurface filling factor is about 0.1 delta t/t in both the constant gamma phase(which probably produces the grb) and the deaccelerating phase (which probablyproduces the x-ray afterglows). here, \delta t is a typical time scale ofvariability and t is the time since the initial signal. we analyze the 2 hrflare seen by asca 36 hr after the grb and conclude that the surface fillingfactor must be small (0.001) in the x-ray afterglow phase as well. explanationsfor low surface filling factor can either require more or less energy (by afactor of about 1000) compared to that expected for a symmetric shell.

astro-ph;9810271	gamma ray bursts have millisecond variability	we have performed searches for isolated flares and for steady flickering ingamma ray burst light curves on the microsecond to millisecond time scales. twobursts out of our sample of 20 revealed four isolated flares with time scalesfrom $256 \mu s$ to $2048 \mu s$. a wavelet analysis for our sample showed lowlevel flickering for all bursts on time scales from $256 \mu s$ to 33 ms, withthe majority of bursts containing rise times faster than four milliseconds and30% having rise times faster than one millisecond. these results show thatmillisecond variability is common in classical bursts and not some exceptionalactivity by a possibly separate class of bursts. these fast rise times can beused to place severe limits on burst models: (1) the characteristic thicknessof the energy generation region must be less than 1200 km along the line ofsight. (2) the angular size of the gamma ray emission region as subtended fromthe central source must be less than 42 arc-seconds. (3) the expanding ejectamust have a range of lorentz factors along a radius line with a dispersion ofless than roughly 2%. (4) within the external shock scenario, thecharacteristic dimension of the impacted cloud must be smaller than 16astronomical units on average. (5) within the collimated jet scenario, thecollimation angle must be smaller than 42 arc-seconds.

astro-ph;9812426	temporal evolution of the pulse width in grbs	many cosmological models of grbs envision the energy source to be acataclysmic stellar event leading to a relativistically expanding fireball.particles are thought to be accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermalradiation. the highly variable temporal structure observed in most grbs hassignificantly constrained models. by using different methods of statisticalanalysis in the time domain we show that the width of the pulses in grbs timehistories remain remarkably constant throughout the classic grb phase. peaks atthe end of a burst have the same average duration to within a few percent asthe peaks at the start of the burst. for emission sites that lie on arelativistically expanding shell, peaks should grow in duration because ofdeceleration. we find no deceleration over at least 2/3 of the burst duration.for emission sites that occupy a spread of angles on a shell, the curvatureshould cause the later peaks to grow in duration. since we see no such growth,we can limit the total angular size of the shell to be substantially smallerthan \gamma^{-1} where \gamma is the bulk lorentz factor. this lack of temporalevolution of the pulse width should be explained by any fireball shockscenario.

astro-ph;9902007	grb990123: evidence that the gamma rays come from a central engine	grb990123 was a long complex gamma-ray burst with an optical transient thatstarted early within the gamma-ray phase. the peak and power law decay of theearly optical emission strongly indicates the presence of a deceleratingrelativistic shell during that phase. prior to this burst, it was not known ifthe shell decelerated during the burst, so an external shock origin for thegamma rays was still possible. if the gamma-rays are produced in the externalshock, then the pulse widths should reflect the observed deceleration of theshell and increase by about 2.3. we analyze the fine time structure observed inthe gamma-ray data from batse and determine that the width of the peaks do notincrease as expected for a decelerating shell; the later pulses are, at most, afactor of 1.15 longer than the earlier pulses. we also analyze the variabilityto determine what fraction of the shell's surface could be involved in theproduction of the gamma rays, the so-called surface filling factor. forgrb990123 we find a filling factor of 0.008. the lack of pulse width evolutioneliminates the only remaining kinematically acceptable external shockexplanation for the gamma-ray phase and, thus, the gamma rays must originate ata central engine.

astro-ph;9906125	the observational basis for central engines in gamma ray bursts	we review the observational differences between gamma-ray bursts occurring ona single shell (such as in the external shock model) and multiple shells (suchas in the internal shock model). we do not argue against external shocks or forinternal shocks, as such, but rather against a single shell and for a centralengine that is small enough to produce the typical grb time history withoutviolating causality or other kinematic limits. the expected profile and averagespectral evolution from a single shell is compared to the average of manybursts and found to be different. the presence of gaps in many gamma-ray burstsis a strong argument against a single shell because an observer should see manycausally disconnected regions at any one time.the rapid variability is alsodifficult to explain from a single shell because of the large number ofcausally disconnected regions. the pulse width as a function of time in a burstshould increase because there is a one-to-one relationship between arrival timeand the off-axis angle of emission. the observations show that the pulse widthdoes not increase with time. finally, in grb990123 there is evidence fordeceleration from the simultaneous optical observations, yet the gamma-raypulses show no lengthening of their pulse structure. we conclude that gamma-raybursts are caused by a relatively small central engine.

astro-ph;9906394	statistical analysis of spectral line candidates in gamma-ray burst  grb870303	the ginga data for the gamma-ray burst grb870303 exhibit low-energy dips intwo temporally distinct spectra, denoted s1 and s2. s1, spanning 4 s, exhibitsa single line candidate at ~ 20 kev, while s2, spanning 9 s, exhibitsapparently harmonically spaced line candidates at ~ 20 and 40 kev. we evaluatethe statistical evidence for these lines, using phenomenological continuum andline models which in their details are independent of the distance scale togamma-ray bursts. we employ the methodologies based on both frequentist andbayesian statistical inference that we develop in freeman et al. (1999b). thesemethodologies utilize the information present in the data to select thesimplest model that adequately describes the data from among a wide range ofcontinuum and continuum-plus-line(s) models. this ensures that the chosen modeldoes not include free parameters that the data deem unnecessary and that wouldact to reduce the frequentist significance and bayesian odds of thecontinuum-plus-line(s) model. we calculate the significance of thecontinuum-plus-line(s) models using the chi-square maximum likelihood ratiotest. we describe a parametrization of the exponentiated gaussian absorptionline shape that makes the probability surface in parameter spacebetter-behaved, allowing us to estimate analytically the bayesian odds. thesignificance of the continuum-plus-line models requested by the s1 and s2 dataare 3.6 x 10^-5 and 1.7 x 10^-4 respectively, with the odds favoring them being114:1 and 7:1. we also apply our methodology to the combined (s1+s2) data. thesignificance of the continuum-plus-lines model requested by the combined datais 4.2 x 10^-8, with the odds favoring it being 40,300:1.

astro-ph;9906395	resonant cyclotron radiation transfer model fits to spectra from  gamma-ray burst grb870303	we demonstrate that models of resonant cyclotron radiation transfer in astrong field (i.e. cyclotron scattering) can account for spectral lines seen attwo epochs, denoted s1 and s2, in the ginga data for grb870303. using ageneralized version of the monte carlo code of wang et al. (1988,1989b), wemodel line formation by injecting continuum photons into a staticplane-parallel slab of electrons threaded by a strong neutron star magneticfield (~ 10^12 g) which may be oriented at an arbitrary angle relative to theslab normal. we examine two source geometries, which we denote "1-0" and "1-1,"with the numbers representing the relative electron column densities above andbelow the continuum photon source plane. we compare azimuthally symmetricmodels, i.e. models in which the magnetic field is parallel to the slab normal,with models having more general magnetic field orientations. if the burstingsource has a simple dipole field, these two model classes represent lineformation at the magnetic pole, or elsewhere on the stellar surface. we findthat the data of s1 and s2, considered individually, are consistent with bothgeometries, and with all magnetic field orientations, with the exception thatthe s1 data clearly favor line formation away from a polar cap in the 1-1geometry, with the best-fit model placing the line-forming region at themagnetic equator. within both geometries, fits to the combined (s1+s2) datamarginally favor models which feature equatorial line formation, and in whichthe observer's orientation with respect to the slab changes between the twoepochs. we interpret this change as being due to neutron star rotation, and weplace limits on the rotation period.

astro-ph;9909299	gamma-ray bursts as internal shocks caused by deceleration	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been thought to originate from internal shocksthat occur about 10^{15} cm from a central site. the shells responsible forthese shocks merge together and undergo an external shock at about 10^{17} cm,producing the afterglows. we include deceleration in our model of internalshocks and find that, for values of the lorentz factor greater than 10^3,deceleration is an effective catalyst for converting the bulk motion energyinto radiation during the grb phase. substantial internal energy occurs becauseother shells run into the back of the first shell which has decelerated andbecause the first shell must energize the interstellar medium. whereas internalshocks without deceleration are about 25% efficient, we can convert up to 85%of the bulk motion energy during the grb phase. we demonstrate that theresulting time history can have three components. the first is due to internalshocks, excluding those that involve the first shell. this component producesnarrow peaks throughout the time history. the second is due to internal shocksinvolving the first shell, and it produces progressively wider and wider peaksbut they tend to be hidden in a slowly varying background in the event. thethird component is from energizing the interstellar medium. it is very smoothand may contribute mostly to a lower energy bandpass than the batse experiment.there have been claims of upper limits on the possible lorentz factor becausethe deceleration must occur at greater radii than the internal shocks to avoidmaking progressively wider peaks. we do not find this to be the case, and thelorentz factor (and efficiency) can be much larger.

astro-ph;9910273	pulse width evolution in grbs: evidence for internal shocks	many cosmological models of grbs envision the energy source to be acataclysmic stellar event leading to a relativistically expanding fireball.particles are thought to be accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermalradiation. the highly variable temporal structure observed in most grbs hassignificantly constrained models. by using different methods of statisticalanalysis in the time domain we find that the width of the large amplitudepulses in grb time histories remain remarkably constant throughout the classicgrb phase. this is also true for small amplitude pulses. however, small andlarge pulses do not have the same pulse width within a single time history. wefind a quantitative relationship between pulse amplitude and pulse width: thesmaller amplitude peaks tend to be wider, with amplitude following a power lawwith an index of about -2.8. internal shocks simulated by randomly selectingthe lorentz factor and energy per shell are consistent with a power lawrelationship. this is strong quantitative evidence that grbs are, indeed,caused by internal shocks. the dependency of the width-vs.-intensityrelationship on the maximum lorentz factor provides a way to estimate thatelusive parameter. our observed power law index indicates that \gamma_{max} isless or equal than 10^3. we also interpret the narrowness of the pulse widthdistribution as indicating that the emission, that occurs when one shell overtakes another, is produced over a small range of distances from the centralsite.

0811.3304	intrinsic properties of a complete sample of hete-2 gamma-ray bursts. a  measure of the grb rate in the local universe	aims: taking advantage of the forthcoming catalog of the hete-2 mission, theaim of this paper is to evaluate the main properties of hete-2 grbs - thee_peak, the t_90 and the e_iso - in their source frames and to derive theirunbiased distribution. methods: we first construct a complete sample containingall the bursts localized by the wxm on-board hete-2, which are selected with auniform criterion and whose observed parameters can be constrained. we thenderive the intrinsic e_peak, t_90 and e_iso distributions using their redshiftwhen it is available, or their pseudo-redshift otherwise. we finally computethe number of grb (n_vmax) within the visibility volume (v_max) of each grb, inorder to derive a weight for each detected burst accounting both for thedetection significance and the star formation history of the universe. results:the unbiased distributions obtained clearly show the predominence of x-rayflashes (xrfs) in the global grb population. we also derive the rate of localgrbs: r0^h2 &gt; 11 gpc-3 yr-1, which is intermediate between the local rateobtained by considering only the high-luminosity bursts (~1 gpc-3 yr-1) andthat obtained by including the low-luminosity bursts (&gt;200 gpc-3 yr-1).

0811.3401	epeak estimator for gamma-ray bursts observed by the swift burst alert  telescope	we report a correlation based on a spectral simulation study of the promptemission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the swift burst alerttelescope (bat). the correlation is between the epeak energy, which is the peakenergy in the \nu f_\nu spectrum, and the photon index (\gamma) derived from asimple power-law model. the epeak - \gamma relation, assuming the typicalsmoothly broken power-law spectrum of grbs, is \log epeak = 3.258 - 0.829\gamma(1.3 &lt; \gamma &lt; 2.3). we take into account not only a range of epeak energiesand fluences, but also distributions for both the low-energy photon index andthe high-energy photon index in the smoothly broken power-law model. thedistribution of burst durations in the bat grb sample is also included in thesimulation. our correlation is consistent with the index observed by bat andepeak measured by the bat, and by other grb instruments. since about 85% ofgrbs observed by the bat are acceptably fit with the simple power-law modelbecause of the relatively narrow energy range of the bat, this relationship canbe used to estimate epeak when it is located within the bat energy range.
