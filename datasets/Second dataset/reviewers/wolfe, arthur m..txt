0904.4725	wavelength accuracy of the keck hires spectrograph and measuring changes  in the fine structure constant	we report on an attempt to accurately wavelength calibrate four nights ofdata taken with the keck hires spectrograph on qso phl957, for the purpose ofdetermining whether the fine structure constant was different in the past.using new software and techniques, we measured the redshifts of various ni ii,fe ii, si ii, etc. lines in a damped ly-alpha system at z=2.309. roughly halfthe data was taken through the keck iodine cell which contains thousands ofwell calibrated iodine lines. using these iodine exposures to calibrate thenormal th-ar keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, anddrifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. these offsets correspond to anabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about delta z=10^{-5} (delta lambda= 0.02ang), with daily drifts of around delta z=5x10^{-6} (delta lambda =0.01 ang),and multiday drifts of nearly delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 ang). the causes of thewavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the finestructure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m/s, thislevel of systematic uncertainty makes may make it difficult to use keck hiresdata to constrain the change in the fine structure constant. using ourcalibrated data, we applied both our own fitting software and standard fittingsoftware to measure (delta alpha)/alpha, but discovered that we could obtainresults ranging from significant detection of either sign, to strong nulllimits, depending upon which sets of lines and which fitting method was used.we thus speculate that the discrepant results on (delta alpha)/alpha reportedin the literature may be due to random fluctuations coming from under-estimatedsystematic errors in wavelength calibration and fitting procedure.

0905.1042	metal-enriched plasma in protogalactic halos: a survey of n v absorption  in high-z damped &amp; sub-damped lyman-alpha systems	we continue our recent work to characterize the plasma content ofhigh-redshift damped and sub-damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas/sub-dlas), whichrepresent multi-phase gaseous (proto)galactic disks and halos seen toward abackground source. we survey n v absorption in a sample of 91 dlas and 18sub-dlas in the redshift range 1.67&lt;z&lt;4.28 with unblended coverage of the n vdoublet, using data from vlt/uves, keck/hires, and keck/esi. in dlas, we findeight secure n v detections, four marginal detections, and 79 non-detections.the detection rate of n v in dlas is therefore 13^{+5}_{-4}%. two sub-dla n vdetections are found among a sample of 18, at a similar detection rate of11^{+15}_{-7}%. we show that the n v detection rate is a strong function ofmetallicity, increasing by a factor of ~4 at [n/h]=[ni/hi]&gt;-2.3. the n v andciv component b-value distributions in dlas are statistically similar, but themedian b(n v) of 18 km/s is lower than the median b(o vi) of 25 km/s. some ~20%of the n v components have b&lt;10 km/s and thus arise in warm photoionized plasmaat log (t/k)&lt;4.92; local sources of ionizing radiation (as opposed to theextragalactic background) are required to keep the cloud sizes physicallyreasonable. the nature of the remaining ~80% of (broad) n v components isunclear; models of radiatively-cooling collisionally-ionized plasma atlog(t/k)=5.2-5.4 are fairly successful in reproducing the observed integratedhigh-ion column density ratios and the component line widths, but we cannotrule out photoionization by local sources. finally, we identify several unusualdlas with extremely low metallicity (&lt;0.01 solar) but strong high-ionabsorption [log n(n v)&gt;14 or log n(o vi)&gt;14.2] that present challenges toeither galactic inflow or outflow models.

0908.3485	direct evidence of cold gas in dla 0812+32b	we present the first direct evidence for cold gas in a high redshift dlagalaxy. we measured several multiplets of weak neutral carbon (ci) transitionsin order to perform a curve of growth analysis. a delta chi-squared testconstrains the best fit doppler parameter, b = 0.33_{-0.04}^{+0.05} km/s, andlogn(ci) = 13.30 +- 0.2 cm^-2. this doppler parameter constrains the kinetictemperature of the gas to t &lt;= 78 k (t &lt;= 115 k, 2 sigma). we used theassociated ci fine structure lines to constrain the volume density of the gas,n(hi) ~ 40 - 200 cm^-3 (2 sigma), resulting in a lower limit on the cloud sizeof approximately 0.1 - 1 parsec. while it is difficult to determine themetallicity of the cold component, the absence of cr ii indicates that the coldcloud suffers a high level of dust depletion. additionally, the large amount oflyman and werner-band molecular hydrogen absorption (log n(h2)_{total} = 19.88cm^-2, f_{h_2} &gt;= 0.06) with an excitation temperature of t_{ex} = 46 k asdetermined by the rotational j = 0 and j = 1 states, is consistent with thepresence of cold gas. we propose that this cloud may be gravitationallyconfined and may represent a transition gas-phase from primarily neutral atomicgas, to a colder, denser molecular phase that will eventually host starformation.

0912.1632	lyman break galaxy close and interacting pairs at z ~ 3	to date, the identification of interactions at z ~ 3 and above has relied onmorphological analysis. here, we present five serendipitous spectroscopic z ~ 3lyman break galaxy (lbg) pairs with projected proper separations &lt; 15 h^-1 kpcin our survey of nine separate keck fields. the data consist of 140 of ourhighest signal-to-noise ratio lbg spectra and ~500 of our most confidentcolour-selected lbgs. we show that the pairs are composed of two distinct closeand/or interacting lbgs from a detailed analysis of the rest-frame ultravioletspectra and images. in addition, we show that the pair number and separationdistribution is expected from (1) the angular correlation function when appliedto our survey and ~2500 colour-selected lbgs from the literature and (2) ananalysis of a carefully matched high-resolution hybrid numerical and analyticalcosmological simulation. because the spectroscopic slitlets have randomorientations with respect to the close pairs on the sky, the serendipitouspairs provide an unbiased sampling of the underlying close pair fraction.finally, we discover two ly-a emitters (laes) in our slitlets and find thatthey reside within 50 projected h^-1 kpc of lbgs. in this work, we uncover astrong relationship between ly-a emission and pair separation. all confirmedand all candidate lbg pairs with separations of &lt; 15 projected h^-1 kpc exhibitly-a in emission and we find an overabundance of ly-a emission in pairs with &lt;50 projected h^-1 kpc separations. this relationship suggests a picture inwhich a measurable fraction of the ly-a emission of lbgs, and potentially laes,is generated via interaction mechanisms. as a result, serendipitousspectroscopic close pairs provide a unique means to help identify and studyhigh-redshift galaxy interactions using conventional ground-based optical data.

1004.2715	the nature of proximate damped lyman alpha systems	we present high resolution echelle spectra of 7 proximate damped lyman alpha(pdla) systems whose relative velocity separation from the background quasar isdelta v &lt; 3000 km/s. combining our sample with a further 9 pdlas from theliterature we compare the chemical properties of the proximate systems with acontrol sample of intervening dlas. taken at face value, the sample of 16 pdlasexhibits a wide range of metallicities, ranging from z ~ 1/3 z_sun down to z ~1/1000 z_sun, including the dla with the lowest n(siii)/n(hi) yet reported inthe literature. we find several pieces of evidence that indicate enhancedionization and the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum in pdlas which lead toproperties that contrast with the intervening dlas, particularly when the n(hi)is low. the abundances of zn, si and s in pdlas with log n(hi) &gt; 21, whereionization corrections are minimized, are systematically higher than theintervening population by a factor of around 3. we also find possible evidencefor a higher fraction of nv absorbers amongst the pdlas, although thestatistics are still modest. 6/7 of our echelle sample show high ionizationspecies (siiv, civ, ovi or nv) offset by &gt;100 km/s from the main low ionabsorption. we analyse fine-structure transitions of cii* and siii* toconstrain the pdla distance from the qso. lower limits range from tens of kpcup to &gt;160 kpc for the most stringent limit. we conclude that (at least some)pdlas do exhibit different characteristics relative to the interveningpopulation out to 3000 km/s (and possibly beyond). nonetheless, the pdlasappear distinct from lower column density associated systems and the inferredqso-absorber separations mean they are unlikely to be associated with the qsohost. we speculate that the pdlas preferentially sample more massive galaxiesin more highly clustered regions of the high redshift universe.

1008.4676	understanding physical conditions in high redshift galaxies through c i  fine structure lines: data and methodology	we probe the physical conditions in high redshift galaxies, specifically, thedamped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) using neutral carbon (ci) fine structurelines and molecular hydrogen (h2). we report five new detections of ci andanalyze the ci in an additional 2 dlas with previously published data. we alsopresent one new detection of h2 in a dla. we present a new method of analysisthat simultaneously constrains \emph{both} the volume density and thetemperature of the gas, as opposed to previous studies that a priori assumed agas temperature. we use only the column density of ci measured in the finestructure states and the assumption of ionization equilibrium in order toconstrain the physical conditions in the gas. we present a sample of 11 civelocity components in 6 dlas and compare their properties to those derived bythe global cii* technique. the resulting median values for this sample are:&lt;n(hi)&gt; = 69 cm^{-3}, &lt;t&gt; = 50 k, and &lt;log(p/k)&gt; = 3.86 cm^{-3} k, withstandard deviations, sigma_{n(hi)} = 134 cm^{-3}, sigma_t = 52 k, andsigma_{log(p/k)} = 3.68 cm^{-3} k. this can be compared with the integratedmedian values for the same dlas : &lt;n(hi)&gt; = 2.8 cm^{-3}, &lt;t&gt; = 139 k, and&lt;log(p/k)&gt; = 2.57 cm^{-3} k, with standard deviations sigma_{n(hi)} = 3.0cm^{-3}, sigma_t = 43 k, and sigma_{log(p/k)} = 0.22 cm^{-3} k. interestingly,the pressures measured in these high redshift ci clouds are similar to thosefound in the milky way. we conclude that the ci gas is tracing ahigher-density, higher-pressure region, possibly indicative of post-shock gasor a photodissociation region on the edge of a molecular cloud. we speculatethat these clouds may be direct probes of the precursor sites of star formationin normal galaxies at high redshift.

1011.6390	star formation from dla gas in the outskirts of lyman break galaxies at  z~3	we present evidence for spatially extended low surface brightness emissionaround lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the v band image of the hubble ultra deepfield, corresponding to the z~3 rest-frame fuv light, which is a sensitivemeasure of star formation rates (sfrs). we find that the covering fraction ofmolecular gas at z~3 is not adequate to explain the emission in the outskirtsof lbgs, while the covering fraction of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gasat high redshift is sufficient. we develop a theoretical framework to connectthis emission around lbgs to the expected emission from neutral h i gas i.e.,damped lyman alpha systems (dlas), using the kennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation.working under the hypothesis that the observed fuv emission in the outskirts oflbgs is from in situ star formation in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas, theresults suggest that the sfr efficiency in such gas at z~3 is between factorsof 10 and 50 lower than predictions based on the local ks relation. the totalsfr density in atomic-dominated gas at z~3 is constrained to be ~10% of thatobserved from the inner regions of lbgs. in addition, the metals produced by insitu star formation in the outskirts of lbgs yield metallicities comparable tothose of dlas, which is a possible solution to the "missing metals" problem fordlas. finally, the atomic-dominated gas in the outskirts of galaxies at bothhigh and low redshifts has similar reduced sfr efficiencies and is consistentwith the same power law.

1103.4167	spectral polarization of the redshifted 21 cm absorption line toward 3c  286	a re-analysis of the stokes-parameter spectra obtained of the z=0.692 21 cmabsorption line toward 3c 286 shows that our original claimed detection ofzeeman splitting by a line-of-sight magnetic field, b_los = 87 microgauss isincorrect. because of an insidious software error, what we reported as stokes vis actually stokes u: the revised stokes v spectrum indicates a 3-sigma upperlimit of b_los &lt; 17 microgauss. the correct analysis reveals an absorptionfeature in fractional polarization that is offset in velocity from the stokes ispectrum by -1.9 km/s. the polarization position-angle spectrum shows a dipthat is also significantly offset from the stokes i feature, but at a velocitythat differs slightly from the absorption feature in fractional polarization.we model the absorption feature with 3 velocity components against the core-jetstructure of 3c 286. our chisquare minimization fitting results in componentswith differing (1) ratios of h i column density to spin temperature, (2)velocity centroids, and (3) velocity dispersions. the change in polarizationposition angle with frequency implies incomplete coverage of the background jetsource by the absorber. it also implies a spatial variation of the polarizationposition angle across the jet source, which is observed at frequencies higherthan the 839.4 mhz absorption frequency. the multi-component structure of thegas is best understood in terms of components with spatial scales of ~100 pccomprised of hundreds of low-temperature (t &lt; 200 k) clouds with lineardimensions of about 1 pc.

1205.5047	metallicity evolution of damped lyman-alpha systems out to z~5	we present chemical abundance measurements for 47 damped lyman-alpha systems(dlas), 30 at z&gt;4, observed with the echellette spectrograph and imager and thehigh resolution echelle spectrometer on the keck telescopes. hi columndensities of the dlas are measured with voigt profile fits to the lyman-alphaprofiles, and we find an increased number of false dla identifications withsdss at z&gt;4 due to the increased density of the lyman-alpha forest. ioniccolumn densities are determined using the apparent optical depth method, and wecombine our new metallicity measurements with 195 from previous surveys todetermine the evolution of the cosmic metallicity of neutral gas. we find themetallicity of dlas decreases with increasing redshift, improving thesignificance of the trend and extending it to higher redshifts, with a linearfit of -0.22+-0.03 dex per unit redshift from z=0.09-5.06. the metallicity'floor' of ~1/600 solar continues out to z~5, despite our sensitivity forfinding dlas with much lower metallicities. however, this floor is notstatistically different from a steep tail to the distribution. we also findthat the intrinsic scatter of metallicity among dlas of ~0.5 dex continues outto z~5. in addition, the metallicity distribution and the alpha/fe ratios ofz&gt;2 dlas are consistent with being drawn from the same parent population withthose of halo stars. it is therefore possible that the halo stars in the milkyway formed out of gas that commonly exhibits dla absorption at z&gt;2.

0712.1108	the color excess of quasars with intervening dla systems- analysis of  the sdss data release five	we analyzed the spectroscopic and photometric database of the 5th datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to search for evidence of thequasar reddening produced by dust embedded in intervening damped ly alpha (dla)systems. from a list of 5164 quasars in the interval of emission redshift 2.25&lt;/= z_e &lt;/= 3.5 and sdss spectra with signal-to-noise ratio snr &gt;/= 4, we builtup an "absorption sample" of 248 qsos with a single dla system in the intervalof absorption redshift 2.2 &lt; z_a &lt;/= 3.5 and a "pool" of 1959 control qsoswithout dla systems or strong metal systems. for each qso of the absorptionsample we extracted from the pool a subset of control qsos that are closest inredshift and magnitude. the mean color of this subset was used as a zero pointto measure the "deviation from the mean color" of individual dla-qsos, delta_i.the colors were measured using "best" ugriz sdss imaging data. the mean colorexcess of the absorption sample, &lt;e&gt;, was estimated by averaging the individualcolor deviations delta_i. we find &lt;e(r-z)&gt; = 27 +/- 9 x 10**(-3) mag and&lt;e(g-z)&gt; = 54 +/- 12 x 10**(-3) mag. these values are representative of thereddening of dla systems at z_a ~ 2.7 in sdss qsos with limiting magnitude r=/~ 20.2. the detection of the mean reddening is confirmed by severalstatistical tests. analysis of the results suggests an origin of the reddeningin dust embedded in the dla systems, with an smc-type extinction curve. byconverting the reddening into rest-frame extinction, we derive a meandust-to-gas ratio &lt;a_v/n(hi)&gt; ~ 2 to 4 x 10**(-23) mag cm^2. this value is ~-1.25 dex lower than the mean dust-to-gas ratio of the milky way, in line withthe lower level of metallicity in the present dla sample.

1303.7239	the fundamental plane of damped lyman alpha systems	using a sample of 100 h i - selected damped lyman alpha (dla) systems,observed with the high resolution echelle spectrometer on the keck i telescope,we present evidence that the scatter in the well-studied correlation betweenthe redshift and metallicity of a dla is largely due to the existence of amass-metallicity relationship at each redshift. to describe the fundamentalrelations that exist between redshift, metallicity and mass, we use afundamental plane description, which is described by the following equation:[m/h]=(-1.9+-0.5)+(0.74+-0.21)logdv_90-(0.32+-0.06)z. here, we assert that thevelocity width, dv_90, which is defined as the velocity interval containing 90%of the integrated optical depth, traces the mass of the underlying dark matterhalo. this description provides two significant improvements over theindividual descriptions of the mass-metallicity correlation andmetallicity-redshift correlation. firstly, the fundamental equation reduces thescatter around both relationships by about 20%, providing a more stringentconstraint on numerical simulations modeling dlas. secondly, it confirms thatthe dark matter halos that host dlas satisfy a mass-metallicity relationship ateach redshift between redshifts 2 through 5.

1310.6042	the rapid decline in metallicity of damped ly-alpha systems at z~5	we present evidence that the cosmological mean metallicity of neutral atomichydrogen gas shows a sudden decrease at z&gt;4.7 down to &lt;z&gt;=-2.03(+0.09-0.11),which is 6 sigma deviant from that predicted by a linear fit to the data atlower redshifts. this measurement is made possible by the chemical abundancemeasurements of 8 new damped ly-alpha (dla) systems at z&gt;4.7 observed with theechellette spectrograph and imager on the keck ii telescope, doubling thenumber of measurements at z&gt;4.7 to 16. possible explanations for this suddendecrease in metallicity include a change in the physical processes that enrichthe neutral gas within disks, or an increase of the covering factor of neutralgas outside disks due to a lower ultra-violet radiation field and higherdensity at high redshift. the later possibility would result in a newpopulation of presumably lower metallicity dlas, with an increased contributionto the dla population at higher redshifts resulting in a reduced meanmetallicity. furthermore, we provide evidence of a possible decrease at z&gt;4.7in the comoving metal mass density of dlas, which is flat out to z~4.3. such adecrease is expected, as otherwise most of the metals from star-forminggalaxies would reside in dlas by z~6. while the metallicity is decreasing athigh redshift, the contribution of dlas to the total metal budget of theuniverse increases with redshift, with dlas at z~4.3 accounting for ~20% asmany metals as produced by lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0009081	ionized gas in damped lyman alpha protogalaxies: i. model-independent  inferences from kinematic data	we investigate the kinematics of ionized and neutral gas in a sample of 35damped lyman alpha protogalaxies (dlas) with hires on the keck i 10 mtelescope. velocity profiles with resolution of ~ 8 km/s are obtained for highions such as c iv and si iv, and for intermediate ions such as al iii.combining these profiles with accurate low-ion (e.g., fe ii) profiles, weinvestigate the kinematic state of dlas in the redshift range 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.4 bycomparisons between data for various ion pairs.  we find the dlas comprise distinct kinematic subsystems: a low ion subsystemin which the low ions are physically associated with intermediate ions, and ahigh subsystem containing neither low nor intermediate ions. the evidence fortwo subsystems stems from (a) differences between the widths of the velocityprofiles, (b) misalignment in velocity space between the narrow componentscomprising the profiles in each subsystem, and (c) significant dissimilaritiesbetween the mean velocities of the high ion and low ion velocity profiles. inevery case we find that test statistics such as velocity width and variousasymmetry parameters distribute differently for low ions than for high ions.  despite misalignment in velocity space, the low and high ion kinematicsubsystems are interrelated. this is indicated by detection of a statisticallysignificant c iv versus low-ion cross correlation function, and by a systematiceffect where the c iv velocity widths are greater than or equal to the low ionvelocity widths in 29 out of 32 systems. these phenomena are consistent withthe location of the two subsystems in the same potential well.

astro-ph;0009082	ionized gas in damped lyman alpha protogalaxies: ii. comparison between  models and the kinematic data	we test semi-analytic models for galaxy formation with accurate kinematicdata of damped lyman alpha protogalaxies (dlas) presented in the companionpaper i. the models envisage centrifugally supported exponential disks at thecenters of dark matter halos which are filled with ionized gas undergoingradial infall to the disks. the halo masses are drawn from cross-sectionweighted mass distributions predicted by cdm cosmogonies, or by the nullhypothesis (tf model) that the dark matter mass distribution has not evolvedsince z ~ 3. in our models, c iv absorption lines detected in dlas arise ininfalling ionized clouds while the low-ion absorption lines arise from neutralgas in the disks. using monte carlo methods we find: (a) the cdm models areincompatible with the low-ion statistics at more than 99% confidence whereassome tf models cannot be excluded at more than 88% confidence. (b) both cdm andtf models agree with the observed distribution of c iv velocity widths. (c) thecdm models generate differences between the mean velocities of c iv and low ionprofiles in agreement with the data, while the tf model produces differences inthe means that are too large. (d) both cdm and tf models produce ratios of c ivto low-ion velocity widths that are too large. (e) both cdm and tf modelsgenerate c iv versus low-ion cross-correlation functions incompatible with thedata.  while it is possible to select model parameters resulting in consistency withthe data, the disk-halo configuration assumed in both cosmogonies still doesnot produce significant overlap in velocity space between c iv low-ion velocityprofiles. we conjecture that including angular momentum of the infalling cloudswill increase the overlap between c iv and low-ion profiles.

astro-ph;0203524	metallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha systems in lambda cdm  cosmology	utilizing a new, high mass resolution hydrodynamic simulation we compute themetallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) and find areasonable agreement with observations. in particular, the observed slowevolution of the dla metallicity occurs naturally in the simulation due to thecombined effects of physical and observational selection. the slow metallicityevolution is caused by the steady transformation, with increasing time, of thehighest metallicity systems to "galaxies", thus depleting this category, whileall the lower metallicity systems show, individually, an increase inmetallicity. although the trend of dla metallicity with redshift is in goodagreement with observations, it appears that the average metallicity ofsimulated dlas is higher than observed by 0.3-0.5 dex in the probed redshiftrange (z=0-5). our study indicates that this difference may be attributed toobservational selection effects due to dust obscuration. if we allow for a dustobscuration effect, our model reproduces the observed metallicity evolution inboth amplitude and slope. we find that dlas are not a simple population butprobe a range of different systems and the mix changes with redshift. about 50%of all metals in the gaseous phase is in dlas at all times from z=5 to z=1,making a rapid downturn at z\le 1 to ~20% by z=0, as metals are swept into thehotter components of the igm as well as locked up in stars. while not theprimary focus of this study, we find that the model provides good matches toobservations with respect to column density distribution and evolution ofneutral gas content, if the same dust obscuration is taken into account. wefind omega_{dla,comp}=(1-3)e-3, depending on the effect of dust obscuration.

astro-ph;0304040	cii* absorption in damped lyman alpha systems: (i) star formation rates  in a two-phase medium	we describe a technique that for the first time measures star formation rates(sfrs) in damped lyman alpha systems(dlas) directly. we assume that massivestars form in dlas, and that the fuv radiation they emit heats the gas by thegrain photoelectric mechanism. we infer the heating rate from the cooling ratemeasured by the strength of cii* 1335.7 absorption. since the heating rate isproportional to the dust-to-gas ratio and the sfr per unit area, we deduce thesfr per unit area for dlas in which both quantities have been measured. weconsider models in which the the dust comprises carbonaceous or silicategrains. we present two-phase models where the cold neutral medium (cnm) andwarm neutral medium (wnm) are in pressuer equilibrium. in the cnm model the thesightline goes throught the cnm and wnm, while in the wnm model it goes onlythrough the wnm. since the grain photoelectric heating efficiency is at least10 times higher in the cnm than in the wnm, cii* absorption mainly arises inthe cnm in the cnm model. but in the wnm model all of the cii* absorptionarises in the wnm. we use cii* absorption lines to derive the sfr per unit areafor a sample of ~ 30 dlas in which the dust-to-gas ratio has been inferred fromelement depletion patterns. we show that the resulting sfr per unit areacorresponds to an average over the star forming volume of galaxy hosting thedla rather than to local star formation along the line of sight. we find theaverage sfr per unit area and equals10$^{-2.2}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$for the cnm model and 10$^{-1.3}$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$ for the wnmmodel. the sfr per unit area in the cnm solution is similar to that measured inthe milky way ism.

astro-ph;0304042	cii* absorption in damped lyman alpha systems: (ii) a new window on the  star formation history of the universe	starting from the sfr per unit physical area, determined for dlas using the cii* method, we obtain the sfr per unit comoving volume at $z$ $\approx$ 3, andfind that it agrees with that for the lyman break galaxies (lbgs). though themass of produced stars indicated by the sfrs is consistent with the currentdensities of known stellar populations, the mass of metals produced by $z$=2.5is 30 times larger than detected in absorption in dlas. the most likelysolutions to this ``missing metals'' problem is that star formation occurs incompact bulge regions. we search for evidence of feedback and find nocorrelations between the sfr per unit area and n(h i), but possiblecorrelations between sfr per unit area and low-ion velocity width and sfr perunit area and metal abundance. we show that (a) the correlation between coolingrate and dust-to-gas ratio is positive evidence for grain photoelectricheating, (b) the cmb does not significantly populate the c ii excitedfine-structure states, and (c) the ratio of cii* to resonance-line opticaldepths is a sensitive probe of the multi-phase structure of the dla gas. weaddress recent arguments that dlas are comprised only of wnm gas, and show themto be inconclusive. despite the rough agreement between sfr per unit comovingvolume for dlas and lbgs, current evidence indicates these are distinctpopulations.

astro-ph;0305004	the elemental abundance pattern in a galaxy at z=2.626	the discovery of metal-poor stars (where metal is any element more massivethan helium) has enabled astronomers to probe the chemical enrichment historyof the milky way. more recently, element abundances in gas inside high-redshiftgalaxies has been probed through the absorption lines imprinted on the spectraof background quasars, but these have typically yielded measurements of only afew elements. furthermore, interpretation of these abundances is complicated bythe fact that differential incorporation of metals into dust can produce anabundance pattern similar to that expected from nucleosynthesis by massivestars. here we report the observation of over 25 elements in a galaxy atz=2.626. with these data, we can examine nucleosynthetic processes independentof the uncertainty arising from depletion. we find that the galaxy was enrichedmainly by massive stars (m &gt; 15 solar masses) and propose that it is theprogenitor of a massive, elliptical galaxy. the detailed abundance patternssuggest that boron is produced through processes that act independently ofmetallicity, and may require alternative mechanisms for the nucleosynthesis ofgermanium.

astro-ph;0407517	on the nature of the heat source for damped lya systems	we investigate the heat source of the neutral gas comprising dlas. unlike thelya forest, where the extragalactic background radiation field ionizes andheats the gas, we find that grain photoelectric heating by the fuv backgroundis not sufficient to balance the c ii 158um cooling rate inferred from dlas. inthese systems, a local energy source is required. we show that in the case ofthe z=1.919 dla toward q2206-19, the local source is fuv emission from theassociated galaxy found by moller et al (2002): the mean intensity inferredfrom photometry is in good agreement with the intensity jnu required to explainthe cooling rate. the fuv mean intensity predicted for a cold neutral medium(cnm) model, jnu=(1.7+2.7-1.0)x10^(-18) cgs (95% c.l.), is the largest expectedfrom our cii* study of 45 dlas. this may explain why this is the only confirmeddla yet detected in emission at z&gt;1.9. we argue that in most dlas with detectedcii* absorption, jnu is between 10^{-19} and 10^{-18} and heats the gas whichis a cnm. by contrast, in most dlas with upper limits on cii* absorption thegas is a warm neutral medium (wnm). surprisingly, the upper limits arecompatible with the same range of jnu values suggesting the majority of dlasare heated by radiation fields generated by a limited range of star formationrates per unit h i area, between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2} msol/kpc^2. we also showthat cii* absorption is unlikely to arise in gas that is ionized.

astro-ph;0604334	the ucsd radio-selected quasar survey for damped lyman alpha system	as large optical quasar surveys for damped lya become a reality and the studyof star forming gas in the early universe achieves statistical robustness, itis now vital to identify and quantify the sources of systematic error. becausethe nature of optically-selected quasar surveys makes them vulnerable to dustobscuration, we have undertaken a radio-selected quasar survey for damped lyasystems to address this bias. we present the definition and results of thissurvey. we then combine our sample with the corals dataset to investigate thehi column density distribution function f(n) of damped lya systems towardradio-selected quasars. we find that f(n) is well fit by a power-law f(n) = k_1n^alpha_1, with log k_1 = 22.90 and alpha_1 = -2.18. this power-law is inexcellent agreement with that of optically-selected samples at low n(hi), animportant yet expected result given that obscuration should have negligibleeffect at these gas columns. however, because of the relatively small size ofthe radio-selected sample, 26 damped lya systems in 119 quasars, f(n) is notwell constrained at large n(hi) and the first moment of the hi distributionfunction, omega_g, is, strictly speaking, a lower limit. the power-law is steepenough, however, that extrapolating it to higher column densities implies onlya modest, logarithmic increase in omega_g. the radio-selected value of omega_g= 1.15 x 10^-3, agrees well with the results of optically-selected surveys.while our results indicate that dust obscuration is likely not a major issuefor surveys of damped lya systems, we estimate that a radio-selected sample ofapproximately 100 damped lya systems will be required to obtain the precisionnecessary to absolutely confirm an absence of dust bias.

astro-ph;0608040	searching for low surface-brightness galaxies in the hubble ultra deep  field: implications for the star formation efficiency in neutral gas at z ~ 3	(abridged) the kennicutt--schmidt law relates the face-on star formation rate(sfr) per unit area with the face-on gaseous column density in nearby galaxies.applying this relation to damped lya absorption systems (dlas) of neutralhydrogen column density n &gt; 1.6x10^21 cm^-2 leads to an estimate that threepercent of the sky should be covered with extended sources brighter thanmu_v~28.4 mag arcsec^-2, if dlas at redshift z=[2.5,3.5] undergo in situ starformation. we test this hypothesis by searching the hubble ultra deep field(udf) f606w image for low surface-brightness features of angular sizes, rangingbetween theta_dla=0.25" and 4.0". our search yields upper limits on thecomoving sfr densities that are between factors of 30 and 100 lower thanpredictions, suggesting a reduction by more than a factor of 10 in starformation efficiency at z~3. we consider several mechanisms that could reducestar formation efficiency at high redshift. we find that the cosmologicalincrease with redshift of the critical surface density for the toomreinstability may be sufficient to suppress star formation to the levels impliedby the udf observations. however, the uncertainties are such that toomreinstabilities may still exist. in that case star formation at column densitiesless than 10^22 cm^-2 may be suppressed by the low molecular content of the dlagas. the upper limits on in situ star formation reduce the predictedmetallicities at z~3 to be significantly lower than observed, and reduce theheat input in the gas to be substantially lower than the inferred coolingrates. in contrast, the radiative output from compact lyman break galaxies(lbgs) with r&lt;27 is sufficient to balance the comoving cooling rate.

astro-ph;9704169	on the kinematics of the damped lyman alpha protogalaxies	we present the first results of an ongoing program to investigate thekinematic characteristics of high redshift damped lya systems. because dampedlya systems are widely believed to be the progenitors of current massivegalaxies, an analysis of their kinematic history allows a direct test of galaxyformation scenarios.  we have collected a kinematically unbiased sample of 17 high s/n ratio, highresolution damped lya spectra taken with hires on the 10m w.m. keck telescope.our study focuses on the unsaturated, low-ion transitions of these systemswhich reveal their kinematic traits. the profiles exhibit a nearly uniformdistribution of velocity widths ranging from 20 - 200 km/s and a relativelyhigh degree of asymmetry. in an attempt to explain these characteristics, weintroduce several physical models, which have previously been attributed todamped lya systems, including rapidly rotating cold disks, slowly rotating hotdisks, massive isothermal halos, and a hydrodynamic spherical accretion model.  using standard monte carlo techniques, we run sightlines through these modelsystems to derive simulated low-ion profiles. comparing statistical measures ofthe simulated profiles with the observed profiles, we determine that therapidly rotating cold disk model is the only tested model consistent with thedata at high confidence levels. a relative likelihood test of the rapidlyrotating cold disk model indicates the disks must have large rotation speeds; v&gt; 180 km/s at the 99% c.l. in turn, we demonstrate that the cold dark mattermodel, as developed by kauffmann (1996), is inconsistent with the damped lyadata at very high c.l. this is because the cdm model does not predict a largeenough fraction of rapidly rotating disks at z approx 2.5.

astro-ph;9707157	damped lyman-alpha absorption associated with an early-type galaxy at  redshift z = 0.16377	we report new hst and ground-based observations of a damped lyman-alphaabsorption system toward the qso 0850+4400. the redshift of the absorptionsystem is z = 0.163770 and the neutral hydrogen column density of theabsorption system is log n = 19.81 cm**-2. the absorption system is by far thelowest redshift confirmed damped lyman-alpha absorption system yet identified,which provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the nature, impactgeometry, and kinematics of the absorbing galaxy in great detail. theobservations indicate that the absorption system is remarkable in threerespects: first, the absorption system is characterized by weak metalabsorption lines and a low metal abundance, possibly less than 4% of the solarmetal abundance. this cannot be explained as a consequence of dust, because theneutral hydrogen column density of the absorption system is far too low forobscuration by dust to introduce any significant selection effects. second, theabsorption system is associated with a moderate-luminosity early-type s0galaxy, although the absorption may actually arise in one of several very faintgalaxies detected very close to the qso line of sight. third, the absorbingmaterial moves counter to the rotating galaxy disk, which rules out thepossibility that the absorption arises in a thin or thick co-rotating gaseousdisk. these results run contrary to the expectation that low-redshift dampedlyman-alpha absorption systems generally arise in the gas- and metal-rich innerparts of late-type spiral galaxies. we suggest instead that mounting evidenceindicates that low-redshift galaxies of a variety of morphological types maycontain significant quantities of low metal abundance gas at largegalactocentric distances.

astro-ph;9712050	on the evolution of damped lyman alpha systems to galactic disks	the mean metallicity of the thick disk of the galaxy is 0.5 dex higher thanthat of the damped lyman alpha systems. this has been interpreted to argue thatstars in the former do not arise out of gas in the latter. using newmetallicity and h i column-density data we show the metal-rich damped systemsdo contain sufficient baryons at the thick-disk metallicity to account for thestellar masses of thick disks. comparing our kinematic data with themetallicities we show that damped lyman alpha systems exhibiting the largestprofile velocity widths span a narrow range of high metallicities, whilesystems with small velocity widths span a wider range of metallicities. this isnaturally explained by passage of the damped lyman alpha sightlines throughrapidly rotating disks with negative radial gradients in metallicity. thesystematically lower n(h i) of systems with high velocity widths indicates (a)the gaseous disks have centrally located holes, and (b) an apparentinconsistency with the protogalactic clump model for damped lyman alphasystems. the higher metallicity of systems with low n(h i) further implies thatstars rather than gas dominate the baryonic content of the most metal-richdamped systems.

astro-ph;9805293	protogalactic disk models of damped lya kinematics	we present new observational results on the kinematics of the damped lyasystems. our full sample is now comprised of 31 low-ion profiles and exhibitssimilar characteristics to the sample from paper i. the primary exception isthat the new distribution of velocity widths includes values out to a maximumof nearly 300 km/s, approx 100 km/s greater than the previous maximum. thesehigh velocity width systems will significantly leverage models introduced toexplain the damped lya systems. comparing the characteristics from low-redshiftand high-redshift sub-samples, we find no evidence for significant evolution inthe kinematic properties of protogalaxies from z = 2.0 - 3.3.  the new observations give greater statistical significance to the mainconclusions of our first paper. in particular, those models inconsistent withthe damped lya observations in paper i are ruled out at even higher levels ofconfidence. at the same time, the observations are consistent with a populationof rapidly rotating, thick disks (the trd model) at high redshift.  buoyed by the success of the trd model, we investigate it more closely byconsidering more realistic disk properties. our goal is to demonstrate thestatistical power of the damped lya observations by investigating therobustness of the trd model. in particular, we study the effects of warping,realistic rotation curves, and photoionization on the kinematics of disks inthe trd model. the principal results are: (1) disk warping has only minimaleffect on the kinematic results, primarily influencing the effective diskthickness, (2) the trd model is robust to more realistic rotation curves; (3)the effects of photoionization require thicker disks to give consistentvelocity width distributions.

(1996), our observations lendsupport both for dust depletion and type ii sn enrichment. specifically, theobserved overabundance of zn/fe and underabundance of ni/fe relative to solarabundances suggest significant dust depletion within the damped lya systems.meanwhile, the relative abundances of al, si, and cr vs. fe are consistent withboth dust depletion and type ii supernova enrichment. our measurements of ti/feand the mn/fe measurements from lu et al. (1996), however, cannot be explainedby dust depletion and indicate an underlying type ii sn pattern. finally, theobserved values of [s/fe] are inconsistent with the combined effects of dustdepletion and the nucleosynthetic yields expected for type ii supernovae. thislast result emphasizes the need for another physical process to explain thedamped lya abundance patterns.  we also examine the metallicity of the damped lya systems both with respectto zn/h and fe/h. our results confirm previous surveys by pettini andcollaborators, i.e., [&lt;zn/h&gt;] = -1.15 +/- 0.15 dex.
