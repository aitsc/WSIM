0902.1527	astro2010 decadal survey whitepaper: coordinated science in the  gravitational and electromagnetic skies	it is widely expected that the coming decade will witness the first directdetection of gravitational waves (gws). the ground-based ligo and virgo gwobservatories are being upgraded to advanced sensitivity, and are expected toobserve a significant binary merger rate. the launch of the laserinterferometer space antenna (lisa) would extend the gw window to lowfrequencies, opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (m &gt;~10^5 m_sun) black holes. gw events are likely to be accompanied byelectromagnetic (em) counterparts and, since information carriedelectromagnetically is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a greatdeal can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes possibleto measure both forms of radiation in concert. measurements of this kind willmark the dawn of trans-spectral astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectralbands of information. the aim of this whitepaper is to articulate futuredirections in both theory and observation that are likely to impact broadastrophysical inquiries of general interest. what will em observations reflecton the nature and diversity of gw sources? can gw sources be exploited ascomplementary probes of cosmology? what cross-facility coordination will expandthe science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic observations?

0904.1383	the population of viscosity- and gravitational wave-driven supermassive  black hole binaries among luminous agn	supermassive black hole binaries (smbhbs) in galactic nuclei are thought tobe a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. we use simple disk models forthe circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbitaldecay of smbhbs with a range of total masses (m) and mass ratios (q), throughphysically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (gws) takeover their evolution. prior to the gw-driven phase, the viscous decay is in thestalled "secondary-dominated" regime. smbhbs spend a non-negligible fraction of10^7 years at orbital periods t_var between a day and a year. a dedicatedoptical or x-ray survey could identify coalescing smbhbs statistically, as apopulation of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance n_var isproportional to t_var^alpha, in a range of periods t_var around tens of weeks.smbhbs with m &lt; 10^7 m_sun, with 0.5 &lt; alpha &lt; 1.5, would probe the physics ofviscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-massbinaries, with alpha=8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by gws. thelowest mass smbhbs (m &lt; 10^{5-6} m_sun) enter the gw-driven regime at shortorbital periods, in the frequency band of the laser interferometric spaceantenna (lisa). while viscous processes are strongly sub-dominant in the lastfew years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolvedbackground of near-stationary lisa sources. we discuss constraints on the smbhbpopulation available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coveragerequirements for a detection in future surveys. smbhbs may also be identifiedfrom velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance ofsmbhbs as a function of their orbital velocity.

0907.1897	planetesimal and protoplanet dynamics in a turbulent protoplanetary  disk: ideal unstratified disks	the dynamics of planetesimals and planetary cores may be strongly influencedby density perturbations driven by magneto-rotational turbulence in their natalprotoplanetary gas disks. using the local shearing box approximation, weperform numerical simulations of planetesimals moving as massless particles ina turbulent, magnetized, unstratified gas disk. our fiducial disk model showsturbulent accretion characterized by a shakura-sunyaev viscosity parameter of$\alpha \sim 10^{-2}$, with root-mean-square density perturbations of$\sim$10%. we measure the statistical evolution of particle orbital propertiesin our simulations including mean radius, eccentricity, and velocitydispersion. we confirm random walk growth in time of all three properties, thefirst time that this has been done with direct orbital integration in a localmodel. we find that the growth rate increases with the box size used at leastup to boxes of eight scale heights in horizontal size. however, even ourlargest boxes show velocity dispersions sufficiently low that collisionaldestruction of planetesimals should be unimportant in the inner disk throughoutits lifetime. our direct integrations agree with earlier torque measurementsshowing that type i migration dominates over diffusive migration by stochastictorques for most objects in the planetary core and terrestrial planet massrange. diffusive migration remains important for objects in the mass range ofkilometer-sized planetesimals. discrepancies in the derived magnitude ofturbulence between local and global simulations of magneto-rotationallyunstable disks remains an open issue, with important consequences for planetformation scenarios.

0907.2692	three dimensional modeling of hot jupiter atmospheric flows	we present a three dimensional hot jupiter model, extending from 200 bar to 1mbar, using the intermediate general circulation model from the university ofreading. our horizontal spectral resolution is t31 (equivalent to a grid of48x96), with 33 logarithmically spaced vertical levels. a simplified(newtonian) scheme is employed for the radiative forcing. we adopt a physicalset up nearly identical to the model of hd 209458b by cooper &amp; showman(2005,2006) to facilitate a direct model inter-comparison. our results arebroadly consistent with theirs but significant differences also emerge. theatmospheric flow is characterized by a super-rotating equatorial jet, transonicwind speeds, and eastward advection of heat away from the dayside. we identifya dynamically-induced temperature inversion ("stratosphere") on the planetarydayside and find that temperatures at the planetary limb differ systematicallyfrom local radiative equilibrium values, a potential source of bias for transitspectroscopic interpretations. while our model atmosphere is quasi-identical tothat of cooper &amp; showman (2005,2006) and we solve the same meteorologicalequations, we use different algorithmic methods, spectral-implicit vs.grid-explicit, which are known to yield fully consistent results in the earthmodeling context. the model discrepancies identified here indicate that one orboth numerical methods do not faithfully capture all of the atmosphericdynamics at work in the hot jupiter context. we highlight the emergence of ashock-like feature in our model, much like that reported recently by showman etal.

0910.1346	radiation-hydrodynamics of hot jupiter atmospheres	radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres is usually treated in the staticlimit, i.e., neglecting atmospheric motions. we argue that hot jupiteratmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a morestrongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics.to lowest order in v/c, relativistic doppler shifts distort line profiles alongoptical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. this leads to flow-dependentdeviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of theatmospheric medium. evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on theradiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. we presenttransmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations whichsuggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot jupiteratmospheres. if winds are fast and bulk doppler shifts are indeed important forthe global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable datainterpretation for hot jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it wouldinvolve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupledradiation-hydrodynamical flow. on the bright side, it would also imply that theemergent properties of hot jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of theiratmospheric flows than is the case for solar system planets.radiation-hydrodynamics may also influence radiative transfer in other classesof hot exoplanetary atmospheres with fast winds.

0911.3170	atmospheric circulation of exoplanets	we survey the basic principles of atmospheric dynamics relevant to explainingexisting and future observations of exoplanets, both gas giant and terrestrial.given the paucity of data on exoplanet atmospheres, our approach is toemphasize fundamental principles and insights gained from solar-system studiesthat are likely to be generalizable to exoplanets. we begin by presenting thehierarchy of basic equations used in atmospheric dynamics, including thenavier-stokes, primitive, shallow-water, and two-dimensional nondivergentmodels. we then survey key concepts in atmospheric dynamics, including theimportance of planetary rotation, the concept of balance, and scaling argumentsto show how turbulent interactions generally produce large-scale east-westbanding on rotating planets. we next turn to issues specific to giant planets,including their expected interior and atmospheric thermal structures, theimplications for their wind patterns, and mechanisms to pump their east-westjets. hot jupiter atmospheric dynamics are given particular attention, as theseclose-in planets have been the subject of most of the concrete developments inthe study of exoplanetary atmospheres. we then turn to the basic elements ofcirculation on terrestrial planets as inferred from solar-system studies,including hadley cells, jet streams, processes that govern the large-scalehorizontal temperature contrasts, and climate, and we discuss how theseinsights may apply to terrestrial exoplanets. although exoplanets surelypossess a greater diversity of circulation regimes than seen on the planets inour solar system, our guiding philosophy is that the multi-decade study ofsolar-system planets reviewed here provides a foundation upon which ourunderstanding of more exotic exoplanetary meteorology must build.

0912.2054	time-dependent models for the afterglows of massive black hole mergers	the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa) will detect gravitational wavesignals from coalescing pairs of massive black holes in the total mass range(10^5 - 10^7)/msol out to cosmological distances. identifying and monitoringthe electromagnetic counterparts of these events would enable cosmologicalstudies and offer new probes of gas physics around well-characterized massiveblack holes. milosavljevic &amp; phinney (2005) proposed that a circumbinary diskaround a binary of mass ~10^6 msol will emit an accretion-powered x-rayafterglow approximately one decade after the gravitational wave event. werevisit this scenario by using green's function solutions to calculate thetemporal viscous evolution and the corresponding electromagnetic signature ofthe circumbinary disk. our calculations suggest that an electromagneticcounterpart may become observable as a rapidly brightening source soon afterthe merger, i.e. several years earlier than previously thought. the afterglowcan reach super-eddington luminosities without violating the local eddingtonflux limit. it is emitted in the soft x-ray by the innermost circumbinary disk,but it may be partially reprocessed at optical and infrared frequencies. wealso find that the spreading disk becomes increasingly geometrically thickclose to the central object as it evolves, indicating that the innermost flowcould become advective and radiatively inefficient, and generate a powerfuloutflow. we conclude that the mergers of massive black holes detected by lisaoffer unique opportunities for monitoring on humanly tractable timescales theviscous evolution of accretion flows and the emergence of outflows aroundmassive black holes with precisely known masses, spins and orientations.

1002.4875	habitable climates: the influence of eccentricity	in the outer regions of the habitable zone, the risk of transitioning into aglobally frozen "snowball" state poses a threat to the habitability of planetswith the capacity to host water-based life. we use a one-dimensional energybalance climate model (ebm) to examine how obliquity, spin rate, orbitaleccentricity, and ocean coverage might influence the onset of such a snowballstate. for an exoplanet, these parameters may be strikingly different from thevalues observed for earth. since, for constant semimajor axis, the annual meanstellar irradiation scales with (1-e^2)^(-1/2), one might expect the greatesthabitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as(1-e^2)^(-1/4). we find that this standard ansatz provides a reasonable lowerbound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone, but the influence ofobliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets oneccentric orbits. for planets with eccentricity 0.5, our ebm suggests that thegreatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0.8 au (78%!) dependingon obliquity, with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable againstsnowball transitions. one might also expect that the long winter at aneccentric planet's apoastron would render it more susceptible to globalfreezing. our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for earth-likeplanets around sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermalinertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. sinceplanets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from thestar, such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for directobservations with missions such as tpf-darwin. nevertheless, the extremetemperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-earths raise questionsabout the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitableconditions.

1004.5411	witnessing the birth of a quasar	the coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (smbhb) is thought to beaccompanied by an electromagnetic (em) afterglow, produced by the viscousinfall of the surrounding circumbinary gas disk after the merger. it has beenproposed that once the merger has been detected in gravitational waves (gws) bylisa, follow-up em searches for this afterglow can help identify the emcounterpart of the lisa source. here we study whether the afterglows may besufficiently bright and numerous to be detectable in em surveys alone. theviscous afterglow, which lasts for years to decades for smbhbs in lisa'ssensitivity window, is characterized by rapid increases in both the bolometricluminosity and in the spectral hardness of the source. if quasar activity istriggered by the same major galaxy mergers that produce smbhbs, then theafterglow could be interpreted as a signature of the birth of a quasar. usingan idealized model for the post-merger viscous spreading of the circumbinarydisk and the resulting light curve, and using the observed luminosity functionof quasars as a proxy for the smbhb merger rate, we delineate the surveyrequirements for identifying such birthing quasars. if circumbinary disks havea high disk surface density and viscosity, an all-sky soft x-ray survey with asensitivity of ~&lt;3x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and a time resolution of ~months couldidentify dozens of birthing quasars with sustained brightening rates of&gt;10%/yr. if &gt;1% of the x-ray emission is reprocessed into optical frequencies,birthing quasars could also be identified in optical transient surveys such asthe lsst. distinguishing a birthing quasar from other variable sources may befacilitated by the monotonic hardening of its spectrum, but will likely remainchallenging. this reinforces the notion that joint em-plus-gw observationsoffer the best prospects for identifying the em signatures of smbhb mergers.

1105.2321	the role of drag in the energetics of strongly forced exoplanet  atmospheres	in contrast to the earth, where frictional heating is typically negligible,we show that drag mechanisms could act as an important heat source in thestrongly-forced atmospheres of some exoplanets, with the potential to alter thecirculation. we modify the standard formalism of the atmospheric energy cycleto explicitly track the loss of kinetic energy and the associated frictional(re)heating, for application to exoplanets such as the asymmetrically heated"hot jupiters" and gas giants on highly eccentric orbits. we establish that anunderstanding of the dominant drag mechanisms and their dependence on localatmospheric conditions is critical for accurate modeling, not just in theirability to limit wind speeds, but also because they could possibly change theenergetics of the circulation enough to alter the nature of the flow. wediscuss possible sources of drag and estimate the strength necessary tosignificantly influence the atmospheric energetics. as we show, the frictionalheating depends on the magnitude of kinetic energy dissipation as well as itsspatial variation, so that the more localized a drag mechanism is, the weakerit can be and still affect the circulation. we also use the derived formalismto estimate the rate of numerical loss of kinetic energy in a few previouslypublished hot jupiter models with and without magnetic drag and find it to besurprisingly large, at 5-10% of the incident stellar irradiation.

1107.2937	electromagnetic counterparts of supermassive black hole binaries  resolved by pulsar timing arrays	pulsar timing arrays (ptas) are expected to detect gravitational waves (gws)from individual low-redshift (z&lt;1.5) compact supermassive (m&gt;10^9 msun) blackhole (smbh) binaries with orbital periods of approx. 0.1 - 10 yrs. identifyingthe electromagnetic (em) counterparts of these sources would provideconfirmation of putative direct detections of gws, present a rare opportunityto study the environments of compact smbh binaries, and could enable the use ofthese sources as standard sirens for cosmology. here we consider thefeasibility of such an em identification. we show that because the hostgalaxies of resolved pta sources are expected to be exceptionally massive andrare, it should be possible to find unique hosts of resolved sources out toredshift z=0.2. at higher redshifts, the pta error boxes are larger, and maycontain as many as 100 massive-galaxy interlopers. the number of candidates,however, remains tractable for follow-up searches in upcoming wide-field emsurveys. we develop a toy model to characterize the dynamics and the thermalemission from a geometrically thin, gaseous disc accreting onto a pta-sourcesmbh binary. our model predicts that at optical and infrared frequencies, thesource should appear similar to a typical luminous active galactic nucleus(agn). however, owing to the evacuation of the accretion flow by the binary'stidal torques, the source might have an unusually low soft x-ray luminosity andweak uv and broad optical emission lines, as compared to an agn powered by asingle smbh with the same total mass. for sources near z=1, the decrement inthe rest-frame uv should be observable as an extremely red optical color. theseproperties would make the pta sources stand out among optically luminous agn,and could allow their unique identification.

1108.3592	magnetic scaling laws for the atmospheres of hot giant exoplanets	we present scaling laws for advection, radiation, magnetic drag and ohmicdissipation in the atmospheres of hot giant exoplanets. in the limit of weakthermal ionization, ohmic dissipation increases with the planetary equilibriumtemperature (t_eq &gt;~ 1000 k) faster than the insolation power does, eventuallyreaching values &gt;~ 1% of the insolation power, which may be sufficient toinflate the radii of hot jupiters. at higher t_eq values still, magnetic dragrapidly brakes the atmospheric winds, which reduces the associated ohmicdissipation power. for example, for a planetary field strength b=10g, thefiducial scaling laws indicate that ohmic dissipation exceeds 1% of theinsolation power over the equilibrium temperature range t_eq ~ 1300-2000 k,with a peak contribution at t_eq ~ 1600 k. evidence for magnetically draggedwinds at the planetary thermal photosphere could emerge in the form of reducedlongitudinal offsets for the dayside infrared hotspot. this suggests thepossibility of an anticorrelation between the amount of hotspot offset and thedegree of radius inflation, linking the atmospheric and interior properties ofhot giant exoplanets in an observationally testable way. while providing auseful framework to explore the magnetic scenario, the scaling laws also revealstrong parameter dependencies, in particular with respect to the unknownplanetary magnetic field strength.

1304.6472	water-trapped worlds	although tidally-locked habitable planets orbiting nearby m-dwarf stars areamong the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they mayalso be deficient in volatiles and water. climate models for this class ofplanets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside,where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. since ice only slowlyflows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cyclecan trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. using ice sheetdynamical and thermodynamical constraints, i illustrate how planets with lessthan about a quarter the earth's oceans could trap most of their surface wateron the nightside. this would leave their dayside, where habitable conditionsare met, potentially dry. the amount and distribution of residual liquid wateron the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including theefficiency of rock weathering at regulating atmospheric co2 as dayside oceanbasins dry-up. water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similaradvantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where moreabundant water freely flows around the globe.

1502.05099	dynamical stability of imaged planetary systems in formation:  application to hl tau	a recent alma image revealed several concentric gaps in the protoplanetarydisk surrounding the young star hl tau. we consider the hypothesis that thesegaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understandingthe dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providingestimates for the maximum planetary masses. we collect these easily evaluatedconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretationof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in suchsystems. we argue that the locations of resonances should be significantlyshifted in massive disks like hl tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in theexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty inthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. this presents an importantbarrier to using systems like hl tau as a proxy for the initial conditionsfollowing planet formation. an important observational avenue to breaking thisdegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantlyinteracting planets. unfortunately, massive disks like hl tau should induceswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features ofplanetary origin. this motivates pushing toward more typical, less massivedisks. for a nominal non-resonant model of the hl tau system with five planets,we find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 neptunemasses. in a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the massof saturn. the inner two planets' masses are unconstrained by dynamicalstability arguments.

0807.3547	microphysical dissipation, turbulence and magnetic fields in  hyper-accreting discs	hyper-accreting discs occur in compact-object mergers and collapsars, and maypower gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we calculate the microscopic viscosity andresistivity of plasma in these discs, and discuss the implications for theirglobal structure and evolution. in the neutrino-cooled innermost regions, theviscosity is provided mainly by mildly degenerate electrons, while theresistivity is modified from the spitzer value due to the effects of bothrelativity and degeneracy. the plasma behaves as an almost ideal mhd fluid.among the non-ideal mhd effects the hall term is relatively the most important,while the magnetic prandtl number, pr (the ratio of viscosity to resistivity),is typically larger than unity: 10 &lt; pr &lt; 6000. the outer radiativelyinefficient regions also display high pr. numerical simulations of themagneto-rotational instability indicate that the saturation level and angularmomentum transport efficiency may be greatly enhanced at high pr. if thisbehaviour persists in the presence of a strong hall effect we would expect thathyper-accreting discs should be strongly magnetised and highly variable. theexpulsion of magnetic field that cannot be dissipated at small scales may alsofavour a magnetic outflow. we note the similaries between the prandtl number inhyper-accreting discs and x-ray binary discs, which suggests that a comparisonbetween late-time activity in grbs and x-ray binary accretion states may befruitful. our results imply that the behavior of high prandtl number mhd flowsneeds to be considered in studies of hyper-accreting discs.

0807.4180	habitable climates: the influence of obliquity	extrasolar terrestrial planets with the potential to host life might havelarge obliquities or be subject to strong obliquity variations. we revisit thehabitability of oblique planets with an energy balance climate model (ebm)allowing for dynamical transitions to ice-covered snowball states as a resultof ice-albedo feedback. despite the great simplicity of our ebm, it capturesreasonably well the seasonal cycle of global energetic fluxes at earth'ssurface. it also performs satisfactorily against a full-physics climate modelof a highly oblique earth-like planet, in an unusual regime of circulationdominated by heat transport from the poles to the equator. climates on obliqueterrestrial planets can violate global radiative balance through much of theirseasonal cycle, which limits the usefulness of simple radiative equilibriumarguments. high obliquity planets have severe climates, with large amplitudeseasonal variations, but they are not necessarily more prone to global snowballtransitions than low obliquity planets. we find that terrestrial planets withmassive co2 atmospheres, typically expected in the outer regions of habitablezones, can also be subject to such dynamical snowball transitions. some of thesnowball climates investigated for co2-rich atmospheres experience partialatmospheric collapse. since long-term co2 atmospheric build-up acts as aclimatic thermostat for habitable planets, partial co2 collapse could limit thehabitability of such planets. a terrestrial planet's habitability may thusdepend sensitively on its short-term climatic stability.

0807.4697	gravitational radiation driven supermassive black hole binary inspirals  as periodically variable electromagnetic sources	supermassive black hole binaries (smbhbs) produced in galaxy mergers arethought to complete their coalescence, below separations of r_gw=10^{-3}(m_bh/10^8 m_sun)^{3/4} pc, as their orbit decays due to the emission ofgravitational waves (gws). it may be possible to identify such gw-driveninspirals statistically in an electromagnetic (em) survey for variable sources.a gw-driven binary spends a characteristic time t_gw at each orbital separationr_orb &lt; r_gw that scales with the corresponding orbital time t_orb as t_gw =(const) t_orb^{8/3}. if the coalescing binary produces variations in the ememission on this timescale, then it could be identified as a variable sourcewith a characteristic period t_var = t_orb. the incidence rate of sources withsimilar inferred bh masses, showing near-periodic variability on the time-scalet_var, would then be proportional to t_var^{8/3}. luminosity variationscorresponding to a fraction f_edd&lt;0.01 of the eddington luminosity would havebeen missed in current surveys. however, if the binary inspirals are associatedwith quasars, we show that a dedicated survey could detect the population ofsmbhbs with a range of periods around tens of weeks. the discovery of apopulation of periodic sources whose abundance obeys n_var = (const)t_var^{8/3} would confirm (i) that the orbital decay is indeed driven by gws,and (ii) that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is beingperturbed by the bhs. deviations from the t_var^{8/3} power-law could constrainthe structure of the circumbinary gas disk and viscosity-driven orbital decay.we discuss constraints from existing data, and quantify the sensitivity and skycoverage that could yield a detection in future surveys.

astro-ph;0001203	disc instability models for x-ray transients: evidence for evaporation  and low alpha-viscosity ?	we construct time-dependent models of accretion discs around black holes andneutron stars. we investigate the effect of evaporating the disc inner regionsduring quiescence on the predictions of the disc instability model (dim) forthese systems. we do not include irradiation of the disc in the models.  removing the inner, most unstable parts of the accretion disc increases thepredicted recurrence times. however, dims with values of the viscosityparameter alpha_hot ~ 0.1 and alpha_cold ~ 0.02 (typical of applications of thedim to standard dwarf nova outbursts) fail to reproduce the long recurrencetimes of sxts (unless we resort to fine-tuning of the parameters) independentof the evaporation strength. we show that models with evaporation and a smallervalue of alpha_cold (~ 0.005) do reproduce the long recurrence times and theaccretion rates at the level of the eddington rate observed in outburst. thelarge difference between the values of alpha_hot and alpha_cold, if confirmedwhen disc irradiation is included, suggests that several viscosity mechanismsoperate in these accretion discs.  for some choices of parameters our models predict reflares during the declinefrom outburst. they are a physical property of the model and result from aheating front forming in the wake of an initial cooling front and subsequent,multiple front reflections. the reflares disappear in low-alpha models wherefront reflection can not occur.

astro-ph;0007185	advection-dominated accretion onto weakly-magnetized white dwarfs	the boundary layers of weakly-magnetized white dwarfs (wds) accreting atrates &lt;=10^16 g/s are radially extended, hot, optically-thin, and they advectsome of their internally-dissipated energy (narayan &amp; popham 1993). motivatedby this, i construct here idealized spectral models of an advection-dominatedaccretion flow (adaf) around a wd, for application to quiescent dwarf novae(dn). the bremsstrahlung cooling of the gas in the adaf, with temperaturesranging from a few kev to a few tens of kev, can account for the x-ray emissionproperties of quiescent dn. if the energy advected by the flow is thermalizedin the wd atmosphere, the resulting emission from the entire stellar surface(blackbody of temperature t_eff ~ 5 ev) outshines the x-ray luminositysubstantially. this extreme-uv component provides a flux in the 0.055-0.28 kevband which is sufficient to power the strong heii lambda4686 emission lines ofquiescent dn by photoionization of the disk material. reprocessing of the adafx-ray emission by a cold outer thin disk could also lead to an observable ironkalpha fluorescence emission line, which can be used to probe the geometry ofthe accretion flow. existing observational data indicate that the presence ofadafs in quiescent dn is not ubiquitous, while future observations, inparticular with the x-ray satellites chandra and xmm-newton, have the potentialto detect signatures of the hot flow in promising candidates.

astro-ph;0010430	the quiescent emission spectrum of cen x-4 and other x-ray transients  containing neutron stars	we use the observed optical-uv and x-ray emission spectrum of cen x-4 duringquiescence to constrain models for the accretion flow in this system. we arguethat the optical-uv emission is not due to an optically-thick quiescentaccretion disk, nor due to synchrotron emission from an advection-dominatedaccretion flow (adaf). emission from the bright spot could account for theobserved optical-uv component if the mass transfer rate in cen x-4 is &gt;~2.10^16 g/s. although the presence of an adaf around the neutron star leads tocompton upscattering of the soft x-ray photons radiated from the stellarsurface, we find that this process alone cannot account for the power lawcomponent seen in the quiescent x-ray spectrum of cen x-4 and other x-raytransients containing neutron stars; this result is independent of whether thesource of soft photons is incandescent thermal emission or accretion-poweredemission. we conclude that, in models which invoke the presence of an adaf anda propeller effect for the quiescence of x-ray transients containing neutronstars, the intrinsic emission from the adaf must contribute very little to theoptical-uv and x-ray emission observed. if these adaf+propeller models arecorrect, the x-ray power law component observed must arise from regions wherethe gas impacts the neutron star surface. variability studies could greatlyhelp clarify the role of the various emission mechanisms involved.

astro-ph;0101196	the merger history of supermassive black holes in galaxies	the ubiquity of supermassive black holes (smbhs) at the centers of nearbyluminous galaxies can arise from the multiple mergers experienced by darkmatter halos in hierarchical structure formation models, even if only a smallfraction of these galaxies harbor smbhs at high redshifts. we illustrate thispossibility using cosmological monte carlo simulations of the merger history ofdark matter halos and their associated smbhs. in our most extreme models, inorder to populate nearly every bright galaxy with a smbh at z=0, only a fewpercent of the halos with virial temperatures above 10^4 k are required toharbor a smbh at high redshift. this possibility must be included in studies ofthe luminosity function and the clustering properties of quasars. we predictthe number of smbh merger events that are detectable by the gravitational waveexperiment lisa, as a function of redshift, out to z=5. although the eventrates can be significantly reduced in scenarios with rare smbhs, a minimum of\~10 detectable merger events per year is predicted if smbh binaries coalesceefficiently. the observed distribution of events with redshift could yieldvaluable information on the smbh formation process. if smbh binaries do notcoalesce, we find that at least several smbh slingshot ejections probablyoccurred from z=5 to the present in each galaxy more massive than ~10^11 msunat z=0. although our results are sensitive to the minimum cooling mass assumedfor the formation of smbhs, we expect the qualitative predictions of our modelsto be robust.

astro-ph;0102478	stability and evolution of supernova fallback disks	we show that thin accretion disks made of carbon or oxygen are subject to thesame thermal ionization instability as hydrogen and helium disks. we argue thatthe instability applies to disks of any metal content. the relevance of theinstability to supernova fallback disks probably means that their power-lawevolution breaks down when they first become neutral. we construct simpleanalytical models for the viscous evolution of fallback disks to show that itis possible for these disks to become neutral when they are still young (agesof a few 10^3 to 10^4 years), compact in size (a few 10^9 cm to 10^11 cm) andgenerally accreting at sub-eddington rates (mdot ~ a few 10^14 - 10^18 g/s).based on recent results on the nature of viscosity in the disks of closebinaries, we argue that this time may also correspond to the end of the diskactivity period. indeed, in the absence of a significant source of viscosity inthe neutral phase, the entire disk will likely turn to dust and become passive.we discuss various applications of the evolutionary model, including anomalousx-ray pulsars and young radio pulsars. our analysis indicates that metal-richfallback disks around newly-born neutron stars and black holes become neutralgenerally inside the tidal truncation radius (roche limit) for planets, at\~10^11 cm. consequently, the efficiency of the planetary formation process inthis context will mostly depend on the ability of the resulting disk of rocksto spread via collisions beyond the roche limit. it appears easier for themerger product of a doubly degenerate binary, whether it is a massive whitedwarf or a neutron star, to harbor planets because it can spread beyond theroche limit before becoming neutral.[abridged]

astro-ph;0203191	the giant x-ray flare of ngc 5905: tidal disruption of a star, a brown  dwarf, or a planet?	we model the 1990 giant x-ray flare of the quiescent galaxy ngc 5905 as thetidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. from the observedrapid decline of the luminosity, over a timescale of a few years, we argue thatthe flare was powered by the fallback of debris rather than subsequentaccretion via a thin disk. the fallback model allows constraints to be set onthe black hole mass and the mass of debris. the latter must be very much lessthan a solar mass to explain the very low luminosity of the flare. theobservations can be explained either as the partial stripping of the outerlayers of a low-mass main sequence star or as the disruption of a brown dwarfor a giant planet. we find that the x-ray emission in the flare must haveoriginated within a small patch rather than over the entire torus ofcircularized material surrounding the black hole. we suggest that the patchcorresponds to the ``bright spot'' where the stream of returning debris impactsthe torus. interestingly, although the peak luminosity of the flare was highlysub-eddington, the peak flux from the bright spot was close to the eddingtonlimit. we speculate on the implications of this result for observations ofother flare events.

astro-ph;0210006	dynamical habitability of known extrasolar planetary systems	habitability is usually defined as the requirement for a terrestrial planet'satmosphere to sustain liquid water. this definition can be complemented by thedynamical requirement that other planets in the system do not gravitationallyperturb terrestrial planets outside of their habitable zone, the orbital regionallowing the existence of liquid water. we quantify the dynamical habitabilityof 85 known extrasolar planetary systems via simulations of their orbitaldynamics in the presence of potentially habitable terrestrial planets. whenrequiring that habitable planets remain strictly within their habitable zone atall time, the perturbing influence of giant planets extends beyond thetraditional hill sphere for close encounters: terrestrial planet excursionsoutside of the habitable zone are also caused by secular eccentricityvariations and, in some cases, strong mean-motion resonances. our resultsindicate that more than half the known extrasolar planetary systems (mostlythose with distant, eccentric giant planets) are unlikely to harbor habitableterrestrial planets. about 1/4 of the systems (mostly those with close-in giantplanets), including 1/3 of the potential targets for the terrestrial planetfinder, appear as dynamically habitable as our own solar system. the influenceof yet undetected giant planets in these systems could compromise theirdynamical habitability. some habitable terrestrial planets in our simulationshave substantial eccentricities (e &gt; 0.1) which may lead to large seasonalclimate variations and thus affect their habitability.

astro-ph;0405334	the mass budget of merging quasars	two spectacular results emerging from recent studies of nearby dead quasarsand distant active quasars are (i) the existence of tight relations between themasses of black holes (bhs) and the properties of their host galaxies (spheroidluminosity or velocity dispersion, galaxy mass), and (ii) a consistency betweenthe local mass density in bhs and that expected by summing up the lightreceived from distant active quasars. these results are partly shaped bysuccessive galactic mergers and bh coalescences, since mergers redistribute thepopulation of bhs in galaxies and bh binary coalescences reduce the massdensity in bhs through losses to gravitational waves. here, we isolate andquantify these effects by following the cosmological merger history of apopulation of massive bhs representing the quasar population between z = 3 andz =0. our results suggest that the relation between bh mass and host galaxyproperties, and inferences on the global efficiency of bh accretion duringactive quasar phases, could be influenced by the cumulative effect of repeatedmergers.

astro-ph;0603235	diffusive migration of low-mass proto-planets in turbulent disks	torque fluctuations due to magnetorotational turbulence in proto-planetarydisks may greatly influence the migration patterns and survival probabilitiesof nascent planets. provided that the turbulence is a stationary stochasticprocess with finite amplitude and correlation time, the resulting diffusivemigration can be described with a fokker-planck equation, which we reduce to anadvection-diffusion equation. we calibrate the coefficients with existingturbulent-disk simulations and mean-migration estimates, and solve the equationboth analytically and numerically. diffusion tends to dominate over advectionfor planets of low-mass and those in the outer regions of proto-planetarydisks, whether they are described by the minimum mass solar nebula (mmsn) or byt-tauri alpha disks. diffusion systematically reduces the lifetime of mostplanets, yet it allows a declining fraction of them to survive for extendedperiods of time at large radii. mean planet lifetimes can even be formallyinfinite (e.g. in an infinite steady mmsn), though median lifetimes are alwaysfinite. surviving planets may linger near specific radii where the combinedeffects of advection and diffusion are minimized, or at large radii, dependingon model specifics. the stochastic nature of migration in turbulent diskschallenges deterministic planet formation scenarios and suggests instead that awide variety of planetary outcomes are possible from similar initialconditions. this would contribute to the diversity of (extrasolar) planetarysystems.

astro-ph;0606358	magneto-rotational transport in the early sun	angular momentum transport must have occurred in the sun's radiative zone toexplain its current solid body rotation. we survey the stability of the earlysun's radiative zone with respect to diffusive rotational instabilities, for avariety of plausible past configurations. we find that the (faster rotating)early sun was prone to rotational instabilities even if only weak levels ofradial differential rotation were present, while the current sun is not.stability domains are determined by approximate balance between dynamical anddiffusive timescales, allowing generalizations to other stellar contexts.depending on the strength and geometry of the weak magnetic field present, thefastest growing unstable mode can be hydrodynamic or magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd)in nature. our results suggest that diffusive mhd modes may be more efficientat transporting angular momentum than their hydrodynamic(``goldreich-schubert-fricke'') counterparts because the minimum spatial scalerequired for magnetic tension to be destabilizing limits the otherwise verysmall scales favored by double-diffusive instabilities. diffusivemagneto-rotational instabilities are thus attractive candidates for angularmomentum transport in the early sun's radiative zone.

astro-ph;0702549	turbulent torques on protoplanets in a dead zone	migration of protoplanets in their gaseous host disks may be largelyresponsible for the observed orbital distribution of extrasolar planets. recentsimulations have shown that the magnetorotational turbulence thought to driveaccretion in protoplanetary disks can affect migration by turning it into anorbital random walk. however, these simulations neglected the disk's ionizationstructure. low ionization fraction near the midplane of the disk can decouplethe magnetic field from the gas, forming a dead zone with reduced or noturbulence. here, to understand the effect of dead zones on protoplanetarymigration, we perform numerical simulations of a small region of a stratifieddisk with magnetorotational turbulence confined to thin active layers above andbelow the midplane. turbulence in the active layers exerts decreased, but stillmeasurable, gravitational torques on a protoplanet located at the diskmidplane. we find a decrease of two orders of magnitude in the diffusioncoefficient for dead zones with dead-to-active surface density ratiosapproaching realistic values in protoplanetary disks. this torque arisesprimarily from density fluctuations within a distance of one scale height ofthe protoplanet. turbulent torques have correlation times of only $\sim 0.3$orbital periods and apparently time-stationary distributions. these propertiesare encouraging signs that stochastic methods can be used to determine theorbital evolution of populations of protoplanets under turbulent migration. ourresults indicate that dead zones may be dynamically distinct regions forprotoplanetary migration.

astro-ph;9803242	accretion disc outbursts: a new version of an old model	we have developed 1d time-dependent numerical models of accretion discs,using an adaptive grid technique and an implicit numerical scheme, in which thedisc size is allowed to vary with time. the code fully resolves the cooling andheating fronts propagating in the disc. we show that models in which the radiusof the outer edge of the disc is fixed produce incorrect results, from whichprobably incorrect conclusions about the viscosity law have been inferred. inparticular we show that outside-in outbursts are possible when a standardbimodal behaviour of the shakura-sunyaev viscosity parameter alpha is used. wealso discuss to what extent insufficient grid resolutions have limited thepredictive power of previous models. we find that the global properties(magnitudes, etc. ...) of transient discs can be addressed by codes using ahigh, but reasonable, number of fixed grid points. however, the study of thedetailed physical properties of the transition fronts generally requiresresolutions which are out of reach of fixed grid codes. it appears that mosttime-dependent models of accretion discs published in the literature have beenlimited by resolution effects, improper outer boundary conditions, or both.

astro-ph;9810186	a population of faint non-transient low mass black hole binaries	we study the thermal and viscous stability of accretion flows in low massblack hole binaries (lmbhbs). we consider a model in which an inneradvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) is surrounded by a geometrically thinaccretion disk, the transition between the two zones occurring at a radiusr_tr. in all the known lmbhbs, r_tr appears to be such that the outer diskscould suffer from a global thermal-viscous instability. this instability islikely to cause the transient behavior of these systems. however, in mostcases, if r_tr were slightly larger than the estimated values, the systemswould be globally stable. this suggests that a population of faint persistentlmbhbs with globally stable outer disks could be present in the galaxy. suchlmbhbs would be hard to detect because they would lack large amplitudeoutbursts, and because their adaf zones would have very low radiativeefficiencies, making the systems very dim. we present model spectra of suchsystems covering the optical and x-ray bands.

astro-ph;9810426	on the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function and the  accretion rate of quasars	we consider a class of models for the redshift evolution (between $0\lsim z\lsim 4$) of the observed optical and x-ray quasar luminosity functions (lfs),with the following assumptions: (i) the mass-function of dark matter halosfollows the press-schechter theory, (ii) the black hole (bh) mass scaleslinearly with the halo mass, (iii) quasars have a constant universal lifetime,and (iv) a thin accretion disk provides the optical luminosity of quasars,while the x-ray/optical flux ratio is calibrated from a sample of observedquasars. the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}$ onto quasar bhs is a free parameterof the models, that we constrain using the observed lfs. the accretion rate$\dot m$ inferred from either the optical or x-ray data under these assumptionsgenerally decreases as a function of cosmic time from $z \simeq 4$ to $z \simeq0$. we find that a comparable accretion rate is inferred from the x-ray andoptical lf only if the x-ray/optical flux ratio decreases with bh mass. near$z\simeq 0$, $\dot m$ drops to substantially sub-eddington values at whichadvection-dominated accretion flows (adafs) exist. such a decline of $\dot m$,possibly followed by a transition to radiatively inefficient adafs, couldexplain both the absence of bright quasars in the local universe and thefaintness of accreting bhs at the centers of nearby galaxies. we argue that adecline of the accretion rate of the quasar population is indeed expected incosmological structure formation models.

astro-ph;9811188	structure and properties of transition fronts in accretion discs	we use high-resolution time-dependent numerical simulations of accretiondiscs around white dwarfs to study the structure and properties of transitionfronts in the context of the thermal-viscous disc instability model. thethermal structure of cooling and heating fronts is dominated by radiativecooling and viscous heating, respectively, except in a very narrow precursorregion in heating fronts where advection and radial transport of energydominate. cooling fronts are much broader than heating fronts, but the widthsof both types of fronts scale with the local vertical scale height of the disc.we confirm that during a fair fraction of the propagation time of a coolingfront, the structure of the inner disc is close to self-similar. the speed ofheating fronts is ~ a few km/s, while the speed of cooling fronts is ~ afraction of a km/s. we show that direct measurements of the speed of transitionfronts probably cannot discriminate between various prescriptions proposed forthe viscosity parameter alpha. a natural prediction of the disc instabilitymodel is that fronts decelerate as they propagate in the disc, independent ofthe prescription for alpha. observation of this effect would confirm that dwarfnova outbursts are driven by the thermal-viscous instability. most of ourresults also apply to low mass x-ray binaries in which the accreting object isa neutron star or a black hole.

0811.1920	identifying decaying supermassive black hole binaries from their  variable electromagnetic emission	supermassive black hole binaries (smbhbs) with masses in the range 10^4-10^7m_sun/(1+z), produced in galaxy mergers, are thought to complete theircoalescence due to the emission of gravitational waves (gws). the anticipateddetection of the gws by the lisa will constitute a milestone for fundamentalphysics and astrophysics. while the gw signatures themselves will provide atreasure trove of information, if the source can be securely identified inelectromagnetic (em) bands, this would open up entirely new scientificopportunities, to probe fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. wediscuss several ideas, involving wide-field telescopes, that may be useful inlocating electromagnetic counterparts to smbhbs detected by lisa. inparticular, the binary may produce a variable electromagnetic flux, such as aroughly periodic signal due to the orbital motion prior to coalescence, or aprompt transient signal caused by shocks in the circumbinary disk when thesmbhb recoils and "shakes" the disk. we discuss whether these time-variable emsignatures may be detectable, and how they can help in identifying a uniquecounterpart within the localization errors provided by lisa. we also discuss apossibility of identifying a population of coalescing smbhbs statistically, ina deep optical survey for periodically variable sources, before lisa detectsthe gws directly. the discovery of such sources would confirm that gas ispresent in the vicinity and is being perturbed by the smbhb - serving as aproof of concept for eventually finding actual lisa counterparts.
