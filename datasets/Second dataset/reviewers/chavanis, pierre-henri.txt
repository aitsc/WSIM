0904.2729	dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with long-range interactions:  interpretation of the different functionals	we discuss the dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with weak long-rangeinteractions. generically, these systems experience a violent collisionlessrelaxation in the vlasov regime leading to a (usually) non-boltzmannian quasistationary state (qss), followed by a slow collisional relaxation leading tothe boltzmann statistical equilibrium state. these two regimes can be explainedby a kinetic theory, using an expansion of the bbgky hierarchy in powers of1/n, where n is the number of particles. we discuss the physical meaning of thedifferent functionals appearing in the analysis: the boltzmann entropy, thelynden-bell entropy, the "generalized" entropies arising in the reduced spaceof coarse-grained distribution functions, the tsallis entropy, the generalizedh-functions increasing during violent relaxation (not necessarilymonotonically) and the convex casimir functionals used to settle the formalnonlinear dynamical stability of steady states of the vlasov equation. we showthe connection between the different variational problems associated with thesefunctionals. we also introduce a general class of nonlinear mean fieldfokker-planck (nfp) equations that can be used as numerical algorithms to solvethese constrained optimization problems.

0706.3974	kinetic and hydrodynamic models of chemotactic aggregation	we derive general kinetic and hydrodynamic models of chemotactic aggregationthat describe certain features of the morphogenesis of biological colonies(like bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells or social insects). starting from astochastic model defined in terms of n coupled langevin equations, we derive anonlinear mean field fokker-planck equation governing the evolution of thedistribution function of the system in phase space. by taking the successivemoments of this kinetic equation and using a local thermodynamic equilibriumcondition, we derive a set of hydrodynamic equations involving a damping term.in the limit of small frictions, we obtain a hyperbolic model describing theformation of network patterns (filaments) and in the limit of strong frictionswe obtain a parabolic model which is a generalization of the standardkeller-segel model describing the formation of clusters (clumps). our approachconnects and generalizes several models introduced in the chemotacticliterature. we discuss the analogy between bacterial colonies andself-gravitating systems and between the chemotactic collapse and thegravitational collapse (jeans instability). we also show that the basicequations of chemotaxis are similar to nonlinear mean field fokker-planckequations so that a notion of effective generalized thermodynamics can bedeveloped.

0707.2292	relativistic stars with a linear equation of state: analogy with  classical isothermal spheres and black holes	we complete our previous investigation concerning the structure and thestability of "isothermal" spheres in general relativity. this concerns objectsthat are described by a linear equation of state $p=q\epsilon$ so that thepressure is proportional to the energy density. in the newtonian limit $q\to0$, this returns the classical isothermal equation of state. we considerspecifically a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/3), the core of neutron stars(q=1/3) and a gas of baryons interacting through a vector meson field (q=1). westudy how the thermodynamical parameters scale with the size of the object andfind unusual behaviours due to the non-extensivity of the system. we comparethese scaling laws with the area scaling of the black hole entropy. we alsodetermine the domain of validity of these scaling laws by calculating thecritical radius above which relativistic stars described by a linear equationof state become dynamically unstable. for photon stars, we show that thecriteria of dynamical and thermodynamical stability coincide. consideringfinite spheres, we find that the mass and entropy as a function of the centraldensity present damped oscillations. we give the critical value of the centraldensity, corresponding to the first mass peak, above which the series ofequilibria becomes unstable. finally, we extend our results to d-dimensionalspheres. we show that the oscillations of mass versus central density disappearabove a critical dimension d_{crit}(q). for newtonian isothermal stars (q=0) werecover the critical dimension d_{crit}=10. for the stiffest stars (q=1) wefind d_{crit}=9 and for a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/d) we findd_{crit}=9.96404372... very close to 10. finally, we give analytical solutionsof relativistic isothermal spheres in 2d gravity.

0912.5102	statistical mechanics of beltrami flows in axisymmetric geometry: theory  reexamined	a simplified thermodynamic approach of the incompressible axisymmetric eulerequations is considered based on the conservation of helicity, angular momentumand microscopic energy. statistical equilibrium states are obtained bymaximizing the boltzmann entropy under these sole constraints. we assume thatthese constraints are selected by the properties of forcing and dissipation.the fluctuations are found to be gaussian while the mean flow is in a beltramistate. furthermore, we show that the maximization of entropy at fixed helicity,angular momentum and microscopic energy is equivalent to the minimization ofmacroscopic energy at fixed helicity and angular momentum. this provides ajustification of this selective decay principle from statistical mechanics.these theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experiments of a vonkarman turbulent flow and provide a way to measure the temperature ofturbulence and check fluctuation-dissipation relations (fdr). relaxationequations are derived that could provide an effective description of thedynamics towards the beltrami state and the progressive emergence of a gaussiandistribution. they can also provide a numerical algorithm to determine maximumentropy states or minimum energy states.

1002.2711	statistical mechanics of beltrami flows in axisymmetric geometry:  equilibria and bifurcations	we characterize the thermodynamical equilibrium states of axisymmetriceuler-beltrami flows. they have the form of coherent structures presenting oneor several cells. we find the relevant control parameters and derive thecorresponding equations of state. we prove the coexistence of severalequilibrium states for a given value of the control parameter like in 2dturbulence [chavanis and sommeria, j. fluid mech. 314, 267 (1996)]. we explorethe stability of these equilibrium states and show that all states are saddlepoints of entropy and can, in principle, be destabilized by a perturbation witha larger wavenumber, resulting in a structure at the smallest available scale.this mechanism is therefore reminiscent of the 3d richardson energy cascadetowards smaller and smaller scales. therefore, our system is truly intermediatebetween 2d turbulence (coherent structures) and 3d turbulence (energy cascade).we further explore numerically the robustness of the equilibrium states withrespect to random perturbations using a relaxation algorithm in both canonicaland microcanonical ensembles. we show that saddle points of entropy can be veryrobust and therefore play a role in the dynamics. we evidence differences inthe robustness of the solutions in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles.a scenario of bifurcation between two different equilibria (with one or twocells) is proposed and discussed in connection with a recent observation of aturbulent bifurcation in a von karman experiment [ravelet et al., phys. rev.lett. 93, 164501 (2004)].

1002.3268	kinetic equations for systems with long-range interactions: a unified  description	we complete the existing literature on the kinetic theory of systems withlong-range interactions. starting from the bbgky hierarchy, or using projectionoperator technics or a quasilinear theory, a general kinetic equation can bederived when collective effects are neglected. this equation (which is notwell-known) applies to possibly spatially inhomogeneous systems, which isspecific to systems with long-range interactions. interestingly, the structureof this kinetic equation bears a clear physical meaning in terms of generalizedkubo relations. furthermore, this equation takes a very similar form forstellar systems and two-dimensional point vortices providing therefore aunified description of the kinetic theory of these systems. if we assume thatthe system is spatially homogeneous (or axisymmetric for point vortices), thisequation can be simplified and reduces to the landau equation (or itscounterpart for point vortices). our formalism thus offers a simple derivationof landau-type equations. we also use this general formalism to derive akinetic equation, written in angle-action variables, describing spatiallyinhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions. this new derivation solvesthe shortcomings of our previous derivation [p.h. chavanis, physica a 377, 469(2007)]. finally, we consider a test particle approach and derive generalexpressions for the diffusion and friction (or drift) coefficients of a testparticle evolving in a bath of field particles. we make contact with theexpressions previously obtained in the literature. as an application of thekinetic theory, we argue that the relaxation time is shorter for inhomogeneous(or high-dimensional) systems than for homogeneous (or low-dimensional) systemsbecause there are potentially more resonances.

1003.5148	escape of stars from gravitational clusters in the chandrasekhar model	we study the evaporation of stars from globular clusters using the simplifiedchandrasekhar model. this is an analytically tractable model giving reasonableagreement with more sophisticated models that require complicated numericalintegrations. in the chandrasekhar model: (i) the stellar system is assumed tobe infinite and homogeneous (ii) the evolution of the velocity distribution ofstars f(v,t) is governed by a fokker-planck equation, the so-calledkramers-chandrasekhar equation (iii) the velocities |v| that are above athreshold value r&gt;0 (escape velocity) are not counted in the statisticaldistribution of the system. in fact, high velocity stars leave the system, dueto free evaporation or to the attraction of a neighboring galaxy (tidaleffects). accordingly, the total mass and energy of the system decrease intime. if the star dynamics is described by the kramers-chandrasekhar equation,the mass decreases to zero exponentially rapidly. our goal is to obtainnon-perturbative analytical results that complement the seminal studies ofchandrasekhar, michie and king valid for large times $t\to+\infty$ and largeescape velocities $r\to +\infty$. in particular, we obtain an exactsemi-explicit solution of the kramers-chandrasekhar equation with the absorbingboundary condition f(r,t)=0. we use it to obtain an explicit expression of themass loss at any time t when $r\to +\infty$. we also derive an exact integralequation giving the exponential evaporation rate $\lambda(r)$, and thecorresponding eigenfunction $f_{\lambda}(v)$, when $t\to +\infty$ for anysufficiently large value of the escape velocity r. for $r\to +\infty$, weobtain an explicit expression of the evaporation rate that refines thechandrasekhar results.

1008.2898	brownian particles with long and short range interactions	we develop a kinetic theory of brownian particles with long and short rangeinteractions. we consider both overdamped and inertial models. in theoverdamped limit, the evolution of the spatial density is governed by thegeneralized mean field smoluchowski equation including a mean field potentialdue to long-range interactions and a generically nonlinear barotropic pressuredue to short-range interactions. this equation describes various physicalsystems such as self-gravitating brownian particles (smoluchowski-poissonsystem), bacterial populations experiencing chemotaxis (keller-segel model) andcolloidal particles with capillary interactions. we also take into account theinertia of the particles and derive corresponding kinetic and hydrodynamicequations generalizing the usual kramers, jeans, euler and cattaneo equations.for each model, we provide the corresponding form of free energy and establishthe h-theorem and the virial theorem. finally, we show that the samehydrodynamic equations are obtained in the context of nonlinear mean fieldfokker-planck equations associated with generalized thermodynamics. however, inthat case, the nonlinear pressure is due to the bias in the transitionprobabilities from one state to the other leading to non-boltzmanniandistributions while in the former case the distribution is boltzmannian but thenonlinear pressure arises from the two-body correlation function induced by theshort-range potential of interaction. as a whole, our paper developsconnections between the topics of long-range interactions, short-rangeinteractions, nonlinear mean field fokker-planck equations and generalizedthermodynamics. it also justifies from a kinetic theory based on microscopicprocesses, the basic equations that were introduced phenomenologically ingravitational brownian dynamics, chemotaxis and colloidal suspensions withattractive interactions.

0708.3163	jeans type analysis of chemotactic collapse	we perform a linear dynamical stability analysis of a general hydrodynamicmodel of chemotactic aggregation [chavanis &amp; sire, physica a, in press (2007)].specifically, we study the stability of an infinite and homogeneousdistribution of cells against "chemotactic collapse". we discuss the analogybetween the chemotactic collapse of biological populations and thegravitational collapse (jeans instability) of self-gravitating systems. ourhydrodynamic model involves a pressure force which can take into accountseveral effects like anomalous diffusion or the fact that the organisms cannotinterpenetrate. we also take into account the degradation of the chemical whichleads to a shielding of the interaction like for a yukawa potential. finally,our hydrodynamic model involves a friction force which quantifies theimportance of inertial effects. in the strong friction limit, we obtain ageneralized keller-segel model similar to the generalized smoluchowski-poissonsystem describing self-gravitating langevin particles. for small frictions, weobtain a hydrodynamic model of chemotaxis similar to the euler-poisson systemdescribing a self-gravitating barotropic gas. we show that an infinite andhomogeneous distribution of cells is unstable against chemotactic collapse whenthe "velocity of sound" in the medium is smaller than a critical value. westudy in detail the linear development of the instability and determine therange of unstable wavelengths, the growth rate of the unstable modes and thedamping rate, or the pulsation frequency, of the stable modes as a function ofthe friction parameter and shielding length. for specific equations of state,we express the stability criterion in terms of the density of cells.

1009.2884	exact analytical solution of the collapse of self-gravitating brownian  particles and bacterial populations at zero temperature	we provide an exact analytical solution of the collapse dynamics ofself-gravitating brownian particles and bacterial populations at zerotemperature. these systems are described by the smoluchowski-poisson system orkeller-segel model in which the diffusion term is neglected. as a result, thedynamics is purely deterministic. a cold system undergoes a gravitationalcollapse leading to a finite time singularity: the central density increasesand becomes infinite in a finite time t_coll. the evolution continues in thepost collapse regime. a dirac peak emerges, grows and finally captures all themass in a finite time t_end, while the central density excluding the dirac peakprogressively decreases. close to the collapse time, the pre and post collapseevolution is self-similar. interestingly, if one starts from a parabolicdensity profile, one obtains an exact analytical solution that describes thewhole collapse dynamics, from the initial time to the end, and accounts for nonself-similar corrections that were neglected in previous works. our resultshave possible application in different areas including astrophysics,chemotaxis, colloids and nanoscience.

1011.2393	thermodynamics of the hmf model with a magnetic field	we study the thermodynamics of the hamiltonian mean field (hmf) model with anexternal potential playing the role of a "magnetic field". if we consider onlyfully stable states, this system does not present any phase transition.however, if we take into account metastable states (for a restricted class ofperturbations), we find a very rich phenomenology. in particular, the systemdisplays a region of negative specific heats in the microcanonical ensemble inwhich the temperature decreases as the energy increases. this leads toensembles inequivalence and to zeroth order phase transitions similar to the"gravothermal catastrophe" and to the "isothermal collapse" of self-gravitatingsystems. in the present case, they correspond to the reorganization of thesystem from an "anti-aligned" phase (magnetization pointing in the directionopposite to the magnetic field) to an "aligned" phase (magnetization pointingin the same direction as the magnetic field). we also find that the magneticsusceptibility can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble so that themagnetization decreases as the magnetic field increases. the magnetic curvescan take various shapes depending on the values of energy or temperature. wedescribe hysteretic cycles involving positive or negative susceptibilities. wealso show that this model exhibits gaps in the magnetization at fixed energy,resulting in ergodicity breaking.

1012.3284	the hmf model for fermions and bosons	we study the thermodynamics of quantum particles with long-range interactionsat t=0. specifically, we generalize the hamiltonian mean field (hmf) model tothe case of fermions and bosons. in the case of fermions, we consider thethomas-fermi approximation that becomes exact in a proper thermodynamic limit.the equilibrium configurations, described by the fermi (or waterbag)distribution, are equivalent to polytropes with index n=1/2. in the case ofbosons, we consider the hartree approximation that becomes exact in a properthermodynamic limit. the equilibrium configurations are solutions of the meanfield schr\"odinger equation with a cosine interaction. we show that thehomogeneous phase, that is unstable in the classical regime, becomes stable inthe quantum regime. this takes place through a first order phase transition forfermions and through a second order phase transition for bosons where thecontrol parameter is the normalized planck constant. in the case of fermions,the homogeneous phase is stabilized by the pauli exclusion principle while forbosons the stabilization is due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle. as aresult, the thermodynamic limit is different for fermions and bosons. we pointout analogies between the quantum hmf model and the concepts of fermion andboson stars in astrophysics. finally, as a by-product of our analysis, weobtain new results concerning the vlasov dynamical stability of the waterbagdistribution.

1103.2050	mass-radius relation of newtonian self-gravitating bose-einstein  condensates with short-range interactions: i. analytical results	we provide an approximate analytical expression of the mass-radius relationof a newtonian self-gravitating bose-einstein condensate (bec) with short-rangeinteractions described by the gross-pitaevskii-poisson system. these equationsmodel astrophysical objects such as boson stars and, presumably, dark mattergalactic halos. our study connects the non-interacting case studied by ruffini&amp; bonazzola (1969) to the thomas-fermi limit studied by b\"ohmer &amp; harko(2007). for repulsive short-range interactions (positive scattering lengths),there exists configurations of arbitrary mass but their radius is always largerthan a minimum value. for attractive short-range interactions (negativescattering lengths), equilibrium configurations only exist below a maximummass. above that mass, the system is expected to collapse and form a blackhole. we also study the radius versus scattering length relation for a givenmass. we find that stable configurations only exist above a (negative) minimumscattering length. our approximate analytical solution, based on a gaussianansatz, provides a very good agreement with the exact solution obtained bynumerically solving a nonlinear differential equation representing hydrostaticequilibrium. our treatment is, however, easier to handle and permits to studythe stability problem, and derive an analytical expression of the pulsationperiod, by developing an analogy with a simple mechanical problem.

1204.6392	statistical mechanics of quasi-geostrophic flows on a rotating sphere	statistical mechanics provides an elegant explanation to the appearance ofcoherent structures in two-dimensional inviscid turbulence: while thefine-grained vorticity field, described by the euler equation, becomes more andmore filamented through time, its dynamical evolution is constrained by someglobal conservation laws (energy, casimir invariants). as a consequence, thecoarse-grained vorticity field can be predicted through standard statisticalmechanics arguments (relying on the hamiltonian structure of thetwo-dimensional euler flow), for any given set of the integral constraints.  it has been suggested that the theory applies equally well to geophysicalturbulence; specifically in the case of the quasi-geostrophic equations, withpotential vorticity playing the role of the advected quantity. in this study,we demonstrate analytically that the miller-robert-sommeria theory leads tonon-trivial statistical equilibria for quasi-geostrophic flows on a rotatingsphere, with or without bottom topography. we first consider flows withoutbottom topography and with an infinite rossby deformation radius, with andwithout conservation of angular momentum. when the conservation of angularmomentum is taken into account, we report a case of second order phasetransition associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. in a second step, wetreat the general case of a flow with an arbitrary bottom topography and afinite rossby deformation radius. previous studies were restricted to flows ina planar domain with fixed or periodic boundary conditions with a beta-effect.  in these different cases, we are able to classify the statistical equilibriafor the large-scale flow through their sole macroscopic features. we build thephase diagrams of the system and discuss the relations of the variousstatistical ensembles.

1208.1192	a simple model of universe with a polytropic equation of state	we construct a simple model of universe with a generalized equation of state$p=(\alpha +k\rho^{1/n})\rho c^2$ having a linear component $p=\alpha\rho c^2$and a polytropic component $p=k\rho^{1+1/n}c^2$. for $\alpha=1/3$, $n=1$ and$k=-4/(3\rho_p)$, where $\rho_p=5.16 10^{99} g/m^3$ is the planck density, thisequation of state provides a model of the early universe without singularitydescribing the transition between the pre-radiation era and the radiation era.the universe starts from $t=-\infty$ but, when $t&lt;0$, its size is less than theplanck length $l_p=1.62 10^{-35} m$. the universe undergoes an inflationaryexpansion that brings it to a size $a_1=2.61 10^{-6} m$ on a timescale of a fewplanck times $t_p=5.39 10^{-44} s$. when $t\gg t_p$, the universe deceleratesand enters in the radiation era. for $\alpha=0$, $n=-1$ and$k=-\rho_{\lambda}$, where $\rho_{\lambda}=7.02 10^{-24} g}/m^3$ is thecosmological density, this equation of state describes the transition from adecelerating universe dominated by baryonic and dark matter to an acceleratinguniverse dominated by dark energy (second inflation). the transition takesplace at a size $a_2=8.95 10^{25} m$ corresponding to a time of the order ofthe cosmological time $t_{\lambda}=1.46 10^{18} s$. this polytropic modelreveals a nice "symmetry" between the early and late evolution of the universe,the cosmological constant $\lambda$ in the late universe playing a role similarto the planck constant $\hbar$ in the early universe. we interpret thecosmological constant as a fundamental constant of nature describing the"cosmophysics" just like the planck constant describes the microphysics. theplanck density and the cosmological density represent fundamental upper andlower bounds differing by ${122}$ orders of magnitude. the cosmologicalconstant "problem" may be a false problem.

1209.5987	linear response theory for hydrodynamic and kinetic equations with  long-range interactions	we apply the linear response theory to systems with long-range interactionsdescribed by hydrodynamic equations such as the euler, smoluchowski, and dampedeuler equations. we analytically determine the response of the system submittedto a pulse and to a step function. we compare these results with those obtainedfor collisionless systems described by the vlasov equation. we show that, inthe linear regime, the evolution of a collisionless system (vlasov) with thewaterbag distribution is the same as the evolution of a collision-dominated gaswithout dissipation (euler). in this analogy, the maximum velocity of thewaterbag distribution plays the role of the velocity of sound in thecorresponding barotropic gas. when submitted to a step function, these systemsexhibit permanent oscillations. other distributions exhibit landau damping andrelax towards a steady state. we illustrate this behaviour with the cauchydistribution which can be studied analytically. we apply our results to the hmfmodel and obtain a generalized curie-weiss law for the magnetic susceptibility.finally, we compare the linear response theory to the initial value problem forthe linearized vlasov equation and report a case of algebraic damping of theinitial perturbation.

1210.5743	kinetic theory of spatially inhomogeneous stellar systems without  collective effects	we review and complete the kinetic theory of spatially inhomogeneous stellarsystems when collective effects (dressing of the stars by their polarizationcloud) are neglected. we start from the bbgky hierarchy issued from theliouville equation and consider an expansion in powers of 1/n in a properthermodynamic limit. for $n\rightarrow +\infty$, we obtain the vlasov equationdescribing the evolution of collisionless stellar systems like ellipticalgalaxies. at the order 1/n, we obtain a kinetic equation describing theevolution of collisional stellar systems like globular clusters. this equationdoes not suffer logarithmic divergences at large scales since spatialinhomogeneity is explicitly taken into account. making a local approximation,and introducing an upper cut-off at the jeans length, it reduces to thevlasov-landau equation which is the standard kinetic equation of stellarsystems. our approach provides a simple and pedagogical derivation of theseimportant equations from the bbgky hierarchy which is more rigorous for systemswith long-range interactions than the two-body encounters theory. making anadiabatic approximation, we write the generalized landau equation inangle-action variables and obtain a landau-type kinetic equation that is validfor fully inhomogeneous stellar systems and is free of divergences at largescales. this equation is less general than the lenard balescu-type kineticequation recently derived by heyvaerts (2010) since it neglects collectiveeffects, but it is substantially simpler and could be useful as a first step.we discuss the evolution of the system as a whole and the relaxation of a teststar in a bath of field stars. we derive the corresponding fokker-planckequation in angle-action variables and provide expressions for the diffusioncoefficient and friction force.

1303.0998	kinetic theory of spatially homogeneous systems with long-range  interactions: ii. basic equations	we provide a short historic of the early development of kinetic theory inplasma physics and synthesize the basic kinetic equations describing theevolution of systems with long-range interactions derived in paper i. wedescribe the evolution of the system as a whole and the relaxation of a testparticle in a bath at equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium. we write theseequations for an arbitrary long-range potential of interaction in a space ofarbitrary dimension d. we discuss the scaling of the relaxation time with thenumber of particles for non-singular potentials. for always spatiallyhomogeneous systems, the relaxation time of the system as a whole scales like nin d&gt;1 and like n^2 (presumably) in d=1. for always spatially inhomogeneoussystems, the relaxation time of the system as a whole scales like n in anydimension of space. for one dimensional systems undergoing a dynamical phasetransition from a homogeneous to an inhomogeneous phase, we expect a relaxationtime of the form n^{\delta} with 1&lt;\delta&lt;2 intermediate between the twoprevious cases. the relaxation time of a test particle in a bath always scaleslike n. we also briefly discuss the kinetic theory of systems with long-rangeinteractions submitted to an external stochastic potential. this paper gathersbasic equations that are applied to specific systems in paper iii.

1303.1004	kinetic theory of spatially homogeneous systems with long-range  interactions: iii. application to power-law potentials, plasmas, stellar  systems, and to the hmf model	we apply the general results of the kinetic theory of systems with long-rangeinteractions to particular systems of physical interest. we consider repulsiveand attractive power-law potentials of interaction r^{-\gamma} with \gamma&lt;d ina space of dimension d. for \gamma&gt;\gamma_c= (d-1)/2, strong collisions must betaken into account and the evolution of the system is governed by the boltzmannequation or by a modified landau equation; for \gamma&lt;\gamma_c, strongcollisions are negligible and the evolution of the system is governed by thelenard-balescu equation. in the marginal case \gamma=\gamma_c, we can use thelandau equation (with appropriately justified cut-offs) as a relevantapproximation of the boltzmann and lenard-balescu equations. the divergence atsmall scales that appears in the original landau equation is regularized by theeffect of strong collisions. in the case of repulsive interactions with aneutralizing background (e.g. plasmas), the divergence at large scales thatappears in the original landau equation is regularized by collective effectsaccounting for debye shielding. in the case of attractive interactions (e.g.gravity), it is regularized by the spatial inhomogeneity of the system and itsfinite extent. we provide explicit analytical expressions of the diffusion andfriction coefficients, and of the relaxation time, depending on the value ofthe exponent \gamma and on the dimension of space d. we treat in a unifiedframework the case of coulombian plasmas and stellar systems in variousdimensions of space, and the case of the attractive and repulsive hmf models.

1307.4786	supernovae: an example of complexity in the physics of compressible  fluids	the supernovae are typical complex phenomena in fluid mechanics with verydifferent time scales. we describe them in the light of catastrophe theory,assuming that successive equilibria between pressure and gravity present asaddle-node bifurcation. in the early stage we show that the loss ofequilibrium may be described by a generic equation of the painlev\'e i form. inthe final stage of the collapse, just before the divergence of the centraldensity, we show that the existence of a self-similar collapsing solutioncompatible with the numerical observations imposes that the gravity forces arestronger than the pressure ones. this situation differs drastically in itsprinciple from the one generally admitted where pressure and gravity forces areassumed to be of the same order. our new self-similar solution (based on thehypothesis of dominant gravity forces) which matches the smooth solution of theouter core solution, agrees globally well with our numerical results. whereassome differences with the earlier self-similar solutions are minor, others arevery important. for example, we find that the velocity field becomes singularat the collapse time, diverging at the center, and decreasing slowly outsidethe core, whereas previous works described a finite velocity field in the corewhich tends to a supersonic constant value at large distances. this discrepancyshould be important for explaining the emission of remnants in thepost-collapse regime. finally we describe the post-collapse dynamics, when massbegins to accumulate in the center, also within the hypothesis that gravityforces are dominant.

1308.1765	explicit formula of energy-conserving fokker-planck type collision term  for single species point vortex systems with weak mean flow	this paper derives a kinetic equation for a two-dimensional single speciespoint vortex system. we consider a situation (different from the onesconsidered previously) of weak mean flow where the time scale of themacroscopic motion is longer than the decorrelation time so that the trajectoryof the point vortices can be approximated by a straight line on thedecorrelation time scale. this may be the case when the number $n$ of pointvortices is not too large. using a kinetic theory based on the klimontovichformalism, we derive a collision term consisting of a diffusion term and adrift term, whose structure is similar to the fokker-planck equation. thecollision term exhibits several important properties: (a) it includes anonlocal effect; (b) it conserves the mean field energy; (c) it satisfies the htheorem; (d) its effect vanishes in each local equilibrium region with the sametemperature. when the system reaches a global equilibrium state, the collisionterm completely converges to zero all over the system.

1309.2843	gravitational phase transitions with an exclusion constraint in position  space	we discuss the statistical mechanics of a system of self-gravitatingparticles with an exclusion constraint in position space in a space ofdimension $d$. the exclusion constraint puts an upper bound on the density ofthe system and can stabilize it against gravitational collapse. we plot thecaloric curves giving the temperature as a function of the energy andinvestigate the nature of phase transitions as a function of the size of thesystem and of the dimension of space in both microcanonical and canonicalensembles. we consider stable and metastable states and emphasize theimportance of the latter for systems with long-range interactions. for $d\le2$, there is no phase transition. for $d&gt;2$, phase transitions can take placebetween a "gaseous" phase unaffected by the exclusion constraint and a"condensed" phase dominated by this constraint. the condensed configurationshave a core-halo structure made of a "rocky core" surrounded by an"atmosphere", similar to a giant gaseous planet. for large systems there existmicrocanonical and canonical first order phase transitions. for intermediatesystems, only canonical first order phase transitions are present. for smallsystems there is no phase transition at all. as a result, the phase diagramexhibits two critical points, one in each ensemble. there also exist a regionof negative specific heats and a situation of ensemble inequivalence forsufficiently large systems. by a proper interpretation of the parameters, ourresults have application for the chemotaxis of bacterial populations in biologydescribed by a generalized keller-segel model including an exclusion constraintin position space. they also describe colloids at a fluid interface driven byattractive capillary interactions when there is an excluded volume around theparticles. connexions with two-dimensional turbulence are also mentioned.

1309.3509	statistical mechanics of two-dimensional point vortices: relaxation  equations and strong mixing limit	we complete the literature on the statistical mechanics of point vortices intwo-dimensional hydrodynamics. using a maximum entropy principle, we determinethe multi-species boltzmann-poisson equation and establish a form of virialtheorem. using a maximum entropy production principle (mepp), we derive a setof relaxation equations towards statistical equilibrium. these relaxationequations can be used as a numerical algorithm to compute the maximum entropystate. we mention the analogies with the fokker-planck equations derived bydebye and h\"uckel for electrolytes. we then consider the limit of strongmixing (or low energy). to leading order, the relationship between thevorticity and the stream function at equilibrium is linear and the maximizationof the entropy becomes equivalent to the minimization of the enstrophy. thisexpansion is similar to the debye-h\"uckel approximation for electrolytes,except that the temperature is negative instead of positive so that theeffective interaction between like-sign vortices is attractive instead ofrepulsive. this leads to an organization at large scales presentinggeometry-induced phase transitions, instead of debye shielding. we compare theresults obtained with point vortices to those obtained in the context of thestatistical mechanics of continuous vorticity fields described by themiller-robert-sommeria (mrs) theory. at linear order, we get the same resultsbut differences appear at the next order. in particular, the mrs theorypredicts a transition between sinh and tanh-like \omega-\psi relationshipsdepending on the sign of ku-3 (where ku is the kurtosis) while there is no suchtransition for point vortices which always show a sinh-like \omega-\psirelationship. we derive the form of the relaxation equations in the strongmixing limit and show that the enstrophy plays the role of a lyapunovfunctional.

1309.5784	a cosmological model describing the early inflation, the intermediate  decelerating expansion, and the late accelerating expansion by a quadratic  equation of state	we develop a cosmological model based on a quadratic equation of statep/c^2=-(\alpha+1){\rho^2}/{\rho_p}+\alpha\rho-(\alpha+1)\rho_{\lambda} (where\rho_p is the planck density and \rho_{\lambda} the cosmological density)"unifying" vacuum energy and dark energy in the spirit of a generalizedchaplygin gas model. for $\rho\rightarrow \rho_p$, it reduces to p=-\rho c^2leading to a phase of early accelerated expansion (early inflation) with aconstant density equal to the planck density \rho_p (vacuum energy). for$\rho_{\lambda}\ll\rho\ll \rho_p$, we recover the standard linear equation ofstate p=\alpha \rho c^2 describing radiation (\alpha=1/3) or pressurelessmatter (\alpha=0) and leading to an intermediate phase of deceleratingexpansion. for $\rho\rightarrow \rho_{\lambda}$, we get p=-\rho c^2 leading toa phase of late accelerated expansion (late inflation) with a constant densityequal to the cosmological density \rho_{\lambda} (dark energy). we show a nicesymmetry between the early universe (vacuum energy + \alpha-fluid) and the lateuniverse (\alpha-fluid + dark energy). in our model, they are described by twopolytropic equations of state with index n=+1 and n=-1 respectively.furthermore, the planck density \rho_p in the early universe plays a rolesimilar to the cosmological density \rho_{\lambda} in the late universe. theyrepresent fundamental upper and lower density bounds differing by 122 orders ofmagnitude. this quadratic equation of state leads to a fully analytical modeldescribing the evolution of the universe from the early inflation (planck era)to the late accelerated expansion (de sitter era). these two phases are bridgedby a decelerating algebraic expansion (\alpha-era). this model does not presentany singularity at t=0 and exists eternally in the past. it admits a scalarfield interpretation based on a quintessence field or a tachyon field.

1402.5525	a parametrization of two-dimensional turbulence based on a maximum  entropy production principle with a local conservation of energy	in the context of two-dimensional (2d) turbulence, we apply the maximumentropy production principle (mepp) by enforcing a local conservation ofenergy. this leads to an equation for the vorticity distribution that conservesall the casimirs, the energy, and that increases monotonically the mixingentropy ($h$-theorem). furthermore, the equation for the coarse-grainedvorticity dissipates monotonically all the generalized enstrophies. theseequations may provide a parametrization of 2d turbulence. they do not generallyrelax towards the maximum entropy state. the vorticity current vanishes for anysteady state of the 2d euler equation. interestingly, the equation for thecoarse-grained vorticity obtained from the mepp turns out to coincide, aftersome algebraic manipulations, with the one obtained with the anticipatedvorticity method. this shows a connection between these two approaches when theconservation of energy is treated locally. furthermore, the newly derivedequation, which incorporates a diffusion term and a drift term, has a nicephysical interpretation in terms of a selective decay principle. this gives anew light to both the mepp and the anticipated vorticity method.

0803.0263	hamiltonian and brownian systems with long-range interactions: v.  stochastic kinetic equations and theory of fluctuations	we develop a theory of fluctuations for brownian systems with weak long-rangeinteractions. for these systems, there exists a critical point separating ahomogeneous phase from an inhomogeneous phase. starting from the stochasticsmoluchowski equation governing the evolution of the fluctuating density field,we determine the expression of the correlation function of the densityfluctuations around a spatially homogeneous equilibrium distribution. in thestable regime, we find that the temporal correlation function of the fouriercomponents of the density fluctuations decays exponentially rapidly with thesame rate as the one characterizing the damping of a perturbation governed bythe mean field smoluchowski equation (without noise). on the other hand, theamplitude of the spatial correlation function in fourier space diverges at thecritical point $t=t_{c}$ (or at the instability threshold $k=k_{m}$) implyingthat the mean field approximation breaks down close to the critical point andthat the phase transition from the homogeneous phase to the inhomogeneous phaseoccurs sooner. by contrast, the correlations of the velocity fluctuationsremain finite at the critical point (or at the instability threshold). we giveexplicit examples for the brownian mean field (bmf) model and for brownianparticles interacting via the gravitational potential and via the attractiveyukawa potential. we also introduce a stochastic model of chemotaxis forbacterial populations generalizing the mean field keller-segel model by takinginto account fluctuations.

1409.7838	models of dark matter halos based on statistical mechanics: i. the  classical king model	we consider the possibility that dark matter halos are described by thefermi-dirac distribution at finite temperature. this is the case if dark matteris a self-gravitating quantum gas made of massive neutrinos at statisticalequilibrium. this is also the case if dark matter can be treated as aself-gravitating collisionless gas experiencing lynden-bell's type of violentrelaxation. in order to avoid the infinite mass problem and carry out arigorous stability analysis, we consider the fermionic king model. in thispaper, we study the non-degenerate limit leading to the classical king model.this model was initially introduced to describe globular clusters. we proposeto apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects arenegligible. we determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamicalstability of the different configurations. equilibrium states exist only abovea critical energy $e_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above acritical temperature $t_c$ in the canonical ensemble. for $e&lt;e_c$, the systemundergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $t&lt;t_c$, it undergoes anisothermal collapse. we compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, andvelocity dispersion. we compare the prediction of the classical king model tothe observations of large dark matter halos. because of collisions andevaporation, the central density increases while the slope of the halo densityprofile decreases until an instability takes place. we show that large darkmatter halos are relatively well-described by the king model at, or close to,the point of marginal microcanonical stability. at that point, the king modelgenerates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified hubbleprofile. this profile has a flat core and decreases as $r^{-3}$ at largedistances, like the observational burkert profile. less steep halos areunstable.

1409.7840	models of dark matter halos based on statistical mechanics: ii. the  fermionic king model	we discuss the nature of phase transitions in the fermionic king model whichdescribes tidally truncated quantum self-gravitating systems. this distributionfunction takes into account the escape of high energy particles and has afinite mass. on the other hand, the pauli exclusion principle puts an upperbound on the phase space density of the system and stabilizes it againstgravitational collapse. as a result, there exists a statistical equilibriumstate for any accessible values of energy and temperature. we plot the caloriccurves and investigate the nature of phase transitions as a function of thedegeneracy parameter in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. weconsider stable and metastable states and emphasize the importance of thelatter for systems with long-range interactions. phase transitions can takeplace between a "gaseous" phase unaffected by quantum mechanics and a"condensed" phase dominated by quantum mechanics. the phase diagram exhibitstwo critical points, one in each ensemble, beyond which the phase transitionsdisappear. there also exist a region of negative specific heats and a situationof ensemble inequivalence for sufficiently large systems. we apply thefermionic king model to the case of dark matter halos made of massiveneutrinos. the gaseous phase describes large halos and the condensed phasedescribes dwarf halos. partially degenerate configurations describeintermediate size halos. we argue that large dark matter halos cannot harbor afermion ball because these nucleus-halo configurations are thermodynamicallyunstable (saddle points of entropy). large dark matter halos may rather containa central black hole resulting from a dynamical instability of relativisticorigin occurring during the gravothermal catastrophe.
{fenge}
1411.6154	the fermionic king model	we study the fermionic king model which may provide a relevant model of darkmatter halos. the exclusion constraint can be due to quantum mechanics (forfermions such as massive neutrinos) or to lynden-bell's statistics (forcollisionless systems undergoing violent relaxation). this model has a finitemass. furthermore, a statistical equilibrium state exists for all accessiblevalues of energy. dwarf and intermediate size halos are degenerate quantumobjects stabilized against gravitational collapse by the pauli exclusionprinciple. large halos at sufficiently high energies are in a gaseous phasewhere quantum effects are negligible. they are stabilized by thermal motion.below a critical energy they undergo gravitational collapse (gravothermalcatastrophe). this may lead to the formation of a central black hole that doesnot affect the structure of the halo. this may also lead to the formation of acompact degenerate object surrounded by a hot massive atmosphere extending atlarge distances. we argue that large dark matter halos should not contain adegenerate nucleus (fermion ball) because these nucleus-halo structures arethermodynamically unstable. we compare the rotation curves of the classicalking model to observations of large dark matter halos (burkert profile).because of collisions and evaporation, the central density increases while theslope of the halo density profile decreases until an instability takes place.we find that the observations are compatible with a king profile at, or closeto, the point of marginal stability in the microcanonical ensemble. at thatpoint, the king profile can be fitted by the modified hubble profile that has aflat core and a halo in which the density decreases as $r^{-3}$. this isqualitatively similar to the burkert profile.

1412.0005	relativistic self-gravitating bose-einstein condensates and cold baryons  with a stiff equation of state	because of their superfluid properties, some compact astrophysical objectssuch as neutron stars may contain a significant part of their matter in theform of a bose-einstein condensate (bec). we consider a partially-relativisticmodel of self-gravitating becs where the relation between the pressure and therest-mass density is assumed to be quadratic (as in the case of classical becs)but pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energydensity and the rest-mass density. at high densities, we get a stiff equationof state similar to the one considered by zel'dovich (1961) in the context ofbaryon stars in which the baryons interact through a vector meson field. wedetermine the maximum mass of general relativistic bec stars described by thisequation of state by using the formalism of tooper (1965). this maximum mass isslightly larger than the maximum mass obtained by chavanis and harko (2012)using a fully-relativistic model. we also consider the possibility that darkmatter is made of becs and apply the partially-relativistic model of becs tocosmology. in this model, we show that the universe experiences a stiff matterphase, followed by a dust matter phase, and finally by a dark energy phase(equivalent to a cosmological constant). the same evolution is obtained inzel'dovich (1972) model which assumes that initially, near the cosmologicalsingularity, the universe is filled with cold baryons. interestingly, thefriedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide asimple generalization of the $\lambda$cdm model. we point out, however, thelimitations of the partially-relativistic model for becs and show the need fora fully-relativistic one.

1412.0743	cosmology with a stiff matter era	we provide a simple analytical solution of the friedmann equations for auniverse made of stiff matter, dust matter, and dark energy. a stiff matter erais present in the cosmological model of zel'dovich (1972) where the primordialuniverse is assumed to be made of a cold gas of baryons. it also occurs incertain cosmological models where dark matter is made of relativisticself-gravitating bose-einstein condensates (becs). when the energy density ofthe stiff matter is positive, the primordial universe is singular. it startsfrom a state with a vanishing scale factor and an infinite density. we considerthe possibility that the energy density of the stiff matter is negative(anti-stiff matter). this happens, for example, when the becs have anattractive self-interaction. in that case, the primordial universe isnon-singular. it starts from a state in which the scale factor is finite andthe energy density is equal to zero. for the sake of generality, we consider acosmological constant of arbitrary sign. when the cosmological constant ispositive, the universe asymptotically reaches a de sitter phase where the scalefactor increases exponentially rapidly. this can account for the acceleratingexpansion of the universe that we observe at present. when the cosmologicalconstant is negative (anti-de sitter), the evolution of the universe is cyclic.therefore, depending on the sign of the energy density of the stiff matter andof the dark energy, we obtain singular and non-singular expanding or cyclicuniverses.

0804.3517	critical dynamics of self-gravitating langevin particles and bacterial  populations	we study the critical dynamics of the generalized smoluchowski-poisson system(for self-gravitating langevin particles) or generalized keller-segel model(for the chemotaxis of bacterial populations). these models [chavanis &amp; sire,pre, 69, 016116 (2004)] are based on generalized stochastic processes leadingto the tsallis statistics. the equilibrium states correspond to polytropicconfigurations with index $n$ similar to polytropic stars in astrophysics. atthe critical index $n_{3}=d/(d-2)$ (where $d\ge 2$ is the dimension of space),there exists a critical temperature $\theta_{c}$ (for a given mass) or acritical mass $m_{c}$ (for a given temperature). for $\theta&gt;\theta_{c}$ or$m&lt;m_{c}$ the system tends to an incomplete polytrope confined by the box (in abounded domain) or evaporates (in an unbounded domain). for $\theta&lt;\theta_{c}$or $m&gt;m_{c}$ the system collapses and forms, in a finite time, a dirac peakcontaining a finite fraction $m_c$ of the total mass surrounded by a halo. thisstudy extends the critical dynamics of the ordinary smoluchowski-poisson systemand keller-segel model in $d=2$ corresponding to isothermal configurations with$n_{3}\to +\infty$. we also stress the analogy between the limiting mass ofwhite dwarf stars (chandrasekhar's limit) and the critical mass of bacterialpopulations in the generalized keller-segel model of chemotaxis.

1503.07437	hydrodynamic representation of the klein-gordon-einstein equations in  the weak field limit: i. general formalism and perturbations analysis	using a generalization of the madelung transformation, we derive thehydrodynamic representation of the klein-gordon-einstein equations in the weakfield limit. we consider a complex self-interacting scalar field with a$\lambda|\varphi|^4$ potential. we study the evolution of the homogeneousbackground in the fluid representation and derive the linearized equationsdescribing the evolution of small perturbations in a static and in an expandinguniverse. we compare the results with simplified models in which thegravitational potential is introduced by hand in the klein-gordon equation, andassumed to satisfy a (generalized) poisson equation. we study the evolution ofthe perturbations in the matter era using the nonrelativistic limit of ourformalism. perturbations whose wavelength is below the jeans length oscillatein time while pertubations whose wavelength is above the jeans length growlinearly with the scale factor as in the cold dark matter model. the growth ofperturbations in the scalar field model is substantially faster than in thecold dark matter model. when the wavelength of the pertubations approaches thecosmological horizon (hubble length), a relativistic treatment is mandatory. inthat case, we find that relativistic effects attenuate or even prevent thegrowth of pertubations. this paper exposes the general formalism and providesillustrations in simple cases. other applications of our formalism will beconsidered in companion papers.

1504.05028	secular diffusion in discrete self-gravitating tepid discs i : analytic  solution in the tightly wound limit	the secular evolution of an infinitely thin tepid isolated galactic disc madeof a finite number of particles is described using the inhomogeneousbalescu-lenard equation. assuming that only tightly wound transient spirals arepresent in the disc, a wkb approximation provides a simple and tractablequadrature for the corresponding drift and diffusion coefficients. it providesinsight into the physical processes at work during the secular diffusion of aself-gravitating discrete disc and makes quantitative predictions on theinitial variations of the distribution function in action space.  when applied to the secular evolution of an isolated stationaryself-gravitating mestel disc, this formalism predicts initially the importanceof the corotation resonance in the inner regions of the disc leading to aregime involving radial migration and heating. it predicts in particular theformation of a "ridge like" feature in action space, in agreement withsimulations, but over-estimates the timescale involved in its appearance. swingamplification is likely to resolve this discrepancy.  in astrophysics, the inhomogeneous balescu-lenard equation and its wkb limitmay also describe the secular diffusion of giant molecular clouds in galacticdiscs, the secular migration and segregation of planetesimals inproto-planetary discs, or even the long-term evolution of population of starswithin the galactic center.

1504.08355	is the universe logotropic?	we consider the possibility that the universe is made of a single dark fluiddescribed by a logotropic equation of state $p=a\ln(\rho/\rho_*)$, where $\rho$is the rest-mass density, $\rho_*$ is a reference density, and $a$ is thelogotropic temperature. the energy density $\epsilon$ is the sum of two terms:a rest-mass energy term $\rho c^2$ that mimics dark matter and an internalenergy term $u(\rho)=-p(\rho)-a$ that mimics dark energy. this decompositionleads to a natural, and physical, unification of dark matter and dark energy,and elucidates their mysterious nature. the logotropic model depends on asingle parameter $b=a/\rho_{\lambda}c^2$ where $\rho_{\lambda}$ is thecosmological density. for $b=0$, we recover the $\lambda$cdm model. usingcosmological constraints, we find that $0\le b\le 0.09425$. we consider thepossibility that dark matter halos are described by the same logotropicequation of state. when $b&gt;0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitationalcollapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, inagreement with the observations. the universal rotation curve of logotropicdark matter halos is consistent with the observational burkert profile up tothe halo radius. interestingly, if we assume that all the dark matter haloshave the same logotropic temperature $b$, we find that their surface density$\sigma=\rho_0 r_h$ is constant. this result is in agreement with theobservations where it is found that $\sigma_0=141\, m_{\odot}/{\rm pc}^2$ fordark matter halos differing by several orders of magnitude in size. using thisobservational result, we obtain $b=3.53\times 10^{-3}$. assuming that$\rho_*=\rho_p$, where $\rho_p$ is the planck density, we predict $b=3.53\times10^{-3}$, in perfect agreement with the value obtained from the observations.

1505.00034	the logotropic dark fluid as a unification of dark matter and dark  energy	we propose a heuristic unification of dark matter and dark energy in terms ofa single dark fluid with a logotropic equation of state $p=a\ln(\rho/\rho_p)$,where $\rho$ is the rest-mass density, $\rho_p$ is the planck density, and $a$is the logotropic temperature. the energy density $\epsilon$ is the sum of arest-mass energy term $\rho c^2$ mimicking dark matter and an internal energyterm $u(\rho)=-p(\rho)-a$ mimicking dark energy. the logotropic temperature isapproximately given by $a \simeq\rho_{\lambda}c^2/\ln(\rho_p/\rho_{\lambda})\simeq\rho_{\lambda}c^2/[123\ln(10)]$, where $\rho_{\lambda}$ is the cosmological density. more precisely,we obtain $a=2.13\times 10^{-9} \, {\rm g}\, {\rm m}^{-1}\, {\rm s}^{-2}$ thatwe interpret as a fundamental constant. at the cosmological scale, this modelfullfills the same observational constraints as the $\lambda$cdm model.however, it has a nonzero velocity of sound and a nonzero jeans length which,at the beginning of the matter era, is about $\lambda_j=40.4\, {\rm pc}$, inagreement with the minimum size of the dark matter halos observed in theuniverse. at the galactic scale, the logotropic pressure balances gravitationalattraction and solves the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem. thelogotropic equation of state generates a universal rotation curve that agreeswith the empirical burkert profile of dark matter halos up to the halo radius.in addition, it implies that all the dark matter halos have the same surfacedensity $\sigma_0=\rho_0 r_h=141\, m_{\odot}/{\rm pc}^2$ and that the mass ofdwarf galaxies enclosed within a sphere of fixed radius $r_{u}=300\, {\rm pc}$has the same value $m_{300}=1.93\times 10^{7}\, m_{\odot}$, in remarkableagreement with the observations.

1507.06887	secular diffusion in discrete self-gravitating tepid discs ii:  accounting for swing amplification via the matrix method	the secular evolution of an infinitely thin tepid isolated galactic disc madeof a finite number of particles is investigated using the inhomogeneousbalescu-lenard equation expressed in terms of angle-action variables. thematrix method is implemented numerically in order to model the inducedgravitational polarization. special care is taken to account for theamplification of potential fluctuations of mutually resonant orbits and theunwinding of the induced swing amplified transients. quantitative comparisonswith ${n-}$body simulations yield consistent scalings with the number ofparticles and with the self-gravity of the disc: the fewer particles and thecolder the disc, the faster the secular evolution. secular evolution is drivenby resonances, but does not depend on the initial phases of the disc. for amestel disc with ${q \sim 1.5}$, the polarization cloud around each star boostsup its secular effect by a factor of the order of a thousand or more, promotingaccordingly the dynamical relevance of self-induced collisional secularevolution. the position and shape of the induced resonant ridge are found to bein very good agreement with the prediction of the balescu-lenard equation,which scales with the square of the susceptibility of the disc.  in astrophysics, the inhomogeneous balescu-lenard equation may describe thesecular diffusion of giant molecular clouds in galactic discs, the secularmigration and segregation of planetesimals in proto-planetary discs, or eventhe long-term evolution of population of stars within the galactic centre. itcould be used as a valuable check of the accuracy of ${n-}$body integratorsover secular timescales.

0807.0324	dynamical phase transitions in long-range hamiltonian systems and  tsallis distributions with a time-dependent index	we study dynamical phase transitions in systems with long-range interactions,using the hamiltonian mean field (hmf) model as a simple example. these systemsgenerically undergo a violent relaxation to a quasi-stationary state (qss)before relaxing towards boltzmann equilibrium. in the collisional regime, theout-of-equilibrium one-particle distribution function (df) is aquasi-stationary solution of the vlasov equation, slowly evolving in time dueto finite $n$ effects. for subcritical energies $7/12&lt;u&lt;3/4$, we exhibit caseswhere the df is well-fitted by a tsallis $q$-distribution with an index $q(t)$slowly decreasing in time from $q\simeq 3$ (semi-ellipse) to $q=1$ (boltzmann).when the index $q(t)$ reaches a critical value $q_{crit}(u)$, thenon-magnetized (homogeneous) phase becomes vlasov unstable and a dynamicalphase transition is triggered, leading to a magnetized (inhomogeneous) state.while tsallis distributions play an important role in our study, we explainthis dynamical phase transition by using only conventional statisticalmechanics. for supercritical energies, we report for the first time theexistence of a magnetized qss with a very long lifetime.

astro-ph;0404251	on the lifetime of metastable states in self-gravitating systems	we discuss the physical basis of the statistical mechanics ofself-gravitating systems. we show the correspondance between statisticalmechanics methods based on the evaluation of the density of states andpartition function and thermodynamical methods based on the maximization of athermodynamical potential (entropy or free energy). we address the question ofthe thermodynamic limit of self-gravitating systems, the justification of themean-field approximation, the validity of the saddle point approximation nearthe transition point, the lifetime of metastable states and the fluctuations inisothermal spheres. in particular, we emphasize the tremendously long lifetimeof metastable states of self-gravitating systems which increases exponentiallywith the number of particles n except in the vicinity of the critical point.more specifically, using an adaptation of the kramers formula justified by akinetic theory, we show that the lifetime of a metastable state scales as e^{ndelta s} in microcanonical ensemble and e^{n delta j} in canonical ensemble,where delta s and delta j are the barriers of entropy and free energy j=s-betaepsilon (per particle) respectively. the physical caloric curve must take thesemetastable states (local entropy maxima) into account. as a result, it becomesmulti-valued and leads to microcanonical phase transitions and ``dinosaur'snecks''(chavanis 2002b, chavanis &amp; rieutord 2003). the consideration ofmetastable states answers the critics raised by d.h.e. gross [cond-mat/0307535;cond-mat/0403582].

0705.4405	hamiltonian and brownian systems with long-range interactions: iii. the  bbgky hierarchy for spatially inhomogeneous systems	we study the growth of correlations in systems with weak long-rangeinteractions. starting from the bbgky hierarchy, we determine the evolution ofthe two-body correlation function by using an expansion of the solutions of thehierarchy in powers of 1/n in a proper thermodynamic limit $n\to +\infty$.these correlations are responsible for the ``collisional'' evolution of thesystem beyond the vlasov regime due to finite $n$ effects. we obtain a generalkinetic equation that can be applied to spatially inhomogeneous systems andthat takes into account memory effects. these peculiarities are specific tosystems with unshielded long-range interactions. for spatially homogeneoussystems with short memory time like plasmas, we recover the classical landau(or lenard-balescu) equations. an interest of our approach is to develop aformalism that remains in physical space (instead of fourier space) and thatcan deal with spatially inhomogeneous systems. this enlightens the basicphysics and provides novel kinetic equations with a clear physicalinterpretation. however, unless we restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneoussystems, closed kinetic equations can be obtained only if we ignore somecollective effects between particles. general exact coupled equations takinginto account collective effects are also given. we use this kinetic theory todiscuss the processes of violent collisionless relaxation and slow collisionalrelaxation in systems with weak long-range interactions. in particular, weinvestigate the dependence of the relaxation time with the system size andprovide a coherent discussion of all the numerical results obtained for thesesystems.
