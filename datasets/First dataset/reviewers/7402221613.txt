84929517906	Limitation of degree information for analyzing the interaction evolution in online social networks	Previously many studies on online social networks simply analyze the static topology in which the friend relationship once established, then the links and nodes will not disappear, but this kind of static topology may not accurately reflect temporal interactions on online social services. In this study, we define four types of users and interactions in the interaction (dynamic) network. We found that active, disappeared, new and super nodes (users) have obviously different strength distribution properties and this result also can be revealed by the degree characteristics of the unweighted interaction and friendship (static) networks. However, the active, disappeared, new and super links (interactions) only can be reflected by the strength distribution in the weighted interaction network. This result indicates the limitation of the static topology data on analyzing social network evolutions. In addition, our study uncovers the approximately stable statistics for the dynamic social network in which there are a large variation for users and interaction intensity. Our findings not only verify the correctness of our definitions, but also helped to study the customer churn and evaluate the commercial value of valuable customers in online social networks.

84929791719	Periodic event-triggered distributed receding horizon control of dynamically decoupled linear systems	This paper is concerned with the distributed receding horizon control (DRHC) problem for large-scale linear systems with disturbances. A periodic event-triggered DRHC scheme is proposed to reduce communication and computation load. A detailed dual-mode periodic event-triggered DHRC algorithm is designed, and sufficient conditions for ensuring feasibility and stability are established, respectively. We show that the feasibility depends on the testing period, and that the stability is related with the testing period, and the cooperation matrices. The overall system is stable and the system state converges to a set under the designed algorithm.

8644251882	Method for modeling long distance autonomous underwater vehicle	It is well known that the hydrodynamic model of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is very important for system analysis, design and simulation, but the traditional model of AUV suffers from the following two shortcomings: (1) the local earth coordinate is selected as an inertial one, the model does not consider the curvature and rotation of the earth; (2) the geographic positional parameters, such as longitude and latitude, are not included in the model. Therefore such a model will result in a big position error and cannot be used for integrated navigation and control system simulation for a long distance AUV. In order to overcome the aforementioned problems, a hydrodynamic model for long distance AUV is proposed. In order to establish the hydrodynamic model of long distance AUV, the earth-centered inertial coordinates and earth-centered earth-fixed coordinates, navigation coordinates, body-fixed coordinates and velocity coordinates are selected. The hydrodynamic model consists of two parts. The first part is the six-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations in earth-centered inertial coordinates based on the theory of momentum and moment. The second part is the six-degree-of-freedom kinematic equations by coordinates transformations among earth-centered inertial coordinates, earth-centered earth-fixed coordinates, navigation coordinates and body-fixed coordinates. This model has been successfully used in integrated navigation and control system semi-physical simulation for long distance AUV, Simulation results show that this model has the following two distinguishing features: (1) Because the model is established in the earth-centered inertial coordinates, the navigation parameters, such as longitude and latitude, are included in the model, therefore the model is more suitable for global guidance system simulation for long distance AUV. (2) The model is suitable for long distance AUV integrated navigation and control system simulation and can be used for precision analysis and precision index assignment of the sensors of navigation and control system.

1442312554	Global sliding-mode control for companion nonlinear system with bounded control	Based on feedback linearization, quasi-time-optimal control and sliding-mode control theory, a kind of quasi-time-optimal continuously time-varying sliding-mode for robust control of nonlinear uncertainties systems subject to input constraint is presented. The proposed sliding surface can adapt it to the initial conditions of the system and the controller can be composed of two parts, one part is used to turn the nonlinear system into linear system by feedback linearization, and the other part is used to realize the quasi-time-optimal control for feedback linearized system. By this means, insensitivity of the system to external disturbance and parameter uncertainties is guaranteed from the very beginning of the proposed control action, and the system error convergence rate can be greatly increased. The advantages of the proposed scheme are indicated by comparison with the Bartoszewicz's scheme[5], and the Lyapunov theory is used to prove the existence of a sliding mode on the surface. © 1998 AACC.

0031384151	Improving robust self-organizing fuzzy variable structure controller	The improvements were mainly in two respects: elimination of need for upper bounds on norms of system uncertainties and large reduction of control chatter. The key to the improvements was the selection of a equation that represented a virtual controller (virtual controller was a part of the fuzzy controller) and allowed mismatched uncertainties to be compensated for adaptively. Thus no upper bounds on norms of system uncertainties were needed. With mismatched uncertainties adaptively compensated for, k in the sliding-mode control law becomes very small according to Kosko's theory, small k signified that chatter was small. Simulation results show that steady-state chatter is very small.

3042723543	Easily implementable backstepping variable structure controller for nonlinear system with unmatched uncertainties	Past papers on designing suitable controller for nonlinear system with unmatched uncertainties with Kokotovc's adaptive backstepping method are not easy to implement. We propose to combine backstepping with VSC (variable structure control) scheme to design an easily implementable controller. The distinguishing feature of our control scheme is that, the effect of unknown disturbances and unmatched uncertainties is suppressed in each step of backstepping design. In our proposed control scheme, it is not necessary to assume that the uncertainties can be expressed in some unknown parameters. Although our proposed control scheme is based on three assumptions, they are easily satisfied and do not affect the easy implementability of our control scheme. The closed loop system is globally stable and can reach the sliding surface in a finite time. The simulation results confirm that the performance of the proposed backstepping VS controller is satisfactory.

33750900084	Model of a new type long distance autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)	It is well known that the hydrodynamic model of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is very important for system analysis, design and simulation, but the traditional model of AUV is only suitable for cruise mode and suffers from the following shortcomings: (1) it considers only the hydrodynamic damping at cruise mode; (2)it considers only the hydrodynamic forces from the axial flow; (3)it does not consider the force and moment from the vertical thrusters and lateral thrusters. Thus this kind of model is not suitable for a new type long distance AUV (Fig.1 in full paper) that not only can cruise but also can hover. In order to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, a new hydrodynamic model for the new type AUV is proposed in this paper. In the paper, we explain in detail the design of hydrodynamic model for the above-mentioned new type AUV. We introduce the kinematical equations of AUV. The momentum and angular momentum of AUV and external forces acting on AUV are derived. The new hydrodynamic model has been successfully used in its control system simulation and has proved to be not only suitable for modeling the new type AUV at cruise mode but also suitable for modeling the AUV at hover mode.

In the full paper, we explain in detail the design of longitudinal sliding mode control for the above-mentioned new type AUV for slow speed cruise mode, high speed cruise mode as well as hover mode.

37249000798	Influence analysis of dithered laser gyro whole cycle sampling demodulation on SINS attitude computation accuracy	In dithered laser gyro strapdown inertial navigation system(LSINS), the mechanical dither frequencies of three laser gyros are always different form each other. Using dithered laser gyro whole cycle sampling demodulation method, the angular data sampled by navigation computer timing sample system imply that the outputs of the three laser gyros are asynchronous, hence noncommutative error occurs in LSINS attitude updating algorithm. The error becomes even worse under coning motion environment. The asynchronous behave of laser gyro outputs is introduced and analysed. Under coning motion circumstance, some simulations are carried out. The simulation results show that the laser gyro asynchronous sampling error plays an important part in LSINS attitude updating algorithm. The attitude updating error by asynchronous sampling method is far greater than that of ideal sampling method. Conclusion is drawn that more attention must be paid to LSINS sampling demodulation in high angular dynamic environment.

38949090424	Formation constraint tracking control of AUV	The formation constraint tracking control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) was studied in this paper. The system total error was divided into two parts; one is the tracking error of each AUV and the other is the formation error. On the basis of this division of the system total error, an adaptive sliding mode variable structure control law, which is eq. (17) in the full paper, was proposed to take into due consideration the parameter uncertainties and the ocean current distribution of each AUV. The convergence of the proposed control law was proved in Theorem 1 in the full paper, whose proof involved eqs. (19) through (22), and the appropriate path variable updating law, which was eq. (24) in the full paper, was selected to avoid using high gain control for large error signal in the proposed algorithm. Simulation results, given in Figs. 2 through 6 in the full paper, show preliminarily that AUVs can cruise in formation regardless of the ocean current distribution, that the model parameters can converge in finite time, and that the formation error with formation constraint was smaller than that without formation constraint.

The depth control loop uses the adaptive algorithm to online estimate the angle of attack which cannot be measured. The pitch angle loop uses the adaptive sliding-mode control method, online estimates the uncertain model parameters and overcomes the unmodeled uncertainties, which ensures the stability of the tri-speed torpedo under the condition of speed change and model parameters uncertainty, and also eliminates the depth steady-state errors caused by the non-zero equilibrium state.

Secondly, a coordinated consensus tracking strategy is derived to ensure each AUV for reaching a consistent state about the inconsistent reference information. The stability of the overall closed-loop system is analyzed mathematically by adopting Nested Matrosov theorem. Simulation results are presented and discussed for validating the proposed controller.

70349305604	Sensorless direct torque controlled drive of brushless DC motor based on fuzzy logic	Investigations were carried out on a sensorless fuzzy direct torque control (DTC) which drives brushless DC motors (BLDC). It is deduced that the amplitude of stator flux linkage can not been controlled in BLDC-DTC since it is automatically determined by every 60 electrical degrees commutation.

80053084227	Nonlinear cross-track control of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle	The cross-track control problem is studied for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Using the backstopping methodology, the stabilization function of the yaw angle is designed to stabilize the cross-track error as the virtual input, resulting in the cascaded subsystems of the cross-track and the yaw tracking. For the normal cross-track subsystem when the yaw and yaw rate tracking errors are zeros, the control parameter condition in the derived to make the cross-track error and the sway velocity globally asymptotically stable. More easily, the globally exponentially tracking controller is designed for the yaw tracking subsystem. Finally the globally asymptotically stability of the whole control system is proved using the cascaded systems theory. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

81055131631	Study on algorithms for fast frequency estimation in the system of high-speed underwater acoustic communication	Aiming at the requirement of fast frequency estimation for high-speed underwater acoustic communication, an improved algorithm for fast frequency estimation with short sequences is proposed based on the algorithm of three-point self-correlation. Increasing a sampling data is adopted for the improved algorithm of fast frequency estimation. The precision of frequency estimation is improved, but the operation amount is almost equal to the ones of the other algorithm. The simulation results show that the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the improved algorithm is closer to Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) than the ones of the other algorithm. What's more, the RMS of the improved algorithm outperform the ones of the other method by 10dB in the environment with low signal-noise-ratio (SNR), and it is better for the higher frequency signal with the same SNR, and the RMS can reach the CRB while the SNR is increased to 10dB at the condition of 6kHz frequency signal. © 2011 IEEE.

84860672649	Intelligent flight for UAV via integration of dynamic MOEA, Bayesian network and fuzzy logic	Intelligent flight is a key technology for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to react to the changing environment. Online path planning (OPP) is a basic issue for intelligent flight and is indeed a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem (DMOP). In this paper, we use an OPP scheme in the sense of model predictive control to continuously update the environmental information for the planner. This method is in fact a DMOP. For solving the problem at hand we propose a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on linkage and prediction (LP-DMOEA).Within this algorithm the historical Pareto sets are collected and analyzed to enhance the performance. For intelligently selecting the best path from the output (a set of Pareto solutions obtained by the LP-DMOEA) of the OPP, the Bayesian network and fuzzy logic are used to quantify the bias to each optimal objective. The experimental results show the LP-DMOEA works more effectively for OPP in contrast to the restart method and the intelligent methods for solution selection can automatically assess the changing environment and adapt the path planner. © 2011 IEEE.

84862620332	Synchronization of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles without velocity measurements	In this paper, we investigate the synchronization control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), considering both state feedback and output feedback cases. Treating multiple AUVs as a graph, we define the tracking error of each AUV with both its own tracking error and the relative position errors with respect to its neighbors taken into account. Lyapunov analysis is used to derive the control law for each AUV. For the output feedback case, a passive filter is used to compensate for the unknown relative velocity errors among AUVs, and an observer is employed to estimate the velocity of the AUV itself. Rigid mathematical proof is provided for the proposed algorithms for both state feedback and output feedback cases. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is shown that, the synchronization error is smaller in the case of considering the relative errors between AUVs than in the case of considering the tracking error of the single AUV only. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84862983224	Non-linear path following control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles	The globally Κ-exponentially stable path following control of an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is proposed based on the cascaded approach. The dynamics model of the ASV path following errors is derived utilizing the Serret-Frenet coordinate originated at the free path reference point, which creates an added control input, i.e., the change rate of the path parameter, to avoid the singularity problem when adopting the coordinate originating at the orthogonal projection point. The path following reference yaw is designed, and the whole path following model is decomposed into two cascaded sub-models, named the position tracking sub-model and the yaw angle and surge velocity tracking sub-model. The global Κ-exponential stability of the path following errors is proved using the cascaded system theory with the globally exponentially stable yaw angle and surge velocity tracking controllers. The results of the mathematic simulations and the lake trials of a real ASV demonstrate the performance of the proposed path following control algorithm.

84866000646	An effective observability analysis for the leader-follower autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cooperative localization based on range measurements	Sections 1 through 3 of the full paper explain our observability analysis mentioned in the titile, which we believe is effective and whose core consists of: (1) in the leader-follower structure, the leader can use high precision navigation system for precise localization but the follower is equipped with only low precision navigation system; thus, the followers need to combine the range measurements to the leader for underwater localization; (2) aiming at finding the influence of control inputs on the observability properties, we develop a kinematics model of the followers in the leader's body coordinate system; considering the range measurements as the observation, we perform an observability analysis for the cooperative localization with different control inputs with nonlinear observability rank condition based on Lie derivatives. Simulation results, presented in Figs. 2 through 4, and their analysis show preliminarily that, for the observable system, the position estimation of each follower has a good convergence and positioning accuracy.

Three common measurements used on real platform, such as depth, heading and pitch, were considered as basic observation values, assisting range measurements for underwater localization. An observability analysis was performed on the system defined with different assist measurements, and then the influence of control inputs and trajectories on the observability property was also performed by nonlinear observability rank condition, which is based on the Lie derivatives. The results indicate that the most simplified measurements combination meeting the system observable is heading and range, and the systems, whose assist measurements containing the heading, are all observable, the change in control inputs and trajectories may make the change in observability property.

84868367256	Global Κ-exponential straight-line tracking control of an underactuated AUV in 3 dimensions using a cascaded approach	The 3-dimension straight-line tracking control is proposed for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle by using the cascaded approach of nonlinear systems. The 3-dimension straight-line tracking model is divided into the vertical tracking model and horizontal tracking model which is perturbed by the former. The desired pitch angle and yaw angle are designed, and the two planar tracking models are divided into the position tracking models and the Euler angles tracking models in the cascaded structures. The pitch and yaw angles tracking control laws are designed based on the pitch and yaw angles tracking models respectively. The nonlinear cascaded system theory is used to strictly prove the global Κ-exponential stability of the whole tracking system without any assumptions on the underactuated sway and heave motions used by the former researches.

84872143699	Behavior-based collision free path following control of an autonomous underwater vehicle	To make an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of avoiding multiple obstacles in proximity along its track path planned by the global path planning algorithms, the collision free path following control is proposed within the behavior-based system architecture including two basic behaviors, namely the path following behavior and the obstacle avoidance behavior. In the path following behavior, the AUV's yaw command is designed by the nonlinear cross-tracking control technique to make the path following errors globally asymptotically stable. Meanwhile, the obstacle avoidance behavior is accomplished using the fuzzy logic methodology with the ranges and bearings of the obstacles measured by the forward looking sonar. The arbitrator chooses the active behavior according to the signs and magnitudes of the desired head change angles of the two behaviors. Simulation results demonstrate the obstacle avoidance capability of the AUV following the planned path.

Towing tank test is the traditional approach to identify these coefficients, however, the obtained values are not completely reliable since experimental difficulties and errors are involved. In this paper, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) method and a least squares (LS) method are proposed, only using onboard sensor data for identification of a small underactuated USV. The vehicle prototype as well as the system integration is delineated. Performance of the identification is evaluated by comparing the estimated coefficients, and the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation.

84873529715	Path following for multiple underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with formation constraints	This paper addresses the problem of steering a group of underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles along specified paths while keeping a desired spatial formation. The controller proposed consists of a nonlinear path following control law and a coordination control law. The new type of path following control law takes an arbitrary variable but not necessarily the curvilinear abscissas variable to describe the referenced path, by which the stringent initial condition constrains existed in current path following controllers are extended; The coordination control strategy proposed only need the vehicles communicate the information of the coordinated variable, so the information flow is small and satisfies with a practical standpoint. For the overall closed-loop system, it is shown in detail how Lyapunov-based techniques and graph theory can be brought together to design a decentralized control structure, where the vehicle dynamics and the constraints imposed by the topology of the inter-vehicle communication network are explicitly taken into account. © 2012 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

A new consensus protocol is given with the properties that not all the agents, even none of them need to use their private state information. Based on the matrix theory and graph theory, it is proved that consensus problems can be solved for both fixed and switching topology by studying the structure of graphs corresponding to nonnegative matrices. If and only if the root vertex has a loop in the interaction topology which has a spanning tree, then the system can achieve consensus asymptotically.

The simulation results demonstrate that the localization performance is more sensitive to the range rather than to the separation angle.
