0902.0863	broad hi absorption in the candidate binary black-hole 4c37.11 (b2  0402+379)	we report the discovery of extremely broad 21-cm hi absorption (fwzi ~1600km/s) detected with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in the radiosource 4c37.11 (b2 0402+379). this object has been claimed to host asuper-massive binary black hole (rodriguez et al. 2006). the main features inthe absorption profile are two components, separated by ~1100 km/s. the hiabsorption in 4c37.11 is unusual because it is the first case where such broadabsorption is found to be centred on the systemic velocity of the host galaxyand not asymmetric and blueshifted as is seen in all other galaxies with broadhi absorption. given the large width of the absorption, we suggest that apossible explanation for the extreme properties of the hi absorption is that itis the kinematic signature of a binary black hole. if this interpretation iscorrect, the combined black hole mass derived from the absorption profile isconsistent with that derived from the luminosity of the spheroid. if the broadabsorption is indeed due to a binary black hole, this finding confirms theimportance of the gaseous component in the merging process of supermassiveblack holes.

0903.5331	eso 381-47, an early-type galaxy with extended hi and a star forming  ring	eso 381-47 is an early type galaxy with an extended hi disk. galex and verydeep optical images reveal a distinct stellar ring far outside the optical bodywith a diameter of ~30 kpc, which has undergone recent star formation at 1.8 x10^-4 msun/yr/kpc^-2, consistent with other new results which detect low levelstar formation below the traditional kennicutt relation in the outer parts ofspiral galaxies. the morphology of this galaxy resembles the recentlyidentified class of ultraviolet objects called extended ultraviolet disks, orxuv-disks. new hi observations of this galaxy taken at the atca and in the cnbarray at the vla show that the cold gas lies in an extended (diameter ~90 kpc)ring around the central s0 galaxy. the hi data cube can be well modeled by awarped ring. the faint ionized gas in the inner parts of the galaxy iskinematically decoupled from the stars and instead appears to exhibitvelocities consistent with the rotation of the hi ring at larger radius. thepeak of the stellar ring, as seen in the optical and uv, is slightly displacedto the inside relative to the peak of the hi ring. we discuss the manner inwhich this offset could be caused by the propagation of a radial density wavethrough an existing stellar disk, perhaps triggered by a galaxy collision atthe center of the disk, or possibly due to a spiral density wave set up atearly times in a disk too hot to form a stellar bar. gas accretion andresonance effects due to a bar which has since dissolved are also considered toexplain the presence of the star forming ring seen in the galex and deepoptical data.

0910.2416	cold gas and young stars in tidally-disturbed ellipticals at z=0	we present an analysis of the neutral hydrogen and stellar populations ofelliptical galaxies in the tal et al. (2009) sample. our aim is to test theirconclusion that the continuing assembly of these galaxies at z~0 is essentiallygas-free and not accompanied by significant star formation. in order to do so,we make use of hi data and line-strength indices available in the literature.we look for direct and indirect evidence of the presence of cold gas during therecent assembly of these objects and analyse its relation to galaxymorphological fine structure.  we find that &gt;25% of ellipticals contain hi at the level of m(hi)&gt;10^8m(sun), and that m(hi) is of the order of a few percent of the total stellarmass. available data are insufficient to establish whether galaxies with adisturbed stellar morphology are more likely to contain hi. however, hiinterferometry reveals very disturbed gas morphology/kinematics in all but oneof the detected systems, confirming the continuing assembly of many ellipticalsbut also showing that this is not necessarily gas-free. we also find that allvery disturbed ellipticals have a single-stellar-population-equivalent age &lt;4gyr. we interpret this as evidence that ~0.5-5% of their stellar mass iscontained in a young population formed during the past ~1 gyr. overall, a largefraction of ellipticals seem to have continued their assembly over the past fewgyr in the presence of a mass of cold gas of the order of 10% of the galaxystellar mass. this material is now observable as neutral hydrogen and youngstars.

1001.2389	cold and warm gas outflows in radio agn	the study of the conditions and the kinematics of the gas in the centralregion of agn provides important information on the relevance of feedbackeffects connected to the nuclear activity. quantifying these effects is key forconstraining galaxy evolution models. here we present a short summary of ourrecent efforts to study the occurrence and the impact of gas outflows inradio-loud agn that are in their first phase of their evolution. clear evidencefor agn-induced outflows have been found for the majority of these young radiosources. the outflows are detected both in (warm) ionized as well in (cold)atomic neutral gas and they are likely to be driven (at least in most of thecases) by the interaction between the expanding jet and the medium. the massoutflow rates of the cold gas (hi) appear to be systematically higher thanthose of the ionized gas. the former reach up to ~50 msun/yr, and are in thesame range as "mild" starburst-driven superwinds in ulirgs, whilst the latterare currently estimated to be a few solar masses per year. however, the kineticpowers associated with these gaseous outflow are a relatively small fraction (afew x 10^-4) of the eddington luminosity of the galaxy. thus, they do notappear to match the requirements of the galaxy evolution feedback models.

1005.4208	a collisional origin for the leo ring	extended hi structures around galaxies are of prime importance to probegalaxy formation scenarios. the giant hi ring in the leo group is one of thelargest and most intriguing hi structures in the nearby universe. whether itconsists of primordial gas, as suggested by the apparent absence of any opticalcounterpart and the absence of an obvious physical connection to nearbygalaxies, or of gas expelled from a galaxy in a collision is actively debated.we present deep wide field-of-view optical images of the ring region obtainedwith megacam on the cfht. they reveal optical counterparts to several hi and uvcondensations along the ring, in the g', r', and i' bands, which likelycorrespond to stellar associations formed within the gaseous ring. analyzingthe spectral energy distribution of one of these star-forming regions, we foundit to be typical for a star-forming region in pre-enriched tidal debris. wethen use simulations to test the hypothesis that the leo ring results from ahead-on collision between leo group members ngc 3384 and m96. according to ourmodel which is able to explain, at least qualitatively, the main observationalproperties of the system, the leo ring is consistent with being a collisionalring. it is thus likely another example of extended intergalactic gas made-upof pre-enriched collisional debris.

1007.2059	early-type galaxies in different environments: an hi view	we present an analysis of deep wsrt observations of the hi in 33 nearbyearly-type galaxies selected from a sample studied earlier at opticalwavelengths with the sauron integral-field spectrograph. the sample covers bothfield environments and the virgo cluster. our analysis shows that gas accretionplays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so forthose in clusters. for detection limits of a few times 10^6 msun, hi isdetected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while &lt;10% of the virgo objectsare detected. in about half of the detections, the hi forms a regularlyrotating disc or ring. all hi discs have counterparts of ionised gas and innerhi discs are also detected in molecular gas. the cold ism is dominated bymolecular gas (m_h2/m_hi ~ 10). we conclude that accretion of hi is common forfield early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usuallysmall. cluster galaxies appear not to accrete hi. the few galaxies with asignificant young sub-population all have inner gas discs, but for theremaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and hi. someearly-type galaxies are very gas rich, but only have an old population. thestellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those invirgo. this is likely related to differences in accretion history. in about 50%of the galaxies we detect a central continuum source. in many objects thisemission is from a low-luminosity agn, in some it is consistent with theobserved star formation. galaxies with hi in the central regions are morelikely detected in continuum. this is due to a higher probability for starformation to occur in such galaxies and not to hi-related agn fuelling.(abridged)

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1201.1503	strong molecular hydrogen emission and kinematics of the multiphase gas  in radio galaxies with fast jet-driven outflows	observations of ionized and neutral gas outflows in radio-galaxies (rgs)suggest that agn radio jet feedback has a galaxy-scale impact on the host ism,but it is still unclear how the molecular gas is affected. we present deepspitzer irs spectroscopy of 8 rgs that show fast hi outflows. all of thesehi-outflow rgs have bright h2 mid-ir lines that cannot be accounted for by uvor x-ray heating. this suggests that the radio jet, which drives the hioutflow, is also responsible for the shock-excitation of the warm h2 gas. inaddition, the warm h2 gas does not share the kinematics of the ionized/neutralgas. the mid-ir ionized gas lines are systematically broader than the h2 lines,which are resolved by the irs (with fwhm up to 900km/s) in 60% of the detectedh2 lines. in 5 sources, the neii line, and to a lesser extent the neiii and nevlines, exhibit blue-shifted wings (up to -900km/s with respect to the systemicvelocity) that match the kinematics of the outflowing hi or ionized gas. the h2lines do not show broad wings, except tentative detections in 3 sources. thisshows that, contrary to the hi gas, the h2 gas is inefficiently coupled to theagn jet-driven outflow of ionized gas. while the dissipation of a smallfraction (&lt;10%) of the jet kinetic power can explain the dynamical heating ofthe molecular gas, our data show that the bulk of the warm molecular gas is notexpelled from these galaxies.

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1205.5694	continuum halos in nearby galaxies -- an evla survey (chang-es) -- i:  introduction to the survey	we introduce a new survey to map the radio continuum halos of a sample of 35edge-on spiral galaxies at 1.5 ghz and 6 ghz in all polarization products. thesurvey is exploiting the new wide bandwidth capabilities of the karl g. janskyvery large array (i.e. the expanded very large array, or evla) in a variety ofarray configurations (b, c, and d) in order to compile the most comprehensivedata set yet obtained for the study of radio halo properties. this is the firstsurvey of radio halos to include all polarization products.  in this first paper, we outline the scientific motivation of the survey, thespecific science goals, and the expected improvements in noise levels andspatial coverage from the survey. our goals include investigating the physicalconditions and origin of halos, characterizing cosmic ray transport and windspeed, measuring faraday rotation and mapping the magnetic field, probing thein-disk and extraplanar far-infrared - radio continuum relation, andreconciling non-thermal radio emission with high-energy gamma-ray models. thesample size allows us to search for correlations between radio halos and otherproperties, including environment, star formation rate, and the presence ofagns. in a companion paper (paper ii) we outline the data reduction steps andpresent the first results of the survey for the galaxy, ngc 4631.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1207.4348	recurrent radio emission and gas supply: the case of the radio galaxy b2  0258+35	outlined is the discovery of a very faint, diffuse, low surface-brightness(0.5 \mjybeam, 1.4 \mjyarcminsq on average) structure around the radio sourceb2 0258+35 hosted by an hi-rich early-type galaxy (ngc 1167). since b2 0258+35is a young compact steep spectrum (css) source, the newly discovered structurecould represent a remnant from an earlier stage of agn activity.  we go on by explaining in detail all the possibilities for triggering theradio activity in b2 0258+35 regarding gas accretion in a recurrent agnactivity framework.  ngc 1167 hosts a very regular, extended and massive \hi\ disc that has beenstudied in great detail. previous studies of the \hi\ closer to the core seemto go against the assumption of a circum-nuclear disc of \hi\ as the source ofthe accreting gas.  we consider the cooling of gas from the hot, x-ray halo as a possiblealternative option for the fueling of the agn, as suggested in the case ofother sources of similar radio power as b2 0258+35.  estimates are given for the age of the faint diffuse emission as well as forthe current accretion rate, which are in good agreement with literature values.  if our assumptions about the accretion mechanism are correct, similarlarge-scale, relic-like structures should be more commonly found aroundearly-type galaxies and this will be hopefully confirmed by the next generationof sensitive, low-frequency radio surveys.

0711.3232	is ngc 3108 transforming itself from an early to late type galaxy -- an  astronomical hermaphrodite?	a common feature of hierarchical galaxy formation models is the process of"inverse" morphological transformation: a bulge dominated galaxy accretes a gasdisk, dramatically reducing the system's bulge-to-disk mass ratio. during theirformation, present day galaxies may execute many such cycles across the hubblediagram. a good candidate for such a "hermaphrodite" galaxy is ngc 3108: adust-lane early-type galaxy which has a large amount of hi gas distributed in alarge scale disk. we present narrow band h_alpha and r-band imaging, andcompare the results with the hi distribution. the emission is in twocomponents: a nuclear bar and an extended disk component which coincides withthe hi distribution. this suggests that a stellar disk is currently beingformed out of the hi gas. the spatial distributions of the h_alpha and hiemission and the hii regions are consistent with a barred spiral structure,extending some 20 kpc in radius. we measure an extinction- corrected sfr of0.42 msun/yr. the luminosity function of the hii regions is similar to otherspiral galaxies, with a power law index of -2.1, suggesting that the starformation mechanism is similar to other spiral galaxies. we measured thecurrent disk mass and find that it is too massive to have been formed by thecurrent sfr over the last few gyr. it is likely that the sfr in ngc 3108 washigher in the past. with the current sfr, the disk in ngc 3108 will grow to be~6.2x10^9 msun in stellar mass within the next 5.5 gyr. while this issubstantial, the disk will be insignificant compared with the large bulge mass:the final stellar mass disk-to-bulge ratio will be ~0.02. ngc 3108 will fail totransform into anything resembling a spiral without a boost in the sfr andadditional supply of gas.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

1302.2236	tracing the extreme interplay between radio jets and the ism in ic5063	we report the discovery with the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex) of anoutflow of molecular gas in the radio-loud seyfert galaxy ic5063 (z = 0.0110).in addition to the emission of the large-scale co disk, a prominent blueshiftedwing is observed in the co(2-1) spectrum. ic5063 represents one of the bestcases of a fast jet-driven hi (and ionized gas) outflow, which is located atthe site of a radio-bright feature about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus. it ispossible that the blueshifted part of the molecular gas is associated with thisoutflow and is accelerated by the interaction with the radio jet. the outflowof molecular gas is characterized by an h$_2$ mass of the outflowing componentof between 2.25 +/- 0.70 x 10^7 m_sun and 1.29 +/- 0.40 x 10^8 m_sun and a massoutflow rate between 22 and 129 m_sun/yr depending on the assumption foralpha_x and assuming a luminosity ratio l'_co(2-1)/l'_co(1-0) = 1. thisconfirms that this may indeed be the dominant component in outflows driven bythe nuclear activity that are also found in other objects. however, this highmass outflow rate cannot easily be supported for a long time, suggesting thatthe gas outflow in ic5063 happens in bursts and is in a particularly strongphase at present. owing to its proximity, ic5063 serves as an excellentlaboratory for understanding the impact of radio jets on the gas-richinter-stellar medium.

1303.2659	a pilot for a vla hi deep field	high-resolution 21-cm hi deep fields provide spatially and kinematicallyresolved neutral gas maps at different redshifts, which are key tounderstanding galaxy evolution across cosmic time and testing predictions ofcosmological simulations. here we present results from a pilot for the cosmoshi large extragalactic survey (chiles) done with the karl g. jansky very largearray (vla). we take advantage of the newly expanded capabilities of thetelescope to probe the redshift interval 0&lt;z&lt;0.193 in one observation. weobserve the cosmos field for 50 hours, which contains 413 galaxies with opticalspectroscopic redshifts in the imaged field of view of 34' x 34' and theobserved redshift interval. we have detected neutral hydrogen gas in 33galaxies in different environments spanning the probed redshift range,including three without a previously known spectroscopic redshift. thedetections have a range of hi and stellar masses, indicating the diversity ofgalaxies we are probing. we discuss the observations, data reduction, resultsand highlight interesting detections. we find that the vla's b-array is theideal configuration for hi deep fields since its long spacings mitigate rfi.this pilot shows that the vla is ready to carry out such a survey, and servesas a test for future hi deep fields planned with other ska pathfinders.

1303.3538	the bluedisks project, a study of unusually hi-rich galaxies: i. hi  sizes and morphology	we introduce the "bluedisk" project, a large program at the westerborksynthesis radio telescope (wsrt) that has mapped the hi in a sample of 23nearby galaxies with unusually high hi mass fractions, along with asimilar-sized sample of control galaxies matched in stellar mass, size,inclination and redshift. this paper presents the sample selection,observational set-up, data reduction strategy, and a first analysis of thesizes and structural properties of the hi disks. we find that the hi-richgalaxies lie on the same hi mass versus hi size relation as normal spiralgalaxies, extending it to total hi masses of $2 \times 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ andradii r1 of $\sim 100$ kpc (where r1 is defined as the radius where the hicolumn density reaches 1 $m_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). hi-rich galaxies havesignificantly larger values of hi-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass,concentration index, stellar and star formation rate surface density comparedto the control sample. the disks of hi-rich galaxies are also significantlymore clumpy (i.e. have higher hi gini and $\delta$area coefficient) than thoseof normal spirals. there is no evidence that the disks of hi-rich galaxies aremore disturbed: hi-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to controlsamples in their distributions of hi asymmetry indices or optical/hi diskposition angle differences. in fact, the center of the hi distributioncorresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in the hi-richgalaxies than in the controls. all these results argue against a scenario inwhich new gas has been brought in by mergers. it is possible that they may bemore consistent with cooling from a surrounding quasi-static halo of warm/hotgas.

1305.4973	the atlas3d project -- xxiii. angular momentum and nuclear surface  brightness profiles	[abridged and edited] we investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 atlas3dgalaxies for which the hubble space telescope (hst) imaging is available andcompare them to the large scale kinematics obtained with the sauronintegral-field spectrograph. specific angular momentum, lambda_r, correlateswith the shape of nuclear light profiles, where cores are typically found inslow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. cores are found only inmassive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass m&gt;8x10^10 msun.based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution ofnuclear slopes. the best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellarvelocity dispersion within an effective radius, sigma_e, and specific angularmomentum, where cores are found for lambda_r&lt;0.25 and sigma_e&gt;160 km/s. weestimate that only about 10% of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores.furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators withcores. we also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematicallyand dynamically different from core slow rotators. the cores of fast rotatorscould harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, buttypically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. core-lessgalaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are under-luminous in thediffuse x-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high x-rayluminosities. we postulate a possible population of core-less galaxies amongslow rotators, which can not be explained as face-on discs, but comprise agenuine sub-population of slow rotators. these galaxies are typically lessmassive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamicalcold structures and exponential photometric components. we discuss possibleprocesses for formation of cores and their subsequent preservation.

1307.4535	the location and impact of jet-driven outflows of cold gas: the case of  3c293	the nearby radio galaxy 3c293 is one of a small group of objects whereextreme outflows of neutral hydrogen have been detected. however, due to thelimited spatial resolution of previous observations, the exact location of theoutflow was not able to be determined. in this letter, we present new higherresolution vla observations of the central regions of this radio source anddetect a fast outflow of hi with a fwzi velocity of \delta v~1200 km/sassociated with the inner radio jet, approximately 0.5 kpc west of the centralcore. we investigate possible mechanisms which could produce the observed hioutflow and conclude that it is driven by the radio-jet. however, this outflowof neutral hydrogen is located on the opposite side of the nucleus to theoutflow of ionised gas previously detected in this object. we calculate a massoutflow rate in the range of 8-50 solar masses/yr corresponding to a kineticenergy power injected back into the ism of 1.38x10^{42} - 1.00x10^{43} erg/s or0.01 - 0.08 percent of the eddington luminosity. this places it just outsidethe range required by some galaxy evolution simulations for negative feedbackfrom the agn to be effective in halting star-formation within the galaxy.

1307.6368	hi in ho: hoag's object revisited	we present new hi observations of hoag's object obtained with the westerborksynthesis radio telescope (wsrt). the data show that the luminous optical ringaround the elliptical body has a bright hi counterpart that shares thekinematical properties of the optical ring. the entire hi structure is twice aslarge as the optical ring and shows a mild warp in its outer regions relativeto the inner ring. we detect two additional hi sources close in redshift tothat of hoag's object, and report on a newly identified sdss optical companiongalaxy. the hi sources are ~0.3 and ~1 mpc away in projected distance, and thecompanion galaxy is also ~1 mpc away. our main conclusion is that the hidetected in hoag's object shows no indication that this galaxy has experienceda recent (less than ~1 gyr ago) accretion event. at least one of the twoadditional hi detected objects does not have an optical counterpart. onepossibility is that this object is an hi filament left over from an interactionshaping hoag's object, in which case this interaction must also have occurredat least 1-2 gyr ago.

1308.1462	neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) gas evolution in field galaxies at z ~ 0.1  and 0.2	we measure the neutral atomic hydrogen (hi) gas content of field galaxies atintermediate redshifts of z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 0.2 using hydrogen 21-cm emissionlines observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt). in orderto make high signal-to-noise ratio detections, an hi signal stacking techniqueis applied: hi emission spectra from multiple galaxies, optically selected bythe cnoc2 redshift survey project, are co-added to measure the average hi massof galaxies in the two redshift bins. we calculate the cosmic hi gas densities({\omega}_{hi}) at the two redshift regimes and compare those with measurementsat other redshifts to investigate the global evolution of the hi gas densityover cosmic time. from a total of 59 galaxies at z ~ 0.1 we find {\omega}_{hi}= (0.33 $\pm$ 0.05) ~ $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, and at z ~ 0.2 we find {\omega}_{hi}= (0.34 $\pm$ 0.09) ~ $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, based on 96 galaxies. thesemeasurements help bridge the gap between high-z damped lyman-$\alpha$observations and blind 21-cm surveys at $z=$ 0. we find that our measurementsof {\omega}_{hi} at z ~ 0.1 and 0.2 are consistent with the hi gas density at z~ 0 and that all measurements of {\omega}_{hi} from 21-cm emission observationsat $z \la$ ~ 0.2 are in agreement with no evolution of the hi gas content ingalaxies during the last 2.4 gyr.

0801.4769	cold gas &amp; mergers: fundamental difference in hi properties of different  types of radio galaxies?	we present results of a study of large-scale neutral hydrogen (hi) gas innearby radio galaxies. we find that the early-type host galaxies of differenttypes of radio sources (compact, fr-i and fr-ii) appear to containfundamentally different large-scale hi properties: enormous regular rotatingdisks and rings are present around the host galaxies of a significant fractionof low power compact radio sources, while no large-scale hi is detected in lowpower, edge-darkened fr-i radio galaxies. preliminary results of a study ofnearby powerful, edge-brightened fr-ii radio galaxies show that these systemsgenerally contain significant amounts of large-scale hi, often distributed intail- or bridge-like structures, indicative of a recent galaxy merger orcollision. our results suggest that different types of radio galaxies may havea different formation history, which could be related to a difference in thetriggering mechanism of the radio source. if confirmed by larger studies withthe next generation radio telescopes, this would be in agreement with previousoptical studies that suggest that powerful fr-ii radio sources are likelytriggered by galaxy mergers and collisions, while the lower power fr-i sourcesare fed in other ways (e.g. through the accretion of hot igm). the giant hidisks/rings associated with some compact sources could - at least in some cases- be the relics of much more advanced mergers.

1311.6469	ngc1266 as a local candidate for rapid cessation of star formation	we present new spectrographic areal unit for research on optical nebulae(sauron) integral-field spectroscopy and swift ultraviolet optical telescope(uvot) observations of molecular outflow host galaxy ngc 1266 that indicate ngc1266 has experienced a rapid cessation of star formation. both the sauron mapsof stellar population age and the swift uvot observations demonstrate thepresence of young ($&lt; 1$ gyr) stellar populations within the central 1 kpc,while existing combined array for research in millimeter-wave astronomy (carma)co(1--0) maps indicate that the sites of current star formation are constrainedto the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy only. the optical spectrum ofngc 1266 from moustakas &amp; kennicutt (2006) reveal a characteristicpost-starburst (k+a) stellar population and davis et al. (2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1401.3180	the atlas3d project - xxvi. hi discs in real and simulated fast and slow  rotators	one quarter of all nearby early-type galaxies (etgs) outside virgo host adisc/ring of hi with size from a few to tens of kpc and mass up to ~1e+9 solarmasses. here we investigate whether this hi is related to the presence of astellar disc within the host making use of the classification of etgs in fastand slow rotators (fr/sr). we find a large diversity of hi masses andmorphologies within both families. surprisingly, srs are detected as often,host as much hi and have a similar rate of hi discs/rings as frs. accretion ofhi is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. theweak relation between hi and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequentkinematical misalignment in frs, including cases of polar and counterrotatinggas. in srs the hi is usually polar. this complex picture highlights adiversity of etg formation histories which may be lost in the relativesimplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outerregions.  we find that lcdm hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducingthe hi properties of etgs. the gas discs formed in simulations are either toomassive or too small depending on the star formation feedback implementation.kinematical misalignments match the observations only qualitatively. the mainpoint of conflict is that nearly all simulated frs and a large fraction of allsimulated srs host corotating hi. this establishes the hi properties of etgs asa novel challenge to simulations.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1408.1099	the atlas3d project - xxiv. the intrinsic shape distribution of  early-type galaxies	we use the atlas3d sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes ofearly-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric andkinematic data. based on our ellipticity measurements from the sloan digitalsky survey data release 7, and additional imaging from the isaac newtontelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotatorsunder the assumption of axisymmetry. the so-obtained intrinsic shapedistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a gaussian with a meanflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additionaltail towards rounder shapes. the slow rotators are much rounder, and are welldescribed with a gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. we then checkedthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independentmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observedellipticity distributions directly using gaussian parametrisations for theintrinsic axis ratios. although both fast and slow rotators are identified asearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shapestudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions aresignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. theintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with thespiral galaxy population. including the observed kinematic misalignment in ourintrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantlyaxisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. for the slow rotatorsthough there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.

1410.0981	the atlas3d project -- xxix. the new look of early-type galaxies and  surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images	galactic archeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct thepast mass assembly of local group galaxies. the development of new observingtechniques and data-reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field ofview cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxiesexploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (lsb) light. as part of theatlas3d project, we have obtained with the megacam camera at the canada-francehawaii telescope extremely deep, multi--band, images of nearby early-typegalaxies. we present here a catalog of 92 galaxies from the atlas3d sample,that are located in low to medium density environments. the observing strategyand data reduction pipeline, that achieve a gain of several magnitudes in thelimiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, arepresented. the size and depth of the survey is compared to other recent deepimaging projects. the paper highlights the capability of lsb--optimized surveysat detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology ofgalaxies. the intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are alsodiscussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar halos of galaxies byextended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from galactic dust. thedetection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present andpast mass assembly of etgs is one of the prime goals of the project. we providespecific examples of each type of observed structures -- tidal tails, stellarstreams and shells --, and explain how they were identified and classified. wegive an overview of the initial results. the detailed statistical analysis willbe presented in future papers.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1505.01052	neutral hydrogen absorption towards fast radio bursts	if fast radio bursts (frbs) are truly at astronomical, in particularcosmological, distances, they represent one of the most exciting discoveries inastrophysics of the past decade. however, the distance to frbs has, to date,been estimated purely from their excess dispersion, and has not beencorroborated by any independent means. in this paper we discuss the possibilityof detecting neutral hydrogen absorption against frbs both from spiral armswithin our own galaxy, or from intervening extragalactic hi clouds. in eithercase a firm lower limit on the distance to the frb would be established.absorption against galactic spiral arms may already be detectable for brightlow-latitude bursts with existing facilities, and should certainly be so by thesquare kilometre array (ska). absorption against extragalactic hi clouds, whichwould confirm the cosmological distances of frbs, should also be detectablewith the ska, and maybe also arecibo. quantitatively, we estimate that ska1-midshould be able to detect extragalactic hi absorption against a few percent offrbs at a redshift z~1.

1505.07190	the fast molecular outflow in the seyfert galaxy ic5063 as seen by alma	we use high-resolution (0.5 arcsec) co(2-1) observations performed with almato trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the seyfert 2 galaxy ic5063. afast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet, with thehighest outflow velocities about 0.5kpc from the nucleus, at the location ofthe brighter hot-spot in the w lobe. the data show that a massive, fast outflowwith velocities up to 650 km/s of cold molecular gas is present, in addition toone detected earlier in warm h2, hi and ionised gas. both the central agn andthe radio jet could energetically drive the outflow. however, thecharacteristics of the outflowing gas point to the radio jet being the maindriver. this is important, because ic5063, although one of the most powerfulseyfert galaxies, is a relatively weak radio source (p = 3x10^23 w/hz). all theobserved characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jetexpanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds andinflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium.this model is consistent with results obtained by recent simulations such asthose of wagner et al.. a stronger, direct interaction between the jet and agas cloud is present at the location of the brighter w lobe. even assuming themost conservative values for the conversion factor co-to-h2, the mass of theoutflowing gas is between 1.9 and 4.8x10^7 msun. these amounts are much largerthan those of the outflow of warm gas (molecular and ionized) and somewhatlarger than of the hi outflow. this suggests that most of the observed coldmolecular outflow is due to fast cooling after being shocked. this gas is theend product of the cooling process. our co observations demonstrate that fastoutflows of molecular gas can be driven by relativistic jets.

1506.04473	hi science with the square kilometre array	the square kilometre array (ska) will be a formidable instrument for thedetailed study of neutral hydrogen (hi) in external galaxies and in our owngalaxy and local group. the sensitivity of the ska, its wide receiver bands,and the relative freedom from radio frequency interference at the ska siteswill allow the imaging of substantial number of high-redshift galaxies in hifor the first time. it will also allow imaging of galaxies throughout the localvolume at resolutions of &lt;100 pc and detailed investigations of galaxy disksand the transition between disks, halos and the intergalactic medium (igm) inthe milky way and external galaxies. together with deep optical andmillimetre/sub-mm imaging, this will have a profound effect on ourunderstanding of the formation, growth and subsequent evolution of galaxies indifferent environments. this paper provides an introductory text to a series ofnine science papers describing the impact of the ska in the field of hi andgalaxy evolution. we propose a nested set of surveys with phase 1 of the skawhich will help tackle much of the exciting science described. longer commensalsurveys are discussed, including an ultra-deep survey which should permit thedetection of galaxies at z=2, when the universe was a quarter of its currentage. the full ska will allow more detailed imaging of even more distantgalaxies, and allow cosmological and evolutionary parameters to be measuredwith exquisite precision.

1506.08822	neutral hydrogen gas, past and future star-formation in galaxies in and  around the 'sausage' merging galaxy cluster	ciza j2242.8+5301 ($z = 0.188$, nicknamed 'sausage') is an extremely massive($m_{200}\sim 2.0 \times 10^{15}m_\odot$ ), merging cluster with shock wavestowards its outskirts, which was found to host numerous emission-line galaxies.we performed extremely deep westerbork synthesis radio telescope hiobservations of the 'sausage' cluster to investigate the effect of the mergerand the shocks on the gas reservoirs fuelling present and future star formation(sf) in cluster members. by using spectral stacking, we find that theemission-line galaxies in the 'sausage' cluster have, on average, as much higas as field galaxies (when accounting for the fact cluster galaxies are moremassive than the field galaxies), contrary to previous studies. since thecluster galaxies are more massive than the field spirals, they may have beenable to retain their gas during the cluster merger. the large hi reservoirs areexpected to be consumed within $\sim0.75-1.0$ gyr by the vigorous sf and agnactivity and/or driven out by the out-flows we observe. we find that thestar-formation rate in a large fraction of h$\alpha$ emission-line clustergalaxies correlates well with the radio broad band emission, tracing supernovaremnant emission. this suggests that the cluster galaxies, all located inpost-shock regions, may have been undergoing sustained sfr for at least 100myr. this fully supports the interpretation proposed by stroe et al. (2015) andsobral et al. (2015) that gas-rich cluster galaxies have been triggered to formstars by the passage of the shock.

1510.06498	jet-driven outflows of ionised gas in the nearby radio galaxy 3c293	fast outflows of gas, driven by the interaction between the radio-jets andism of the host galaxy, are being observed in an increasing number of galaxies.one such example is the nearby radio galaxy 3c293. in this paper we presentintegral field unit (ifu) observations taken with oasis on the william herscheltelescope (wht), enabling us to map the spatial extent of the ionised gasoutflows across the central regions of the galaxy. the jet-driven outflow in3c293 is detected along the inner radio lobes with a mass outflow rate rangingfrom $\sim 0.05-0.17$ solar masses/yr (in ionised gas) and correspondingkinetic power of $\sim 0.5-3.5\times 10^{40}$ erg/s. investigating thekinematics of the gas surrounding the radio jets (i.e. not directly associatedwith the outflow), we find line-widths broader than $300$ km/s up to 5 kpc inthe radial direction from the nucleus (corresponding to 3.5 kpc in thedirection perpendicular to the radio axis at maximum extent). along the axis ofthe radio jet line-widths $&gt;400$ km/s are detected out to 7 kpc from thenucleus and line-widths of $&gt;500$ km/s at a distance of 12 kpc from thenucleus, indicating that the disturbed kinematics clearly extend well beyondthe high surface brightness radio structures of the jets. this is suggestive ofthe cocoon structure seen in simulations of jet-ism interaction and impliesthat the radio jets are capable of disturbing the gas throughout the centralregions of the host galaxy in all directions.

astro-ph;0110369	a new, kinematically anomalous hi component in the spiral galaxy ngc  2403	we discuss new, high sensitivity hi observations of the spiral galaxy ngc2403which show extended emission at anomalous velocities with respect to the `cold'disk. this `anomalous' gas component (~1/10 of the total hi mass) is probablylocated in the region of the halo and rotates more slowly (~20-50 km/s) thanthe gas in the disk. moreover, it shows a distortion in the velocity field thatwe interpret as a large-scale radial motion (10-20 km/s inflow) towards thecentre of the galaxy. the most likely explanation for its origin and kinematicsseems to be that of a galactic fountain. there is, however, a significant partof the anomalous gas which seems to be moving contrary to rotation and isdifficult to understand in such a picture. these anomalous gas complexesdiscovered in ngc 2403 may be analogous to the high velocity clouds of ourgalaxy. they may be rather common in spiral galaxies and not have been detectedyet for lack of sensitivity.

astro-ph;0203405	deep h i survey of the spiral galaxy ngc 2403	high sensitivity h i observations of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 2403obtained with the vla are presented and discussed. the properties of theextended, differentially rotating h i layer with its h i holes, spiralstructure and outer warp are described. in addition, these new data reveal thepresence of a faint, extended and kinematically anomalous component. this showsup in the h i line profiles as extended wings of emission towards the systemicvelocity. in the central regions these wings are very broad (up to 150 km/s)and indicate large deviations from circular motion. we have separated theanomalous gas component from the cold disk and have obtained for it a separatevelocity field and a separate rotation curve. the mass of the anomalouscomponent is 1/10 of the total h i mass. the rotation velocity of the anomalousgas is 25-50 km/s lower than that of the disk. its velocity field hasnon-orthogonal major and minor axes that we interpret as due to an overallinflow motion of 10-20 km/s towards the centre of the galaxy. the pictureemerging from these observations is that of a cold h i disk surrounded by athick and clumpy h i layer characterized by slower rotation and inflow motiontowards the center. the origin of this anomalous gas layer is unclear. it islikely, however, that it is related to the high rate of star formation in thedisk of ngc 2403 and that its kinematics is the result of a galactic fountaintype of mechanism. we suggest that these anomalous h i complexes may beanalogous to a part of the high velocity clouds of our galaxy.

astro-ph;0309477	hi on large and small scales in starburst radio galaxies	the study of the optical continuum of radio galaxies shows that about 30%have a young stellar population component. among them are the most far-irbright radio galaxies. a further indication of the relatively gas richenvironment of these galaxies (possibly related to the recent merger from whichthey originate) is the high fraction being detected in hi. here we presentrecent results obtained from the study of neutral hydrogen (detected either inemission or absorption) in a group of starburst radio galaxies. in someobjects, large-scale (tens of kpc) structures involving hi masses exceeding10^9 m_sun are observed. in these cases, the hi can be used to study the originand evolution of these systems and the timescales involved. in this respect,the parameters obtained from the study of the stellar populations and from thehi can be complementary. in other objects, very broad (&gt; 1000 km/s), mostlyblueshifted hi is detected in absorption. this result shows that, despite theextremely energetic phenomena occurring near an agn - including the powerfulradio jet - some of the outflowing gas remains, or becomes again, neutral. thiscan give new and important insights in the physical conditions of the gaseousmedium around an agn. the possible origin of the extreme kinematics isdiscussed.

0705.4034	the cold gaseous halo of ngc 891	we present hi observations of the edge-on galaxy ngc 891. these are among thedeepest ever performed on an external galaxy. they reveal a huge gaseous halo,much more extended than seen previously and containing almost 30 % of the hi.this hi halo shows structures on various scales. on one side, there is afilament extending (in projection) up to 22 kpc vertically from the disk. small(m_hi ~ 10^6 msol) halo clouds, some with forbidden (apparentlycounter-rotating) velocities, are also detected. the overall kinematics of thehalo gas is characterized by differential rotation lagging with respect to thatof the disk. the lag, more pronounced at small radii, increases with heightfrom the plane. there is evidence that a significant fraction of the halo isdue to a galactic fountain. accretion from intergalactic space may also play arole in building up the halo and providing low angular momentum material neededto account for the observed rotation lag. the long hi filament and thecounter-rotating clouds may be direct evidence of such accretion.

astro-ph;0505397	a large hi cloud near the centre of the virgo cluster	we report the discovery of a large hi cloud in the central regions of thevirgo cluster. it is 110 x 25 kpc in size and contains 3.4 x 10^8 msol of hi.the morphology and kinematics of this cloud strongly suggest that it consistsof hi removed from the galaxy ngc 4388 by ram-pressure stripping. it is morelikely the result of an interaction of the ism of ngc 4388 with the hot halo ofthe m86 group and not with the icm centred on m87. the large extent of theplume suggests that gas stripped from cluster galaxies can remain neutral forat least 10^8 yr. locally, the column density is well above 10^20 cm^-2,suggesting that the intra-cluster hii regions known to exist in virgo may haveformed from gas stripped from cluster galaxies. the existence of the hi plumesuggests that stripping of infalling spirals contributes to the enrichment ofthe icm. the hi object in the virgo cluster recently reported by minchin et al.may have a similar origin and may therefore not be a ``dark galaxy''.

astro-ph;0604557	minkowski's object: a starburst triggered by a radio jet, revisited	we present neutral hydrogen, ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging,and optical spectroscopy, of minkowski's object (mo), a star forming peculiargalaxy near ngc 541. the observations strengthen evidence that star formationin mo was triggered by the radio jet from ngc 541. key new results are thediscovery of a 4.9e8 solar mass double hi cloud straddling the radio jetdownstream from mo, where the jet changes direction and decollimates; strongdetections of mo, also showing double structure, in uv and h-alpha; andnumerous hii regions and associated clusters in mo. in uv, mo resembles theradio-aligned, rest-frame uv morphologies in many high redshift radio galaxies(hzrgs), also thought to be caused by jet-induced star formation. mo's stellarpopulation is dominated by a 7.5 myr-old, 1.9e7 solar mass instantaneous burst,with current star formation rate 0.52 solar masses per year (concentratedupstream from where the hi column density is high). this is unlike thejet-induced star formation in centaurus a, where the jet interacts withpre-existing cold gas; in mo the hi may have cooled out of a warmer, clumpyintergalactic or interstellar medium as a result of jet interaction, followedby collapse of the cooling clouds and subsequent star formation (consistentwith numerical simulations). since the radio source that triggered starformation in mo is much less luminous, and therefore more common, than powerfulhzrgs, and because the environment around mo is not particularly special interms of abundant dense, cold gas, jet-induced star formation in the earlyuniverse might be even more prevalent than previously thought.

astro-ph;0610114	the westerbork sings survey: i. overview and image atlas	we have obtained moderately deep radio continuum imaging at 18 and 22cm withthe westerbork array of 34 nearby galaxies drawn from the spitzer sings andstarburst samples to enable complimentary analysis. the sub-sample have anoptical major axis diameter in excess of 5 arcmin and are north of declination12.5 deg. sub-sample galaxies span a very wide range of morphological types andstar formation rates. resolved detection was possible for every galaxy. thisconstitutes a first time detection at ghz radio frequencies for about half ofthe sample. analysis of both total intensity and polarization properties of thesample will be published in companion papers. both the hi and oh main-lines ofthe target galaxies were within the observed band-pass, albeit with only coarsevelocity resolution. only two low mass elliptical galaxies were undetected inhi. four of the sub-sample galaxies were detected in oh main-line absorption,including two new detections. the results are presented in the form of an imageatlas for which a standard transfer function and image size are used throughoutand whereby the radio continuum, dss optical and integrated hi are displayedside-by-side. continuum and hi line photometry are tabulated for all targets.
