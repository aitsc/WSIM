0907.2392	superdense massive galaxies in wings local clusters	massive quiescent galaxies at z&gt;1 have been found to have small physicalsizes, hence to be superdense. several mechanisms, including minor mergers,have been proposed for increasing galaxy sizes from high- to low-z. we searchfor superdense massive galaxies in the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey(wings) of x-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07. we discover asignificant population of superdense massive galaxies with masses and sizescomparable to those observed at high redshift. they approximately represent 22%of all cluster galaxies more massive than 3x10^10msol, are mostly s0 galaxies,have a median effective radius &lt;re&gt; =1.61+/-0.29kpc, a median sersic index &lt;n&gt;= 3.0+/-0.6, and very old stellar populations with a median mass-weighted ageof 12.1+/-1.3gyr. we calculate a number density of 2.9x10^-2mpc^-3 forsuperdense galaxies in local clusters, and a hard lower limit of1.3x10^-5mpc^-3 in the whole comoving volume between z = 0.04 and z = 0.07. wefind a relation between mass, effective radius and luminosity-weighted age inour cluster galaxies, which can mimic the claimed evolution of the radius withredshift, if not properly taken into account. we compare our data withspectroscopic high-z surveys and find that -when stellar masses are considered-there is consistency with the local wings galaxy sizes out to z~2, while adiscrepancy of a factor of 3 exists with the only spectroscopic z&gt;2 study. incontrast, there is strong evidence for a large evolution in radius for the mostmassive galaxies with m*&gt;4x10^11msol compared to similarly massive galaxies inwings, i.e. the bcgs.

1001.2701	the shapes of bcgs and normal ellipticals in nearby clusters	we compare the apparent axial ratio distributions of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) and normal ellipticals (es) in our sample of 75 galaxy clustersfrom the wings survey. most bcgs in our clusters (69%) are classified as cdgalaxies. the sample of cds has been completed by 14 additional cds (non-bcgs)we found in our clusters. we find that: (i) es have triaxial shape, thetriaxiality sharing almost evenly the intrinsic axial ratios parameter space,with a weak preference for prolateness; (ii) the bcgs have triaxial shape aswell. however, their tendence towards prolateness is much stronger than in thecase of es. such a strong prolateness appears entirely due to the sizeable(dominant) component of cds inside the wings sample of bcgs. in fact, while the'normal'(non-cd) bcgs do not differ from es, as far as the shape distributionis concerned, the axial ratio distribution of bcg_cd galaxies is found tosupport quite prolate shapes; (iii) our result turns out to be strongly atvariance with the only similar, previous analysis by ryden et al.(1993)(rlp93),where bcgs and es were found to share the same axial ratio distribution; (iv)our data suggest that the above discrepancy is mainly caused by the differentcriteria that rlp93 and ourselves use to select the cluster samples, coupledwith a preference of cds to reside in powerful x-ray emitting clusters; (v) thegif2 n-body results suggest that the prolateness of the bcgs (in particular thecds) could reflect the shape of the associated dark matter halos.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1073	dissecting the cosmic infra-red background with herschel/pep	the constituents of the cosmic ir background (cib) are studied at its peakwavelengths (100 and 160 um) by exploiting herschel/pacs observations of thegoods-n, lockman hole, and cosmos fields in the pacs evolutionary probe (pep)guaranteed-time survey. the goods-n data reach 3 sigma depths of ~3.0 mjy at100 um and ~5.7 mjy at 160 um. at these levels, source densities are 40 and 18beams/source, respectively, thus hitting the confusion limit at 160 um.differential number counts extend from a few mjy up to 100-200 mjy, and areapproximated as a double power law, with the break lying between 5 and 10 mjy.the available ancillary information allows us to split number counts intoredshift bins. at z&lt;=0.5 we isolate a class of luminous sources (l(ir)~1e11lsun), whose seds resemble late-spiral galaxies, peaking at ~130 um restframeand significantly colder than what is expected on the basis of pre-herschelmodels. by integrating number counts over the whole covered flux range, weobtain a surface brightness of 6.36 +/- 1.67 and 6.58 +/-1.62 [nw m^-2 sr^-1]at 100 and 160 um, resolving ~45% and ~52% of the cib, respectively. whenstacking 24 um sources, the inferred cib lies within 1.1 sigma and 0.5 sigmafrom direct measurements in the two bands, and fractions increase to 50% and75%.most of this resolved cib fraction was radiated at z&lt;=1.0, with 160 umsources found at higher redshift than 100 um ones.

1005.1074	herschel pep: the star-formation rates of 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 massive galaxies	the star formation rate (sfr) is a key parameter in the study of galaxyevolution. the accuracy of sfr measurements at z~2 has been questionedfollowing a disagreement between observations and theoretical models. thelatter predict sfrs at this redshift that are typically a factor 4 or morelower than the measurements. we present star-formation rates based oncalorimetric measurements of the far-infrared (fir) luminosities for massive1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, normal star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which do not depend onextinction corrections and/or extrapolations of spectral energy distributions.the measurements are based on observations in goods-n with the photodetectorarray camera &amp; spectrometer (pacs) onboard herschel, as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) project, that resolve for the first time individualsfgs at these redshifts at fir wavelengths. we compare fir-based sfrs to themore commonly used 24 micron and uv sfrs. we find that sfrs from 24 micronalone are higher by a factor of ~4-7.5 than the true sfrs. this overestimationdepends on luminosity: gradually increasing for log l(24um)&gt;12.2 l_sun. thesfgs and agns tend to exhibit the same 24 micron excess. the uv sfrs are incloser agreement with the fir-based sfrs. using a calzetti uv extinctioncorrection results in a mean excess of up to 0.3 dex and a scatter of 0.35 dexfrom the fir sfrs. the previous uv sfrs are thus confirmed and the mean excess,while narrowing the gap, is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between theobserved sfrs and simulation predictions.

1005.1089	the first herschel view of the mass-sfr link in high-z galaxies	we exploit deep observations of the goods-n field taken with pacs, on boardof herschel, as part of the pep guaranteed time, to study the link between starformation and stellar mass in galaxies to z~2. starting from a stellarmass-selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag[4.5mu]&lt;23 (ab), we identify~350 objects with a pacs detection at 100 or 160mu and ~1500 with only spitzer24 mu counterpart. stellar masses and total ir luminosities (lir) are estimatedby fitting the seds. consistently with other herschel results, we find that lirbased only on 24 mu data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z~2,whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at0.5&lt;z&lt;1.0. we then exploit this calibration to correct lir based on the mipsfluxes. these results clearly show how herschel is fundamental to constrainlir, and hence the sfr, of high redshift galaxies. using the galaxies detectedwith pacs (and/or mips), we investigate the existence and evolution of therelations between the star formation rate (sfr), the specific star formationrate (ssfr=sfr/mass) and the stellar mass. moreover, in order to avoidselection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on thepacs images to fully exploit the far-ir information also for the herschel andspitzer undetected subsamples. we find that the ssfr-mass relation steepenswith redshift, being almost flat at z&lt;1.0 and reaching a slope ofalpha=-0.50^(+0.13)_(-0.16) at z~2, at odds with recent works based onradio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. the mean ssfr of galaxiesincreases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive m&gt;10^(11) (m_sun) galaxiesfrom z=0 to z=2, and seems to flatten at z&gt;1.5 in this mass range. moreover,the most massive galaxies have the lowest ssfr at any z, implying that theyhave formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low masscounterparts.

1005.1154	far-infrared properties of submillimeter and optically faint radio  galaxies	we use deep observations obtained with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs) onboard the herschel space observatory to study thefar-infrared (fir) properties of submm and optically faint radio galaxies (smgsand ofrgs). from literature we compiled a sample of 35 securely identified smgsand nine ofrgs located in the goods-n and the a2218 fields. this sample iscross-matched with our pacs 100 um and 160 um multi-wavelength catalogs. abouthalf of the galaxies in our sample are detected with pacs. the dusttemperatures and the infrared luminosities of our galaxies are derived byfitting their pacs and scuba 850 um (only the upper limits for the ofrgs) fluxdensities with a single modified (beta=1.5) black body function. the mediandust temperature of our smg sample is t=36+/-8k while for our ofrg sample it ist=47+/-3k. for both samples, median dust temperatures derived from herscheldata agree well with previous estimates. in particular, chapman et al. (2005)found a dust temperature of t=36+/-7k for a large sample of smgs assuming thevalidity of the fir/radio correlation. the agreement between our studiesconfirms that the local fir/radio correlation effectively holds at highredshift even though we find &lt;q&gt;=2.17+/-0.19, a slightly lower value than thatobserved in local systems. the median ir luminosities of smgs and ofrgs are4.6*10^12 lsun and 2.6*10^12 lsun, respectively. we note that for both samplesthe ir luminosity estimates from the radio part of the spectral energydistribution are accurate, while estimates from the mid-ir are considerably(x3) more uncertain. our observations confirm the remarkably high luminositiesof smgs and thus imply median star-formation rates of 960msun yr^-1 for smgswith s(850um)&gt;5mjy and 460msun yr^-1 for smgs with s(850um)&gt;2mjy, assuming achabrier imf and no dominant agn contribution to the far-infrared luminosity.

1005.1575	herschel deep far-infrared counts through the abell 2218 cluster-lens	gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters allows study of thepopulation of intrinsically faint infrared galaxies that lie below thesensitivity and confusion limits of current infrared and submillimetertelescopes. we present ultra-deep pacs 100 and 160 microns observations towardthe cluster lens abell 2218, to penetrate the herschel confusion limit. wederive source counts down to a flux density of 1 mjy at 100 microns and 2 mjyat 160 microns, aided by strong gravitational lensing. at these levels, sourcedensities are 20 and 10 beams/source in the two bands, approaching sourcedensity confusion at 160 microns. the slope of the counts below the turnover ofthe euclidean-normalized differential curve is constrained in both bands and isconsistent with most of the recent backwards evolutionary models. byintegrating number counts over the flux range accessed by abell 2218 lensing(0.94-35 mjy at 100 microns and 1.47-35 mjy at 160 microns, we retrieve acosmic infrared background (cib) surface brightness of ~8.0 and ~9.9 nw m^-2sr^-1, in the respective bands. these values correspond to 55% (+/- 24%) and77% (+/- 31%) of dirbe direct measurements. combining abell 2218 results withwider/shallower fields, these figures increase to 62% (+/- 25%) and 88% (+/-32%) cib total fractions, resolved at 100 and 160 microns, disregarding thehigh uncertainties of dirbe absolute values.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2562	star formation in agn hosts in goods-n	sensitive herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that wereinherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z agn hosts. combiningpacs 100 and 160um observations of the goods-n field with 2msec chandra data,we detect ~20% of x-ray agn individually at &gt;3sig. the host far-infraredluminosity of agn with l2-10~10^43erg/s increases with redshift by an order ofmagnitude from z=0 to z~1. in contrast, there is little dependence offar-infrared luminosity on agn luminosity, for l2-10&lt;~10^44erg/s agn at z&gt;~1.we do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on x-ray obscuringcolumn, for our sample which is dominated by l2-10&lt;10^44erg/s agn. inconjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z agn, we interpretthese results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of agn/hostcoevolution. a correlation of agn luminosity and host star formation is tracedlocally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high zagn. this correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging.for lower agn luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-activemassive galaxies and shows little dependence on agn luminosity. the level ofthis secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over thecorrelation at increasing redshift.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.5678	the dust content of high-z submillimeter galaxies revealed by herschel	we use deep observations taken with the photodetector array camera andspectrometer (pacs), on board the herschel satellite as part of the pacsevolutionary probe (pep) guaranteed project along with submm ground-basedobservations to measure the dust mass of a sample of high-z submillimetergalaxies (smgs). we investigate their dust content relative to their stellarand gas masses, and compare them with local star-forming galaxies. high-z smgsare dust rich, i.e. they have higher dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared tolocal spiral galaxies (by a factor of 30) and also compared to localultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs, by a factor of 6). this indicates thatthe large masses of gas typically hosted in smgs have already been highlyenriched with metals and dust. indeed, for those smgs whose gas mass ismeasured, we infer dust-to-gas ratios similar or higher than local spirals andulirgs. however, similarly to other strongly star-forming galaxies in the localuniverse and at high-z, smgs are characterized by gas metalicities lower (by afactor of a few) than local spirals, as inferred from their optical nebularlines, which are generally ascribed to infall of metal-poor gas. this is incontrast with the large dust content inferred from the far-ir and submm data.in short, the metalicity inferred from the dust mass is much higher (by morethan an order of magnitude) than that inferred from the optical nebular lines.we discuss the possible explanations of this discrepancy and the possibleimplications for the investigation of the metalicity evolution at high-z.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1007.3264	evolution of bcgs structural parameters in the last $\sim$6 gyr:  feedback processes versus merger events	we present results on the evolution in the last 6 gyr of the structuralparameters of two samples of brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). the nearbysample of bcgs consist on 69 galaxies from the wings survey spanning a redshiftrange of 0.04$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.07. the intermediate redshift (0.3$&lt;$z$&lt;$0.6) sample isformed by 20 bcgs extracted from the hubble space telescope archive. bothsamples have similar spatial resolution and their host clusters have similarx-ray luminosities. we report an increase in the size of the bcgs fromintermediate to local redshift. however, we do not detect any variation in thes\'ersic shape parameter in both samples. these results are proved to be robustsince the observed tendencies are model independent. we also obtain significantcorrelations between some of the bcgs parameters and the main properties of thehost clusters. more luminous, larger and centrally located bcgs are located inmore massive and dominant galaxy clusters. these facts indicate that the hostgalaxy cluster has played an important role in the formation of their bcgs. wediscuss the possible mechanisms that can explain the observed evolution of thestructural parameters of the bcgs. we conclude that the main mechanisms thatcan explain the increase in size and the non-evolution in the s\'ersic shapeparameter of the bcgs in the last 6 gyr are feedback processes. this resultdisagrees with semi-analytical simulation results supporting that mergingprocesses are the main responsible for the evolution of the bcgs until thepresent epoch.

1007.4447	superdense massive galaxies in the eso distant cluster survey (ediscs)	we find a significant number of massive and compact galaxies in clusters fromthe eso distant clusters survey (ediscs) at 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. they have similar stellarmasses, ages, sizes and axial ratios to local z~0.04 compact galaxies in wingsclusters, and to z=1.4-2 massive and passive galaxies found in the generalfield. if non-bcg cluster galaxies of all densities, morphologies and spectraltypes are considered, the median size of ediscs galaxies is only a factor 1.18smaller than in wings. we show that for morphologically selected samples, themorphological evolution taking place in a significant fraction of galaxiesduring the last gyrs may introduce an apparent, spurious evolution of size withredshift, which is actually due to intrinsic differences in the selectedsamples. we conclude that the median mass-size relation of cluster galaxiesdoes not evolve significantly from z~0.7 to z~0.04. in contrast, the masses andsizes of bcgs and galaxies with m*&gt;4x10^11 msun have significantly increased bya factor of 2 and 4, respectively, confirming the results of a number of recentworks on the subject. our findings show that progenitor bias effects play animportant role in the size-growth paradigm of massive and passive galaxies.

1012.5186	herschel-atlas: rapid evolution of dust in galaxies in the last 5  billion years	we present the first direct and unbiased measurement of the evolution of thedust mass function of galaxies over the past 5 billion years of cosmic historyusing data from the science demonstration phase of the herschel-atlas. thesample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\mu}m which have reliablecounterparts from sdss at z &lt; 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. dust masses arecalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectralenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperaturecomponents. the dust temperature for either model shows no trend with redshift.splitting the sample into bins of redshift reveals a strong evolution in thedust properties of the most massive galaxies. at z = 0.4 - 0.5, massivegalaxies had dust masses about five times larger than in the local universe. atthe same time, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio was about 3-4 times larger, andthe optical depth derived from fitting the uv-sub-mm data with an energybalance model was also higher. this increase in the dust content of massivegalaxies at high redshift is difficult to explain using standard dust evolutionmodels and requires a rapid gas consumption timescale together with either amore top-heavy imf, efficient mantle growth, less dust destruction orcombinations of all three. this evolution in dust mass is likely to beassociated with a change in overall ism mass, and points to an enhanced supplyof fuel for star formation at earlier cosmic epochs.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1103.3905	herschel-atlas: the link between accretion luminosity and star formation  in quasar host galaxies	we use the science demonstration field data of the herschel-atlas to studyhow star formation, traced by the far-infrared herschel data, is related toboth the accretion luminosity and redshift of quasars selected from the sloandigital sky survey and the 2slaq survey. by developing a maximum likelihoodestimator to investigate the presence of correlations between the far-infraredand optical luminosities we find evidence that the star-formation in quasarhosts is correlated with both redshift and quasar accretion luminosity.assuming a relationship of the form l_ir \propto l_qso^{\theta} (1 +z)^{\zeta}, we find {\theta} = 0.22 +/- 0.08 and {\zeta} = 1.6 +/- 0.4,although there is substantial additional uncertainty in {\zeta} of order +/- 1,due to uncertainties in the host galaxy dust temperature. we find evidence fora large intrinsic dispersion in the redshift dependence, but no evidence forintrinsic dispersion in the correlation between l_qso and l_ir, suggesting thatthe latter may be due to a direct physical connection between star formationand black hole accretion. this is consistent with the idea that both the quasaractivity and star formation are dependent on the same reservoir of cold gas, sothat they are both affected by the influx of cold gas during mergers or heatingof gas via feedback processes.

1105.3199	herschel-atlas: detection of a far-infrared population around galaxy  clusters	we report the detection of a significant excess in the surface density offar-infrared sources from the herschel-astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) within ~1 mpc of the centres of 66 optically-selected clustersof galaxies in the sdss with &lt;z&gt;~0.25. from the analysis of the multiwavelengthproperties of their counterparts we conclude that the far-infrared emission isassociated with dust-obscured star formation and/or active galactic nucleiwithin galaxies in the clusters themselves. the excess reaches a maximum at aradius of ~0.8 mpc, where we find 1.0\pm0.3 s_250um&gt;34 mjy sources on averageper cluster above what would be expected for random field locations. if thefar-infrared emission is dominated by star formation (as opposed to agn) thenthis corresponds to an average star formation rate of ~7 m_sun/yr per clusterin sources with l_ir&gt;5d10 l_sun. although lensed sources make a negligiblecontribution to the excess signal, a fraction of the sources around theclusters could be gravitationally lensed, and we have identified a sample ofpotential cases of cluster-lensed herschel sources that could be targeted infollow-up studies.

1105.3924	physical conditions of the interstellar medium of high-redshift,  strongly lensed submillimetre galaxies from the herschel-atlas	we present herschel-spire fourier transform spectrometer (fts) and radiofollow-up observations of two herschel-atlas (h-atlas) detected strongly lenseddistant galaxies. in one of the targeted galaxies h-atlas j090311.6+003906(sdp.81) we detect [oiii] 88\mum and [cii] 158\mum lines at a signal-to-noiseratio of ~5. we do not have any positive line identification in the otherfainter target h-atlas j091305.0-005343 (sdp.130). currently sdp.81 is thefaintest sub-mm galaxy with positive line detections with the fts, withcontinuum flux just below 200 mjy in the 200-600 \mum wavelength range. thederived redshift of sdp.81 from the two detections is z=3.043 +/-0.012, inagreement with ground-based co measurements. this is the first detection byherschel of the [oiii] 88\mum line in a galaxy at redshift higher than 0.05.comparing the observed lines and line ratios with a grid of photo-dissociationregion (pdr) models with different physical conditions, we derive the pdr clouddensity n ~ 2000 cm^{-3} and the far-uv ionizing radiation field g_0 ~ 200 (inunits of the habing field -- the local galactic interstellar radiation field of1.6x10^{-6} w/m^2). using the co derived molecular mass and the pdr propertieswe estimate the effective radius of the emitting region to be 500-700 pc. thesecharacteristics are typical for star-forming, high redshift galaxies. the radioobservations indicate that sdp.81 deviates significantly from the localfir/radio correlation, which hints that some fraction of the radio emission iscoming from an agn. the constraints on the source size from millimiter-waveobservations put a very conservative upper limit of the possible agncontribution to less than 33%. these indications, together with the high[oiii]/fir ratio and the upper limit of [oi] 63\mum/[cii] 158\mum suggest thatsome fraction of the ionizing radiation is likely to originate from an agn.

1106.6195	the environment and characteristics of low redshift galaxies detected by  the herschel-atlas	we investigate the ultraviolet and optical properties and environment of lowredshift galaxies detected in the herschel astrophysical terahertz large areasurvey (h-atlas) science demonstration data. we use the sloan digital skysurvey seventh release and the galaxy and mass assembly database to selectgalaxies with r_petro &lt; 19.0 mag in the redshift range 0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.2 and lookfor their submillimeter counterparts in h-atlas. our results show that at lowredshift, h-atlas detects mainly blue/star-forming galaxies with a minorcontribution from red systems which are highly obscured by dust. in addition wefind that the colour of a galaxy rather than the local density of itsenvironment determines whether it is detectable by h-atlas. the average dusttemperature of galaxies that are simultaneously detected by both pacs and spireis 25k \pm 4k, independent of environment. this analysis provides a glimpse ofthe potential of the h-atlas data to investigate the submillimeter propertiesof galaxies in the local universe.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1108.0933	the lesser role of starbursts for star formation at z=2	two main modes of star formation are know to control the growth of galaxies:a relatively steady one in disk-like galaxies, defining a tight star formationrate (sfr)-stellar mass sequence, and a starburst mode in outliers to such asequence which is generally interpreted as driven by merging. such starburstgalaxies are rare but have much higher sfrs, and it is of interest to establishthe relative importance of these two modes. pacs/herschel observations over thewhole cosmos and goods-south fields, in conjunction with previousoptical/near-ir data, have allowed us to accurately quantify for the first timethe relative contribution of the two modes to the global sfr density in theredshift interval 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.5, i.e., at the cosmic peak of the star formationactivity. the logarithmic distributions of galaxy sfrs at fixed stellar massare well described by gaussians, with starburst galaxies representing only arelatively minor deviation that becomes apparent for sfrs more than 4 timeshigher than on the main sequence. such starburst galaxies represent only 2% ofmass-selected star forming galaxies and account for only 10% of the cosmic sfrdensity at z~2. only when limited to sfr&gt;1000m(sun)/yr, off-sequence sourcessignificantly contribute to the sfr density (46+/-20%). we conclude thatmerger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role for the formation ofstars in galaxies, whereas they may represent a critical phase towards thequenching of star formation and morphological transformation in galaxies.

1108.3911	herschel-atlas galaxy counts and high redshift luminosity functions: the  formation of massive early type galaxies	exploiting the herschel-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp) survey data,we have determined the luminosity functions (lfs) at rest-frame wavelengths of100 and 250 micron and at several redshifts z&gt;1, for bright sub-mm galaxieswith star formation rates (sfr) &gt;100 m_sun/yr. we find that the evolution ofthe comoving lf is strong up to z~2.5, and slows down at higher redshifts. fromthe lfs and the information on halo masses inferred from clustering analysis,we derived an average relation between sfr and halo mass (and its scatter). wealso infer that the timescale of the main episode of dust-enshrouded starformation in massive halos (m_h&gt;3*10^12 m_sun) amounts to ~7*10^8 yr. given thesfrs, which are in the range 10^2-10^3 m_sun/yr, this timescale implies finalstellar masses of order of 10^11-10^12 m_sun. the corresponding stellar massfunction matches the observed mass function of passively evolving galaxies atz&gt;1. the comparison of the statistics for sub-mm and uv selected galaxiessuggests that the dust-free, uv bright phase, is &gt;10^2 times shorter than thesub-mm bright phase, implying that the dust must form soon after the onset ofstar formation. using a single reference spectral energy distribution (sed; theone of the z~2.3 galaxy smm j2135-0102), our simple physical model is able toreproduce not only the lfs at different redshifts &gt; 1 but also the counts atwavelengths ranging from 250 micron to ~1 mm. owing to the steepness of thecounts and their relatively broad frequency range, this result suggests thatthe dispersion of sub-mm seds of z&gt;1 galaxies around the reference one israther small.

1109.2026	morphology of galaxies in the wings clusters	we present the morphological catalog of galaxies in nearby clusters of thewings survey (fasano et al. 2006). the catalog contains a total number of 39923galaxies, for which we provide the automatic estimates of the morphologicaltype applying the purposely devised tool morphot to the v-band wings imaging.for ~3000 galaxies we also provide visual estimates of the morphological types.a substantial part of the paper is devoted to the description of the morphottool, whose application is limited, at least for the moment, to the wingsimaging only. the approach of the tool to the automation of morphologicalclassification is a non parametric and fully empiri- cal one. in particular,morphot exploits 21 morphological diagnostics, directly and easily computablefrom the galaxy image, to provide two independent classifications: one based ona maximum likelihood (ml), semi-analytical technique, the other one on a neuralnetwork (nn) machine. a suitably selected sample of ~1000 visually clas- sifiedwings galaxies is used to calibrate the diagnostics for the ml estimator and asa training set in the nn machine. the final morphological estimator combinesthe two techniques and proves to be effective both when applied to anadditional test sample of ~1000 visually classified wings galaxies and whencompared with small samples of sdss galaxies visually classified by fukugita etal. (2007) and nair et al. (2010). finally, besides the galaxy morphologydistribution (corrected for field contamination) in the wings clusters, wepresent the ellipticity ({\epsilon}), color (b-v) and sersic index (n)distributions for different morphological types, as well as the morphologicalfractions as a function of the clustercentric distance (in units of r200).

1109.2887	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: spire-mm photometric  redshifts	we investigate the potential of submm-mm and submm-mm-radio photometricredshifts using a sample of mm-selected sources as seen at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m by the spire instrument on herschel. from a sample of 63 previouslyidentified mm-sources with reliable radio identifications in the goods-n andlockman hole north fields 46 (73 per cent) are found to have detections in atleast one spire band. we explore the observed submm/mm colour evolution withredshift, finding that the colours of mm-sources are adequately described by amodified blackbody with constant optical depth {\tau} = ({\nu}/{\nu}0)^{\beta}where {\beta} = +1.8 and {\nu}0 = c/100 {\mu}m. we find a tight correlationbetween dust temperature and ir luminosity. using a single model of the dusttemperature and ir luminosity relation we derive photometric redshift estimatesfor the 46 spire detected mm-sources. testing against the 22 sources with knownspectroscopic, or good quality optical/near-ir photometric, redshifts we findsubmm/mm photometric redshifts offer a redshift accuracy of |z|/(1+z) = 0.16 (&lt;|z| &gt;= 0.51). including constraints from the radio-far ir correlation theaccuracy is improved to |z|/(1 + z) = 0.15 (&lt; |z| &gt;= 0.45). we estimate theredshift distribution of mm-selected sources finding a significant excess at z&gt; 3 when compared to ~ 850 {\mu}m selected samples.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1110.2946	the evolution of the star formation activity per halo mass up to  redshift ~ 1.6 as seen by herschel	star formation in massive galaxies is quenched at some point duringhierarchical mass assembly. to understand where and when the quenchingprocesses takes place, we study the evolution of the total star formation rateper unit total halo mass (\sigma(sfr/m)) in three different mass scales: lowmass halos (field galaxies), groups, and clusters, up to a redshift ~1.6. weuse deep far-infrared pacs data at 100 and 160 um to accurately estimate thetotal star formation rate of the luminous infrared galaxy population of 9clusters with mass ~10^{15} m_{\odot}, and 9 groups/poor clusters with mass ~ 5x 10^{13} m_{\odot}. estimates of the field \sigma(sfr/m) are derived from theliterature, by dividing the star formation rate density by the mean comovingmatter density of the universe. the field \sigma(sfr/m) increases with redshiftup to z~1 and it is constant thereafter. the evolution of the \sigma(sfr/m)-zrelation in galaxy systems is much faster than in the field. up to redshiftz~0.2, the field has a higher \sigma(sfr/m) than galaxy groups and galaxyclusters. at higher redshifts, galaxy groups and the field have similar\sigma(sfr/m), while massive clusters have significantly lower \sigma(sfr/m)than both groups and the field. there is a hint of a reversal of the sfractivity vs. environment at z~1.6, where the group \sigma(sfr/m) lies above thefield \sigma(sfr/m)-z relation. we discuss possible interpretations of ourresults in terms of the processes of downsizing, and star-formation quenching.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1204.4706	blind detections of co j = 1--0 in 11 h-atlas galaxies at z = 2.1--3.5  with the gbt/zpectrometer	we report measurements of the carbon monoxide ground state rotationaltransition (12c16o j = 1--0) with the zpectrometer ultra-wideband spectrometeron the 100-m diameter green bank telescope. the sample comprises 11 galaxieswith redshifts between z = 2.1 and 3.5 from a total sample of 24 targetsidentified by herschel-atlas photometric colors from the spire instrument. nineof the co measurements are new redshift determinations, substantially adding tothe number of detections of galaxies with rest-frame peak submillimeteremission near 100um. the co detections confirm the existence of massive gasreservoirs within these luminous dusty star-forming galaxies (dsfgs). the coredshift distribution of the 350um-selected galaxies is strikingly similar tothe optical redshifts of 850um-selected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in 2.1 &lt;z &lt; 3.5. spectroscopic redshifts break a temperature-redshift degeneracy;optically thin dust models fit to the far-infrared photometry indicatecharacteristic dust temperatures near 34 k for most of the galaxies we detectin co. detections of two warmer galaxies and statistically significantnondetections hint at warmer or molecule-poor dsfgs with redshifts difficultdetermine from from herschel-spire photometric colors alone. many of thegalaxies identified by h-atlas photometry are expected to be amplified byforeground gravitational lenses. analysis of co linewidths and luminositiesprovides a method for finding approximate gravitational lens magnifications mufrom spectroscopic data alone, yielding mu ~ 3--20. corrected formagnification, most galaxy luminosities are consistent with an ultra-luminousinfrared galaxy (ulirg) classification, but three are candidate hyper-lirgswith luminosities greater than 10^13 l_sun.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.4060	the spitzer extragalactic representative volume survey (servs): survey  definition and goals	we present the spitzer extragalactic representative volume survey (servs), an18 square degrees medium-deep survey at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with thepost-cryogenic spitzer space telescope to ~2 microjy (ab=23.1) depth of fivehighly observed astronomical fields (elais-n1, elais-s1, lockman hole, chandradeep field south and xmm-lss). servs is designed to enable the study of galaxyevolution as a function of environment from z~5 to the present day, and is thefirst extragalactic survey both large enough and deep enough to put rareobjects such as luminous quasars and galaxy clusters at z&gt;1 into theircosmological context. servs is designed to overlap with several key surveys atoptical, near- through far-infrared, submillimeter and radio wavelengths toprovide an unprecedented view of the formation and evolution of massivegalaxies. in this paper, we discuss the servs survey design, the dataprocessing flow from image reduction and mosaicing to catalogs, as well ascoverage of ancillary data from other surveys in the servs fields. we alsohighlight a variety of early science results from the survey.

1207.2724	a detailed gravitational lens model based on submillimeter array and  keck adaptive optics imaging of a herschel-atlas sub-millimeter galaxy at  z=4.243	we present high-spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeterarray (sma) at 880um and the keck adaptive optics (ao) system at ks-band of agravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy (smg) at z=4.243 discovered in theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey. the sma data (angularresolution ~0.6") resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images, whilethe keck ao ks-band data (angular resolution ~0.1") resolve the lens into apair of galaxies separated by 0.3". we present an optical spectrum of theforeground lens obtained with the gemini-south telescope that provides a lensredshift of z_lens = 0.595 +/- 0.005. we develop and apply a new lens modelingtechnique in the visibility plane that shows that the smg is magnified by afactor of mu = 4.1 +/- 0.2 and has an intrinsic infrared (ir) luminosity ofl_ir = (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^13 lsun. we measure a half-light radius of thebackground source of r_s = 4.4 +/- 0.5 kpc which implies an ir luminositysurface density of sigma_ir = (3.4 +/- 0.9) x 10^11 lsun kpc^-2, a value thatis typical of z &gt; 2 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies atz~0. the two lens galaxies are compact (r_lens ~ 0.9 kpc) early-types witheinstein radii of theta_e1 = 0.57 +/- 0.01 and theta_e2 = 0.40 +/- 0.01 thatimply masses of m_lens1 = (7.4 +/- 0.5) x 10^10 msun and m_lens2 = (3.7 +/-0.3) x 10^10 msun. the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo adissipationless merger, and the mass and size of the resultant system should besimilar to other early-type galaxies at z~0.6. this work highlights theimportance of high spatial resolution imaging in developing models of stronglylensed galaxies discovered by herschel.

1208.3079	herschel-atlas: multi-wavelength seds and physical properties of 250  micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5	we present a pan-chromatic analysis of an unprecedented sample of 1402 250micron-selected galaxies at z &lt; 0.5 (mean z = 0.24) from the herschel-atlassurvey. we complement our herschel 100-500 micron data with uv-k-bandphotometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey and apply themagphys energy-balance technique to produce pan-chromatic seds for arepresentative sample of 250 micron selected galaxies spanning the most recent5 gyr of cosmic history. we derive estimates of physical parameters, includingstar formation rates, stellar masses, dust masses and infrared luminosities.the typical h-atlas galaxy at z &lt; 0.5 has a far-infrared luminosity in therange 10^10 - 10^12 lsolar (sfr: 1-50 msolar/yr) thus is broadly representativeof normal star forming galaxies over this redshift range. we show that 250micron-selected galaxies contain a larger mass of dust at a given infra-redluminosity or star formation rate than previous samples selected at 60 micronfrom iras. we derive typical seds for h-atlas galaxies, and show that theemergent sed shape is most sensitive to specific star formation rate. theoptical-uv seds also become more reddened due to dust at higher redshifts. ourtemplate seds are significantly cooler than existing infra-red templates. theymay therefore be most appropriate for inferring total ir luminosities frommoderate redshift submillimetre selected samples and for inclusion in models ofthe lower redshift submillimetre galaxy populations.

1209.0670	herschel-atlas: the far-infrared properties and star-formation rates of  broad absorption line quasi-stellar objects	we have used data from the herschel-atlas at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m todetermine the far-infrared (fir) properties of 50 broad absorption line quasars(bal qsos). our sample contains 49 high-ionization bal qsos (hibals) and 1low-ionization bal qso (lobal) which are compared against a sample of 329non-bal qsos. these samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z &lt;2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq m_{i} \leq -24. ofthese, 3 bal qsos (hibals) and 27 non-bal qsos are detected at the &gt; 5 sigmalevel. we calculate star-formation rates (sfr) for our individually detectedhibal qsos and the non-detected lobal qso as well as average sfrs for the baland non-bal qso samples based on stacking the herschel data. we find nodifference between the hibal and non-bal qso samples in the fir, even whenseparated based on differing bal qso classifications. using mrk 231 as atemplate, the weighted mean sfr is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 m_{\odot}yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upperlimit if agn-heated dust makes a contribution to the fir emission. despitetentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc c\,iv}equivalent width on fir emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflowin these objects is not linked to their fir output. these results stronglysuggest that bal qsos (more specifically hibals) can be accommodated within asimple agn unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersectsoutflowing material. models in which hibals are caught towards the end of aperiod of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a windterminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed firproperties.

1211.4257	the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the  herschel pacs photometer psf and noise	we investigate the effect of the "high-pass filter" data reduction techniqueon the herschel pacs psf and noise of the pacs maps at the 70, 100 and 160 umbands and in medium and fast scan speeds. this branch of the pacs photometerpipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-sourceobservations.the calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal appliedby the pacs pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulationsobtained by "polluting" real pacs timelines with fake sources at different fluxlevels. the effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final mapnoise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high dataredundancy. we show that the running median removal can cause significant fluxlosses at any flux level. we analyse the advantages and disadvantages ofseveral masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circularpatches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of fluxloss. we provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for severalmasking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as afunction of the source flux. we also show that, for stacking analysis, theimpact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly theclustering effect. the analysis of the global noise and noise components of thepacs maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise isthe high-pass filter width. we also provide simple fitting functions to buildthe error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlationcorrection factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameterspace.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1307.2360	the hybrid solution for the fundamental plane	by exploiting the database of early-type galaxies (etgs) members of the wingssurvey of nearby clusters, we address here the long debated question of theorigin and shape of the fundamental plane (fp). our data suggest that differentphysical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the fp with respect to thevirial plane (vp) expectation. in particular, an hybrid solution in which thestructure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors tothe fp tilt seems to be favoured. we find that the bulk of the tilt should beattributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play animportant but less crucial role. our data indicate that the differential fptilt between the v and k-band is due to a sort of entanglement betweenstructural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening ofcolor profiles (v-k) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of etgs.the same analysis applied to the atlas3d and sdss data in common with wings(wsdss throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkabledifference being the less important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio indetermining the fp tilt. the atlas3d data also suggest that the tilt depends aswell on the dark matter (dm) fraction and on the rotational contribution to thekinetic energy (vrot/sigma). we show that the global properties of the fp canbe understood in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure andstellar population of etgs, for which, at increasing the stellar mass, etgsbecome (on average) older and more centrally concentrated. finally, we showthat a malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution ofthe mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses. this should be takeninto account in the studies investigating the amount of the so calleddownsizing phenomenon.

1307.3556	herschel reveals the obscured star formation in hizels h\alpha\ emitters  at z=1.47	we describe the far-infrared (fir; rest-frame 8--1000\mu m) properties of asample of 443 h\alpha-selected star-forming galaxies in the cosmos and udsfields detected by the hizels imaging survey. sources are identified usingnarrow-band filters in combination with broad-band photometry to uniformlyselect h\alpha\ (and [oii] if available) emitters in a narrow redshift slice atz = 1.47+/-0.02. we use a stacking approach in spitzer, herschel (from pep andhermes surveys) and aztec images to describe their typical fir properties. wefind that hizels galaxies with observed h\alpha\ luminosities of ~ 10^{8.1-9.1}lo have bolometric fir luminosities of typical lirgs, l_fir ~ 10^{11.48+/-0.05}lo. combining the h\alpha\ and fir luminosities, we derive median sfr = 32+/-5mo/yr and h\alpha\ extinctions of a(h\alpha) = 1.0+/-0.2 mag. perhapssurprisingly, little difference is seen in typical hizels extinction levelscompared to local star-forming galaxies. we confirm previous empirical stellarmass (m*) to a(h\alpha) relations and the little or no evolution up to z =1.47. for hizels galaxies, we provide an empirical parametrisation of the sfras a function of (u-z)_rest colours and 3.6\mu m photometry. we find that theobserved h\alpha\ luminosity is a dominant sfr tracer when (u-z)_rest ~&lt; 0.9mag or when 3.6\mu m photometry &gt; 22 mag (vega) or when m* &lt; 10^9.7 mo. we donot find any correlation between the [oii]/h\alpha\ and fir luminosity,suggesting that this emission line ratio does not trace the extinction of themost obscured star-forming regions. the luminosity-limited hizels sample tendsto lie above of the so-called `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies,especially at low m*. this work suggests that obscured star formation is linkedto the assembly of m*, with deeper potential wells in massive galaxiesproviding dense, heavily obscured environments in which stars can form rapidly.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1311.5758	hermes: clusters of dusty galaxies uncovered by herschel and planck	the potential for planck to detect clusters of dusty, star-forming galaxiesat z greater than 1 is tested by examining the herschel-spire images of planckearly release compact source catalog (ercsc) sources lying in fields observedby the hermes survey. of the 16 planck sources that lie in the roughly 90 sq.deg. examined, we find that twelve are associated with single bright herschelsources. the remaining four are associated with overdensities of herschelsources, making them candidate clusters of dusty, starforming galaxies. we usecomplementary optical and nir data for these clumps to test this idea, and findevidence for the presence of galaxy clusters in all four cases. we usephotometric redshifts and red sequence galaxies to estimate the redshifts ofthese clusters, finding that they range from 0.8 to 2.3. these redshifts implythat the herschel sources in these clusters, which contribute to the detectedplanck flux, are forming stars very rapidly, with typical total cluster starformation rates greater than 1000msun per yr. the high redshift clustersdiscovered in these observations are used to constrain the epoch of clustergalaxy formation, finding that the galaxies in our clusters are 1 to 1.5 gy oldat z about 1 to 2. prospects for the discovery of further clusters of dustygalaxies are discussed, using not only all sky planck surveys, but also deeper,smaller area, herschel surveys.

1311.7516	u-band photometry of 17 wings clusters	this paper belongs to a series presenting the wide field nearbygalaxy-cluster survey (wings). the wings project has collected wide-field,optical (b,v) and near-infrared (j,k) imaging, as well as medium resolutionspectroscopy of galaxies in a sample of 76 x-ray selected nearby clusters (0.04&lt; z &lt; 0.07), with the aim of establishing a reference sample for evolutionarystudies of galaxies and galaxy clusters. in this paper we present the u-bandphotometry of galaxies and stars in the fields of 17 clusters of the wingssample. we also extend to a larger field of view the original b- and v-bandphotometry (wings-opt) for 9 and 6 wings clusters, respectively. we use boththe new and the already existing b-band photometry to get reliable (u-b) colorsof galaxies within three fixed apertures in kpc. to this aim, in the reductionprocedure we put particular care in the astrometric precision. since not allthe observations have been taken in good transparency conditions, thephotometric calibration was partly obtained relying on the sdss and wings-optphotometry for the u- and optical bands, respectively. we provide u-band (alsob- and v-band, where possible) total magnitudes of stars and galaxies in thefields of clusters. just for galaxies, the catalogs also provide geometricalparameters and carefully centered aperture magnitudes. the internal consistencyof magnitudes has been checked for clusters imaged with different cameras,while the external photometric consistency has been obtained comparing with thewings-opt and sdss surveys. the photometric catalogs presented here add theu-band information to the wings database for extending the sed of the galaxies,in particular in the uv wavelengths which are fundamental for deriving the sfrproperties.

1312.5317	constraints on the merging channel of massive galaxies since z~1	(abridged) we probe the merging channel of massive galaxies over thez=0.3-1.3 redshift window by studying close pairs in a sample of 238 galaxieswith stellar mass &gt;1e11msun, from the deep (m&lt;26.5ab, 3 sigma) shards survey.shards provides medium band photometry equivalent to low-resolution opticalspectra (r~50), allowing us to obtain extremely accurate photometric redshifts(|dz|/(1+z)~0.55%) and to improve the constraints on the age distribution ofthe stellar populations. a strong correlation is found between the agedifference of central and satellite galaxy and stellar mass ratio, fromnegligible age differences in major mergers to age differences ~4 gyr for 1:100minor mergers. however, this correlation is simply a reflection of the mass-agetrend in the general population. the dominant contributor to the growth ofmassive galaxies corresponds to mass ratios mu=msat/mcen&gt;0.3, followed by adecrease in the fractional mass growth rate linearly proportional to log mu, atleast down to mu~0.01, suggesting a decreasing role of mergers involvinglow-mass satellites, especially if dynamical friction timescales are taken intoaccount. a simple model results in an upper limit for the average mass growthrate of massive galaxies of dm/m/dt~ 0.08+-0.02 per gyr, over the z&lt;1 range,with a ~70% fractional contribution from (major) mergers with mu&gt;0.3. themajority of the stellar mass contributed by mergers does not introducesignificantly younger populations, in agreement with the small radial agegradients observed in present-day early-type galaxies.

1402.4131	wings-spe iii: equivalent width measurements, spectral properties and  evolution of local cluster galaxies	[abridged] we investigate the frequency of the various spectral types as afunction both of the clusters' properties and of the galaxies' characteristics.in this way, using the same classification criteria adopted for higher redshiftstudies, we can consistently compare the properties of the local clusterpopulation to those of their more distant counterparts. we describe a method wehave developed to automatically measure the equivalent width of spectral linesin a robust way even in spectra with a non optimal signal to noise. like this,we can derive a spectral classification reflecting the stellar content, basedon the presence and strength of the [oii] and hdelta lines. we are able tomeasure 4381 of the ~6000 originally observed spectra, in the fields of 48clusters, 2744 of which are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. thespectral classification is then analyzed as a function of galaxies' luminosity,stellar mass, morphology, local density and host cluster's global properties,and compared to higher redshift samples (morphs and ediscs). the vast majorityof galaxies in the local clusters population are passive objects, being alsothe most luminous and massive. at a magnitude limit of mv&lt;-18, galaxies in apost-starburst phase represent only ~11% of the cluster population and thisfraction is reduced to ~5% at mv&lt;-19.5, which compares to the 18% at the samemagnitude limit for high-z clusters. "normal" star forming galaxies [e( c )]are proportionally more common in local clusters. the relative occurrence ofpost--starbursts suggests a very similar quenching efficiency in clusters atredshifts in the 0 to ~1 range. furthermore, more important than the globalenvironment, the local density seems to be the main driver of galaxy evolutionin local clusters, at least with respect to their stellar populations content.

1403.1408	wings data release: a database of galaxies in nearby clusters	[abridged] to effectively investigate galaxy formation and evolution, it isof paramount importance to exploit homogeneous data for large samples ofgalaxies in different environments. the wings (wide-field nearby galaxy-clustersurvey) project aim is to evaluate physical properties of galaxies in acomplete sample of low redshift clusters to be used as reference sample forevolutionary studies. the wings survey is still ongoing and the originaldataset will soon be enlarged with new observations. this paper presents theentire collection of wings measurements obtained so far. we decided to make useof the virtual observatory (vo) tools to share the wings database (that will beregularly updated) with the community. in the database each object has oneunique identification (wingsid). each subset of estimated properties isaccessible using a simple cone search (including wide-field images). we providethe scientific community the entire set of wide-field images. furthermore, thepublished database contains photometry of 759,024 objects and surfacebrightness analysis for 42,275 and 41,463 galaxies in the v and b band,respectively. the completeness depends on the image quality, and on the clusterredshift, reaching on average 90% at v&lt;= 21.7. near infrared photometriccatalogs for 26 (in k) and 19 (in j) clusters are part of the database and thenumber of sources is 962,344 in k and 628,813 in j. here again the completenessdepends on the data quality, but it is on average higher than 90% for j&lt;=20.5and k&lt;=19.4. the ir subsample with a sersic fit comprises 71,687 objects. amorphological classification is available for 39,923 galaxies. we publishspectroscopic data, including 6,132 redshifts, 5,299 star formation historiesand 4,381 equivalent widths. finally, a calculation of local density ispresented and implemented in the vo catalogs for 66,164 galaxies.

1403.5237	j-pas: the javalambre-physics of the accelerated universe astrophysical  survey	the javalambre-physics of the accelerated universe astrophysical survey(j-pas) is a narrow band, very wide field cosmological survey to be carried outfrom the javalambre observatory in spain with a purpose-built, dedicated 2.5mtelescope and a 4.7 sq.deg. camera with 1.2gpix. starting in late 2015, j-paswill observe 8500sq.deg. of northern sky and measure $0.003(1+z)$ photo-z for$9\times10^7$ lrg and elg galaxies plus several million qsos, sampling aneffective volume of $\sim 14$ gpc$^3$ up to $z=1.3$ and becoming the firstradial bao experiment to reach stage iv. j-pas will detect $7\times 10^5$galaxy clusters and groups, setting constrains on dark energy which rival thoseobtained from its bao measurements. thanks to the superb characteristics of thesite (seeing ~0.7 arcsec), j-pas is expected to obtain a deep, sub-arcsec imageof the northern sky, which combined with its unique photo-z precision willproduce one of the most powerful cosmological lensing surveys before thearrival of euclid. j-pas unprecedented spectral time domain information willenable a self-contained sn survey that, without the need for externalspectroscopic follow-up, will detect, classify and measure $\sigma_z\sim 0.5\%$redshifts for $\sim 4000$ sneia and $\sim 900$ core-collapse sne. the key tothe j-pas potential is its innovative approach: a contiguous system of 54filters with $145\aa$ width, placed $100\aa$ apart over a multi-degree fov is apowerful "redshift machine", with the survey speed of a 4000 multiplexing lowresolution spectrograph, but many times cheaper and much faster to build. thej-pas camera is equivalent to a 4.7 sq.deg. "ifu" and it will produce atime-resolved, 3d image of the northern sky with a very wide range ofastrophysical applications in galaxy evolution, the nearby universe and thestudy of resolved stellar populations.

1406.7410	interacting laes at z = 5.1. episodic star formation in a group of laes  at z= 5.07	we are undertaking a search for high-redshift low luminosity lyman alphasources in the shards survey. among the pre-selected lyman alpha sources 2candidates were spotted, located 3.19 arcsec apart, and tentatively at the sameredshift. here we report on the spectroscopic confirmation with gtc of thelyman alpha emission from this pair of galaxies at a confirmed spectroscopicredshifts of z=5.07. furthermore, one of the sources is interacting/mergingwith another close companion that looks distorted. based on the analysis of thespectroscopy and additional photometric data, we infer that most of the stellarmass of these objects was assembled in a burst of star formation 100 myr ago. amore recent burst (2 myr old) is necessary to account for the measured lymanalpha flux. we claim that these two galaxies are good examples of lyman alphasources undergoing episodic star formation. besides, these sources very likelyconstitute a group of interacting lyman alpha emitters (laes).

0705.1513	a spectrophotometric model applied to cluster galaxies: the wings  dataset	[abridged] the wide-field nearby galaxy-cluster survey (wings) is a projectaiming at the study of the galaxy populations in clusters in the local universe(0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07) and the influence of environment on the physical properties ofgalaxies. this survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. a salient feature of this model is thepossibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing youngerstars to be more obscured than older ones. our technique, for the first time,takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. a set of templatespectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, withfeatures closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms ofspectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. our method of analyzingthese spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties relatedto each physical parameter we are inferring. the well-known degeneracy problem,i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction indifferent age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to therecovered parameters. the values found in this way, together with their errorbars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possiblesolutions for a given spectrum. a comparison test was also performed on a wingssubsample, containing objects in common with the sloan digital sky survey,yielding excellent agreement. we find that the stellar content as a function ofage is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties onlymildly depend on the s/n ratio. the metallicity of the dominant stellarpopulation is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the starformation history pattern.

0804.1892	the fundamental plane of early type galaxies in nearby clusters from the  wings database	by exploting the data of three large surveys (wings, nfps and sdss), wepresent here a comparative analysis of the fundamental plane (fp hereafter) ofthe early-type galaxies (etgs) belonging to 59 galaxy clusters in the redshiftrange $0.04&lt;z&lt;0.07$.  we show that the variances of the distributions of the fp coefficientsderived for the clusters in our sample are not consistent with the hypothesisof universality of the fp relation. by investigating the origin of suchremarkable variances we find that, besides a couple of obvious factors, such asthe adopted fitting technique and the method used to measure the photometricand kinematic variables, the coefficients of the fp are strongly influenced bya number of things, mainly related to the distribution of photometric/kinematicproperties of galaxies in the particular sample under analysis. for instance,the $a$ coefficient derived for the whole sample of etgs, turns out to decreasewhen faint galaxies are progressively removed from the sample, suggesting thatbright and faint etgs have systematically different fps, likely because ofdifferent mechanisms of galaxy formation. in general, by comparing mock clustersamples with the real one, we conclude that the observed variances of the fpcoefficients cannot be attributed just to statistical uncertainties. wespeculate that the fp is actually a bent surface, which is approximated bydifferent planes when different selection criteria, either chosen or induced byobservations, are acting to define galaxies samples.  we also find ...

1502.03842	alma detection of [cii] 158 micron emission from a strongly lensed z=2  star-forming galaxy	our objectives are to determine the properties of the interstellar medium(ism) and of star-formation in typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift.following up on our previous multi-wavelength observations with hst, spitzer,herschel, and the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi), we have studied astrongly lensed z=2.013 galaxy, the arc behind the galaxy cluster macsj0451+0006, with alma to measure the [cii] 158 micron emission line, one of themain coolants of the ism. [cii] emission from the southern part of this galaxyis detected at 10 $\sigma$. taking into account strong gravitational lensing,which provides a magnification of $\mu=49$, the intrinsic lensing-corrected[cii]158 micron luminosity is $l(cii)=1.2 \times 10^8 l_\odot$. the observedratio of [cii]-to-ir emission, $l(cii)/l(fir) \approx (1.2-2.4) \times10^{-3}$, is found to be similar to that in nearby galaxies. the same alsoholds for the observed ratio $l(cii)/l(co)=2.3 \times 10^3$, which iscomparable to that of star-forming galaxies and active galaxy nuclei (agn) atlow redshift. we utilize strong gravitational lensing to extend diagnosticstudies of the cold ism to an order of magnitude lower luminosity ($l(ir) \sim(1.1-1.3) \times 10^{11} l_\odot$) and sfr than previous work at high redshift.while larger samples are needed, our results provide evidence that the cold ismof typical high redshift galaxies has physical characteristics similar tonormal star forming galaxies in the local universe.

1503.01339	morphological fractions of galaxies in wings clusters: revisiting the  morphology-density paradigm	we present the morphology-density and morphology-radius relations (t-sigmaand t-r, respectively) obtained from the wings database of galaxies in nearbyclusters. aiming to achieve the best statistics, we exploit the whole sample ofgalaxies brighter than mv=-19.5 (5,504 objects), stacking up the 76 clusters ofthe wings survey altogether. using this global cluster sample, we find that thet-sigma relation holds only in the inner cluster regions (r&lt;1/3xr200), whilethe t-r relation keeps almost unchanged over the whole range of local density.a couple of tests and two sets of numerical simulations support the robustnessof these results against the effects of the limited cluster area coverage ofthe wings imaging. the above mentioned results hold for all cluster masses(x-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion) and all galaxy stellar masses (m).the strength of the t-sigma relation (where present) increases with increasingm, while this effect is not found for the t-r relation. noticeably, theabsence/presence of subclustering determines the presence/absence of thet-sigma relation outside the inner cluster regions, leading us to the generalconclusion that the link between morphology and local density is preserved justin dynamically evolved regions. we hypothesize that some mechanism ofmorphological broadening/redistribution operates in the intermediate/outerregions of substructured (non relaxed) clusters, producing a strong weakeningof the t-sigma relation.

1503.07164	caught in the act: gas and stellar velocity dispersions in a fast  quenching compact star-forming galaxy at z~1.7	we present keck-i mosfire spectroscopy in the y and h bands of gdn-8231, amassive, compact, star-forming galaxy (sfg) at a redshift $z\sim1.7$. itsspectrum reveals both h$_{\alpha}$ and [nii] emission lines and strong balmerabsorption lines. the h$_{\alpha}$ and spitzer mips 24 $\mu$m fluxes are bothweak, thus indicating a low star formation rate of sfr $\lesssim5-10$m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. this, added to a relatively young age of $\sim700$ myrmeasured from the absorption lines, provides the first direct evidence for adistant galaxy being caught in the act of rapidly shutting down its starformation. such quenching allows gdn-8231 to become a compact, quiescentgalaxy, similar to 3 other galaxies in our sample, by $z\sim1.5$. moreover, thecolor profile of gdn-8231 shows a bluer center, consistent with the predictionsof recent simulations for an early phase of inside-out quenching. itsline-of-sight velocity dispersion for the gas, $\sigma^{\rm{gas}}_{\!_{\rmlos}}=127\pm32$ km s$^{-1}$, is nearly 40% smaller than that of its stars,$\sigma^{\star}_{\!_{\rm los}}=215\pm35$ km s$^{-1}$. high-resolutionhydro-simulations of galaxies explain such apparently colder gas kinematics ofup to a factor of $\sim1.5$ with rotating disks being viewed at differentinclinations and/or centrally concentrated star-forming regions. a clearprediction is that their compact, quiescent descendants preserve some remnantrotation from their star-forming progenitors.

1506.01201	galaxy luminosity functions in wings clusters	using v band photometry of the wings survey, we derive galaxy luminosityfunctions (lf) in nearby clusters. this sample is complete down to mv=-15.15,and it is homogeneous, thus allowing the study of an unbiased sample ofclusters with different characteristics. we constructed the photometric lf for72 out of the original 76 wings clusters, excluding only those without avelocity dispersion estimate. for each cluster we obtained the lf for galaxiesin a region of radius=0.5 x r200, and fitted them with single and doubleschechter's functions. we also derive the composite lf for the entire sample,and those pertaining to different morphological classes. finally we derive thespectroscopic cumulative lf for 2009 galaxies that are cluster members. thedouble schechter fit parameters are neither correlated with the clustervelocity dispersion, nor with the x-ray luminosity. our median values of theschechter's fit slope are, on average, in agreement with measurements of nearbyclusters, but are less steep that those derived from large surveys, such as thesdss. early--type galaxies outnumber late-types at all magnitudes, but bothearly and late types contribute equally to the faint end of the lf. finally,the spectroscopic lf is in excellent agreement with the ones derived for a2199,a85 and virgo, and with the photometric one at the bright magnitudes (whereboth are available). there is a large spread in the lf of different clusters.however, this spread is not caused by correlation of the lf shape with clustercharacteristics such as x--ray luminosity or velocity dispersions. the faintend is flatter than what previously derived (alpha_f=-1.7) at odds with whatpredicted from numerical simulations.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.
