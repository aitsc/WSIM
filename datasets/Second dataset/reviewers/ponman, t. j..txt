0909.3776	gas entropy in a representative sample of nearby x-ray galaxy clusters  (rexcess): relationship to gas mass fraction	(abridged) we examine the radial entropy distribution and its scaling using31 nearby galaxy clusters from the representative xmm-newton cluster structuresurvey (rexcess). the entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out tor_1000 in all systems and out to r_500 in 13 systems. compared to theoreticalexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependentexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower masssystems. at r_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligiblewithin the uncertainties. mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropyis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,becoming consistent with self-similar at r_500. the dispersion in scaledentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores anddynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of twoand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. parameterising the profileswith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropyk_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skeweddistribution. the outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; theirdistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. renormalising thedimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(&lt; r),leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fractionvariations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropyproperties. we discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of theentropy and gas mass fraction in the rexcess sample, in which extra heating andmerger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority ofthe population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.

0707.1879	the dark haloes of early-type galaxies in low-density environments:  xmm-newton and chandra observations of ngc 57, ngc 7796 and ic 1531	we present analysis of chandra and xmm-newton observations of threeearly-type galaxies, ngc 57, ngc 7796 and ic 1531. all three are found in verylow density environments, and appear to have no neighbours of comparable size.ngc 57 has a halo of kt~0.9 kev, solar metallicity gas, while ngc 7796 and ic1531 both have ~0.55 kev, 0.5-0.6 zsol haloes. ic 1531 has a relatively compacthalo, and we consider it likely that gas has been removed from the system bythe effects of agn heating. for ngc 57 and ngc 7796 we estimate mass, entropyand cooling time profiles and find that ngc 57 has a fairly massive dark halowith a mass-to-light ratio of 44.7 (4.0,-8.5) msol/lsol (1 sigma uncertainties)at 4.75 re. this is very similar to the mass-to-light ratio found for ngc 4555and confirms that isolated ellipticals can possess sizable dark matter haloes.we find a significantly lower mass-to-light ratio for ngc 7796, 10.6(+2.5,-2.3) msol/lsol at 5 re, and discuss the possibility that ngc 7796 hostsa galactic wind, causing us to underestimate its mass.

0912.4667	substructure of the galaxy clusters in the rexcess sample: observed  statistics and comparison to numerical simulations	we study the substructure statistics of a representative sample of galaxyclusters by means of two currently popular substructure characterisationmethods, power ratios and centroid shifts. we use the 31 clusters from therexcess sample, compiled from the southern rosat all-sky cluster survey reflexwith a morphologically unbiased selection in x-ray luminosity and redshift, allof which have been reobserved with xmm-newton. we investigate the uncertaintiesof the substructure parameters and examine the dependence of the results onprojection effects, finding that the uncertainties of the parameters can bequite substantial. thus while the quantification of the dynamical state ofindividual clusters with these parameters should be treated with extremecaution, these substructure measures provide powerful statistical tools tocharacterise trends of properties in large cluster samples. the centre shiftparameter, w, is found to be more sensitive in general. for the rexcess sampleneither the occurence of substructure nor the presence of cool cores depends oncluster mass. there is a significant anti-correlation between the existence ofsubstantial substructure and cool cores. the simulated clusters show on averagelarger substructure parameters than the observed clusters, a trend that istraced to the fact that cool regions are more pronounced in the simulatedclusters, leading to stronger substructure measures in merging clusters andclusters with offset cores. moreover, the frequency of cool regions is higherin the simulations than in the observations, implying that the description ofthe physical processes shaping cluster formation in the simulations requiresfurther improvement.

1007.2196	locuss: connecting the dominance and shape of brightest cluster galaxies  with the assembly history of massive clusters	we study the luminosity gap, dm12, between the first and second rankedgalaxies in a sample of 59 massive galaxy clusters, using data from the haletelescope, hst, chandra, and spitzer. we find that the dm12 distribution,p(dm12), is a declining function of dm12, to which we fitted a straight line:p(dm12) propto -(0.13+/-0.02)dm12. the fraction of clusters with "large"luminosity gaps is p(dm12&gt;=1)=0.37+/-0.08, which represents a 3sigma excessover that obtained from monte carlo simulations of a schechter function thatmatches the mean cluster galaxy luminosity function. we also identify fourclusters with "extreme" luminosity gaps, dm12&gt;=2, giving a fraction ofp(dm12&gt;=2)=0.07+0.05-0.03. more generally, large luminosity gap clusters arerelatively homogeneous, with elliptical/disky brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs), cuspy gas density profiles (i.e. strong cool cores), highconcentrations, and low substructure fractions. in contrast, small luminositygap clusters are heterogeneous, spanning the full range ofboxy/elliptical/disky bcg morphologies, the full range of cool core strengthsand dark matter concentrations, and have large substructure fractions. takentogether, these results imply that the amplitude of the luminosity gap is afunction of both the formation epoch, and the recent infall history of thecluster. "bcg dominance" is therefore a phase that a cluster may evolvethrough, and is not an evolutionary "cul-de-sac". we also compare our resultswith semi-analytic model predictions based on the millennium simulation. noneof the models are able to reproduce all of the observational results,underlining the inability of current models to match the empirical propertiesof bcgs. we identify the strength of agn feedback and the efficiency with whichcluster galaxies are replenished after they merge with the bcg in each model aspossible causes of these discrepancies.

1010.6195	the xmm-lss survey: optical assessment and properties of different x-ray  selected cluster classes	xmm and chandra opened a new area for the study of clusters of galaxies. notonly for cluster physics but also, for the detection of faint and distantclusters that were inaccessible with previous missions. this article presents66 spectroscopically confirmed clusters (0.05&lt;z&lt;1.5) within an area of 6 deg2enclosed in the xmm-lss survey. almost two thirds have been confirmed withdedicated spectroscopy only and 10% have been confirmed with dedicatedspectroscopy supplemented by literature redshifts. sub-samples, or classes, ofextended-sources are defined in a two-dimensional x-ray parameter spaceallowing for various degrees of completeness and contamination. we describe theprocedure developed to assess the reality of these cluster candidates using thecfhtls photometric data and spectroscopic information from our own follow-upcampaigns. most of these objects are low mass clusters, hence constituting astill poorly studied population. in a second step, we quantify correlationsbetween the optical properties such as richness or velocity dispersion and thecluster x-ray luminosities. we examine the relation of the clusters to thecosmic web. finally, we review peculiar structures in the surveyed area likevery distant clusters and fossil groups.

0709.1950	the xmm-lss survey: the class 1 cluster sample over the initial 5 square  degrees and its cosmological modelling	we present a sample of 29 galaxy clusters from the xmm-lss survey over anarea of some 5deg2 out to a redshift of z=1.05. the sample clusters, whichrepresent about half of the x-ray clusters identified in the region, followwell defined x-ray selection criteria and are all spectroscopically confirmed.for all clusters, we provide x-ray luminosities and temperatures as well asmasses. the cluster distribution peaks around z=0.3 and t =1.5 kev, half of theobjects being groups with a temperature below 2 kev. our l-t(z) relation pointstoward self-similar evolution, but does not exclude other physically plausiblemodels. assuming that cluster scaling laws follow self-similar evolution, ournumber density estimates up to z=1 are compatible with the predictions of theconcordance cosmology and with the findings of previous rosat surveys. our wellmonitored selection function allowed us to demonstrate that the inclusion ofselection effects is essential for the correct determination of the evolutionof the l-t relation, which may explain the contradictory results from previousstudies. extensive simulations show that extending the survey area to 10deg2has the potential to exclude the non-evolution hypothesis, but that constraintson more refined icm models will probably be limited by the large intrinsicdispersion of the l-t relation. we further demonstrate that increasing thedispersion in the scaling laws increases the number of detectable clusters,hence generating further degeneracy [in addition to sigma8, omega_m, l(m,z) andt(m,z)] in the cosmological interpretation of the cluster number counts. weprovide useful empirical formulae for the cluster mass-flux and mass-count-raterelations as well as a comparison between the xmm-lss mass sensitivity and thatof forthcoming sz surveys.

0709.2300	testing the galaxy cluster mass-observable relations at z = 1 with  xmm-newton and chandra observations of xlssj022403.9-041328	we present an analysis of deep xmm-newton and chandra observations of thez=1.05 galaxy cluster xlssj022403.9-041328 (hereafter xlssc 029), detected inthe xmm-newton large scale structure survey. density and temperature profilesof the x-ray emitting gas were used to perform a hydrostatic mass analysis ofthe system. this allowed us to measure the total mass and gas fraction in thecluster and define overdensity radii r500 and r2500. the global properties ofxlssc 029 were measured within these radii and compared with those of the localpopulation. the gas mass fraction was found to be consistent with localclusters. the mean metal abundance was 0.18 +0.17 -0.15 zsol, with the clustercore regions excluded, consistent with the predicted and observed evolution.the properties of xlssc 029 were then used to investigate the position of thecluster on the m-kt, yx-m, and lx-m scaling relations. in all cases theobserved properties of xlssc 029 agreed well with the simple self-similarevolution of the scaling relations. this is the first test of the evolution ofthese relations at z &gt; 1 and supports the use of the scaling relations incosmological studies with distant galaxy clusters.

1306.1583	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): a deeper view of the mass, metallicity,  and sfr relationships	a full appreciation of the role played by gas metallicity (z), star-formationrate (sfr), and stellar mass is fundamental to understanding how galaxies formand evolve. the connections between these three parameters at differentredshifts significantly affect galaxy evolution, and thus provide importantconstraints for galaxy evolution models. using data from the sloan digital skysurvey-data release 7 (sdss-dr7) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)surveys we study the relationships and dependencies between sfr, z, and stellarmass, as well as the fundamental plane for star-forming galaxies. we combineboth surveys using volume-limited samples up to a redshift of z ~ 0.36. thegama and sdss surveys complement each other when analyzing the relationshipsbetween sfr, mass and z. we present evidence for sfr and metallicity evolutionto z ~ 0.2. we study the dependencies between sfr, mass, z, and specificstar-formation rate (ssfr) on the m-z, m-sfr, m-ssfr, z-sfr, and z-ssfrrelations, finding strong correlations between all. based on thosedependencies, we propose a simple model that allows us to explain the differentbehaviour observed between low and high mass galaxies. finally, our analysisallows us to confirm the existence of a fundamental plane, for which mass=f(z,sfr) in star-forming galaxies.

1306.2322	the hot and energetic universe: the astrophysics of galaxy groups and  clusters	as the nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies trace the large-scaledistribution of matter in the universe. they are thus privileged sites in whichto investigate the complex physics of structure formation. however, thecomplete story of how these structures grow, and how they dissipate thegravitational and non-thermal components of their energy budget over cosmictime, is still beyond our grasp. fundamental questions such as how do hotdiffuse baryons accrete and dynamically evolve in dark matter potentials? howand when was the energy that we observe in the icm generated and distributed?where and when are heavy elements produced and how are they circulated? arestill unanswered. most of the cluster baryons exists in the form of a diffuse,hot, metal-enriched plasma that radiates primarily in the x-ray band (theintracluster medium, icm), allowing the x-ray observations of the evolvingcluster population to provide a unique opportunity to address these topics.athena+ with its large collecting area and unprecedented combination of highspectral and angular resolution offers the only way to make major advances inanswering these questions. athena+ will show how the baryonic gas evolves inthe dark matter potential wells by studying the motions and turbulence in theicm. athena+ will be able to resolve the accreting region both spatially andspectroscopically, probing the true nature and physical state of the x-rayemitting plasma. athena+ has the capabilities to permit a definitiveunderstanding of the formation and evolution of large-scale cosmic structurethrough the study of the cluster population.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

0801.3430	galaxy-cluster gas-density distributions of the representative  xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess)	we present a study of the structural and scaling properties of the gasdistributions in the intracluster medium (icm) of 31 nearby (z &lt; 0.2) clustersobserved with xmm-newton, which together comprise the representative xmm-newtoncluster structure survey (rexcess). in contrast to previous studies, thissample is unbiased with respect to cluster dynamical state, and it fullysamples the cluster x-ray luminosity function. the clusters cover a temperaturerange of 2.0 -- 8.5 kev and possess a variety of morphologies. the samplingstrategy allows us to compare clusters with a wide range of central coolingtimes on an equal footing. we present non-parametric gas-density profiles outto distances ranging between 0.8 r_500 and 1.5 r_500. the central gas densitiesdiffer greatly from system to system, with no clear correlation with systemtemperature. at intermediate radii the scaled density profiles show much lessscatter, with a clear dependence on system temperature, consistent with thepresence of an entropy excess as suggested in previous literature. however, atlarge scaled radii this dependence becomes weaker: clusters with kt &gt; 3 kevscale self-similarly, with no temperature dependence of gas-densitynormalisation. we find some evidence of a correlation between dynamical stateand outer gas density slope, and between dynamical state and both central gasnormalisation and cooling time. we find no evidence of a significant bimodalityin the distributions of central density, density gradient, or cooling time.finally, we present the gas mass-temperature relation for the rexcess sample,which is consistent with the expectation of self-similar scaling modified bythe presence of an entropy excess in the inner regions of the cluster, and hasa logarithmic intrinsic scatter of ~10%.

1403.4610	galaxy cluster mass reconstruction project: i. methods and first results  on galaxy-based techniques	this paper is the first in a series in which we perform an extensivecomparison of various galaxy-based cluster mass estimation techniques thatutilise the positions, velocities and colours of galaxies. our primary aim isto test the performance of these cluster mass estimation techniques on adiverse set of models that will increase in complexity. we begin by providingparticipating methods with data from a simple model that delivers idealisedclusters, enabling us to quantify the underlying scatter intrinsic to thesemass estimation techniques. the mock catalogue is based on a halo occupationdistribution (hod) model that assumes spherical navarro, frenk and white (nfw)haloes truncated at r_200, with no substructure nor colour segregation, andwith isotropic, isothermal maxwellian velocities. we find that, above 10^14m_solar, recovered cluster masses are correlated with the true underlyingcluster mass with an intrinsic scatter of typically a factor of two. below10^14 m_solar, the scatter rises as the number of member galaxies drops andrapidly approaches an order of magnitude. we find that richness-based methodsdeliver the lowest scatter, but it is not clear whether such accuracy maysimply be the result of using an over-simplistic model to populate the galaxiesin their haloes. even when given the true cluster membership, large scatter isobserved for the majority non-richness-based approaches, suggesting that massreconstruction with a low number of dynamical tracers is inherentlyproblematic.

1407.0759	igm heating in fossil galaxy groups	we study intergalactic medium (igm) heating in a sample of five fossil galaxygroups by using their radio properties at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz. the power byradio jets introducing mechanical heating for the sampled objects is notsufficient enough to suppress the cooling flow. therefore, we discussed shock-,vortex heating, and conduction as alternative heating processes. further, the1.4 ghz and 610 mhz radio luminosities of fossil groups are compared to asample of normal galaxy groups of the same radio brightest (bggs), stellarmass, and total group stellar mass, quantified using the $k$-band luminosity.it appears that the fossil bggs are under luminous at 1.4 ghz and 610 mhz for agiven bgg stellar mass and luminosity, in comparison to a general population ofthe groups. in addition, we explore how the bolometric radio luminosity offossil sample depends on clusters and groups characteristics. using the highestx-ray flux galaxy cluster sample (hiflugcs) as a control sample we found thatthe large-scale behaviours of fossil galaxy groups are consistent with theirrelaxed and virialised nature.

astro-ph;0002051	the intragroup medium in loose groups of galaxies	we have used the rosat pspc to study the properties of a sample of 24 x-raybright galaxy groups, representing the largest sample examined in detail todate. hot plasma models are fitted to the spectral data to derive temperatures,and modified king models are used to characterise the surface brightnessprofiles. in agreement with previous work, we find evidence for the presence oftwo components in the surface brightness profiles. the extended component isgenerally found to be much flatter than that observed in galaxy clusters, andthere is evidence that the profiles follow a trend with system mass. we deriverelationships between x-ray luminosity, temperature and optical velocitydispersion. the relation between x-ray luminosity and temperature is found tobe l_x \propto t^{4.9}, which is significantly steeper than the same relationin galaxy clusters. these results are in good agreement with preheating models,in which galaxy winds raise the internal energy of the gas, inhibiting itscollapse into the shallow potential wells of poor systems.

astro-ph;0002082	the entropy and energy of intergalactic gas in galaxy clusters	studies of the x-ray surface brightness profiles of clusters, coupled withtheoretical considerations, suggest that the breaking of self-similarity in thehot gas results from an `entropy floor', established by some heating process,which affects the structure of the intracluster gas strongly in lower masssystems. fitting analytical models for the radial variation in gas density andtemperature to x-ray spectral images from the rosat pspc and asca gis, wederive gas entropy profiles for 20 galaxy clusters and groups. scaling theseprofiles to coincide in the self-similar case, the lowest mass systems arefound to have higher scaled entropy profiles than more massive systems. thisappears to be due to a baseline entropy of 70-140 h50^-1/3 kev cm^2, dependingon the extent to which shocks have been suppressed in low mass systems. theextra entropy may be present in all systems, but is detectable only in poorclusters, compared to the entropy generated by gravitational collapse. thisexcess entropy appears to be distributed uniformly with radius outside thecentral cooling regions. we determine the energy associated with this entropyfloor, by studying the net reduction in binding energy of the gas in low masssystems, and find that it corresponds to a preheating temperature of ~0.3 kev.since the relationship between entropy and energy injection depends upon gasdensity, we can combine the excesses of 70-140 kev cm^2 and 0.3 kev to derivethe typical electron density of the gas into which the energy was injected. theresulting value of 1-3x10^-4 h50^1/2 cm-3, implies that the heating must havehappened prior to cluster collapse but after a redshift z~7-10. the energyrequirement is well matched to the energy from supernova explosions responsiblefor the metals which now pollute the intracluster gas.

astro-ph;0009199	chandra study of an overdensity of x-ray sources around two distant  (z~0.5) clusters	we present results from a chandra x-ray observatory study of the field x-raysource populations in 4 different observations: two high-redshift (z~0.5)clusters of galaxies 3c295 and rxj003033.2+261819; and two non-cluster fieldswith similar exposure time. surprisingly, the 0.5-2 kev source surfacedensities (~900-1200 sources deg**-2 at a flux limit of 1.5x10**-15 ergcm**-2s**-1) measured in an ~8'x8' area surrounding each cluster exceed by afactor of ~2 the value expected on the basis of the rosat and chandralogn-logs, with a significance of ~2 sigma each, or ~3.5 sigma when the 2fields are combined (i.e. a probability to be a statistical fluctuation of &lt;1%and &lt;0.04%, respectively). the same analysis performed on the non-clusterfields and on the outer chips of the cluster fields does not show evidence ofsuch an excess. in both cluster fields, the summed 0.5-10 kev spectrum of thedetected objects is well fitted by a power-law with gamma~1.7 similar to agnsand shows no sign of intrinsic absorption. the few (~10 out of 35) opticalidentifications available to date confirm that most of them are, as expected,agns but the number of redshifts available is too small to allow conclusions ontheir nature. we discuss possible interpretations of the overdensity in termsof: a statistical variation of cosmic background sources; a concentration ofagns and/or powerful starburst galaxies associated with the clusters; and gravitational lensing of background qso's by the galaxy clusters. allexplanations are however difficult to reconcile with the large number of excesssources detected. deeper x-ray observations and more redshifts measurements areclearly required to settle the issue.

astro-ph;0010608	xmm-newton observations of ngc 253: resolving the emission components in  the disk and nuclear area	the high xmm-newton throughput allows a detailed investigation of thespatial, spectral and variability properties of the extended and point sourceemission of the starburst galaxy ngc 253 simultaneously. we characterize thebrightest sources by their hardness ratios, detect a bright x-ray transient,and show the spectrum and light curve of the brightest point source, mostlikely a black-hole x-ray binary. the unresolved emission of two disk regionscan be modeled by two thin thermal plasma components of 0.13 and 0.4 kev plusresidual harder emission, with the lower temperature component originating fromabove the disk, the nuclear spectrum by a three temperature plasma (~0.6, 0.9,and 6 kev) with the higher temperatures increasingly absorbed. the hightemperature component most likely originates from the starburst nucleus. nonon-thermal component, that would point at a significant contribution from anactive nucleus (agn), is needed. assuming that type iia supernova remnants(snrs) are mostly responsible for the e&gt;4 kev emission, the detection with epicof the 6.7 kev line allows us to estimate a supernova rate within the nuclearstarburst of 0.2 yr^-1. rgs spectra and epic images reveal that thelimb-brightening of the plume is mostly seen in higher ionization emissionlines, while in the lower ionization lines, and below 0.5 kev, the plume ismore homogeneously structured.

astro-ph;0107461	rosat pspc observations of nearby spiral galaxies - ii. statistical  properties	we present a statistical analysis of the largest x-ray survey of nearbyspiral galaxies in which diffuse emission has been separated from discretesource contributions. regression and rank-order correlation analyses are usedto compare x-ray properties such as total, source and diffuse luminosities, anddiffuse emission temperature, with a variety of physical and multi-wavelengthproperties, such as galaxy mass, type and activity, and optical and infraredluminosity. the results are discussed in terms of the way in which hot gas anddiscrete x-ray sources scale with the mass and activity of galaxies, and withthe star formation rate. we find that the x-ray properties of starburstgalaxies are dependent primarily on their star-forming activity, whilst formore quiescent galaxies, galaxy mass is the more important parameter. one ofthe most intriguing results is the tight linear scaling between far-infraredand diffuse x-ray luminosity across the sample, even though the hot gas changesfrom a hydrostatic corona to a free wind across the activity range sampledhere.

astro-ph;0203502	the effects of similarity breaking on the intracluster medium	we construct a family of simple analytical models of galaxy clusters at thepresent epoch and compare its predictions with observational data. we exploretwo processes that break the self-similarity of galaxy clusters: systematicvariation in the dark matter halo concentration and energy injection into theintracluster gas, through their effects on the observed cluster properties.three observed relations between cluster properties and temperature areemployed to constrain the model; mass, slope of gas density profile (beta) andluminosity. the slope of the mass-temperature relation is found to bereproduced by our model when the observed variation in concentration isincluded, raising the slope from the self-similar prediction of 1.5, to that ofthe observed relation, ~ 2. heating of the gas is observed to have littleeffect on the mass-temperature relation. the mean trend in the beta-temperaturerelation is reproduced by energy injection of 0.5-0.75 kev per particle, whileconcentration variation has only a small effect. excess energies calculated forindividual systems from the beta-temperature relation suggest that the lowestmass systems may have excess energies that are biased to lower values byselection effects. the observed properties of the luminosity-temperaturerelation are reproduced by the combined effects of excess energy and a trend inthe dark matter concentration. at high masses the observed variation in darkmatter concentration results a slope of ~ 2.7 compared to recent observationsin the range 2.6-2.9, whilst the observed steepening in galaxy groups ispredicted when heating of 0.5-0.75 kev per particle is included. hence acombination of energy injection and dark matter concentration variation appearsable to account for the mean trends in the observed relations.

astro-ph;0206362	asca observations of groups at radii of low overdensity. implications  for the cosmic preheating	through a 3d-modeling of asca observations, we performed a spatially resolvedx-ray spectroscopic study, extending to radii exceeding 150 kpc, for a sampleof 9 groups of galaxies. combined with published rosat results, we concludethat these systems generally exhibit a strong temperature decline at outerradii. in our best case, ngc3268, this corresponds to a flattening of theentropy profile at a level of ~400 kev cm^2. this value is high compared bothto the observed entropy floor of ~100 kev cm^2 and to the expected value fromgravitational heating. we suggest that the observed entropy profile in mostgroups at densities exceeding 500 times the critical is purely driven bynon-gravitational heating processes. after comparison with a larger sample ofgroups and clusters, we conclude that there is a variation in the level ofnon-gravitational heating between ~100 kev cm^2 and ~400 kev cm^2 within everysystem. using models of cluster formation as a reference frame, we establishedthat the accreted gas reaches an entropy level of 400 kev cm^2 by redshift2.0-2.5, while such high entropies where not present at redshifts higher than2.8-3.5, favoring nearly instantaneous preheating. adopting galactic winds as asource of preheating, and scaling the released energy by the observed metalabundance, the variation in the preheating could be ascribed mostly tovariation in the typical overdensity of the energy injection, ~30 for anentropy floor (100 kev cm^2) and to ~5 for an entropy of 400 kev cm^2.

astro-ph;0211350	the detection of diffuse emission in hcg 16 with xmm-newton	we report results obtained from analysis of the xmm-newton observation of thecompact group of galaxies hcg 16. it is a peculiar system composed of 7spirals,  6 of which are active, and its nature as a bound system has been muchdebated. the epic camera observations give new insights into the x-rayparameters describing the physical status of the group. we detect diffuse x-rayemission with a rather elliptical morphology which extends to at least a radiusof 135 h^{-1}_{50} kpc from the group centre. the spectrum within this regionis well modelled by a thermal plasma with a temperature of 0.49+/-0.17 kev, anda non-zero metallicity. we measure a bolometric x-ray luminosity of 9.6 10{^40}h^{-2}_{50} erg/s which may be only a small fraction of the total luminositybecause of the limit in spatial detection arising from the high backgroundlevel. despite its low temperature and luminosity, hcg 16 obeys the lx-trelation obtained for brighter galaxy groups even if it lies in a very extremeposition. the properties of the diffuse emission confirm the bound nature ofhcg 16 even if the gas trapped in the potential well may not yet be virialized.this reopens the debate about the real nature of spiral-dominated galaxygroups, and on their role in a more general cosmological context.

astro-ph;0301049	the birmingham-cfa cluster scaling project - i: gas fraction and the m-t  relation	we have assembled a large sample of virialized systems, comprising 66 galaxyclusters, groups and elliptical galaxies with high quality x-ray data. to eachsystem we have fitted analytical profiles describing the gas density andtemperature variation with radius, corrected for the effects of central gascooling. we present an analysis of the scaling properties of these systems andfocus in this paper on the gas distribution and m-t relation. in addition toclusters and groups, our sample includes two early-type galaxies, carefullyselected to avoid contamination from group or cluster x-ray emission. wecompare the properties of these objects with those of more massive systems andfind evidence for a systematic difference between galaxy-sized haloes andgroups of a similar temperature. we derive a mean logarithmic slope of the m-trelation within r_200 of 1.84+/-0.06, although there is some evidence of agradual steepening in the m-t relation, with decreasing mass. we recover asimilar slope using two additional methods of calculating the mean temperature.repeating the analysis with the assumption of isothermality, we find the slopechanges only slightly, to 1.89+/-0.04, but the normalization is increased by30%. correspondingly, the mean gas fraction within r_200 changes from(0.13+/-0.01)h70^-1.5 to (0.11+/-0.01)h70^-1.5, for the isothermal case, withthe smaller fractional change reflecting different behaviour between hot andcool systems. there is a strong correlation between the gas fraction within0.3*r_200 and temperature. this reflects the strong (5.8 sigma) trend betweenthe gas density slope parameter, beta, and temperature, which has been found inprevious work.

astro-ph;0304048	the birmingham-cfa cluster scaling project - iii: entropy and similarity  in galaxy systems	we examine profiles and scaling properties of the entropy of theintergalactic gas in a sample of 66 virialized systems, ranging in mass fromsingle elliptical galaxies to rich clusters, for which we have resolved x-raytemperature profiles. some of the properties we derive appear to beinconsistent with any of the models put forward to explain the breaking ofself-similarity in the baryon content of clusters. in particular, the entropyprofiles, scaled to the virial radius, are broadly similar in form across thesample, apart from a normalization factor which differs from the simpleself-similar scaling with temperature. low mass systems do not show the largeisentropic cores predicted by preheating models, and the high entropy excessesreported at large radii in groups by finoguenov et al (2002) are confirmed, andfound to extend even to moderately rich clusters. we discuss the implicationsof these results for the evolutionary history of the hot gas in clusters, andsuggest that preheating may affect the entropy of intracluster gas primarily byreducing the density of material accreting into groups and clusters alongcosmic filaments.

astro-ph;0304257	the nature and space density of fossil groups of galaxies	we describe the properties of a sample of galaxy groups with very unusualdistributions of galaxy luminosities. the most extreme example has an x-rayluminosity similar to that of the virgo cluster but has a very low richness,with only one galaxy brighter than l*, compared with six in virgo. that onegalaxy, however, is optically more luminous than any galaxy in virgo and has anoptical luminosity as bright as many of the central cd galaxies in rich abellclusters. the characteristic feature of the fossil groups we study is that mostof the light arises from one dominant, central galaxy. we define a fossilsystem and, based on this definition, construct a small x-ray selected,flux-limited sample of fossil groups with well known selection criteria. weconfirm that these systems are indeed groups of galaxies, but dominated by onecentral luminous giant elliptical galaxy and with few, or no, l* galaxies. wefind that fossil systems represent 8%-20% of all systems of the same x-rayluminosity. fossil groups are at least as numerous as all poor and richclusters combined, and are thus a possible site for the formation of luminouscentral cluster galaxies before infall into clusters occurs. the fossil systemsin our sample have significantly higher x-ray luminosities than normal groupsof similar total optical luminosities (or similar x-ray temperature, where thelatter can be measured). these enhanced x-ray luminosities may be due torelatively cool gas in the innermost regions or due to a low central gasentropy. we interpret fossil groups as old, undisturbed systems which haveavoided infall into clusters, but where galaxy merging of most of the l*galaxies has occurred. an early formation epoch, before that of most groups,could explain low central gas entropies and high x-ray luminosities.

astro-ph;0304554	a variable ultraluminous supersoft x-ray source in "the antennae":  stellar-mass black hole or white dwarf?	the chandra monitoring observations of the antennae (ngc 4038/39) have led tothe discovery of a variable, luminous, supersoft source (sss). this source isonly detected at energies below 2 kev and, in 2002 may, reached count ratescomparable to those of the nine ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) detected inthese galaxies. spectral fits of the sss data give acceptable results only fora $\sim$100--90 ev blackbody spectrum with an intrinsic absorption column of$n_{\rm h} \sim 2-3 \times 10^{21} \rm cm^{-2}$. for a distance of 19 mpc, thebest-fit observed luminosity increases from 1.7$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 1999december to 8.0$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 2002 may. the intrinsic,absorption-corrected best-fit luminosity reaches 1.4$\times 10^{40}$ \ergs in2002 may. the assumption of unbeamed emission would suggest a black hole of$\ga$100\msun. however, if the emission is blackbody at all times, as suggestedby the steep soft spectrum, the radiating area would have to vary by a factorof $\sim10^3$, inconsistent with gravitational energy release from within a fewschwarzschild radii of a black hole. viable explanations for the observedproperties of the sss are provided by anisotropic emission from either anaccreting nuclear-burning white dwarf or an accreting stellar-mass black hole.

astro-ph;0307457	the birmingham-cfa cluster scaling project - ii. mass composition and  distribution	we investigate the spatial distribution of the baryonic and non-baryonic masscomponents in a sample of 66 virialized systems. we have used x-raymeasurements to determine the deprojected temperature and density structure ofthe intergalactic medium and have employed these to map the underlyinggravitational potential. in addition, we have measured the deprojected spatialdistribution of galaxy luminosity for a subset of this sample, spanning over 2decades in mass. with this combined x-ray/optical study we examine the scalingproperties of the baryons and address the issue of mass-to-light (m/l) ratio ingroups and clusters of galaxies. we measure a median mass-to-light ratio of 224h70 m/l (solar) in the rest frame b_j band, in good agreement with othermeasurements based on x-ray determined masses. there is no trend in m/l withx-ray temperature and no significant trend for mass to increase faster thanluminosity: m \propto \l_{b,j}^{1.08 +/- 0.12}. this implied lack ofsignificant variation in star formation efficiency suggests that gas coolingcannot be greatly enhanced in groups, unless it drops out to form baryonic darkmatter. correspondingly, our results indicate that non-gravitational heatingmust have played a significant role in establishing the observed departure fromself-similarity in low mass systems. the median baryon fraction for our sampleis 0.162 h70^{-3/2}, which allows us to place an upper limit on thecosmological matter density, omega_m &lt;= 0.27 h70^{-1}, in good agreement withthe latest results from wmap. we find evidence of a systematic trend towardshigher central density concentration in the coolest haloes, indicative of anearly formation epoch and consistent with hierarchical formation models.

astro-ph;0312292	scaling relations in early-type galaxies belonging to groups	we present a photometric analysis of a large sample of early-type galaxies in16 nearby groups, imaged with the wide-field camera on the isaac newtontelescope. using a two-dimensional surface brightness decomposition routine, wefit sersic (r^{1/n}) and exponential models to their bulge and disk componentsrespectively. dividing the galaxies into three subsamples according to thex-ray luminosities of their parent groups, we compare their photometricproperties. galaxies in x-ray luminous groups tend to be larger and moreluminous than those in groups with undetected or low x-ray luminosities, but nosignificant differences in n are seen. both normal and dwarf ellipticalgalaxies in the central regions of groups are found to have cuspier profilesthan their counterparts in group outskirts.  structural differences between dwarf and normal elliptical galaxies areapparent in terms of an offset between their ``photometric planes'' in thespace of n, r_e and mu_0. dwarf ellipticals are found to populate a surface,with remarkably low scatter, in this space with significant curvature, somewhatsimilar to the surfaces of constant entropy proposed by marquez etal (2001).normal ellipticals are offset from this distribution in a direction of higherspecific entropy. this may indicate that the two populations are distinguishedby the action of galaxy merging on larger galaxies.

astro-ph;0405557	xmm-newton observations of the late-stage merger-remnant galaxies ngc  3921 and ngc 7252	using the high sensitivity of xmm, we have studied the x-ray emission of thetwo proto-typical late-stage merger remnants, ngc 3921 and ngc 7252. in thecase of ngc 7252, this is complemented by archival chandra data. we investigatethe nature of the discrete x-ray point source populations and the hot diffusegas components in these two galaxies, and compare them in the light of theirdifferent merger ages and histories. we detect 3 candidate ultra-luminous x-raypoint sources in ngc 3921 and at least 6 in ngc 7252, for which we have highspatial resolution chandra data. these have luminosities ranging from\~1.4x10^39-10^40 erg s^-1 (for h_0= 75 km s-1 mpc^-1). we expect these ulxs tobe high mass x-ray binaries, associated with the recent star formation in thesetwo galaxies. extended hot gas is observed in both galaxies. we have sufficientcounts in the xmm data to fit two-component hot plasma models to their x-rayspectra and estimate the x-ray luminosities of the hot diffuse gas componentsto be 2.75x10^40 erg s^-1 and 2.09x10^40 erg s^-1 in ngc 3921 and ngc 7252,respectively. these luminosities are low compared with the luminositiesobserved in typical mature elliptical galaxies lx ~10^(41-42) erg s^-1), intowhich these merger remnants are expected to evolve. we do not see evidence thatthe x-ray halos of these galaxies are currently being regenerated to the massesand luminosities seen in typical elliptical galaxies. the mass of atomic gasavailable to fall back into the main bodies of these galaxies and shock-heat tox-ray temperatures is insufficient for this to be the sole halo regenerationmechanism. we conclude that halo regeneration is most likely a long-term (&gt;10gyr) process, occurring predominantly via mass loss from evolving stars, in asub-sonic outflow stage commencing ~2 gyr after the merging event.

astro-ph;0504265	entropy amplification from energy feedback in simulated galaxy groups  and clusters	we use hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups to study theeffect of pre-heating on the entropy structure of the icm. our simulationsaccount for non-gravitational heating of the gas either by imposing a minimumentropy floor at redshift z=3, or by considering feedback by galactic windspowered by supernova (sn) energy. in the adiabatic simulations we find that theentropy is increased out to the external regions as a consequence of thetransition from clumpy to smooth accretion induced by extra heating. thisresult is in line with the predictions of the semi-analytical model by voit etal. however, the introduction of radiative cooling substantially reduces thisentropy amplification effect. while galactic winds of increasing strength areeffective in regulating star formation, they have a negligible effect on theentropy profile of cluster-sized halos. only in models where the action of thewinds is complemented with diffuse heating corresponding to a pre-collapseentropy do we find a sizable entropy amplification out to the virial radius ofthe groups. observational evidence for entropy amplification in the outskirtsof galaxy clusters and groups therefore favours a scenario for feedback thatdistributes heating energy in a more diffuse way than predicted by the modelfor galactic winds from sn explosions explored here.

astro-ph;0509034	chemical enrichment of the complex hot ism of the antennae galaxies: ii.  physical properties of the hot gas and supernova feedback	we investigate the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) inthe merging pair of galaxies known as the antennae (ngc 4038/39), using thedeep coadded ~411 ks chandra acis-s data set. the method of analysis and someof the main results from the spectral analysis, such as metal abundances andtheir variations from ~0.2 to ~20-30 times solar, are described in paper i(baldi et al. submitted). in the present paper we investigate in detail thephysics of the hot emitting gas, deriving measures for the hot-gas mass (~10^m_sun), cooling times (10^7-10^8 yr), and pressure (3.5x10^-11-2.8x10^-10 dynecm^-2). at least in one of the two nuclei (ngc 4038) the hot-gas pressure issignificantly higher than the co pressure, implying that shock waves may bedriven into the co clouds. comparison of the metal abundances with the averagestellar yields predicted by theoretical models of sn explosions points to sneof type ii as the main contributors of metals to the hot ism. there is noevidence of any correlation between radio-optical star-formation indicators andthe measured metal abundances. although due to uncertainties in the average gasdensity we cannot exclude that mixing may have played an important role, theshort time required to produce the observed metal masses (&lt;=2 myr) suggeststhat the correlations are unlikely to have been destroyed by efficient mixing.more likely, a significant fraction of sn ii ejecta may be in a cool phase, ingrains, or escaping in hot winds. in each case, any such fraction of the ejectawould remain undetectable with soft x-ray observations.

astro-ph;0607177	the xmm large scale structure survey: the x-ray pipeline and survey  selection function	we present the x-ray pipeline developed for the purpose of the cluster searchin the xmm-lss survey. it is based on a two-stage procedure via a dedicatedhandling of the poisson nature of the signal: (1) source detection onmulti-resolution wavelet filtered images; (2) source analysis by means of amaximum likelihood fit to the photon images. the source detection efficiencyand characterisation are studied through extensive monte-carlo simulations.this led us to define two samples of extended sources: the c1 class that isuncontaminated, and the less restrictive c2 class that allows for 50%contamination. the resulting predicted selection function is presented and thecomparison to the current xmm-lss confirmed cluster sample shows very goodagreement. we arrive at average predicted source densities of about 7 c1 and 12c2 per deg2, which is higher than any available wide field x-ray survey. wefinally notice a substantial deviation of the predicted redshift distributionfor our samples from the one obtained using the usual assumption of a fluxlimited sample.

astro-ph;0611846	xmm-newton study of 0.012&lt;z&lt;0.024 groups. i: overview of the igm  thermodynamics	we study the thermodynamic properties of the hot gas in a sample of groups inthe 0.012-0.024 redshift range, using xmm-newton observations. we presentmeasurements of temperature, entropy, pressure and iron abundance.non-parametric fits are used to derive the mean properties of the sample and tostudy dispersion in the values of entropy and pressure. the scaling of theentropy at 0.2r500 matches well the results of ponman et al. (2003). however,compared to cool clusters, the groups in our sample reveal larger entropy atinner radii and a substantially flatter slope in the entropy in the outskirts,compared to both the prediction of pure gravitational heating and toobservations of clusters. this difference corresponds to the systematicallyflatter group surface brightness profiles, reported previously. the scaledpressure profiles can be well approximated with a sersic model with n=4. wefind that groups exhibit a systematically larger dispersion in pressure,compared to clusters of galaxies, while the dispersion in entropy is similar.

astro-ph;0612350	agn heating in galaxy groups: a statistical study	we present gas temperature, density, entropy and cooling time profiles forthe cores of a sample of 15 galaxy groups observed with {\it chandra}. we findthat the entropy profiles follow a power-law profile down to very smallfractions of $r_{500}$. differences between the gas profiles of groups withradio loud and radio quiet bggs are only marginally significant, and there isonly a small difference in the $l_x:t_x$ relations, for the central regions westudy with {\it chandra}, between the radio-loud and radio-quiet objects in oursample, in contrast to the much larger difference found on scales of the wholegroup in earlier work. however, there is evidence, from splitting the samplebased on the mass of the central black holes, that repeated outbursts of agnactivity may have a long term cumulative effect on the entropy profiles. weargue that, to first-order, energy injection from radio sources does not changethe global structure of the gas in the cores of groups, although it candisplace gas on a local level. in most systems, it appears that agn energyinjection serves primarily to counter the effects of radiative cooling, ratherthan being responsible for the similarity breaking between groups and clusters.

astro-ph;0703553	the representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess) of an  x-ray luminosity selected galaxy cluster sample	the largest uncertainty for cosmological studies using clusters of galaxiesis introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy clusterstructure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass.to improve on this situation we have started an xmm-newton large programme forthe in-depth study of a representative sample of 33 galaxy clusters, selectedin the redshift range z=0.055 to 0.183 from the reflex cluster survey, havingx-ray luminosities above 0.4 x 10^44 h_70^-2 erg s^-1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kevband. this paper introduces the sample, compiles properties of the clusters,and provides detailed information on the sample selection function. we describethe selection of a nearby galaxy cluster sample that makes optimal use of thexmm-newton field-of-view, and provides nearly homogeneous x-ray luminositycoverage for the full range from poor clusters to the most massive objects inthe universe. for the clusters in the sample, x-ray fluxes are derived andcompared to the previously obtained fluxes from the rosat all-sky survey. wefind that the fluxes and the flux errors have been reliably determined in therosat all-sky survey analysis used for the reflex survey. we use the sampleselection function documented in detail in this paper to determine the x-rayluminosity function, and compare it with the luminosity function of the entirereflex sample. we also discuss morphological peculiarities of some of thesample members. the sample and some of the background data given in thisintroductory paper will be important for the application of these data in thedetailed studies of cluster structure, to appear in forthcoming publications.

astro-ph;0703595	the chandra view of galaxy mergers	from a chandra survey of nine interacting galaxy systems the evolution ofx-ray emission during the merger process has been investigated. it is foundthat the x-ray luminosity peaks ~300 myr before nuclear coalescence, and thendips, even though we know that rapid and increasing activity is still takingplace at this time. it is likely that this drop in x-ray luminosity is aconsequence of outflows breaking out of the galactic discs of these systems. inthis work it is also shown that, for the systems close to the point of nuclearcoalescence, lfir becomes massively enhanced compared to the x-ray luminosityof these systems. we suggest that this enhancement may indicate a `top heavy'imf, with an enhanced fraction of massive stars. at a time ~1 gyr aftercoalescence, the merger-remnants in our sample are x-ray faint when compared totypical mature elliptical galaxies. however, we do see evidence that thesesystems will start to resemble typical elliptical galaxies at a greaterdynamical age, given the properties of the 3 gyr system within our sample,supporting the idea that halo regeneration will take place within low lxmerger-remnants. also as a part of this survey, detailed chandra observationsfor the double nucleus merger system mkn 266 and the merger-remnant arp 222 arepresented for the first time.

astro-ph;9703163	the origin of the cosmic soft x-ray background: optical identification  of an extremely deep rosat survey	we present the results of the deepest optically identified x-ray survey yetmade. the x-ray survey was made with the rosat pspc and reaches a flux limit of1.6x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.5--2.0 kev). above a flux limit of 2x10^-15 ergcm^-2 s^-1 we define a complete sample of 70 sources of which 59 areidentified. some (5) other sources have tentative identifications and in afurther 4 the x-ray error-boxes are blank to r=23 mag. at the brighter fluxlevels (&gt;= 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1) we confirm the results of previous less deepx-ray surveys with 84% of the sources begin qsos. at fainter fluxes, however,the survey is dominated by a population of galaxies with narrow opticalemission lines (nelgs). in addition, a number of groups and clusters ofgalaxies are found at intermediate fluxes. most of these are poor systems oflow x-ray luminosity and are generally found at redshifts of &gt; 0.3. theirnumbers are consistent with a zero evolutionary scenario, in contrast to thesituation for high luminosity clusters at the same redshift. we discuss thesignificance of these results to the determination of the cosmic soft x-raybackground (xrb) and show that at 2x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, we have resolvedmore than 50% of the background. we also briefly consider the probableimportance of nelg objects to the residual background and look at some of theproperties of these unusual objects.

astro-ph;9704064	the properties of the hot gas in galaxy groups and clusters from 1-d  hydrodynamical simulations -- i. cosmological infall models	we report the results of 1-d hydrodynamical modelling of the evolution of gasin galaxy clusters. we have incorporated many of the effects missing fromearlier 1-d treatments: improved modelling of the dark matter and galaxydistributions, cosmologically realistic evolution of the cluster potential, andthe effects of a multiphase cooling flow. the model utilises a fairly standard1-d lagrangian hydrodynamical code to calculate the evolution of theintracluster gas. this is coupled to a theoretical model for the growth of darkmatter density perturbations. the main advantages of this treatment over 3-dcodes are (1) improved spatial resolution within the cooling flow region, (2)much faster execution time, allowing a fuller exploration of parameter space,and (3) the inclusion of additional physics.  in the present paper, we explore the development of infall models -- in whichgas relaxes into a deepening potential well -- covering a wide range of clustermass scales. we find that such simple models reproduce many of the globalproperties of observed clusters. very strong cooling flows develop in these 1-dcluster models. in practice, disruption by major mergers probably reduces thecooling rate in most clusters. the models overpredict the gas fraction in lowmass systems, indicating the need for additional physical processes, such aspreheating or galaxy winds, which become important on small mass scales.

astro-ph;9801317	the x-ray evolution of merging galaxies	we present here the first study of the x-ray properties of an evolutionarysample of merging galaxies. both rosat pspc and hri data are presented for asample of eight interacting galaxy systems, each believed to involve a similarencounter between two spiral discs of approximately equal size. the mergersspan a large range in age, from completely detached to fully merged systems. agreat deal of interesting x-ray structure is seen, and the x-ray properties ofeach individual system are discussed in detail. along the merging sequence,several trends are evident: in the case of several of the infrared brightsystems, the diffuse emission is very extended, and appears to arise frommaterial ejected from the galaxies. the onset of this process seems to occurvery soon after the galaxies first encounter one another, and these ejectionssoon evolve into distorted flows. more massive extensions (perhaps involving upto 1e10 solar masses of hot gas) are seen at the `ultraluminous' peak of theinteraction, as the galactic nuclei coalesce. the amplitude of the evolution ofthe x-ray emission through a merger is markedly different from that of theinfrared and radio emission however, and this, we believe, may well be linkedwith the large extensions of hot gas observed. the late, relaxed remnants,appear relatively devoid of gas, and possess an x-ray halo very different fromthat of typical ellipticals, a problem for the `merger hypothesis', whereby themerger of two disc galaxies results in an elliptical galaxy. however, thesesystems are still relatively young in terms of total merger lifetime, and theymay still have a few gyr of evolution to go through, before they resembletypical elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9806230	the mass and dynamical state of abell 2218	abell 2218 is one of a handful of clusters in which x-ray and lensinganalyses of the cluster mass are in strong disagreement. it is also a systemfor which x-ray data and radio measurements of the sunyaev-zel'dovich decrementhave been combined in an attempt to constrain the hubble constant. however, inthe absence of reliable information on the temperature structure of theintracluster gas, most analyses have been carried out under the assumption ofisothermality. we combine x-ray data from the rosat pspc and the asca gisinstruments, enabling us to fit non-isothermal models, and investigate theimpact that this has on the x-ray derived mass and the predictedsunyaev-zel'dovich effect.  we find that a strongly non-isothermal model for the intracluster gas, whichimplies a central cusp in the cluster mass distribution, is consistent with theavailable x-ray data and compatible with the lensing results. at r&lt;1 arcmin,there is strong evidence to suggest that the cluster departs from a simplerelaxed model. we analyse the dynamics of the galaxies and find that thecentral galaxy velocity dispersion is too high to allow a physical solution forthe galaxy orbits. the quality of the radio and x-ray data do not at presentallow very restrictive constraints to be placed on h_0. it is apparent thatearlier analyses have under-estimated the uncertainties involved. however,values greater than 50 km/s/mpc are preferred when lensing constraints aretaken into account.

astro-ph;9810359	the imprint of galaxy formation on x-ray clusters	it is widely believed that structure in the universe evolves hierarchically,as primordial density fluctuations, amplified by gravity, collapse and merge toform progressively larger systems. the structure and evolution of x-rayclusters, however, seems at odds with this hierarchical scenario for structureformation. poor clusters and groups, as well as most distant clusters detectedto date, are substantially fainter than expected from the tight relationsbetween luminosity, temperature and redshift predicted by these models. here weshow that these discrepancies arise because, near the centre, the entropy ofthe hot, diffuse intracluster medium (icm) is higher tha$ achievable throughgravitational collapse, indicating substantial non-gravitational heating of theicm. we estimate this excess entropy for the first time, and argue that itrepresents a relic of the energetic winds through which forming galaxiespolluted the icm with metals. energetically, this is onl$ possible if the icmis heated at modest redshift ($z \ltsim 2$) but prior to cluster collapse,indicating that the formation of galaxies precedes that of clusters and thatmost clusters have been assembled very recently.

astro-ph;9901100	constraining the role of sn ia and sn ii in galaxy groups by spatially  resolved analysis of rosat and asca observations	we present the results of modelling the distribution of gas properties in thegalaxy groups hcg51, hcg62 and ngc5044, and in the poor cluster awm7, usingboth asca sis and rosat data. the spectral quality of the asca data allows theradial distribution in the abundances of several elements to be resolved. inall systems apart from hcg51, we see both central cooling flows, and a generaldecline in metal abundances with radius. the ratio of iron to alpha-elementabundances varies significantly, and in comparison with theoretical supernovayields, indicates a significant contribution to the metal abundance of theintergalactic medium (igm) from type ia supernovae. this is seen both withinthe groups, and also throughout much of the cluster awm7. the total energyinput into the igm from supernovae can be calculated from our results, and istypically 20-40 per cent of the thermal energy of the gas, mostly from sne ii.our results support the idea that the sn ii ejecta have been more widelydistributed in the igm, probably due to the action of galaxy winds, and thelower iron mass to light ratio in groups suggests that some of this enrichedgas has been lost altogether from the shallower potential wells of the smallersystems.

astro-ph;9908150	an asca study of the heavy element distribution in clusters of galaxies	we perform a spatially resolved x-ray spectroscopic study of a set of 11relaxed clusters of galaxies observed by the rosat/pspc and asca/sis. using amethod which corrects for the energy dependent effects of the asca psf based onrosat images, we constrain the spatial distribution of ne, si, s and fe in eachcluster. theoretical prescriptions for the chemical yields of type ia and iisupernovae, then allow determination of the fe enrichment from both types ofsupernovae as a function of radius within each cluster. using opticalmeasurements from the literature, we also determine the iron mass-to-lightratio (imlr) separately for fe synthesized in both types of supernovae. forclusters with the best photon statistics, we find that the total fe abundancedecreases significantly with radius, while the si abundance is either flat ordecreases less rapidly, resulting in an increasing si/fe ratio with radius.this result indicates a greater predominance of type ii sne enrichment at largeradii in clusters. we suggest that the high si/fe ratios in the outskirts ofrich clusters may arise from enrichment by type ii sne released to icm viagalactic star burst driven winds. abridged.
