0904.0452	the chandra deep protocluster survey: ly-alpha blobs are powered by  heating, not cooling	we present the results of a 400ks chandra survey of 29 extended ly-alphaemitting nebulae (ly-alpha blobs, labs) in the z=3.09 proto-cluster in thessa22 field. we detect luminous x-ray counterparts in five labs, implying alarge fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn) in labs, f_agn = 17% down tol_2-32kev ~ 10^44 erg/s. all of the agn appear to be heavily obscured, withspectral indices implying obscuring column densities of n_h &gt; 10^23 cm^-2. theagn fraction should be considered a lower limit, since several more labs notdetected with chandra show agn signatures in their mid-infrared emission. weshow that the uv luminosities of the agn are easily capable of powering theextended ly-alpha emission via photo-ionization alone. when combined with theuv flux from a starburst component, and energy deposited by mechanicalfeedback, we demonstrate that 'heating' by a central source, rather thangravitational cooling is the most likely power source of labs. we argue thatall labs could be powered in this manner, but that the luminous host galaxiesare often just below the sensitivity limits of current instrumentation, or areheavily obscured. no individual labs show evidence for extended x-ray emission,and a stack equivalent to a &gt;9ms exposure of an average lab also yields nostatistical detection of a diffuse x-ray component. the resulting diffusex-ray/ly-alpha luminosity limit implies there is no hot (t&gt;10^7 k) gascomponent in these halos, and also rules out inverse compton scattering ofcosmic microwave background photons, or local far-infrared photons, as a viablepower source for labs.

0908.0819	a 100-kpc inverse compton x-ray halo around 4c60.07 at z=3.79	we analyse a 100-ks chandra observation of the powerful radio galaxy, 4c60.07at z=3.79. we identify extended x-ray emission with lx~10^45 erg/s across a~90-kpc region around the radio galaxy. the energetics of this x-ray halo andits morphological similarity to the radio emission from the galaxy suggest thatit arises from inverse compton (ic) scattering, by relativistic electrons inthe radio jets, of cosmic microwave background photons and potentiallyfar-infrared photons from the dusty starbursts around this galaxy. the x-rayemission has a similar extent and morphology to the ly-alpha halo around thegalaxy, suggesting that it may be ionising this halo. indeed we find that theghz-radio and x-ray and ly-alpha luminosities of the halo around 4c60.07 areidentical to those of 4c41.17 (also at z=3.8) implying that these threecomponents are linked by a single physical process. this is only the secondexample of highly-extended ic emission known at z&gt;3, but it underlines thepotential importance of ic emission in the formation of the most massivegalaxies at high redshifts. in addition, we detect two x-ray luminous activegalactic nuclei (agn) within ~30kpc of the radio galaxy. these two companionagn imply that the radio and starburst activity in the radio galaxy istriggered through multiple mergers of massive progenitors on a short timescale,~100myrs. these discoveries demonstrate the wealth of information whichsensitive x-ray observations can yield into the formation of massive galaxiesat high redshifts.

0909.2258	the roadmap for unification in galaxy group selection:. i. a search for  extended x-ray emission in the cnoc2 survey	x-ray properties of galaxy groups can unlock some of the most challengingresearch topics in modern extragalactic astronomy: the growth of structure andits influence on galaxy formation. only with the advent of the chandra and xmmfacilities have x-ray observations reached the depths required to address thesequestions in a satisfactory manner. here we present an x-ray imaging study oftwo patches from the cnoc2 spectroscopic galaxy survey using combined chandraand xmm data. a state of the art extended source finding algorithm has beenapplied, and the resultant source catalog, including redshifts from aspectroscopic follow-up program, is presented. the total number ofspectroscopically identified groups is 25 spanning a redshift range 0.04-0.79.approximately 50% of cnoc2 spectroscopically selected groups in the deeperx-ray (ra14h) field are likely x-ray detections, compared to 20% in theshallower (ra21h) field. statistical modeling shows that this is consistentwith expectations, assuming an expected evolution of the lx-m relation. asignificant detection of a stacked shear signal for both spectroscopic andx-ray groups indicates that both samples contain real groups of about theexpected mass. we conclude that the current area and depth of x-ray andspectroscopic facilities provide a unique window of opportunity at z~0.4 totest the x-ray appearance of galaxy groups selected in various ways. there isat present no evidence that the correlation between x-ray luminosity andvelocity dispersion evolves significantly with redshift, which implies thatcatalogs based on either method can be fairly compared and modeled.

0909.3776	gas entropy in a representative sample of nearby x-ray galaxy clusters  (rexcess): relationship to gas mass fraction	(abridged) we examine the radial entropy distribution and its scaling using31 nearby galaxy clusters from the representative xmm-newton cluster structuresurvey (rexcess). the entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out tor_1000 in all systems and out to r_500 in 13 systems. compared to theoreticalexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependentexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower masssystems. at r_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligiblewithin the uncertainties. mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropyis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,becoming consistent with self-similar at r_500. the dispersion in scaledentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores anddynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of twoand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. parameterising the profileswith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropyk_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skeweddistribution. the outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; theirdistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. renormalising thedimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(&lt; r),leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fractionvariations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropyproperties. we discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of theentropy and gas mass fraction in the rexcess sample, in which extra heating andmerger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority ofthe population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.

0911.1128	grand unification of agn activity in the lambdacdm cosmology	we track the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (smbhs) and their hostgalaxies. the calculation is embedded in the galform semi-analytical modelwhich simulates the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter(cdm) universe. during the evolution of the host galaxy, hot and cold gas areadded to the smbh by flows triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilitiesand galaxy mergers. this builds up the mass and spin of the bh, and theresulting accretion power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent starformation. the accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool discwhen the accretion rate exceeds 0.01\dot{m}_edd, and a geometrically thick,radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below thisvalue. the resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches observationsvery well, and the mass of the smbh correlates with the mass of the galaxybulge as observed. the bh spin distribution depends strongly on whether the gasin any given accretion episode remains in the same plane (prolonged accretion)or whether, due to self-gravity, it fragments into multiple, randomly alignedaccretion episodes (chaotic accretion). in the chaotic accretion model there isa clear correlation of spin with smbh mass. massive bhs (m&gt;5\times10^8\msun)are hosted by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lowermass bhs are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. using theblandford-znajek mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet power, ourmodel is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio galaxies, liners andseyferts. this is the first confirmation that a cdm galaxy formation model canreproduce the observed phenomenology of agn.

1004.0711	the parameter space of galaxy formation	semi-analytic models are a powerful tool for studying the formation ofgalaxies. however, these models inevitably involve a significant number ofpoorly constrained parameters that must be adjusted to provide an acceptablematch to the observed universe. in this paper, we set out to quantify thedegree to which observational data-sets can constrain the model parameters. byrevealing degeneracies in the parameter space we can hope to better understandthe key physical processes probed by the data. we use novel mathematicaltechniques to explore the parameter space of the galform semi-analytic model.we base our investigation on the bower et al. 2006 version of galform, adoptingthe same methodology of selecting model parameters based on an acceptable matchto the local bj and k luminosity functions. the model contains 16 parametersthat are poorly constrained, and we investigate this parameter space using themodel emulator technique, constructing a bayesian approximation to the galformmodel that can be rapidly evaluated at any point in parameter space. bycombining successive waves of emulation, we show that only 0.26% of the initialvolume is of interest for further exploration. however, within this region weshow that the bower et al. 2006 model is only one choice from an extendedsub-space of model parameters that can provide equally acceptable fits. weexplore the geometry of this region and begin to explore the physicalconnections between parameters that are exposed by this analysis. we alsoconsider the impact of adding additional observational data to furtherconstrain the parameter space.

0708.0753	the baryonic and dark matter properties of high redshift gravitationally  lensed disk galaxies	we present a detailed study of the structural properties of fourgravitationally lensed disk galaxies at z=1. modelling the rotation curves onsub-kpc scales we derive the values for the disk mass, the reference darkmatter density and core radius, and the angular momentum per unit mass. thederived models suggest that the rotation curve profile and amplitude are bestfit with a dark matter component similar to those of local spiral galaxies. thestellar component also has a similar length scale, but with substantiallysmaller masses than similarly luminous disk galaxies in the local universe.comparing the average dark matter density inside the optical radius we findthat the disk galaxies at z=1 have larger densities (by up to a factor of 7)than similar disk galaxies in the local universe. furthermore, the angularmomentum per unit mass versus reference velocity is well matched to the localrelation, suggesting that the angular momentum of the disk remains constantbetween high redshifts and the present day. though statistically limited, theseobservations point towards a spirals' formation scenario in which stellar disksare slowly grown by the accretion of angular momentum conserving material.

1011.5222	the evolution of agn across cosmic time: what is downsizing?	we use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and blackholes (bh) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (agn) in a colddark matter universe. the model predicts the bh mass, spin and mass accretionhistory. bh mass grows via accretion triggered by discs becoming dynamicallyunstable or galaxy mergers (called the starburst mode) and accretion fromquasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes (called the hot-halo mode). by taking intoaccount agn obscuration, we obtain a very good fit to the observed luminosityfunctions (lf) of agn (optical, soft and hard x-ray, and bolometric) for a widerange of redshifts (0&lt;z&lt;6). the model predicts a hierarchical build up of bhmass, with the typical mass of actively growing bhs increasing with decreasingredshift. remarkably, despite this, we find downsizing in the agn population,in terms of the differential growth with redshift of the space density of faintand bright agn. this arises naturally from the interplay between the starburstand hot-halo accretion modes. the faint end of the lf is dominated by massivebhs experiencing quiescent accretion via a thick disc, primarily during thehot-halo mode. the bright end of the lf, on the other hand, is dominated by agnwhich host bhs accreting close to or in excess of the eddington limit duringthe starburst mode. the model predicts that the comoving space density of agnpeaks at z~3, similar to the star formation history. however, when taking intoaccount obscuration, the space density of faint agn peaks at lower redshift(z&lt;2) than that of bright agn (z~2-3). this implies that the cosmic evolutionof agn is shaped in part by obscuration.

1109.3182	orca: the overdense red-sequence cluster algorithm	we present a new cluster detection algorithm designed for the panoramicsurvey telescope and rapid response system (pan-starrs) survey but with genericapplication to any multiband data. the method makes no prior assumptions aboutthe properties of clusters other than (a) the similarity in colour of clustergalaxies (the "red sequence") and (b) an enhanced projected surface density.the detector has three main steps: (i) it identifies cluster members byphotometrically filtering the input catalogue to isolate galaxies incolour-magnitude space, (ii) a voronoi diagram identifies regions of highsurface density, (iii) galaxies are grouped into clusters with afriends-of-friends technique. where multiple colours are available, we requiresystems to exhibit sequences in two colours. in this paper we present thealgorithm and demonstrate it on two datasets. the first is a 7 square degreesample of the deep sloan digital sky survey equatorial stripe (stripe 82), fromwhich we detect 97 clusters with z&lt;=0.6. benefiting from deeper data, we are100% complete in the maxbcg optically-selected cluster catalogue (based onshallower single epoch sdss data) and find an additional 78 previouslyunidentified clusters. the second dataset is a mock medium deep survey (mds)pan-starrs catalogue, based on the lambda-cdm model and a semi-analytic galaxyformation recipe. knowledge of galaxy-halo memberships in the mock allows aquantification of algorithm performance. we detect 305 mock clusters in haloeswith mass &gt;10^13 solar masses at z&lt;=0.6 and determine a spurious detection rateof &lt;1%, consistent with tests on the stripe 82 catalogue. the detector performswell in the recovery of model lambda-cdm clusters.

1111.2529	principles of supernova-driven winds	the formation of galaxies is regulated by a balance between the supply of gasand the rate at which it is ejected. traditional explanations of gas ejectionequate the energy required to escape the galaxy or host halo to an estimate forthe energy yield from supernovae. this yield is usually assumed to be aconstant fraction of the total available from the supernova, or is derived fromthe assumption of a consistent momentum yield. by applying these ideas in thecontext of a cold dark matter cosmogony, we derive a 1st-order analyticconnection between these working assumptions and the expected relationshipbetween baryon content and galaxy circular velocity, and find that these quickpredictions straddle recent observational estimates. to examine the premisesbehind these theories in more detail, we then explore their applicability to aset of gasdynamical simulations of idealised galaxies. we show that differentpremises dominate to differing degrees in the simulated outflow, depending onthe mass of the system and the resolution with which it is simulated. usingthis study to anticipate the emergent behaviour at arbitrarily high resolution,we motivate more comprehensive analytic model which allows for the range ofvelocities with which the gas may exit the system, and incorporates bothmomentum and energy-based constraints on the outflow. using a trial exitvelocity distribution, this is shown to be compatible with the observed baryonfractions in intermediate-mass systems, but implies that current estimates forlow-mass systems can not be solely accounted for by supernova winds undercommonly-held assumptions.

0710.3557	luminous red galaxies in hierarchical cosmologies	luminous red galaxies (lrgs) are much rarer and more massive than l*galaxies. coupled with their extreme colours, lrgs therefore provide ademanding testing ground for the physics of massive galaxy formation. wepresent the first self-consistent predictions for the abundance and propertiesof lrgs in hierarchical structure formation models. we test two publishedmodels which use quite different mechanisms to suppress the formation ofmassive galaxies: the bower et al. (2006) model, which invokes ``agn-feedback''to prevent gas from cooling in massive haloes, and the baugh et al. (2005)model which relies upon a ``superwind'' to eject gas before it is turned intostars. without adjusting any parameters, the bower et al. model gives anexcellent match to the observed luminosity function of lrgs in the sdss (with amedian redshift of z=0.24) and to their clustering; the baugh et al. model isless successful in these respects. both models fail to match the observedabundance of lrgs at z=0.5 to better than a factor of ~2. in the models, lrgsare typically bulge dominated systems with m* of ~2x10^11 h^{-1} m_sun andvelocity dispersions of ~250 km s^{-1}. around half of the stellar mass in themodel lrgs is already formed by z~2.2 and is assembled into one main progenitorby z~1.5; on average, only 25% of the mass of the main progenitor is addedafter z~1. lrgs are predicted to be found in a wide range of halo masses, aconclusion which relies on properly taking into account the scatter in theformation histories of haloes. remarkably, we find that the correlationfunction of lrgs is predicted to be a power law down to small pair separations,in excellent agreement with observational estimates. neither the bower et al.nor the baugh et al. model is able to reproduce the observed radii of lrgs.

1112.2712	what shapes the galaxy mass function? exploring the roles of  supernova-driven winds and agn	the observed stellar mass function (smf) is very different to the halo massfunction predicted by lambda-cdm, and it is widely accepted that this is due toenergy feedback from supernovae and black holes. however, the strength and formof this feedback is not understood. in this paper, we use the phenomenologicalmodel galform to explore how galaxy formation depends on the strength and halomass dependence of feedback. we focus on 'expulsion' models in which the windmass loading, beta, is proportional to 1/\vdisk^n, with n=0,1,2 and contrastthese models with the successful bower et al.\ 2008 model (b8w7). a crucialdevelopment is that our code explicitly accounts for the recapture of expelledgas as the system's halo mass (and thus gravitational potential) increases. wefind that a model with modest wind speed but high mass loading matches the flatportion of the smf. when combined with agn feedback, the model provides a gooddescription of the observed smf above 10^9 h^-1 msol. however, in the expulsionmodels, the brightest galaxies are assembled more recently than in b8w7, andthe specific star formation rates of galaxies decrease strongly with decreasingstellar mass. the expulsion models also tend to have a cosmic star formationdensity that is dominated by lower mass galaxies at z=1-3, and dominated highmass galaxies at low redshift. these trends are in conflict with observationaldata, but the comparison highlights some deficiencies of the b8w7 model also.the experiments in this paper give us important physical insight to the impactof the feedback process on the formation histories of galaxies, but the strongmass dependence of feedback adopted in b8w7 still appears to provide the mostpromising description of the observed universe.

1209.5741	hubble space telescope h-alpha imaging of star-forming galaxies at z =  1-1.5: evolution in the size and luminosity of giant hii regions	we present hst/wfc3 narrowband imaging of the h-alpha emission in a sample ofeight gravitationally-lensed galaxies at z = 1 - 1.5. the magnification causedby the foreground clusters enables us to obtain a median source plane spatialresolution of 360pc, as well as providing magnifications in flux ranging from~10x to ~50x. this enables us to identify resolved star-forming hii regions atthis epoch and therefore study their h-alpha luminosity distributions forcomparisons with equivalent samples at z ~ 2 and in the local universe. we findevolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of hii regions withredshift. the distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an hiiregion luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponentialbreak at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. wetherefore conclude that `clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because ofthe evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similarscaling relations to those at z = 0, but their hii regions are larger andbrighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy.a simple theoretical argument based on gas collapsing on scales of the jeansmass in a marginally unstable disk shows that the clumpy morphologies of high-zgalaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causingperturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclicfrequencies which stabilise the disk.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1312.0598	the impact of angular momentum on black hole accretion rates in  simulations of galaxy formation	feedback from energy liberated by gas accretion onto black holes (bhs) is anattractive mechanism to explain the exponential cut-off at the massive end ofthe galaxy stellar mass function (smf). semi-analytic models of galaxyformation in which this form of feedback is assumed to suppress cooling inhaloes where the gas cooling time is large compared to the dynamical time doindeed achieve a good match to the observed smf. furthermore, hydrodynamicsimulations of individual halos in which gas is assumed to accrete onto thecentral bh at the bondi rate have shown that a self-regulating regime isestablished in which the bh grows just enough to liberate an amount of energycomparable to the thermal energy of the halo. however, this process isefficient at suppressing the growth not only of massive galaxies but also ofgalaxies like the milky way, leading to disagreement with the observed smf. thebondi accretion rate, however, is inappropriate when the accreting material hasangular momentum. we present an improved accretion model that takes intoaccount the circularisation and subsequent viscous transport of infallingmaterial and include it as a "subgrid" model in hydrodynamic simulations of theevolution of halos with a wide range of masses. the resulting accretion ratesare generally low in low mass ($\lsim 10^{11.5} \msun$) halos, but showoutbursts of eddington-limited accretion during galaxy mergers. duringoutbursts these objects strongly resemble quasars. in higher mass haloes, gasaccretion occurs continuously, typically at $~10$ % of the eddington rate,which is conducive to the formation of radio jets. the resulting dependence ofthe accretion behaviour on halo mass induces a break in the relation betweengalaxy stellar mass and halo mass in these simulations that matchesobservations.

1312.4736	the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey: the role of galaxy group environment  in the star formation rate versus stellar mass relation and quiescent  fraction out to $z \sim 0.8$	using a large sample of field and group galaxies drawn from the pan-starrs1medium-deep survey, we present the specific star formation rate (ssfr) -stellar mass (m*) relation, as well as the quiescent fraction versus m*relation in different environments. we confirm that the fraction of quiescentgalaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but thatthe amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between thefield and groups: in other words, the ssfr-density relation at a fixed stellarmass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescentfractions between different environments rather than a global suppression inthe star formation rate for the star-forming population. however, when werestrict our sample to the cluster-scale environments ($m&gt;10^{14}m_{solar}$),we find a global reduction in the ssfr of the star forming sequence of $17\%$at 4$\sigma$ confidence as opposed to its field counterpart. after removing thestellar mass dependence of the quiescent fraction seen in field galaxies, theexcess in the quiescent fraction due to the environment quenching in groups andclusters is found to increase with stellar mass. we argue that these resultsare in favor of galaxy mergers to be the primary environment quenchingmechanism operating in galaxy groups whereas strangulation is able to reproducethe observed trend in the environment quenching efficiency and stellar massrelation seen in clusters. our results also suggest that the relativeimportance between mass quenching and environment quenching depends on stellarmass -- the mass quenching plays a dominant role in producing quiescentgalaxies for more massive galaxies, while less massive galaxies are quenchedmostly through the environmental effect, with the transition mass around$1-2\times10^{10}m_{solar}$ in the group/cluster environment.

0802.2549	unveiling the important role of groups in the evolution of massive  galaxies: insights from an infrared passive sequence at intermediate redshift	the most massive galaxies in the universe are also the oldest. to overturnthis apparent contradiction with hierarchical growth models, we focus on thegroup scale haloes which host most of these galaxies. a stellar mass selectedm_* &gt;~ 2x10^10m_sol sample at z~0.4 is constructed within the cnoc2 redshiftsurvey. a sensitive mid infrared (mir) irac colour is used to isolate passivegalaxies. it produces a bimodal distribution, in which passive galaxies(highlighted by morphological early-types) define a tight mir colour sequence(infrared passive sequence, ips). this is due to stellar atmospheric emissionfrom old stellar populations. significantly offset from the ips are galaxieswhere reemission by dust boosts emission at 8microns (infrared-excess or iregalaxies). they include all known morphological late-types. comparison withew[oii] shows that mir colour is highly sensitive to low levels of activity,and allows us to separate dusty-active from passive galaxies. the fraction ofire galaxies, f(ire) drops with m_*, such that f(ire)=0.5 at a ``crossovermass'' of ~1.3x10^11m_sol. within our optically-defined group sample there is astrong and consistent deficit in f(ire) at all masses, and most clearly at m_*&gt;~10^11m_sol. using a mock galaxy catalogue derived from the milleniumsimulation we show that the observed trend of f(ire) with m_* can be explainedif suppression of star formation occurs primarily in the group environment, andparticularly for m_*&gt;~10^11m_sol galaxies. in this way, downsizing can bedriven solely by structure growth in the universe.

1402.6335	a submillimeter galaxy illuminating its circumgalactic medium: ly-alpha  scattering in a cold, clumpy outflow	we report the detection at 850um of the central source in ssa22-lab1, thearchetypal lyman-alpha blob (lab), a 100kpc-scale radio-quiet emission-linenebula at z=3.1. the flux density of the source, $s_{850}=4.6\pm1.1$mjy impliesthe presence of a galaxy, or group of galaxies, with a total luminosity of$l_{\rm ir}\approx10^{12}l_\odot$. the position of an active source at thecenter of a ~50kpc-radius ring of linearly polarized ly-alpha emission detectedby hayes et al. (2011) suggests that the central source is leaking ly-alphaphotons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in hiclouds at large galactocentric radius. the ly-alpha morphology around thesubmillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the averagely-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expectedfor a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient thatis outflowing relative to the line center. taken together, these observationsprovide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) isresponsible for a large fraction of the extended ly-alpha emission andmorphology. less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalacticmedium being traced by ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting intothe halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ism),now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprisegas that has been swept-up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy?

1410.3485	evolution of galaxy stellar masses and star formation rates in the eagle  simulations	we investigate the evolution of galaxy masses and star formation rates in theevolution and assembly of galaxies and their environment (eagle) simulations.these comprise a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in a $\lambda$cdmcosmogony with subgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellarmass loss, and feedback from stars and accreting black holes. the subgridfeedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellarmass function and galaxy sizes. here we demonstrate that the simulationsreproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 percent. the simulation also tracks the observed evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to theplausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. just as withobserved galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies arebimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. the specific starformation rates of star forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.4 dex lowerthan observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely.the unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data makes eagle apowerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxyformation.

1503.07873	resolved spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies: global  dynamics and star-forming clumps on ~100pc scales	we present adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy around the haor hb lines of 12 gravitationally lensed galaxies obtained with vlt/sinfoni,keck/osiris and gemini/nifs. we combine these data with previous observationsand investigate the dynamics and star formation properties of 17 lensedgalaxies at z = 1-4. thanks to gravitational magnification of 1.4 - 90x byforeground clusters, effective spatial resolutions of 40 - 700 pc are achieved.the magnification also allows us to probe lower star formation rates andstellar masses than unlensed samples; our target galaxies featuredust-corrected sfrs derived from ha or hb emission of 0.8 - 40msol/yr, andstellar masses m* ~ 4e8 - 6e10 msol. all of the galaxies have velocitygradients, with 59% consistent with being rotating discs and a likely mergerfraction of 29%, with the remaining 12% classed as 'undetermined.' we extract50 star-forming clumps with sizes in the range 60pc - 1kpc from the ha (or hb)maps, and find that their surface brightnesses and their characteristicluminosities evolve to higher luminosities with redshift. we show that thisevolution can be described by fragmentation on larger scales in gas-rich discs,and is likely to be driven by evolving gas fractions.

1510.05645	size evolution of normal and compact galaxies in the eagle simulation	we present the evolution of galaxy sizes, from redshift 2 to 0, for activelystar forming and passive galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamical 1003 cmpc3simulation of the eagle project. we find that the sizes increase with stellarmass , but that the relation weakens with increasing redshift. separatinggalaxies by their star formation activity, we find that passive galaxies aretypically smaller than active galaxies at fixed stellar mass. these trends areconsistent with those found in observations and the level of agreement betweenthe predicted and observed size - mass relation is of order 0.1 dex for z &lt; 1and 0.2-0.3 dex from redshift 1 to 2. we use the simulation to compare theevolution of individual galaxies to that of the population as a whole. whilethe evolution of the size-stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides agood proxy for the evolution of individual galaxies, the evolution ofindividual passive galaxies is not well represented by the observed size - massrelation due to the evolving number density of passive galaxies. observationsof z \approx 2 galaxies have revealed an abundance of massive red compactgalaxies, that depletes below z \approx 1. we find that a similar populationforms naturally in the simulation. comparing these galaxies to their z = 0descendants, we find that all compact galaxies grow in size due to thehigh-redshift stars migrating outwards. approximately 60% of the compactgalaxies increase in size further due to renewed star formation and/or mergers.

1511.00008	the kmos agn survey at high redshift (kashz): the prevalence and drivers  of ionised outflows in the host galaxies of x-ray agn	we present the first results from the kmos agn survey at high redshift(kashz), a vlt/kmos integral-field spectroscopic survey of z&gt;0.6 agn. wepresent galaxy-integrated spectra of 89 x-ray agn (lx=10^42-10^45 erg/s), forwhich we observed [o iii] (z=1.1-1.7) or halpha emission (z=0.6-1.1). thetargets have x-ray luminosities representative of the parent agn population andwe explore the emission-line luminosities as a function of x-ray luminosity.for the [o iii] targets, ~50 per cent have ionised gas velocities indicative ofgas that is dominated by outflows and/or highly turbulent material (i.e.,overall line-widths &gt;~600 km/s). the most luminous half (i.e., lx&gt;6x10^43erg/s) have a &gt;~2 times higher incidence of such velocities. on the basis ofour results, we find no evidence that x-ray obscured agn are more likely tohost extreme kinematics than unobscured agn. our kashz sample has adistribution of gas velocities that is consistent with a luminosity-matchedsample of z&lt;0.4 agn. this implies little evolution in the prevalence of ionisedoutflows, for a fixed agn luminosity, despite an order-of-magnitude decrease inaverage star-formation rates over this redshift range. furthermore, we compareour halpha targets to a redshift-matched sample of star-forming galaxies anddespite a similar distribution of halpha luminosities and likely star-formationrates, we find extreme ionised gas velocities are up to ~10x more prevalent inthe agn-host galaxies. our results reveal a high prevalence of extreme ionisedgas velocities in high-luminosity x-ray agn and imply that the most powerfulionised outflows in high-redshift galaxies are driven by agn activity.

astro-ph;0005397	reconstructing the history of star formation in rich cluster cores	we address the current crucial issues on the formation and evolution ofcluster galaxies: ie., connection between the butcher-oemler effect, assemblyof cluster galaxies, truncation of star formation, and the origin of s0galaxies.  we construct the field corrected colour-magnitude (cm) diagrams for 7 cnocclusters (0.23&lt;z&lt;0.43) and coma, and illustrate the evolution of the completecluster population down to the present-day based on the model in which starformation is truncated when the galaxies infall from the surrounding field.  we show that the blue galaxies are incorporated into the present-day tight cmrelation as they fade and become redder after the truncation, which is possiblyresponsible for producing faint s0's (&gt;m*+1). truncation of star formation is,however, found to be relatively milder (with a time scale of 1 gyr) thansuggested by the viorent processes such as ram-pressure stripping and/ormergers/harassment.  the bo effect is after all found to be a combination of three effects,namely, increasing field star formation activity, increasing galaxy infallrate, and the truncatin of star formation after the accretion. our approachnaturally leads to the history of galaxy assembly and `global' star foramtionfor `cluster' galaxies.

astro-ph;0006109	the impact of galaxy formation on the x-ray evolution of clusters	we present a new model for the x-ray properties of the intracluster mediumthat explicitly includes heating of the gas by the energy released during theevolution of cluster galaxies. we calculate the evolution of clusters bycombining the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation of cole et al. with asimple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas. we focus on thecluster x-ray luminosity function and on the relation between x-ray temperatureand luminosity. we show that cooling alone is not enough to account for theflatness of the observed t-l relation or for the lack of strong redshiftevolution in the observed x-ray luminosity function. gas heating, on the otherhand, can solve these two problems: in the \lambda-cdm cosmology, our modelreproduces fairly well the t-l relation and the x-ray luminosity function.furthermore, it predicts only weak evolution in these two properties out toz=0.5, in agreement with recent observational data. a successful model requiresan energy input of 1--2 x 10^49 ergs per solar mass of stars formed. this iscomparable to the total energy released by the supernovae associated with theformation of the cluster galaxies. thus, unless the transfer of supernovaeenergy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically) efficient,additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from agn winds arerequired. however, the amplification of an initial energy input by the responseof the intracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energyrequirements. our model makes definite predictions for the x-ray properties ofgroups and clusters at high redshift which may soon be tested with data fromthe chandra and newton satellites.

astro-ph;0103475	the early-type galaxy population in abell 2218	(abridged) we present morphological, photometric, kinematic and line-strengthdata of 48 early-type members of the rich cluster abell 2218 at z=0.18. thissample is both larger and spans a wider galaxy luminosity range, down tom*_b+1, than previous studies. we compare a2218 with similar samples drawn fromlocal clusters to identify evolutionary changes between the samples which haveoccured over the last 3gyrs. the overall picture is one of little or noevolution in nearly all galaxy parameters. zeropoint offsets in thefaber--jackson, mg_b-sigma and fundamental plane relations are all consistentwith passively evolving stellar populations. the slopes of these relations havenot changed significantly. we do however find a significant spread in theestimated luminosity-weighted ages of the stellar populations in the galaxies,based on line diagnostic diagrams. this age spread is seen in both the diskyearly-type galaxies (s0) and also the ellipticals. we observe both ellipticalswith a strong contribution from a young stellar population and lenticularsdominated by old stellar populations. on average, we find no evidence forsystematic differences between the populations of ellipticals and lenticulars.this points to a common formation epoch for the bulk of the stars in most ofthe early-type galaxies in a2218. this result can be reconciled with the claimsof rapid morphological evolution in distant clusters if the suggestedtransformation from spirals to lenticulars does not involve significant newstar formation.

astro-ph;0106337	the colour magnitude relation for galaxies in the coma cluster	we present a new photometric catalogue of the coma galaxy cluster in thejohnson u- and v- bands. we cover an area of 3360arcmin2 of sky, to a depth ofv=20 mag in a 13 arcsec diameter aperture, and produce magnitudes for ~1400extended objects in metric apertures from 8.8 to 26arcsec diameters. the meaninternal rms scatter in the photometry is 0.014 mag in v, and 0.026 mag in u,for v13 &lt; 17 mag.  we place new limits on the levels of scatter in the colour--magnituderelation (cmr) in the coma cluster, and investigate how the slope and scatterof the cmr depends on galaxy morphology, luminosity and position within thecluster. as expected, the lowest levels of scatter are found in the ellipticalgalaxies, while the late type galaxies have the highest numbers of galaxiesbluewards of the cmr. we investigate whether the slope of the cmr is anartifact of colour gradients within galaxies and, show that it persists whenthe colours are measured within a diameter that scales with galaxy size.looking at the environmental dependence of the cmr, we find a trend ofsystematically bluer galaxy colours with increasing projected cluster-centricradius which we associate with a gradient in the mean galactic ages.

astro-ph;0110354	the transformation of galaxies within the large scale structure around a  z=0.41 cluster	we present deep, panoramic multi-color imaging of the distant rich clustera851 (cl0939+4713, z=0.41) using suprime-cam on subaru. these images cover a27' field of view, ~11 mpc at z=0.41, and by exploiting photometric redshiftsestimated from our bvri imaging we can isolate galaxies in a narrow redshiftslice at the cluster redshift. using a sample of ~2700 probable cluster membersbrighter than 0.02 lv*, we trace the network of filaments and subclumps aroundthe cluster core. the depth of our observations, combined with theidentification of filamentary structure, gives us an unprecedented opportunityto test the influence of the environment on the properties of low luminositygalaxies. we find an abrupt change in the colors of &lt; 0.1 lv* galaxies at alocal density of 100 gal. per sq. mpc, with the population in lower densityregions being predominantly blue, while those in higher density regions arered. the transition in the color-local density behavior occurs at densitiescorresponding to subclumps within the filaments surrounding the cluster.identifying the sites where the transition occurs brings us much closer tounderstanding the mechanisms which are responsible for establishing thepresent-day relationship between environment and galaxy characteristics.

astro-ph;0203502	the effects of similarity breaking on the intracluster medium	we construct a family of simple analytical models of galaxy clusters at thepresent epoch and compare its predictions with observational data. we exploretwo processes that break the self-similarity of galaxy clusters: systematicvariation in the dark matter halo concentration and energy injection into theintracluster gas, through their effects on the observed cluster properties.three observed relations between cluster properties and temperature areemployed to constrain the model; mass, slope of gas density profile (beta) andluminosity. the slope of the mass-temperature relation is found to bereproduced by our model when the observed variation in concentration isincluded, raising the slope from the self-similar prediction of 1.5, to that ofthe observed relation, ~ 2. heating of the gas is observed to have littleeffect on the mass-temperature relation. the mean trend in the beta-temperaturerelation is reproduced by energy injection of 0.5-0.75 kev per particle, whileconcentration variation has only a small effect. excess energies calculated forindividual systems from the beta-temperature relation suggest that the lowestmass systems may have excess energies that are biased to lower values byselection effects. the observed properties of the luminosity-temperaturerelation are reproduced by the combined effects of excess energy and a trend inthe dark matter concentration. at high masses the observed variation in darkmatter concentration results a slope of ~ 2.7 compared to recent observationsin the range 2.6-2.9, whilst the observed steepening in galaxy groups ispredicted when heating of 0.5-0.75 kev per particle is included. hence acombination of energy injection and dark matter concentration variation appearsable to account for the mean trends in the observed relations.

astro-ph;0207360	galaxy properties in low x-ray luminosity clusters at z=0.25	we present the first spectroscopic survey of intrinsically low lx clusters atz&gt;&gt;0, with hst wfpc2 imaging and ground-based spectroscopy. we study 172confirmed cluster members in a sample of ten clusters at z=0.23-0.3, withlx&lt;4.e43 h^{-2} ergs/s. the core of each cluster is imaged with wfpc2 in thef702w filter, and the spectroscopic sample is statistically complete tomr-19.0+5log(h), within an 11' field. the clusters are dynamicallywell-separated from the surrounding field and the velocity dispersions rangefrom ~350-850 km/s. emission line galaxies in these clusters are relativelyrare, comprising only 22 +/- 4% of the sample. there is no evidence that theseemission-line galaxies are dynamically distinct from the majority of thecluster population, though our sample is too small to rule out the ~30%difference that has been observed in more massive clusters. we find elevengalaxies, comprising 6% of the cluster members, which are disk-dominated butshow no sign of emission in their spectrum. most of these are relativelyisolated, spiral galaxies with smooth disks. we find no cluster members with astarburst or post-starburst spectrum. the striking similarity between thespectral and morphological properties of galaxies in these clusters and thoseof galaxies in more massive systems at similar redshifts implies that thephysical processes responsible for truncating star formation in galaxies arenot restricted to the rare, rich cluster environment, but are viable in muchmore common environments. in particular, we conclude that ram pressurestripping or cluster-induced starbursts cannot be solely responsible for thelow star formation rates in these systems.

astro-ph;0302450	what shapes the luminosity function of galaxies?	we investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function.beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos, we show how gas cooling,photoionization, feedback, merging and thermal conduction affect the shape ofthe luminosity function. we consider three processes whereby supernovae canaffect the forming galaxy: (1) reheating of disk gas to the halo temperature;(2) expansion of the diffuse halo gas; (3) expulsion of cold disk gas from thehalo. while feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of theluminosity function, this alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed atlarge luminosities. feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve this problem.the relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if coolingin massive halos is strongly suppressed. conduction is a promising mechanism,but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to thedesired level. if, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of brightgalaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to thegalaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernovaexplosions. the mechanism is only viable if the formation of centralsupermassive black holes play a crucial role in limiting the amount of starsthat form in the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0306314	extended x-ray emission around 4c 41.17 at z=3.8	we present sensitive, high-resolution, x-ray imaging from chandra of thehigh-redshift radio galaxy 4c 41.17 (z=3.8). our 150-ks chandra exposuredetects strong x-ray emission from a point source coincident with the nucleusof the radio galaxy. in addition we identify extended x-ray emission with aluminosity ~1e45 erg/s covering a 100kpc (15'') diameter region around theradio galaxy. the extended x-ray emission follows the general distribution ofradio emission in the radio lobes of this source, and the distribution of agiant lyman-alpha emission line halo, while the spectrum of the x-ray emissionis non-thermal and has a power law index consistent with that of the radiosynchrotron. we conclude that the x-ray emission is most likely inverse-comptonscattering of far-infrared photons from a relativistic electron populationprobably associated with past and current activity from the central object.assuming an equipartition magnetic field the cmb energy density at z=3.8 canonly account for at most 40% of the inverse-compton emission. publishedsubmillimeter maps of 4c 41.17 have detected an apparently extended andextremely luminous far-infrared emission around the radio galaxy. wedemonstrate that this photon component and its spatial distribution, incombination with the cmb can reproduce the observed x-ray luminosity. wepropose that photo-ionization by these inverse-compton x-ray photons plays asignificant role in this system, and provides a new physical feedback mechanismto preferentially affect the gas within the most massive halos at highredshift. this is the highest redshift example of extended x-ray emissionaround a radio galaxy currently known.

astro-ph;0307560	chandra detections of scuba galaxies around high-z radio sources	the most massive galaxies in the present day universe are the giantellipticals found in the centers of rich clusters. these have old, coevalstellar populations, suggesting they formed at high redshift, and are expectedto host supermassive black holes (smbhs). the recent detection of severalhigh-redshift radio galaxies (hzrgs) at submm wavelengths confirms that indeedsome massive galaxies may have formed the bulk of their stellar populations inspectacular dust-enshrouded starbursts at high-z. in this letter we comparesensitive chandra x-ray images - which identify actively-fueled smbhs - andsubmm observations - capable of detecting obscured activity in luminousgalaxies at high redshift - of the environments of three hzrgs. theseobservations exhibit overdensities of x-ray sources in all 3 fields and a closecorrespondence between the chandra and scuba populations. this suggests thatboth substantial star formation and nuclear activity may be occuring in theseregions. we identify possible pairs of chandra sources with each of 2 scubasources, suggesting that their ultraluminous activity may be triggered by theinteraction of two massive galaxies, each of which hosts an accreting smbh. thepresence of two smbhs in the resulting remanent is predicted to produce aflattened stellar core in the galaxy, a morphological signature frequently seenin luminous cluster ellipticals. hence the confirmation of pairs of chandrasources within individual, luminous scuba galaxies would provide additionalevidence that these galaxies at z~2-4 are the progenitors of the giantelliptical galaxies found in clusters at the present-day.

astro-ph;0308130	the ks-band luminosity and stellar mass functions of galaxies in z~1  clusters	we present the near-infrared (ks-band) luminosity function of galaxies in twoz~1 cluster candidates, 3c336 and q1335+28. a third cluster, 3c289, wasobserved but found to be contaminated by a foreground system. our wide fieldimaging data reach to ks=20.5 (5sigma), corresponding to ~m*+2.7 with respectto the passive evolution. the near-infrared luminosity traces the stellar massof a galaxy due to its small sensitivity to the recent star formation history.thus the luminosity function can be transformed to the stellar mass function ofgalaxies using the $j-k$ colours with only a small correction (factor&lt;2) forthe effects of on-going star formation. the derived stellar mass function spansa wide range in mass from ~3 x 10^{11}msun down to ~6 x 10^{9}msun (set by themagnitude limit). the form of the mass function is very similar to lowerredshift counterparts such as that from 2mass/lcrs clusters (balogh et al.2001) and the z=0.31 clusters (barger et al. 1998). this indicates littleevolution of galaxy masses from z=1 to the present-day. combined with colourdata that suggest star formation is completed early (z&gt;&gt;1) in the cluster core,it seems that the galaxy formation processes (both star formation and massassembly) are strongly accerelated in dense environments and has been largelycompleted by z=1. we investigate whether the epoch of mass assembly of massivecluster galaxies is earlier than that predicted by the hierarchical galaxyformation models. these models predict the increase of characteristic mass bymore than factor ~3 between z=1 and the present day. this seems incompatiblewith our data.

astro-ph;0501182	galaxy groups at 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.55. i. group properties	the evolution of galaxies in groups may have important implications for theevolution of the star formation history of the universe, since many processeswhich operate in groups may suppress star formation and the fraction ofgalaxies in bound groups grows rapidly between z=1 and the present day. in thispaper, we present an investigation of the properties of galaxies in galaxygroups at intermediate redshift (z ~ 0.4). the groups were selected from thecnoc2 redshift survey as described in carlberg et al., 2001, with furtherspectroscopic follow-up undertaken at the magellan telescope in order toimprove the completeness and depth of the sample. we present the data for theindividual groups, and find no clear trend in the fraction of passive galaxieswith group velocity dispersion and group concentration. we stack the galaxygroups in order to compare the properties of group galaxies with those of fieldgalaxies at the same redshift. the groups contain a larger fraction of passivegalaxies than the field, this trend being particularly clear for galaxiesbrighter than m_{b_j} &lt; -20 in the higher velocity dispersion groups. inaddition, we see evidence for an excess of bright passive galaxies in thegroups relative to the field. in contrast, the luminosity functions of the starforming galaxies in the groups and the field are consistent. these trends arequalitatively consitent with the differences between group and field galaxiesseen in the local universe.

astro-ph;0507315	the discovery of a galaxy-wide superwind from a young massive galaxy at  redshift z~3	high-velocity galactic outflows, driven by intense bursts of star formationand black hole accretion, are invoked by current theories of galaxy formationto terminate star formation in the most massive galaxies and to deposit heavyelements in the intergalactic medium. from existing observational evidence onhigh-redshift galaxies, it is unclear whether such outflows are localized toregions of intense star formation just a few kiloparsecs in extent, or whetherthey instead have a significant impact on the entire galaxy and itssurroundings. here we present two-dimensional spectroscopy of a star-forminggalaxy at redshift z=3.09 (seen 11.5 gyr ago, when the universe was 20 per centof its current age): its spatially extended ly-alpha emission appears to beabsorbed by hi in a foreground screen covering the entire galaxy, with alateral extent of at least 100 kpc and remarkable velocity coherence. it wasplausibly ejected from the galaxy during a starburst several 1e8 yr earlier andhas subsequently swept up gas from the surrounding intergalactic medium andcooled. this demonstrates the galaxy-wide impact of high-redshift superwinds.

astro-ph;0510077	the cnoc2 sample of intermediate redshift galaxy groups - the powerhouse  of galaxy evolution	the evolution of galaxies in groups may have important implications for theglobal evolution of star formation rate in the universe, since many processeswhich operate in groups may suppress star formation, and the fraction ofgalaxies bound in groups at the present day is as high as ~60%. we present ananalysis of our sample of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;=0.55 groups, selected from the cnoc2 redshiftsurvey and supplemented with deep spectroscopy and hst acs imaging. we findthat these groups contain significantly more passive galaxies than the field,with excesses of s0, elliptical and passive spiral galaxy types. themorphological composition is closely matched to that of more massive irregularclusters at a similar epoch. contrasting with galaxy samples in a variety ofenvironments and epochs, we find that the fraction of passive galaxies(ew[oii]&lt;5a), is strongly evolving in the group environment, with parallelevolution in the (global) field population, whilst little evolution is observedin cluster cores since z~1.

astro-ph;0511338	the broken hierarchy of galaxy formation	recent observations of the distant universe suggest that much of the stellarmass of bright galaxies was already in place at $z&gt;1$. this presents achallenge for models of galaxy formation because massive halos are assembledlate in hierarchical cosmologies such as cold dark matter (cdm). in this paper,we discuss a new implementation of the durham semi-analytic model in whichfeedback due to active galactic nuclei (agn) is assumed to quench cooling flowsin massive halos. this mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxyluminosity function at bright magnitudes. the model is implemented within themillennium n-body simulation; the accurate dark matter merger trees and largenumber of realizations of the galaxy formation process that the simulationprovides results in highly accurate statistics. after adjusting the values ofthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of localgalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the k-band luminosity andgalaxy stellar mass functions. we also calculate the volume averaged starformation rate density of the universe as a function of redshift and the way inwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. the modelrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift$z\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasingredshift in objects of all masses. although observational data on theseproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxyformation, we find that when agn feedback is taken into account, thefundamentally hierachical cdm model provides a very good match to theseobservations.

astro-ph;0607648	galaxy bimodality versus stellar mass and environment	we analyse a z&lt;0.1 galaxy sample from the sloan digital sky survey focusingon the variation of the galaxy colour bimodality with stellar mass andprojected neighbour density sigma, and on measurements of the galaxy stellarmass functions. the characteristic mass increases with environmental densityfrom about 10^10.6 msun to 10^10.9 msun (kroupa imf, h_0=70) for sigma in therange 0.1--10 per mpc^2. the galaxy population naturally divides into a red andblue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass andcolour-concentration index not varying strongly with environment. the fractionof galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in log sigma andlog mass (12 x 13 bins). the red fraction f_r generally increases continuouslyin both sigma and mass such that there is a unified relation: f_r =f(sigma,mass). two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to thedata. these data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analyticalmodels based on the millennium n-body simulation: the bower et al. (2006) andcroton et al. (2006) models that incorporate agn feedback. both models predicta strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that isqualitatively similar to the observations. however, a quantitative comparisonshows that the bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appearsto be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.

astro-ph;0701221	resolved spectroscopy of a gravitationally lensed l* lyman-break galaxy  at z~5	by combining hst imaging with optical (vimos) and near-infrared (sinfoni)integral field spectroscopy we exploit the gravitational potential of amassive, rich cluster at z=0.9 to study the internal properties of agravitationally lensed galaxy at z=4.88. using a detailed gravitational lensmodel of the cluster rcs0224-002 we reconstruct the source-frame morphology ofthe lensed galaxy on 200pc scales and find an ~l* lyman-break galaxy with anintrinsic size of only 2.0x0.8kpc, a velocity gradient of &lt;60km/s and animplied dynamical mass of 1.0x10^10mo within 2kpc. we infer an integratedstar-formation rate of just 12+/-2mo/yr from the intrinsic [oii] emission lineflux. the ly-alpha emission appears redshifted by +200+/-40km/s with respect tothe [oii] emission. the ly-alpha is also significantly more extended than thenebular emission, extending over 11.9x2.4kpc. over this area, the ly-alphacentroid varies by less than 10km/s. by examining the spatially resolvedstructure of the [oii] and asymmetric ly-alpha emission lines we investigatethe nature of this system. the model for local starburst galaxies suggested bymass-hesse et al. (2003) provides a good description of our data, and suggeststhat the galaxy is surrounded by a galactic-scale bi-polar outflow which hasrecently burst out of the system. the outflow, which appears to be currentlylocated &gt;30kpc from the galaxy, is escaping at a speed of upto ~500km/s.although the mass of the outflow is uncertain, the geometry and velocity of theoutflow suggests that the ejected material is travelling far faster than escapevelocity and will travel more than 1mpc (comoving) before eventually stalling.

astro-ph;0703553	the representative xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess) of an  x-ray luminosity selected galaxy cluster sample	the largest uncertainty for cosmological studies using clusters of galaxiesis introduced by our limited knowledge of the statistics of galaxy clusterstructure, and of the scaling relations between observables and cluster mass.to improve on this situation we have started an xmm-newton large programme forthe in-depth study of a representative sample of 33 galaxy clusters, selectedin the redshift range z=0.055 to 0.183 from the reflex cluster survey, havingx-ray luminosities above 0.4 x 10^44 h_70^-2 erg s^-1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kevband. this paper introduces the sample, compiles properties of the clusters,and provides detailed information on the sample selection function. we describethe selection of a nearby galaxy cluster sample that makes optimal use of thexmm-newton field-of-view, and provides nearly homogeneous x-ray luminositycoverage for the full range from poor clusters to the most massive objects inthe universe. for the clusters in the sample, x-ray fluxes are derived andcompared to the previously obtained fluxes from the rosat all-sky survey. wefind that the fluxes and the flux errors have been reliably determined in therosat all-sky survey analysis used for the reflex survey. we use the sampleselection function documented in detail in this paper to determine the x-rayluminosity function, and compare it with the luminosity function of the entirereflex sample. we also discuss morphological peculiarities of some of thesample members. the sample and some of the background data given in thisintroductory paper will be important for the application of these data in thedetailed studies of cluster structure, to appear in forthcoming publications.

astro-ph;9508042	the deficit of distant galaxy clusters in the rixos x-ray survey	clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound systems andtherefore provide an important way of studying the formation and evolution ofthe large scale structure of the universe. cluster evolution can be inferredfrom observations of the x-ray emission of the gas in distant clusters, butinterpreting these data is not straightforward. in a simplified view, clustersgrow from perturbations in the matter distribution: their intracluster gas iscompressed and shock-heated by the gravitational collapse$^{1}$. the resultingx-ray emission is determined by the hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas in thechanging gravitational potential. however, if processes such as radiativecooling or pre-collapse heating of the gas are important, then the x-rayevolution will be strongly influenced by the thermal history of the gas. herewe present the first results from a faint flux-limited sample of x-ray selectedclusters compiled as part of the rosat international x-ray and optical survey(rixos). very few distant clusters have been identified. most importantly,their redshift distribution appears to be inconsistent with simple models basedon the evolution of the gravitational potential. our results suggest thatradiative cooling or non-gravitational heating of the intracluster gas mustplay an important role in the evolution of clusters.

astro-ph;9903179	diffuse x-ray emission from late-type galaxy haloes	current theories of galaxy formation predict that spiral galaxies areembedded in a reservoir of hot gas. this gas is able to cool onto the galaxyreplenishing cold gas that is consumed by star formation. estimates of thex-ray luminosity emitted in the cooling region suggest a bolometric luminosityof order 10 x 10^41 ergs/s in massive systems. we have used rosat pspc data tosearch for extended x-ray emission from the haloes of three nearby, massive,late-type galaxies: ngc 2841, ngc 4594 and ngc 5529. we infer 95 per cent upperlimits on the bolometric x-ray luminosities of the haloes of ngc 2841, ngc 4594and ngc 5529 of 0.4, 1.2 and 3.8 x 10^41 ergs/s respectively. thus the trueluminosity lies well below the straightforward theoretical prediction. wediscuss this discrepancy and suggest a number of ways in which the theoreticalmodel can be brought into agreement with the observational results. a possiblesolution is that the gravitational potentials of the dark matter haloes ofthese galaxies are weaker than assumed in the current model. alternatively, thepresent day accretion may be substantially less than is required on average tobuild the disk over the hubble time. our results are, however, based on onlythree galaxies, none of which is ideal for this kind of study. a larger dataset is required to explore this important problem further.

astro-ph;9907072	colour-magnitude relations and spectral line strengths in the coma  cluster	we use the $c_{2}4668$, $fe4383$, $h\gamma_a$ and $h\delta_a$ spectralabsorption line indices, together with u- and v-band photometry of 101 galaxiesin the coma cluster, to investigate how mean age and metal abundance correlatewith galaxy luminosity. in particular, we use the line index measurements toaddress the origin of the colour-magnitude relation (cmr). we find that the cmrin coma is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicity correlation. weadditionally show evidence for a relation between age and luminosity, in thedirection predicted by the semi-analytic hierarchical clustering models ofkauffmann &amp; charlot, but this is only present in the $c_24668$ index models,and could be an effect of the lack of non solar abundance ratios in the wortheymodels used.  by comparing deviations from the cmr, with deviations in absorption indexfrom analogous `index-magnitude' relations, we find that colour deviationsbluewards of the mean relation are strongly correlated with the hydrogen balmerline series absorption. we show that the properties of these blue galaxies areconsistent with the presence of a young stellar population in the galaxies,rather than with a reduced metallicity.

0811.4425	morphological composition of z~0.4 groups: the site of s0 formation	the low redshift universe (z&lt;~0.5) is not a dull place. processes leading tothe suppression of star formation and morphological transformation areprevalent: this is particularly evident in the dramatic upturn in the fractionof s0-type galaxies in clusters. however, until now, the process andenvironment of formation has remained unidentified. we present a hst-basedmorphological analysis of galaxies in the redshift-space selected group andfield environments at z~0.4. groups contain a much higher fraction of s0s atfixed luminosity than the lower density field, with &gt;99.999% confidence. indeedthe s0 fraction in groups is at least as high as in z~0.4 clusters and x-rayselected groups, which have more luminous intra group medium (igm). an 97%confident excess of s0s at &gt;=0.3mpc from the group centre at fixed luminosity,tells us that formation is not restricted to, and possibly even avoids, thegroup cores. interactions with a bright x-ray emitting igm cannot be importantfor the formation of the majority of s0s in the universe. in contrast to s0s,the fraction of elliptical galaxies in groups at fixed luminosity is similar tothe field, whilst the brightest ellipticals are strongly enhanced towards thegroup centres (&gt;99.999% confidence within 0.3mpc). we conclude that the groupand sub-group environments must be dominant for the formation of s0 galaxies,and that minor mergers, galaxy harassment and tidal interactions are the mostlikely responsible mechanisms. this has implications not only for the inferredpre-processing of cluster galaxies, but also for the global morphological andstar formation budget of galaxies: as hierarchical clustering progresses, moregalaxies will be subject to these transformations as they enter the groupenvironment.

0812.1750	on the origin of cores in simulated galaxy clusters	(abridged) the thermal state of the intracluster medium results from acompetition between gas cooling and heating. the heating comes from twodistinct sources: gravitational heating from the collapse of the dark matterhalo and thermal input from galaxy/black hole formation. however, a longstanding problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothedparticle hydrodynamics (sph) and eulerian mesh codes predict different resultseven when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched off. clustersformed in sph simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while thoseformed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach suchlow entropies. since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimumentropy of the gas, the differences are of potentially key importance.  in this paper, we investigate the origin of this discrepancy. by comparingsimulations run using the gadget-2 sph code and the flash adaptive eulerianmesh code, we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger oftwo clusters. the difference is not sensitive to the resolution of oursimulations, nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers, galileannon-invariance of the mesh code, or an effect of unsuitable artificialviscosity in the sph code. instead, we find that the difference is inherent tothe treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities. these are suppressed in thesph simulations, while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the meshsimulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas.consequently, particles in the sph simulations retain a close connection totheir initial entropy, while this connection is much weaker in the meshsimulations. we discuss the potentially profound implications of these results.
