0903.3988	bright strongly lensed galaxies at redshift z~ 6-7 behind the clusters  abell 1703 and cl0024+161	we report on the discovery of three bright, strongly-lensed objects behindabell 1703 and cl0024+16 from a dropout search over 25 square arcminutes ofdeep nicmos data, with deep acs optical coverage. they are undetected in thedeep acs images below 8500 a and have clear detections in the j and h bands.fits to the acs, nicmos and irac data yield robust photometric redshifts in therange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshiftinterlopers. all three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of brightknots. the bright i-band dropout in abell 1703 has an h-band ab magnitude of23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z&gt;5.5. ourmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with amass of ~ 1e10 solar mass. the dropout galaxy candidates behind cl0024+16 areseparated by 2.5" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have h-band ab magnitudesof 25.0 and 25.6. lensing models of cl0024+16 suggest that the objects havecomparable intrinsic magnitudes of ab ~ 27.3, approximately one magnitudefainter than l* at z~6.5. their similar redshifts, spectral energydistribution, and luminosities, coupled with their very close proximity on thesky, suggest that they are spatially associated, and plausibly are physicallybound. combining this sample with two previously reported, similarly magnifiedgalaxy candidates at z~6-8, we find that complex systems with dual nuclei maybe a common feature of high-redshift galaxies.

0909.1082	stellar masses of lyman break galaxies, lyman alpha emitters and radio  galaxies in overdense regions at z=4-6	we present new information on galaxies in the vicinity of luminous radiogalaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. these fields were previously found to containoverdensities of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) or spectroscopic lyman alphaemitters. we use hst and spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast ourresults with large samples of lbgs in more average environments as probed bythe great observatories origins deep survey (goods). the following results wereobtained. first, lbgs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lieon a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.this is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[m*/msun] = 9-11) inwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their starformation rate (sfr) increases. second, the two radio galaxies are among themost massive objects (log[m*/msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and areextremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimatedfrom the ~25x larger area goods survey. we suggest that the presence of thesemassive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapidaccretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. third, the total stellarmass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' tn1338 accounts for &lt;30% of the stellarmass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z&gt;4, based on acomparison with the massive x-ray cluster cl1252 at z=1.2. although futurenear-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies arecurrently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference isthat tn1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than cl1252. this raises theinteresting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z&gt;4remain yet to be discovered.

0909.1803	discovery of z~8 galaxies in the hudf from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  observations	we utilize the newly-acquired, ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations over the hudfto search for star-forming galaxies at z~8-8.5, only 600 million years fromrecombination, using a y_{105}-dropout selection. the new 4.7 arcmin**2 wfc3/irobservations reach to ~28.8 ab mag (5 sigma) in the y_{105}j_{125}h_{160}bands. these remarkable data reach ~1.5 ab mag deeper than the previous dataover the hudf, and now are an excellent match to the hudf optical acs data. forour search criteria, we use a two-color lyman-break selection technique toidentify z~8-8.5 y_{105}-dropouts. we find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. thesources have h_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 ab mag and very blue uv-continuumslopes, with a median estimated beta of &lt;~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{\beta}). this suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dustfree but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. the observednumber of y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sourcesexpected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expectedextrapolating the bouwens et al. 2008 lf results to z~8. these results provideevidence that the evolution in the lf seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.the remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of wfc3/ir has enabled hst tocross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

0909.1806	z~7 galaxies in the hudf: first epoch wfc3/ir results	we present a sample of 16 robust z~7 z-drop galaxies detected by the newlyinstalled wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope. our analysis is basedon the first epoch data of the hudf09 program covering the hubble ultra deepfield with 60 orbits of y, j, and h observations. these remarkable data cover4.7 arcmin^2 and are the deepest nir images ever taken, reaching to ~29 mag ab(5 sigma). the 16 z~6.5-7.5 galaxies have been identified based on the lymanbreak technique utilizing (z-y) vs. (y-j) colors. they have magnitudes j =26.0-29.0 (ab), an average apparent half-light radius of ~0.16 arcsec (&lt;~1kpc), and show very blue colors (some even beta&lt;~-2.5), in particular at lowluminosities. the wfc3/ir data confirms previous nicmos detections indicatingthat the dropout selection at z~7 is very reliable. our data allow a firstdetermination of the faint end slope of the z~7 luminosity function, reachingdown to m_uv ~ -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. whenfixing phi*=1.4e-3/mpc^3/mag to the value previously measured at z~6, we find abest-fit value of alpha=-1.77+-0.20, with a characteristic luminosity ofm_*=-19.91+-0.09. this steep slope is similar to what is seen at z~2-6 andindicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate fluxto reionize the universe. the remarkable depth and resolution of these newimages provide insights into the coming power of jwst.

0909.4074	uv continuum slope and dust obscuration from z~6 to z~2: the star  formation rate density at high redshift	we provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame uv continuum slope betaover a wide range in redshift (z~2-6) and rest-frame uv luminosity (0.1-2l*) toimprove estimates of the sfr density at high redshift. we utilize the deepoptical and infrared data (acs/nicmos) over the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields,as well as the udf for our primary ubvi "dropout" sample. we correct theobserved distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. we findthat the uv-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantiallyredder at z~2-4 than it is at z~5-6. lower luminosity galaxies are also foundto be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. we do not find alarge number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections atz~4, and particularly at z&gt;~5, even though such sources could be readilyselected from our data. this suggests that star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~5 almostuniversally have very blue uv-continuum slopes, and that there are not likelyto be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z&gt;~5 that are missed in"dropout" searches. using the same relation between uv-continuum slope and dustextinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the averagedust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and uv luminosity in aconsistent way. we find that the estimated dust extinction increasessubstantially with cosmic time for the most uv luminous galaxies, but remainssmall (&lt;~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. because these samelower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the uv, theoverall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. we includethe contribution from ulirgs in our sfr density estimates at z~2-6, but findthat they contribute only ~20% of the total at z~2.5 and &lt;~10% at z&gt;~4.

0909.5183	structure and morphologies of z~7-8 galaxies from ultra-deep wfc3/ir  imaging of the hudf	we present a first morphological study of z~7-8 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)from oesch et al. 2009 and bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deepnear-infrared imaging of the hubble ultra deep field (hudf) by the hudf09program. with an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies arefound to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness ofmu_j ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. by comparison tolower redshift lbgs it is found that only little size evolution takes placefrom z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in theirapparent profiles. the average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 forgalaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52for (0.12-0.3)l*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comovingsizes. the peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.however, a tail of larger galaxies (&gt;~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towardslater cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhancedaccretion of cold gas. additionally, the average star-formation surface densityof lbgs with luminosities (0.3-1)l*_{z=3} is nearly constant at sigma_{sfr}=1.9msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similarstar-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. the above evolutionarytrends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possiblyincomplete.

0910.0001	very blue uv-continuum slopes of low luminosity z~7 galaxies from  wfc3/ir: evidence for extremely low metallicities?	we use the ultra-deep wfc3/ir data over the hudf and the early releasescience wfc3/ir data over the cdf-south goods field to quantify the broadbandspectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. we determine theuv-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxiesat later times to measure the evolution in beta. for luminous l*(z=3) galaxies,we measure a mean uv-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable tothe beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. however, for the lowerluminosity 0.1l*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. this issubstantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just800 myr later, and even at z~5-6. in principle, the observed beta of -3.0 canbe matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebularemission is included the expected beta becomes &gt;~-2.7. to produce these veryblue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms toreduce the red nebular emission are likely required. for example, a largeescape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}&gt;~0.3) could minimize the contribution from thisred nebular emission. if this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7galaxies is &gt;~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

0910.0838	ultradeep infrared array camera observations of sub-l* z~7 and z~8  galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field: the contribution of low-luminosity  galaxies to the stellar mass density and reionization	we study the spitzer infrared array camera (irac) mid-infrared (rest-frameoptical) fluxes of 14 newly wfc3/ir-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5z=8 y_{105}-dropout galaxies. the wfc3/ir depth and spatial resolution allowaccurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable fluxmeasurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. none of the galaxies are detected to[3.6]=26.9 (ab, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detectionfor the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the y_{105}-dropouts. weconstruct average broadband seds using the stacked acs, wfc3, and irac fluxesand fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellarmasses, and ages. for the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},(u-v)_{rest}=0.4, reddening a_v=0, stellar mass m*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9m_sun (salpeter imf). the best-fit ages ~300myr, m/l_v=0.2, andssfr=1.7gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. the sub-l* galaxiesobserved here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and underfavorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustainedreionization at 7&lt;z&lt;11. in contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} y_{105}-dropoutshave stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-completereliance on far-uv data. adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the m/l(z=8), thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab} &lt; -18 declines fromrho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 m_sun mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) &lt; 8 x 10^5 m_sunmpc^{-3}, following (1+z)^{-6} over 3&lt;z&lt;8. lower masses at z=8 would signifymore dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper iracobservations, long before the arrival of the james webb space telescope.

0911.1356	star formation rates and stellar masses of z=7-8 galaxies from irac  observations of the wfc3/ir ers and the hudf field	we investigate the spitzer/irac properties of 36 z~7 z-dropout galaxies and 3z~8 y-dropout galaxies derived from deep/wide-area wfc3/ir data of the earlyrelease science, the ultradeep hudf09, and wide-area nicmos data. we fitstellar population synthesis models to the seds to derive mean redshifts,stellar masses, and ages. the z~7 galaxies are best characterized bysubstantial ages (&gt;100 myr) and m/l_v~0.2. the main trend with decreasingluminosity is that of bluing of the far-uv slope from beta~-2.0 to beta~-3.0.this can be explained by decreasing metallicity, except for the lowestluminosity galaxies (0.1 l*{z=3}), where low metallicity and smooth sfhs failto match the blue far-uv and moderately red h-[3.6] color. such colors mayrequire episodic sfhs with short periods of activity and quiescence ("on-off"cycles) and/or a contribution from emission lines. the stellar mass of oursample of z~7 star forming galaxies correlates with sfr according to log m* =8.70 (+-0.09) + 1.06(+-0.10) log sfr, implying star formation may havecommenced at z&gt;10. no galaxies are found with sfrs much higher or lower thanthe past averaged sfr suggesting that the typical star formation timescales areprobably a substantial fraction of the hubble time. we report the first iracdetection of y-dropout galaxies at z~8. the average rest-frame u-v=0.3 (ab) ofthe 3 galaxies are similar to faint z~7 galaxies, implying similar m/l. thestellar mass density to m_{uv,ab}&lt;-18 is rho*(z=8) = 1.8^{+0.7}_{-1.0} x 10^6m_sun mpc^-3, following log rho*(z)= 10.6(+-0.6) - 4.4(+-0.7) log(1+z) [m_sunmpc^-3] over 3&lt;z&lt; 8.

0912.4263	a candidate redshift z ~ 10 galaxy and rapid changes in that population  at an age of 500 myr	searches for very-high-redshift galaxies over the past decade have yielded alarge sample of more than 6,000 galaxies existing just 900-2,000 million years(myr) after the big bang (redshifts 6 &gt; z &gt; 3; ref. 1). the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf09) data have yielded the first reliable detections of z ~ 8galaxies that, together with reports of a gamma-ray burst at z ~ 8.2 (refs 10,11), constitute the earliest objects reliably reported to date. observations ofz ~ 7-8 galaxies suggest substantial star formation at z &gt; 9-10. here we usethe full two-year hudf09 data to conduct an ultra-deep search for z ~ 10galaxies in the heart of the reionization epoch, only 500 myr after the bigbang. not only do we find one possible z ~ 10 galaxy candidate, but we showthat, regardless of source detections, the star formation rate density is muchsmaller (~10%) at this time than it is just ~200 myr later at z ~ 8. thisdemonstrates how rapid galaxy build-up was at z ~ 10, as galaxies increased inboth luminosity density and volume density from z ~ 8 to z ~ 10. the 100-200myr before z ~ 10 is clearly a crucial phase in the assembly of the earliestgalaxies.

1004.0384	the galaxy luminosity function during the reionization epoch	the new wide field camera 3/ir observations on the hubble ultra-deep fieldstarted investigating the properties of galaxies during the reionization epoch.to interpret these observations, we present a novel approach inspired by theconditional luminosity function method. we calibrate our model to observationsat z=6 and assume a non-evolving galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation.we first compare model predictions against the luminosity function measured atz=5 and z=4. we then predict the luminosity function at z&gt;=7 under the soleassumption of evolution in the underlying dark-matter halo mass function. ourmodel is consistent with the observed z&gt;6.5 galaxy number counts in the hudfsurvey and suggests a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of theluminosity function: alpha(z&gt;8)&lt; -1.9 compared to alpha=-1.74 at z=6. althoughwe currently see only the brightest galaxies, a hidden population of lowerluminosity objects (l/l_{*}&gt; 10^{-4}) might provide &gt;75% of the totalreionizing flux. assuming escape fraction f_{esc}~0.2, clumping factor c~5, topheavy-imf and low metallicity, galaxies below the detection limit producecomplete reionization at z&gt;8. for solar metallicity and normal stellar imf,reionization finishes at z&gt;6, but a smaller c/f_{esc} is required for anoptical depth consistent with the wmap measurement. our model highlights thatthe star formation rate in sub-l_* galaxies has a quasi-linear relation todark-matter halo mass, suggesting that radiative and mechanical feedback wereless effective at z&gt;6 than today.

1005.1661	the evolution of the uv luminosity function from z ~ 0.75 to z ~ 2.5  using hst ers wfc3/uvis observations	we present uv luminosity functions (lfs) at 1500 angstrom derived from thehst early release science wfc3/uvis data acquired over ~50 arcmin^2 of thegoods-south field. the lfs are determined over the entire redshift rangez=0.75-2.5 using two methods, similar to those used at higher redshifts forlyman break galaxies (lbgs): (1) 13-band uv+optical+nir photometric redshiftsto study galaxies in the range z=0.5-2 in three bins of dz=0.5, and (2) dropoutsamples in three redshift windows centered at z~1.5, z~1.9, and z~2.5. thecharacteristic luminosity dims by ~1.5 mag from z=2.5 to z=0.75, consistentwith earlier work. however, the other schechter function parameters, thefaint-end slope and the number density, are found to be remarkably constantover the range z=0.75-2.5. using these lf determinations we find the uvluminosity density to increase by ~1.4 dex according to (1+z)^{2.58+-0.15} fromz~0 to its peak at z~2.5. strikingly, the inferred faint-end slopes for our lfsare all steeper than alpha=-1.5, in agreement with higher-redshift lbg studies.since the faint-end slope in the local universe is found to be much flatterwith alpha~=-1.2, this poses the question as to when and how the expectedflattening occurs. despite relatively large uncertainties, our data suggestalpha~=-1.7 at least down to z~1. these new results from such a shallow earlydataset demonstrate very clearly the remarkable potential of wfc3/uvis for thethorough characterization of galaxy evolution over the full redshift rangez~0.5 to z~3.

1006.4360	uv luminosity functions from 132 z~7 and z~8 lyman-break galaxies in the  ultra-deep hudf09 and wide-area ers wfc3/ir observations	we identify 73 z~7 and 59 z~8 candidate galaxies in the reionization epoch,and use this large 26-29.4 ab mag sample of galaxies to derive very deepluminosity functions to &lt;-18 ab mag and the star formation rate density at z~7and z~8. the galaxy sample is derived using a sophisticated lyman-breaktechnique on the full two-year wfc3/ir and acs data available over the hudf09(~29.4 ab mag, 5 sigma), two nearby hudf09 fields (~29 ab mag, 14 arcmin) andthe wider area ers (~27.5 ab mag) ~40 arcmin**2). the application of strictoptical non-detection criteria ensures the contamination fraction is kept low(just ~7% in the hudf). this very low value includes a full assessment of thecontamination from lower redshift sources, photometric scatter, agn, spurioussources, low mass stars, and transients (e.g., sne). from careful modelling ofthe selection volumes for each of our search fields we derive luminosityfunctions for galaxies at z~7 and z~8 to &lt;-18 ab mag. the faint-end slopesalpha at z~7 and z~8 are uncertain but very steep at alpha = -2.01+/-0.21 andalpha=-1.91+/-0.32, respectively. such steep slopes contrast to the localalpha&lt;~-1.4 and may even be steeper than that at z~4 where alpha=-1.73+/-0.05.with such steep slopes (alpha&lt;~-1.7) lower luminosity galaxies dominate thegalaxy luminosity density during the epoch of reionization. the star formationrate densities derived from these new z~7 and z~8 luminosity functions areconsistent with the trends found at later times (lower redshifts). we findreasonable consistency, with the sfr densities implied from reported stellarmass densities, being only ~40% higher at z&lt;7. this suggests that (1) thestellar mass densities inferred from the spitzer irac photometry are reasonablyaccurate and (2) that the imf at very high redshift may not be very differentfrom that at later times.

1105.2038	lower-luminosity galaxies could reionize the universe: very steep  faint-end slopes to the uv luminosity functions at z&gt;=5-8 from the hudf09  wfc3/ir observations	the hudf09 data are the deepest near-ir observations ever, reaching to 29.5mag. luminosity functions (lf) from these new hudf09 data for 132 z\sim7 andz\sim8 galaxies are combined with new lfs for z\sim5-6 galaxies and the earlierz\sim4 lf to reach to very faint limits (&lt;0.05 l*(z=3)). the faint-end slopesalpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z\sim5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z\sim6), -2.01+/-0.21(z\sim7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z\sim8). slopes alpha\lesssim-2 lead to formallydivergent uv fluxes, though galaxies are not expected to form below \sim-10 abmag. these results have important implications for reionization. the weightedmean slope at z\sim6-8 is -1.87+/-0.13. for such steep slopes, and a faint-endlimit of -10 ab mag, galaxies provide a very large uv ionizing photon flux.while current results show that galaxies can reionize the universe by z\sim6,matching the thomson optical depths is more challenging. extrapolating thecurrent lf evolution to z&gt;8, taking alpha to be -1.87+/-0.13 (the mean value atz\sim6-8), and adopting typical parameters, we derive thomson optical depths of0.061_{-0.006}^{+0.009}. however, this result will change if the faint-endslope alpha is not constant with redshift. we test this hypothesis and find aweak, though uncertain, trend to steeper slopes at earlier times(dalpha/dz\sim-0.05+/-0.04), that would increase the thomson optical depths to0.079_{-0.017}^{+0.063}, consistent with recent wmap estimates(tau=0.088+/-0.015). it may thus not be necessary to resort to extremeassumptions about the escape fraction or clumping factor. nevertheless, theuncertainties remain large. deeper wfc3/ir+acs observations can furtherconstrain the ionizing flux from galaxies.

1105.2297	expanded search for z~10 galaxies from hudf09, ers, and candels data:  evidence for accelerated evolution at z&gt;8?	we search for z~10 galaxies over ~160 arcmin^2 of wfc3/ir data in the chandradeep field south, using the public hudf09, ers, and candels surveys, that reachto 5sigma depths ranging from 26.9 to 29.4 in h_160 ab mag. z&gt;~9.5 galaxycandidates are identified via j_125-h_160&gt;1.2 colors and non-detections in anyband blueward of j_125. spitzer irac photometry is key for separating thegenuine high-z candidates from intermediate redshift (z~2-4) galaxies withevolved or heavily dust obscured stellar populations. after removing 16 sourcesof intermediate brightness (h_160~24-26 mag) with strong irac detections, weonly find one plausible z~10 galaxy candidate in the whole data set, previouslyreported in bouwens et al. (2011). the newer data cover a 3x larger area andprovide much stronger constraints on the evolution of the uv luminosityfunction (lf). if the evolution of the z~4-8 lfs is extrapolated to z~10, sixz~10 galaxies are expected in our data. the detection of only one sourcesuggests that the uv lf evolves at an accelerated rate before z~8. theluminosity density is found to increase by more than an order of magnitude inonly 170 myr from z~10 to z~8. this increase is &gt;=4x larger than expected fromthe lower redshift extrapolation of the uv lf. we are thus likely witnessingthe first rapid build-up of galaxies in the heart of cosmic reionization.future deep hst wfc3/ir data, reaching to well beyond 29 mag, can enable a morerobust quantification of the accelerated evolution around z~10.

1109.0994	uv-continuum slopes at z~4-7 from the hudf09+ers+candels observations:  discovery of a well-defined uv-color magnitude relationship for z&gt;=4  star-forming galaxies	ultra-deep acs and wfc3/ir hudf+hudf09 data, along with the wide-areagoods+ers+candels data over the cdf-s goods field, are used to measure uvcolors, expressed as the uv-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies overa wide range in luminosity (0.1l*(z=3) to 2l*(z=3)) at high redshift (z~7 toz~4). beta is measured using all acs and wfc3/ir passbands uncontaminated byly_alpha and spectral breaks. extensive tests show that our beta measurementsare only subject to minimal biases. using a different selection procedure,dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. toreconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found thatbeta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the samepassbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.high-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame uv color-magnitude (cm)relationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter uv luminosities.no evolution is seen in the slope of the uv cm relationship in the first 1.5gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors fromz~7 to z~4. this suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-definedsequence in the l(uv)-color (beta) plane (a "star-forming sequence"?). dustappears to be the principal factor driving changes in the uv color (beta) withluminosity. these new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinctionestimates at z~4-7 and confirm that the extinction is still essentially zero atlow luminosities and high redshifts. inclusion of the new dust extinctionresults leads to (i) excellent agreement between the sfr density at z~4-8 andthat inferred from the stellar mass density, and (ii) to higher ssfrs at z&gt;~4,suggesting the ssfr may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z~4-7 to z~2.

1110.0468	overdensities of y-dropout galaxies from the brightest-of-reionizing  galaxies survey: a candidate protocluster at redshift z~8	theoretical and numerical modeling of dark-matter halo assembly predicts thatthe most luminous galaxies at high redshift are surrounded by overdensities offainter companions. we test this prediction with hst observations acquired byour brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey, which identified four verybright z~8 candidates as y-dropout sources in four of the 23 non-contiguouswfc3 fields observed. we extend here the search for y-dropouts to fainterluminosities (m_* galaxies with m_ab\sim-20), with detections at &gt;5sigmaconfidence (compared to &gt;8sigma confidence adopted earlier) identifying 17 newcandidates. we demonstrate that there is a correlation between number counts offaint and bright y-dropouts at &gt;99.84% confidence. field borg58, which containsthe best bright z\sim8 candidate (m_ab=-21.3), has the most significantoverdensity of faint y-dropouts. four new sources are located within 70arcsec(corresponding to 3.1 comoving mpc at z=8) from the previously known brighterz\sim8 candidate. the overdensity of y-dropouts in this field has a physicalorigin to high confidence (p&gt;99.975%), independent of completeness andcontamination rate of the y-dropout selection. we modeled the overdensity bymeans of cosmological simulations and estimate that the principal dark matterhalo has mass m_h\sim(4-7)x10^11msun (\sim5sigma density peak) and issurrounded by several m_h\sim10^11msun halos which could host the fainterdropouts. in this scenario, we predict that all halos will eventually mergeinto a m_h&gt;2x10^14msun galaxy cluster by z=0. follow-up observations withground and space based telescopes are required to secure the z\sim8 nature ofthe overdensity, discover new members, and measure their precise redshift.

1201.0755	the bright end of the uv luminosity function at z~8: new constraints  from candels data in goods-south	we present new z~8 galaxy candidates from a search over ~95 arcmin^2 ofwfc3/ir data, tripling the previous search area for bright z~8 galaxies. ouranalysis uses newly acquired wfc3/ir imaging data from the candels multi-cycletreasury program over the goods south field. these new data are combined withexisting deep optical acs imaging to search for relatively bright (m_uv &lt; -19.5mag) z~8 galaxy candidates using the lyman break technique. these newcandidates are used to determine the bright end of the uv luminosity function(lf) of star-forming galaxies at z~8. to minimize contamination from lowerredshift galaxies, we make full use of all optical acs data and impose strictnon-detection criteria based on an optical chi^2_opt flux measurement. in thewhole search area we identify 16 candidate z~8 galaxies, spanning a magnituderange h_160 = 25.7-27.9 mag. the new data show that the uv lf is a factor ~1.7xlower at m_uv &lt; -19.5 mag than determined from the hudf09 and ers data alone.combining this new sample with the previous candidates from the hudf09 and ersdata allows us to perform the most accurate measurement of the z~8 uv lf yet.schechter function fits to the combined data result in a best-fitcharacteristic magnitude of m*(z=8) = -20.04+-0.46 mag. the faint-end slope isvery steep, though quite uncertain, with alpha = -2.06+-0.32. a combination ofwide area data with additional ultra-deep imaging will be required tosignificantly reduce the uncertainties on these parameters in the future.

1204.3641	the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey: constraints on the bright  end of the z~8 luminosity function	we report the discovery of 33 lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidates at z~8detected in hubble space telescope (hst) wide field camera 3 (wfc3) imaging aspart of the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) pure-parallel survey. theongoing borg survey currently has the largest area (274 arcmin^2) with y_098(or y_105), j_125, and h_160 band coverage needed to search for z~8 galaxies,about three times the current candels area, and slightly larger than what willbe the final candels wide component with y_105 data. our sample of 33relatively bright y_098-dropout galaxies have j_125 band magnitudes between25.5 and 27.4 mag. this is the largest sample of bright (j_125 &lt;~ 27.4) z~8galaxy candidates presented to date. combining our dataset with the hubbleultra-deep field (hudf09) dataset, we constrain the rest-frame ultravioletgalaxy luminosity function at z~8 over the widest dynamic range currentlyavailable. the combined datasets are well fitted by a schechter function, i.e.\phi(l) = \phi_* (l/l_*)^{\alpha}\ e^{-(l/l_*)}, without evidence for an excessof sources at the bright end. at 68% confidence, we derive \phi_* =(4.3^{+3.5}_{-2.1}) \times 10^{-4} mpc^{-3}, m_* = -20.26^{+0.29}_{-0.34}, anda very steep faint-end slope \alpha = -1.98^{+0.23}_{-0.22}. while the best-fitparameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between \phi_* and m_*,our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of thefaint-end power-law slope at z~8 compared to the best previous determination at+/-0.4. with a future expansion of the borg survey, combined with plannedultradeep wfc3/ir observations, it will be possible to further reduce thisuncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slopecompared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key roleplayed by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

1209.3037	the spectral energy distributions of z~8 galaxies from the irac ultra  deep fields: emission lines, stellar masses, and specific star formation  rates at 650 myr	using new ultradeep spitzer/irac photometry from the irac ultradeep fieldprogram (iudf), we investigate the stellar populations of a sample of 63y-dropout galaxy candidates at z~8, only 650myr after the big bang. the sourcesare selected from hst/acs+wfc3/ir data over the hubble ultra deep field (hudf),two hudf parallel fields, and wide area data over the candels/goods-south. thenew spitzer/irac data increase the coverage at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron to~120h over the hudf reaching depths of ~28 (ab,1 sigma). the improved depth andinclusion of brighter candidates result in direct &gt;3 sigma irac detections of20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at &gt; 5 sigma. the average[3.6]-[4.5] colors of irac detected galaxies at z~8 are markedly redder thanthose at z~7, observed only 130myr later. the simplest explanation is that wewitness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular[oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) moving through the irac bandpasses with redshift.assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z~7 and z~8we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of w([oiii]4959,5007+hbeta) = 670(+260,-170) angstrom contributing 0.56 (+0.16,-0.11) mag to the 4.5 micronfilter at z~8. the corresponding w(halpha) = 430 (+160,-110) angstrom impliesan average specific star formation rate of ssfr = 11 (+11,-5) gyr^-1 and astellar population age of 100 (+100,-50) myr. correcting the spectral energydistribution for the contribution of emission lines lowers the average best-fitstellar masses and mass-to-light ratios by x3, decreasing the integratedstellar mass density to rho*(z=8,muv&lt;-18)=0.6 (+0.4,-0.3) x 10^6 msun mpc^-3.

1211.1010	a rest-frame optical view on z~4 galaxies i: color and age distributions  from deep irac photometry of the iudf10 and goods surveys	we present a study of rest-frame uv-to-optical color distributions for z~4galaxies based on the combination of deep hst/acs+wfc3/ir data withspitzer/irac imaging. in particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the iracultradeep field program (iudf10). our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxiesselected as b-dropout lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the hudf and one of itsdeep parallel fields, the hudf09-2, as well as goods-north and south. thissample is used to investigate the uv continuum slopes beta and balmer breakcolors (j_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. the [4.5]filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame opticalemission lines. we find that galaxies at m_z&lt;-21.5 (roughly corresponding tol*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. theuv continuum slopes and the j_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. the mostsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at theseredshifts is better described by an smc-like extinction curve, rather than thetypically assumed calzetti reddening. after correcting for dust, we find thatthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function ofluminosity. in contrast to some results from the literature, we find that onlya small fraction of galaxies shows balmer break colors which are consistentwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 myr. under the assumption of smoothstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies atm_z&lt;-19.75. our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars anddust in galaxies at z&gt;4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed inshort, intense bursts of star-formation.

1211.3105	photometric constraints on the redshift of z~10 candidate udfj-39546284  from deeper wfc3/ir+acs+irac observations over the hudf	ultra-deep wfc3/ir observations on the hudf from the hudf09 program revealedjust one plausible z~10 candidate udfj-39546284. udfj-39546284 had all theproperties expected of a galaxy at z~10 showing (1) no detection in the deepacs+wfc3 imaging data blueward of the f160w band, exhibiting (2) a bluespectral slope redward of the break, and showing (3) no prominent detection indeep irac observations. the new, similarly deep wfc3/ir hudf12 f160wobservations over the hudf09/xdf allow us to further assess this candidate.these observations show that this candidate, previously only detected at ~5.9sigma in a single band, clearly corresponds to a real source. it is detected at~5.3 sigma in the new h-band data and at ~7.8 sigma in the full 85-orbit h-bandstack. interestingly, the non-detection of the source (&lt;1 sigma) in the newf140w observations suggests a higher redshift. formally, the best-fit redshiftof the source utilizing all the wfc3+acs (and irac+k-band) observations is11.8+/-0.3. however, we consider the z~12 interpretation somewhat unlikely,since the source would either need to be ~20x more luminous than expected orshow very high-ew ly-alpha emission (which seems improbable given the extensiveneutral gas prevalent early in the reionization epoch). lower-redshiftsolutions fail if only continuum models are allowed. plausible lower-redshiftsolutions require that the h-band flux be dominated by line emission such ashalpha or [oiii] with extreme ews. the tentative detection of line emission at1.6 microns in udfj-39546284 in a companion paper suggests that such emissionmay have already been found.

1301.6162	probing the dawn of galaxies at z~9-12: new constraints from hudf12/xdf  and candels data	we present a comprehensive analysis of z&gt;8 galaxies based on ultra-deepwfc3/ir data. we constrain the evolution of the uv luminosity function (lf) andluminosity densities from z~11 to z~8 by exploiting all the wfc3/ir data overthe hubble ultra-deep field from the hudf09 and the new hudf12 program, inaddition to the hudf09 parallel field data, as well as wider area wfc3/irimaging over goods-south. galaxies are selected based on the lyman breaktechnique in three samples centered around z~9, z~10 and z~11, with seven z~9galaxy candidates, and one each at z~10 and z~11. we confirm a new z~10candidate (with z=9.8+-0.6) that was not convincingly identified in our firstz~10 sample. the deeper data over the hudf confirms all our previous z&gt;~7.5candidates as genuine high-redshift candidates, and extends our samples tohigher redshift and fainter limits (h_160~29.8 mag). we perform one of thefirst estimates of the z~9 uv lf and improve our previous constraints at z~10.extrapolating the lower redshift uv lf evolution should have revealed 17 z~9and 9 z~10 sources, i.e., a factor ~3x and 9x larger than observed. theinferred star-formation rate density (sfrd) in galaxies above 0.7 m_sun/yrdecreases by 0.6+-0.2 dex from z~8 to z~9, in good agreement with previousestimates. the low number of sources found at z&gt;8 is consistent with a veryrapid build-up of galaxies across z~10 to z~8. from a combination of allcurrent measurements, we find a best estimate of a factor 10x decrease in thesfrd from z~8 to z~10, following (1+z)^(-11.4+-3.1). our measurements thusconfirm our previous finding of an accelerated evolution beyond z~8, andsignify a rapid build-up of galaxies with m_uv&lt;-17.7 within only ~200 myr fromz~10 to z~8, in the heart of cosmic reionization.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

0802.2506	discovery of a very bright strongly-lensed galaxy candidate at z ~ 7.6	using hst and spitzer irac imaging, we report the discovery of a very brightstrongly lensed lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidate at z~7.6 in the field of themassive galaxy cluster abell 1689. the galaxy candidate, which we refer to asa1689-zd1, shows a strong z-j break of at least 2.2 mag and is completelyundetected (&lt;1 sigma) in hst/acs g, r, i, and z-band data. these properties,combined with the very blue j-h and h-[4.5] colors, are exactly the propertiesof an z~7.6 lbg and can only be reasonably fit by a star-forming galaxy atz=7.6 +/- 0.4. attempts to reproduce these properties with a model galaxy atz&lt;4 yield particularly poor fits. a1689-zd1 has an observed (lensed) magnitudeof 24.7 ab (8 sigma) in the nicmos h band and is ~1.3 mag brighter than thebrightest-known z-dropout galaxy. when corrected for the cluster magnificationof 9.3 at z~7.6, the candidate has an intrinsic magnitude of h=27.1 ab, orabout an l* galaxy at z~7.6. the source-plane deprojection shows that the starformation is occurring in compact knots of size ~&lt;300 pc. the best-fit stellarpopulation synthesis models yield a median redshift of 7.6, stellar masses(1.6-3.9) x 10^9 m_sun, stellar ages 45-320 myr, star-formation rates ~&lt;7.6m_sun/yr, and low reddening with a_v &lt;= 0.3. these properties are generallysimilar to those of lbgs found at z~5-6. the inferred stellar ages suggest aformation redshift of z~8-10 (t~&lt;0.63 gyr). a1689-zd1 is the brightestobserved, highly reliable z&gt;7.0 galaxy candidate found to date.

1403.4295	uv luminosity functions at redshifts z~4 to z~10: 10000 galaxies from  hst legacy fields	the remarkable hst datasets from the candels, hudf09, hudf12, ers, andborg/hippies programs have allowed us to map out the evolution of the uv lffrom z~10 to z~4. we have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxycandidates at z~4, z~5, z~6, z~7, z~8, and z~10, respectively from the ~1000arcmin**2 area probed. the selection of z~4-8 galaxies over the five candelsfields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations areapparent at z&gt;=7. our new lf determinations at z~4 and z~5 span a 6-magbaseline (-22.5 to -16 ab mag). these determinations agree well with previousestimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a morereliable sampling of &gt;l* galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the uvlfs. our new lf results strengthen our earlier findings to 3.4 sigmasignificance for a steeper faint-end slope to the uv lf at z&gt;4, with alphaevolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04 at z~4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.13 at z~7 (and alpha= -2.02+/-0.23 at z~8), consistent with that expected from the evolution of thehalo mass function. with our improved constraints at the bright end, we findless evolution in the characteristic luminosity m* over the redshift range z~4to z~7; the observed evolution in the lf is now largely represented by changesin phi*. no evidence for a non-schechter-like form to the z~4-8 lfs is found. asimple conditional lf model based on halo growth and evolution in the m/l ratioof halos ((1+z)**-1.5) provides a good representation of the observedevolution.

1407.7316	measurement of galaxy clustering at z~7.2 and the evolution of galaxy  bias from 3.8&lt;z&lt;8 in the xdf, goods-s and goods-n	lyman-break galaxy (lbg) samples observed during reionization ($z\gtrsim6$)with hubble space telescope's wide field camera 3 are reaching sizes sufficientto characterize their clustering properties. using a combined catalog from thehubble extreme deep field and candels surveys, containing $n=743$ lbgcandidates at z&gt;6.5 at a mean redshift of $z=7.2$, we detect a clear clusteringsignal in the angular correlation function (acf) at $\sim4\sigma$,corresponding to a real-space correlation length$r_{0}=6.7^{+0.9}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cmpc. the derived galaxy bias$b=8.6^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ is that of dark-matter halos of$m=10^{11.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}}$m$_{\odot}$ at $z=7.2$, and highlights that galaxiesbelow the current detection limit ($m_{ab}\sim-17.7$) are expected inlower-mass halos ($m\sim10^{8}-10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$). we compute the acf oflbgs at $z\sim3.8-z\sim5.9$ in the same surveys. a trend of increasing bias isfound from $z=3.8$ ($b\sim3.0$) to $z=7.2$ ($b\sim8.6$), broadly consistentwith galaxies at fixed luminosity being hosted in dark-matter halos of similarmass at $4&lt;z&lt;6$, followed by a slight rise in halo masses at $z\sim7$($\sim2\sigma$ confidence). separating the data at the median luminosity of the$z=7.2$ sample ($m_{uv}=-19.4$) shows higher clustering at $z=5.9$ for brightgalaxies ($r_{0}=5.5^{+1.4}_{-1.5}h^{-1}$cmpc, $b=6.2^{+1.2}_{-1.5}$) comparedto faint galaxies ($r_{0}=1.9^{+1.1}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cmpc, $b=2.7\pm1.2$) implyinga constant mass-to-light ratio $\frac{dlogm}{dlogl}\sim1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.8}$. asimilar trend is present in the $z=7.2$ sample with larger uncertainty.finally, our bias measurements allow us to investigate the fraction ofdark-matter halos hosting uv-bright galaxies (the duty-cycle, $\epsilon_{dc}$).at $z=7.2$ values near unity are preferred, which may be explained by theshortened halo assembly time at high-redshift.

1409.1228	first frontier field constraints on the cosmic star-formation rate  density at z~10 - the impact of lensing shear on completeness of  high-redshift galaxy samples	we search the complete hubble frontier field dataset of abell 2744 and itsparallel field for z~10 sources to further refine the evolution of the cosmicstar-formation rate density (sfrd) at z&gt;8. we independently confirm two imagesof the recently discovered triply-imaged z~9.8 source by zitrin et al. (2014)and set an upper limit for similar z~10 galaxies with red colors ofj_125-h_160&gt;1.2 in the parallel field of abell 2744. we utilize extensivesimulations to derive the effective selection volume of lyman-break galaxies atz~10, both in the lensed cluster field and in the adjacent parallel field.particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear toaccurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnifiedsources. we show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness ata given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the criticalcurves. these effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on thedetectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantiallyreduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. the detections andlimits from both pointings result in a sfrd which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dexthan previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. nevertheless, thecombination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistentwith a rapidly declining sfrd in the 170 myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted bycosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in lambdacdm. oncebiases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,the full six cluster and parallel frontier field program will be an extremelypowerful new dataset to probe the evolution of the galaxy population at z&gt;8before the advent of the jwst.

1502.05399	a spectroscopic redshift measurement for a luminous lyman break galaxy  at z=7.730 using keck/mosfire	we present a spectroscopic redshift measurement of a very bright lyman breakgalaxy at z=7.7302+-0.0006 using keck/mosfire. the source was pre-selectedphotometrically in the egs field as a robust z~8 candidate with h=25.0 magbased on optical non-detections and a very red spitzer/irac [3.6]-[4.5]broad-band color driven by high equivalent width [oiii]+hbeta line emission.the lyalpha line is reliably detected at 6.1 sigma and shows an asymmetricprofile as expected for a galaxy embedded in a relatively neutralinter-galactic medium near the planck peak of cosmic reionization. the line hasa rest-frame equivalent width of ew0=21+-4 a and is extended withv_fwhm=360+90-70 km/s. the source is perhaps the brightest and most massive z~8lyman break galaxy in the full candels and borg/hippies surveys, havingassembled already 10^(9.9+-0.2) m_sol of stars at only 650 myr after the bigbang. the spectroscopic redshift measurement sets a new redshift record forgalaxies. this enables reliable constraints on the stellar mass, star-formationrate, formation epoch, as well as combined [oiii]+hbeta line equivalent widths.the redshift confirms that the irac [4.5] photometry is very likely dominatedby line emission with ew0(oiii+hbeta)= 720-150+180 a. this detection thus addsto the evidence that extreme rest-frame optical emission lines are a ubiquitousfeature of early galaxies promising very efficient spectroscopic follow-up inthe future with infrared spectroscopy using jwst and, later, elts.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

1503.08228	reionization after planck: the derived growth of the cosmic ionizing  emissivity now matches the growth of the galaxy uv luminosity density	thomson optical depth tau measurements from planck provide new insights intothe reionization of the universe. in pursuit of model-independent constraintson the properties of the ionising sources, we determine the empirical evolutionof the cosmic ionizing emissivity. we use a simple two-parameter model to mapout the evolution in the emissivity at z&gt;~6 from the new planck optical depthtau measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectraand from the prevalence of ly-alpha emission in z~7-8 galaxies. we find theredshift evolution in the emissivity dot{n}_{ion}(z) required by theobservations to be d(log nion)/dz=-0.15(-0.11)(+0.08), largely independent ofthe assumed clumping factor c_{hii} and entirely independent of the nature ofthe ionising sources. the trend in dot{n}_{ion}(z) is well-matched by theevolution of the galaxy uv-luminosity density (dlog_{10}rho_uv/dz=-0.11+/-0.04) to a magnitude limit &gt;~-13 mag, suggesting thatgalaxies are the sources that drive the reionization of the universe. the roleof galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the uv luminositydensity rho_uv to dot(n)_{ion}(z) being possible for physically-plausiblevalues of the escape fraction f_{esc}, the lyman-continuum photon productionefficiency xi_{ion}, and faint-end cut-off $m_{lim}$ to the luminosityfunction. quasars/agn appear to match neither the redshift evolution nornormalization of the ionizing emissivity. based on the inferred evolution inthe ionizing emissivity, we estimate that the z~10 uv-luminosity density is8(-4)(+15)x lower than at $z~6, consistent with the observations. the presentapproach of contrasting the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity withthat of the galaxy uv luminosity density adds to the growing observationalevidence that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of theuniverse.

astro-ph;0411516	the luminosity functions of the galaxy cluster ms1054-0321 at z=0.83  based on acs photometry	we present new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) and itsdependence on local galaxy density, color, morphology, and clustocentric radiusfor the massive z=0.83 cluster ms1054-0321. our analyses are based on imagingperformed with the acs onboard the hst in the f606w, f775w and f850lp passbandsand extensive spectroscopic data obtained with the keck lris. our main resultsare based on a spectroscopically selected sample of 143 cluster members withmorphological classifications derived from the acs observations. our threeprimary findings are (1) the faint-end slope of the lf is steepest in thebluest filter, (2) the lf in the inner part of the cluster (or highest densityregions) has a flatter faint-end slope, and (3) the fraction of early-typegalaxies is higher at the bright end of the lf, and gradually decreases towardfainter magnitudes. these characteristics are consistent with those in localgalaxy clusters, indicating that, at least in massive clusters, the commoncharacteristics of cluster lfs are established at z=0.83. we also find a 2sigmadeficit of intrinsically faint, red galaxies (i-z&gt;0.5, mi&gt;-19) in this cluster.this trend may suggest that faint, red galaxies (which are common in z&lt;0.1 richclusters) have not yet been created in this cluster at z=0.83. thegiant-to-dwarf ratio in ms1054-0321 starts to increase inwards of the virialradius or when sigma&gt;30 mpc^-2, coinciding with the environment where thegalaxy star formation rate and the morphology-density relation start to appear.(abridged)

astro-ph;0412083	the transformation of cluster galaxies at intermeidate redshift	we combine imaging data from the advanced camera for surveys (acs) withvlt/fors optical spectroscopy to study the properties of star-forming galaxiesin the z=0.837 cluster cl0152-1357. we have morphological information for 24star-forming cluster galaxies, which range in morphology from late-type andirregular to compact early-type galaxies. we find that while most star-forminggalaxies have $r_{625}-i_{775}$ colors bluer than 1.0, eight are in the redcluster sequence. among the star-forming cluster population we find fivecompact early-type galaxies which have properties consistent with theiridentification as progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies. the spatialdistribution of the star-forming cluster members is nonuniform. we find nonewithin $r\sim 500$ mpc of the cluster center, which is highly suggestive of anintracluster medium interaction. we derive star formation rates from [oii]$\lambda\lambda 3727$ line fluxes, and use these to compare the global starformation rate of cl0152-1357 to other clusters at low and intermediateredshifts. we find a tentative correlation between integrated star formationrates and $t_{x}$, in the sense that hotter clusters have lower integrated starformation rates. additional data from clusters with low x-ray temperatures isneeded to confirm this trend. we do not find a significant correlation withredshift, suggesting that evolution is either weak or absent between z=0.2-0.8.

astro-ph;0503365	evolution in the cluster early-type galaxy size-surface brightness  relation at z =~ 1	we investigate the evolution in the distribution of surface brightness, as afunction of size, for elliptical and s0 galaxies in the two clusters rdcsj1252.9-2927, z=1.237 and rx j0152.7-1357, z=0.837. we use multi-color imagingwith the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope to determinethese sizes and surface brightnesses. using three different estimates of thesurface brightnesses, we find that we reliably estimate the surface brightnessfor the galaxies in our sample with a scatter of &lt; 0.2 mag and with systematicshifts of \lesssim 0.05 mag. we construct samples of galaxies with early-typemorphologies in both clusters. for each cluster, we use a magnitude limit in aband which closely corresponds to the rest-frame b, to magnitude limit of m_b =-18.8 at z=0, and select only those galaxies within the color-magnitudesequence of the cluster or by using our spectroscopic redshifts. we measureevolution in the rest-frame b surface brightness, and find -1.41 \+/- 0.14 magfrom the coma cluster of galaxies for rdcs j1252.9-2927 and -0.90 \+/- 0.12 magof evolution for rx j0152.7-1357, or an average evolution of (-1.13 \+/- 0.15)z mag. our statistical errors are dominated by the observed scatter in thesize-surface brightness relation, sigma = 0.42 \+/- 0.05 mag for rxj0152.7-1357 and sigma = 0.76 \+/- 0.10 mag for rdcs j1252.9-2927. we find nostatistically significant evolution in this scatter, though an increase in thescatter could be expected. overall, the pace of luminosity evolution we measureagrees with that of the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies, implying thatthe majority of massive early-type galaxies observed at z =~ 1 formed at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0503445	a dynamical simulation of the debris disk around hd 141569a	we study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in thescattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around hd 141569a. weexplore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag fromthe gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating andmaintaining these structures. we use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetricmodel to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that abroad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. this modelalso suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as theobserved dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistentwith submillimeter mass measurements. we model in two dimensions the effects ofa fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,coplanar orbit. we track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,planetesimals, and dust. we conclude that the surface density distributionreflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. our mostviable model features a disk of initial radius 400 au, a gas mass of 50m_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. the model reproduces some features of hd141569a's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it doesnot reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor theobserved clearing in the inner disk. for the latter, we consider the effect ofa 5 m_jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of hd141569a.

astro-ph;0503454	distant red galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field	we take advantage of the hubble ultra deep field (udf) data to study therestframe optical and ultra violet (uv) morphologies of the novel population ofdistant red galaxies (drgs). six galaxies with j-ks &gt; 2.3 are found to ks=21.5,five of which have photometric redshifts z_phot &gt; 2, corresponding to a surfacedensity of 0.9/arcmin^2. the surface brightness distributions of the z_phot &gt; 2galaxies are better represented by exponential disks than r^{1/4}-laws. two ofthe z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies.the restframe optical morphology of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies is quite differentfrom the restframe uv morphology: all the galaxies have red central componentswhich dominate in the nicmos h_{160}-band images, and distinct off-center bluefeatures which show up in (and often dominate) the acs images. the meanmeasured effective radius of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies is &lt;r_e&gt; =1.9+/-1.4 kpc,similar (within the errors) to the mean size of lbgs at similar redshifts. allthe drgs are resolved in the acs images, while four are resolved in the nicmosimages. two of the z_phot &gt; 2 galaxies are bright x-ray sources and hence hostagn. the diverse restframe optical and uv morphological properties of drgsderived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations, consisting ofboth evolved populations that dominate the mass and the restframe opticallight, and younger populations, which show up as patches of star formation inthe restframe uv light; in many ways resembling the properties of normal localgalaxies. this interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband seds, whichfor all five z_phot &gt; 2 are best represented by models with extended starformation histories and substantial amounts of dust.

astro-ph;0509308	clustering of star-forming galaxies near a radio galaxy at z=5.2	we present hst/acs observations of the most distant radio galaxy known, tnj0924-2201 at z=5.2. this radio galaxy has 6 spectroscopically confirmed lyaemitting companion galaxies, and appears to lie within an overdense region. theradio galaxy is marginally resolved in i_775 and z_850 showing continuumemission aligned with the radio axis, similar to what is observed for lowerredshift radio galaxies. both the half-light radius and the uv star formationrate are comparable to the typical values found for lyman break galaxies atz~4-5. the lya emitters are sub-l* galaxies, with deduced star formation ratesof 1-10 msun/yr. one of the lya emitters is only detected in lya. based on thestar formation rate of ~3 msun/yr calculated from lya, the lack of continuumemission could be explained if the galaxy is younger than ~2 myr and isproducing its first stars.  observations in v_606, i_775, and z_850 were used to identify additionallyman break galaxies associated with this structure. in addition to the radiogalaxy, there are 22 v-break (z~5) galaxies with z_850&lt;26.5 (5sigma), two ofwhich are also in the spectroscopic sample. we compare the surface density of2/arcmin^2 to that of similarly selected v-dropouts extracted from goods andthe udf parallel fields. we find evidence for an overdensity to very highconfidence (&gt;99%), based on a counts-in-cells analysis applied to the controlfield. the excess is suggestive of the v-break objects being associated with aforming cluster around the radio galaxy.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.
