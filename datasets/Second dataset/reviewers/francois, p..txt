0902.0450	evolution of the barium abundance in the early galaxy from a nlte  analysis of the ba lines in a homogeneous sample of emp stars	barium is a key element in constraining the evolution of the (not wellunderstood) r-process in the first galactic stars and currently the baabundances in these very metal-poor stars were mostly measured under the localthermodynamical equilibrium (lte) assumption, which may lead in general to anunderestimation of ba. we present here determinations of the barium abundancetaking into account the non-lte (nlte) effects in a sample of extremelymetal-poor stars (emp stars): 6 turnoff stars and 35 giants. the nlte profilesof the three unblended ba ii lines (455.4, 585.3, 649.6nm) have been computed.the computations were made with a modified version of the multi code, appliedto an atomic model of the ba atom with 31 levels of ba i, 101 levels of ba ii,and compared to the observations. the ratios of the nlte abundances of bariumrelative to fe are slightly shifted towards the solar ratio. in the plot of[ba/fe] versus [fe/h], the slope of the regression line is slightly reduced asis the scatter. in the interval -3.3 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; -2.6, [ba/fe] decreases with aslope of about 1.4 and a scatter close to 0.44. for [fe/h] &lt;-3.3 the number ofstars is not sufficient to decide whether [ba/fe] keeps decreasing (and thencd-38:245 should be considered as a peculiar "barium-rich star") or if aplateau is reached as soon as [ba/fe] ~ -1. in both cases the scatter remainsquite large, larger than what can be accounted for by the measurement anddetermination errors, suggesting the influence of a complex process of baproduction, and/or inefficient mixing in the early galaxy.

0903.4174	first stars xii. abundances in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars,and  comparison with the giants	context:the detailed chemical abundances of extremely metal-poor (emp) starsare key guides to understanding the early chemical evolution of the galaxy.most existing data are, however, for giant stars which may have experiencedinternal mixing later. aims: we aim to compare the results for giants with new,accurate abundances for all observable elements in 18 emp turnoff stars.methods:vlt/uves spectra at r ~45,000 and s/n~ 130 per pixel (330-1000 nm) areanalysed with osmarcs model atmospheres and the turbospectrum code to deriveabundances for c, mg, si, ca, sc, ti, cr, mn, co, ni, zn, sr, and ba. results:for ca, ni, sr, and ba, we find excellent consistency with our earlier sampleof emp giants, at all metallicities. however, our abundances of c, sc, ti, cr,mn and co are ~0.2 dex larger than in giants of similar metallicity. mg and siabundances are ~0.2 dex lower (the giant [mg/fe] values are slightly revised),while zn is again ~0.4 dex higher than in giants of similar [fe/h] (6 starsonly). conclusions:for c, the dwarf/giant discrepancy could possibly have anastrophysical cause, but for the other elements it must arise from shortcomingsin the analysis. approximate computations of granulation (3d) effects yieldsmaller corrections for giants than for dwarfs, but suggest that this is anunlikely explanation, except perhaps for c, cr, and mn. nlte computations forna and al provide consistent abundances between dwarfs and giants, unlike thelte results, and would be highly desirable for the other discrepant elements aswell. meanwhile, we recommend using the giant abundances as reference data forgalactic chemical evolution models.

0904.3199	an investigation of chromospheric activity spanning the vaughan--preston  gap: impact on stellar ages	chromospheric activity is widely used as an age indicator for solar-typestars based on the early evidence that there is a smooth evolution from youngand active to old and inactive stars. we analysed chromospheric activity infive solar-type stars in two open clusters, in order to study how chromosphericactivity evolves with time. we took uves high-resolution, high s/n ratiospectra of 3 stars in ic 4756 and 2 in ngc 5822, which were combined with apreviously studied data-set and reanalysed here. the emission core of the deep,photospheric ca ii k line was used as a probe of the chromospheric activity.all of the 5 stars in the new sample, including those in the 1.2 gyr-old ngc5822, have activity levels comparable to those of hyades and praesepe. a likelyinterpretation of our data is that solar-type-star chromospheric activity, fromthe age of the hyades until that of the sun, does not evolve smoothly. starschange from active to inactive on a short timescale. evolution before and aftersuch a transition is much less significant than cyclical and long-termvariations. we show that data presented in the literature to support acorrelation between age and activity could be also interpreted differently inthe light of our results.

0904.4307	chemical composition of extremely metal-poor stars in the sextans dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	chemical abundances of six extremely metal-poor ([fe/h]&lt;-2.5) stars in thesextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy are determined based on high resolutionspectroscopy (r=40,000) with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph.(1) the fe abundances derived from the high resolution spectra are in goodagreement with the metallicity estimated from the ca triplet lines in lowresolution spectra. the lack of stars with [fe/h]=&lt;-3 in sextans, found byprevious estimates from the ca triplet, is confirmed by our measurements,although we note that high resolution spectroscopy for a larger sample of starswill be necessary to estimate the true fraction of stars with such lowmetallicity. (2) while one object shows an overabundance of mg (similar togalactic halo stars), the mg/fe ratios of the remaining five stars are similarto the solar value. this is the first time that low mg/fe ratios at such lowmetallicities have been found in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. no evidence forover-abundances of ca and ti are found in these five stars, though themeasurements for these elements are less certain. possible mechanisms toproduce low mg/fe ratios, with respect to that of galactic halo stars, arediscussed. (3) ba is under-abundant in four objects, while the remaining twostars exhibit large and moderate excesses of this element. the abundancedistribution of ba in this galaxy is similar to that in the galactic halo,indicating that the enrichment of heavy elements, probably by the r-process,started at metallicities [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, as found in the galactic halo.

0906.3140	on the metallicity gradient of the galactic disk	aims: the iron abundance gradient in the galactic stellar disk providesfundamental constraints on the chemical evolution of this important galaxycomponent. however the spread around the mean slope is, at fixed galactocentricdistance, larger than estimated uncertainties. methods: to provide quantitativeconstraints on these trends we adopted iron abundances for 265 classicalcepheids (more than 50% of the currently known sample) based either onhigh-resolution spectra or on photometric metallicity indices. homogeneousdistances were estimated using near-infrared period-luminosity relations. thesample covers the four disk quadrants and their galactocentric distances rangefrom ~5 to ~17 kpc. results: a linear regression over the entire sampleprovides an iron gradient of -0.051+/-0.004 dex/kpc. the above slope agreesquite well, within the errors, with previous estimates based either on cepheidsor on open clusters covering similar galactocentric distances. however, once wesplit the sample in inner (rg &lt; 8 kpc) and outer disk cepheids we found thatthe slope (-0.130+/-0.015 dex/kpc) in the former region is ~3 times steeperthan the slope in the latter one (-0.042+/-0.004 dex/kpc). we found that in theouter disk the radial distribution of metal-poor (mp, [fe/h]&lt;-0.02 dex) andmetal-rich (mr) cepheids across the four disk quadrants does not show a cleartrend when moving from the innermost to the external disk regions. we alsofound that the relative fractions of mp and mr cepheids in the 1st and in the3rd quadrant differ at 8 sigma (mp) and 15 sigma (mr) level.

1002.2547	abundances and physical parameters for stars in the open clusters ngc  5822 and ic 4756	classical chemical analyses may be affected by systematic errors that wouldcause observed abundance differences between dwarfs and giants. for someelements, however, the abundance difference could be real. we address the issueby observing 2 solar--type dwarfs in ngc 5822 and 3 in ic 4756, and comparingtheir composition with that of 3 giants in either of the aforementionedclusters. we determine iron abundance and stellar parameters of the dwarfstars, and the abundances of calcium, sodium, nickel, titanium, aluminium,chromium, silicon and oxygen for both the giants and dwarfs. we acquired uveshigh-resolution, of high signal--to--noise ratio (s/n) spectra. the width ofthe cross correlation profiles was used to measure rotation velocities. forabundance determinations, the standard equivalent width analysis was performeddifferentially with respect to the sun. for lithium and oxygen, we derivedabundances by comparing synthetic spectra with observed line features. we findan iron abundance for dwarf stars equal to solar to within the margins of errorfor ic 4756, and slightly above for ngc 5822 ([fe/h]= 0.01 and 0.05 dexrespectively). the 3 stars in ng 4756 have lithium abundances between log n(li)2.6 and 2.8 dex, the two stars in ngc 5822 have log n(li) ~ 2.8 and 2.5,respectively. for sodium, silicon, and titanium, we show that abundances ofgiants are significantly higher than those of the dwarfs of the same cluster(about 0.15, 0.15, and 0.35 dex).

1003.3854	new baade-wesselink distances and radii for four metal-rich galactic  cepheids	we provided accurate estimates of distances, radii and iron abundances forfour metal-rich cepheids, namely v340 ara, uz sct, av sgr and vy sgr. the mainaim of this investigation is to constrain their pulsation properties and theirlocation across the galactic inner disk. we adopted new accurate nir (j,h,k)light curves and new radial velocity measurements for the target cepheids todeterminate their distances and radii using the baade-wesselink technique. inparticular, we adopted the most recent calibration of the ir surface brightnessrelation and of the projection factor. moreover, we also provided accuratemeasurements of the iron abundance of the target cepheids. current distanceestimates agree within one sigma with similar distances based either onempirical or on theoretical nir period-luminosity relations. however, theuncertainties of the baade-wesselink distances are on average a factor of 3-4smaller when compared with errors affecting other distance determinations. meanbaade-wesselink radii also agree at one sigma level with cepheid radii basedeither on empirical or on theoretical period-radius relations. iron abundancesare, within one sigma, similar to the iron contents provided by andrievsky andcollaborators, thus confirming the super metal-rich nature of the targetcepheids. we also found that the luminosity amplitudes of classical cepheids,at odds with rr lyrae stars, do not show a clear correlation with themetal-content. this circumstantial evidence appears to be the consequence ofthe hertzsprung progression together with the dependence of the topology of theinstability strip on metallicity, evolutionary effects and binaries.

1003.4510	the metal-poor end of the spite plateau. 1: stellar parameters,  metallicities and lithium abundances	we present vlt-uves li abundances for 28 halo dwarf stars between [fe/h]=-2.5and -3.5, 10 of which have [fe/h]&lt;-3. four different t_eff scales have beenused. direct infrared flux method (irfm) has been used on the basis of 2massinfrared photometry. h_alpha wings have been fitted against synthetic gridscomputed by means of 1d lte atmosphere models, assuming differentself-broadening theories. finally, a grid of h_alpha profiles has been computedby means of 3d hydrodynamical atmosphere models. the li i doublet at 670.8 nmhas been used to measure a(li) by means of 3d hydrodynamical nlte spectralsyntheses. an analytical fit of a(li)(3d, nlte) as a function of equivalentwidth, t_eff, log g, and [fe/h] has been derived and is made available. a(li)does not exhibit a plateau below [fe/h]=-3. a strong positive correlation with[fe/h] appears, not influenced by the choice of the t_eff estimator. from alinear fit, we obtain a strong slope of about 0.30 dex in a(li) per dex in[fe/h], significant to 2-3 sigma, and consistent among all the four t_effestimators. a significant slope is also detected in the a(li)--t_eff plane,driven mainly by the coolest stars in the sample which appear li-poor. removingsuch stars does not alter the behavior in the a(li)-[fe/h] plane. the scatterin a(li) increases by a factor of 2 towards lower metallicities, while theplateau appears very thin above [fe/h]=-2.8. the meltdown of the spite plateaubelow [fe/h]\sim-3 is established, but its cause is unclear. if the primordiala(li) is the one derived from wmap, it appears difficult to envision a singledepletion phenomenon producing a thin, metallicity independent plateau above[fe/h]=-2.8, and a highly scattered, metallicity dependent distribution below.the fact that no star below [fe/h]=-3 lies above the plateau suggests that theyformed at plateau level and underwent subsequent depletion.

1004.2559	on the stellar content of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present u,b,v,i photometry of the carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based onmore than 4,000 ccd images. special attention was given to the photometriccalibration, and the precision for the b,v,i bands is better than 0.01 mag. wecompared in the v,b-v and v,b-i color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) carina withthree globular clusters (gcs, m53, m55, m79). we find that only the moremetal-poor gcs (m55, [fe/h]=-1.85; m53, [fe/h]=-2.02 dex) provide a good matchwith the carina giant branch. we performed a similar comparison in the v,v-icmd with three smc intermediate-age clusters (iacs, kron3, ngc339, lindsay38).we find that the color extent of the sgb of the two more metal-rich iacs(kron3, [fe/h]=-1.08; ngc339, [fe/h]=-1.36 dex) is smaller than the range amongcarina's intermediate-age stars. however, the ridge line of the more metal-pooriac (lindsay38, [fe/h]=-1.59 dex) agrees quite well with the carinaintermediate-age stars. these findings indicate that carina's old stellarpopulation is metal-poor and seems to have a limited spread in metallicity(delta [fe/h]=0.2--0.3 dex). carina intermediate-age stars can hardly be moremetal-rich than lindsay38 and its spread in metallicity appears modest. we alsofind that the synthetic cmd constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5dex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported byobservations. the above results are at odds with recent spectroscopicinvestigations suggesting that carina stars cover a broad range in metallicity(delta [fe/h]~1--2 dex). we present a new method to estimate the metallicity ofcomplex stellar systems using the difference in color between the red clump andthe middle of the rr lyrae instability strip. the observed colors of carina'sevolved stars indicate a metallicity of [fe/h]=-1.70+-0.19 dex, which agreesquite well with spectroscopic measurements.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.6128	on the fine structure of the cepheid metallicity gradient in the  galactic thin disk	we present homogeneous and accurate iron abundances for 42 galactic cepheidsbased on high-spectral resolution (r~38,000) high signal-to-noise ratio(snr&gt;100) optical spectra collected with uves at vlt (128 spectra). the aboveabundances were complemented with high-quality iron abundances provided eitherby our group (86) or available in the literature. we paid attention in derivinga common metallicity scale and ended up with a sample of 450 cepheids. we alsoestimated for the entire sample accurate individual distances by usinghomogeneous near-infrared photometry and the reddening free period-wesenheitrelations. the new metallicity gradient is linear over a broad range ofgalactocentric distances (rg~5-19 kpc) and agrees quite well with similarestimates available in the literature (-0.060+/-0.002 dex/kpc). we also uncoverevidence which suggests that the residuals of the metallicity gradient aretightly correlated with candidate cepheid groups (cgs). the candidate cgs havebeen identified as spatial overdensities of cepheids located across the thindisk. they account for a significant fraction of the residual fluctuations, andin turn for the large intrinsic dispersion of the metallicity gradient. weperformed a detailed comparison with metallicity gradients based on differenttracers: ob stars and open clusters. we found very similar metallicitygradients for ages younger than 3 gyrs, while for older ages we found ashallower slope and an increase in the intrinsic spread. the above findingsrely on homogeneous age, metallicity and distance scales. finally we found, byusing a large sample of galactic and magellanic cepheids for which areavailable accurate iron abundances, that the dependence of the luminosityamplitude on metallicity is vanishing.

1409.0568	gaia-eso survey: the analysis of high-resolution uves spectra of  fgk-type stars	the gaia-eso survey is obtaining high-quality spectroscopic data for about10^5 stars using flames at the vlt. uves high-resolution spectra are beingcollected for about 5000 fgk-type stars. these uves spectra are analyzed inparallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. our aim is to present howthese analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe howa final recommended parameter scale is defined. we also discuss the precision(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to thereference values) of the final parameters. these results are part of thegaia-eso 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release ofadvanced data products. the final parameter scale is tied to the one defined bythe gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmosphericparameters. a set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate thephysical soundness of the results. each methodology is judged against thebenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameterspace. the final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from theindividual methods. the recommended results successfully reproduce thebenchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected teff-log g relation ofthe calibrating clusters. atmospheric parameters and abundances have beendetermined for 1301 fgk-type stars observed with uves. the median of themethod-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 k for teff,0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [fe/h]. systematic biases are estimated tobe between 50-100 k for teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for[fe/h]. abundances for 24 elements were derived: c, n, o, na, mg, al, si, ca,sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr, mo, ba, nd, and eu. the typicalmethod-to-method dispersion of the abundances varies between 0.10 and 0.20 dex.

1409.7703	vlt/flames spectroscopy of red giant branch stars in the fornax dwarf  spheroidal galaxy	fornax is one of the most massive dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the localgroup. the fornax field star population is dominated by intermediate age starsbut star formation was going on over almost its entire history. it has beenproposed that fornax experienced a minor merger event. despite recent progress,only the high metallicity end of fornax field stars ([fe/h]&gt;-1.2 dex) has beensampled in larger number via high resolution spectroscopy. we want to betterunderstand the full chemical evolution of this galaxy by better sampling thewhole metallicity range, including more metal poor stars. we use the vlt-flamesmulti-fibre spectrograph in high-resolution mode to determine the abundances ofseveral alpha, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements in a sample of 47individual red giant branch stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. wecombine these abundances with accurate age estimates derived from the ageprobability distribution from the colour-magnitude diagram of fornax. similarto other dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the old, metal-poor stars of fornax aretypically alpha-rich while the young metal-rich stars are alpha-poor. in theclassical scenario of the time delay between sne ii and sne ia, we confirm thatsne ia started to contribute to the chemical enrichment at [fe/h] between -2.0and -1.8 dex. we find that the onset of sne ia took place between 12-10 gyrsago. the high values of [ba/fe], [la/fe] reflect the influence of sne ia andagb stars in the abundance pattern of the younger stellar population of fornax.our findings of low [alpha/fe] and enhanced [eu/mg] are compatible with aninitial mass function that lacks the most massive stars and with star formationthat kept going on throughout the whole history of fornax. we find that massivestars kept enriching the interstellar medium in alpha-elements, although theywere not the main contributor to the iron enrichment.

1501.01115	cosmic neutron star merger rate and gravitational waves constrained by  the r process nucleosynthesis	the cosmic evolution of the neutron star merger (nsm) rate can be deducedfrom the observed cosmic star formation rate. this allows to estimate the rateexpected in the horizon of the gravitational wave detectors advanced virgo andad ligo and to compare those rates with independent predictions. in thiscontext, the rapid neutron capture process, or r process, can be used as aconstraint assuming nsm is the main astrophysical site for this nucleosyntheticprocess. we compute the early cosmic evolution of a typical r process element,europium. eu yields from nsm are taken from recent nucleosynthesiscalculations. the same approach allows to compute the cosmic rate of corecollapse supernovae (ccsn) and the associated evolution of eu. we find that thebulk of eu observations at high iron abundance can be rather well fitted byeither ccsn or nsm scenarios. however, at lower metallicity, the early eucosmic evolution favors nsm as the main astrophysical site for the r process. acomparison between our calculations and spectroscopic observations at very lowmetallicities allows to constrain the coalescence timescale in the nsm scenarioto about 0.1 to 0.2 gyr. these values are in agreement with the coalescencetimescales of some observed binary pulsars. finally, the cosmic evolution of euis used to put constraints on the nsm rate, the merger rate in the horizon ofthe gravitational wave detectors advanced virgo/ad ligo, as well as theexpected rate of electromagnetic counterparts to mergers (kilonovae) in largenear-infrared surveys.

1502.03223	the gaia-eso survey: tracing interstellar extinction	large spectroscopic surveys have enabled in the recent years the computationof three-dimensional interstellar extinction maps thanks to accurate stellaratmospheric parameters and line-of-sight distances. such maps are complementaryto 3d maps extracted from photometry, allowing a more thorough study of thedust properties. our goal is to use the high-resolution spectroscopic surveygaia-eso in order to obtain with a good distance resolution the interstellarextinction and its dependency as a function of the environment and thegalactocentric position. we use the stellar atmospheric parameters of more than5000 stars, obtained from the gaia-eso survey second internal data release, andcombine them with optical (sdss) and near-infrared (vista) photometry as wellas different sets of theoretical stellar isochrones, in order to calculateline-of-sight extinction and distances. the extinction coefficients are thencompared with the literature to discuss their dependancy on the stellarparameters and position in the galaxy. within the errors of our method, ourwork does not show that there is any dependence of the interstellar extinctioncoefficient on the atmospheric parameters of the stars. we do not find anyevidence of the variation of e(j-h)/e(j-k) with the angle from the galacticcentre nor with galactocentric distance. this suggests that we are dealing witha uniform extinction law in the sdss ugriz bands and the near-ir jhks bands.therefore, extinction maps using mean colour-excesses and assuming a constantextinction coefficient can be used without introducing any systematic errors.

0805.4098	discovery of a peculiar cepheid-like star towards the northern edge of  the small magellanic cloud	for seven years, the eros-2 project obtained a mass of photometric data onvariable stars. we present a peculiar cepheid-like star, in the direction ofthe small magellanic cloud, which demonstrates unusual photometric behaviourover a short time interval. we report on data of the photometry acquired by themarly telescope and spectroscopy from the efosc instrument for this star,called eros2 j005135-714459(sm0060n13842), which resembles the unusual cepheidhr 7308. the light curve of our target is analysed using the analysis ofvariance method to determine a pulsational period of 5.5675 days. a fit oftime-dependent fourier coefficients is performed and a search for proper motionis conducted. the light curve exhibits a previously unobserved and spectacularchange in both mean magnitude and amplitude, which has no clear theoreticalexplanation. our analysis of the spectrum implies a radial velocity of 104 kms$^{-1}$ and a metallicity of -0.4$\pm$0.2 dex. in the direction of rightascension, we measure a proper motion of 17.4$\pm$6.0 mas yr$^{-1}$ using erosastrometry, which is compatible with data from the nomad catalogue. the natureof eros2 j005135-714459(sm0060n13842) remains unclear. for this star, we mayhave detected a non-zero proper motion for this star, which would imply that itis a foreground object. its radial velocity, pulsational characteristics, andphotometric data, however, suggest that it is instead a cepheid-like objectlocated in the smc. in such a case, it would present a challenge toconventional cepheid models.

1510.06314	on the neutron-capture elements across the galactic thin disk using  cepheids	we present new accurate abundances for five neutron-capture (y, la, ce, nd,eu) elements in 73 classical cepheids located across the galactic thin disk.individual abundances are based on high spectral resolution (r ~ 38,000) andhigh signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 50-300) spectra collected with uves at esovlt for the dionysos project. taking account for similar cepheid abundancesprovided either by our group (111 stars) or available in the literature, we endup with a sample of 435 cepheids covering a broad range in iron abundances(-1.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.6). we found, using homogeneous individual distances andabundance scales, well defined gradients for the above elements. however, theslope of the light s-process element (y) is at least a factor of two steeperthan the slopes of heavy s- (la, ce, nd) and r- (eu) process elements. the s tor abundance ratio ([la/eu]) of cepheids shows a well defined anticorrelationwith of both eu and fe. on the other hand, galactic field stars attain analmost constant value and only when they approach solar iron abundance displaya mild enhancement in la. the [y/eu] ratio shows a mild evidence of acorrelation with eu and, in particular, with iron abundance for field galacticstars. we also investigated the s-process index - [hs/ls] - and we found a welldefined anticorrelation, as expected, between [la/y] and iron abundance.moreover, we found a strong correlation between [la/y] and [la/fe] and, inparticular, a clear separation between galactic and sagittarius red giants.finally, the comparison between predictions for low-mass asymptotic giantbranch stars and the observed [la/y] ratio indicate a very good agreement overthe entire metallicity range covered by cepheids. however, the observed spread,at fixed iron content, is larger than predicted by current models.

astro-ph;0104357	measurement of stellar age from uranium decay	the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxy indicate when star formationbegan, and provide a minimum age for the universe. radioactive dating ofmeteoritic material and stars relies on comparing the present abundance ratiosof radioactive and stable nuclear species to the theoretically predicted ratiosof their production. the radioisotope $^{232}$th (half-life 14 gyr) has beenused to date galactic stars, but it decays by only a factor of two over thelifetime of the universe. $^{238}$u (half-life 4.5 gyr) is in principle a moreprecise age indicator, but even its strongest spectral line, from singlyionized uranium at a wavelength of 385.957 nm, has previously not been detectedin stars. here we report a measurement of this line in the very metal-poor starcs31082-001, a star which is strongly overabundant in its heavy elements. thederived uranium abundance, log(u/h) = -13.7+/-0.14+/-0.12 yields an age of12.5+/-3 gyr, though this is still model dependent. the observation of thiscosmochronometer gives the most direct age determination of the galaxy. also,with improved theoretical and laboratory data, it will provide a highly preciselower limit to the age of the universe.

astro-ph;0409536	first stars vi - abundances of c, n, o, li, and mixing in extremely  metal-poor giants. galactic evolution of the light elements	we have investigated the poorly-understood origin of nitrogen in the earlygalaxy by determining n abundances in 35 extremely metal-poor halo giants (22stars have [fe/h]&lt;-3.0) using the c and o abundances determined in paper v.because any dredge-up of cno processed material to the surface may complicatethe interpretation of cno abundances in giants, we have also measured thesurface abundance of lithium. our sample shows a clear dichotomy between twogroups of stars. the first group shows evidence of c to n conversion through cncycling and strong li dilution, a signature of mixing. the second group showsno evidence for c to n conversion, and li is only moderately diluted, and weconclude that their c and n abundances are very close to those of the gas fromwhich they formed in the early galaxy. these "unmixed" stars reflect theabundances in the early galaxy: the [c/fe] ratio is constant (about +0.2 dex)and the [c/mg] ratio is close to solar at low metallicity, favouring a high cproduction by massive zero-metal supernovae. the [n/fe] and [n/mg] ratiosscatter widely. the larger values of these ratios define a flat upper plateau([n/mg]= 0.0, [n/fe]= +0.1), which could reflect higher values within a widerange of yields of zero-metal sne ii. alternatively, by analogy with the dla's,the lower abundances ([n/mg]= -1.1, [n/fe]= -0.7) could reflect generally lowyields from the first sne ii, the other stars being n enhanced by winds ofmassive asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. at present it cannot be decidedwhether primary n is produced primarily in sne ii or in massive agb stars, orin both. the stellar n abundances and [n/o] ratios are compatible with thosefound in damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems.

astro-ph;0411029	two distinct ancient components in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy:  first results from dart	we have found evidence for the presence of two distinct ancient stellarcomponents (both geq 10 gyr old) in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. weused the eso wide field imager (wfi) in conjunction with the vlt/flamesspectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population ofsculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. we find that two components arediscernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in ourimaging, and in the [fe/h] and v_hel distributions for our large sample ofspectroscopic measurements. they can be generally described as a ``metal-poor''component ([fe/h]&lt; -1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([fe/h]&gt; -1.7). themetal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, andthey also appear to be kinematically distinct. these results provide animportant insight into the formation processes of small systems in the earlyuniverse and the conditions found there. even this simplest of galaxies appearsto have had a surprisingly complex early evolution.

astro-ph;0510496	the chemical evolution of barium and europium in the milky way	we compute the evolution of the abundances of barium and europium in themilky way and we compare our results with the observed abundances from therecent uves large program "first stars". we use a chemical evolution modelwhich already reproduces the majority of observational constraints. we confirmthat barium is a neutron capture element mainly produced in the low mass agbstars during the thermal-pulsing phase by the 13c neutron source, in a slowneutron capture process. however, in order to reproduce the [ba/fe] vs. [fe/h]as well as the ba solar abundance, we suggest that ba should be also producedas an r-process element by massive stars in the range 10-30 solar masses. onthe other hand, europium should be only an r-process element produced in thesame range of masses (10-30 solar masses), at variance with previoussuggestions indicating a smaller mass range for the eu producers. as it is wellknown, there is a large spread in the [ba/fe] and [eu/fe] ratios at lowmetallicities, although smaller in the newest data. with our model we estimatefor both elements (ba and eu) the ranges for the r-process yields from massivestars which better reproduce the trend of the data. we find that with the sameyields which are able to explain the observed trends, the large spread in the[ba/fe] and [eu/fe] ratios cannot be explained even in the context of aninhomogeneous models for the chemical evolution of our galaxy. we thereforederive the amount by which the yields should be modified to fully account forthe observed spread. we then discuss several possibilities to explain the sizeof the spread. we finally suggest that the production ratio of [ba/eu] could bealmost constant in the massive stars.

astro-ph;0605056	first stars ix -mixing in extremely metal-poor giants. variation of the  12c/13c, [na/mg] and [al/mg] ratios	extremely metal-poor (emp) stars preserve a fossil record of the compositionof the ism when the galaxy formed. it is crucial, however, to verify whetherinternal mixing has modified their surface. we aim to understand the cnoabundance variations found in some, but not all emp field giants analysedearlier. mixing beyond the first dredge-up of standard models is required, andits origin needs clarification.the 12c/13c ratio is the most robust diagnosticof deep mixing, because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar parameters andshould be uniformly high in near-primordial gas. we have measured 12c and 13cabundances in 35 emp giants from high-quality vlt/uves spectra. correlationswith other abundance data are used to study the depth of mixing.the 12c/13cratio is found to correlate with [c/fe] (and li/h), and clearly anti-correlatewith [n/fe]. evidence for such deep mixing is observed in giants above logl/lsolar = 2.6, brighter than in less metal-poor stars, but matching the bumpin the luminosity function in both cases. three of the mixed stars are alsona-and al-rich, another signature of deep mixing, but signatures of the oncycle are not clearly seen in these stars. extra mixing processes clearly occurin luminous rgb stars. the na-and al-rich giants could be agb stars themselves,but an inhomogeneous early ism or pollution from a binary companion remainpossible alternatives (abridged).

astro-ph;0611420	a new view of the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the milky way from  vlt/flames: where are the very metal poor stars?	as part of the dwarf galaxies abundances and radial-velocities team (dart)program, we have measured the metallicities of a large sample of stars in fournearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsph's): sculptor, sextans, fornax, andcarina. the low mean metal abundances and the presence of very old stellarpopulations in these galaxies have supported the view that they are fossilsfrom the early universe. however, contrary to naive expectations, we find asignificant lack of stars with metallicities below [fe/h] ~ -3 dex in all foursystems. this suggests that the gas that made up the stars in these systems hadbeen uniformly enriched prior to their formation. furthermore, the metal-poortail of the dsph metallicity distribution is significantly different from thatof the galactic halo. these findings show that the progenitors of nearby dsph'sappear to have been fundamentally different from the building blocks of themilky way, even at the earliest epochs.

astro-ph;0701199	nlte determination of the sodium abundance in a homogeneous sample of  extremely metal-poor stars	abundance ratios in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars are a good indication ofthe chemical composition of the gas in the earliest phases of the galaxyevolution. it had been found from an lte analysis that at low metallicity, andin contrast with most of the other elements, the scatter of [na/fe] versus[fe/h] was surprisingly large and that, in giants, [na/fe] decreased withmetallicity.  since it is well known that the formation of sodium lines is very sensitiveto non-lte effects, to firmly establish the behaviour of the sodium abundancein the early galaxy, we have used high quality observations of a sample of empstars obtained with uves at the vlt, and we have taken into account the non-lteline formation of sodium.  the profiles of the two resonant sodium d lines (only these sodium lines aredetectable in the spectra of emp stars) have been computed in a sample of 54emp giants and turn-off stars (33 of them with [fe/h]&lt; -3.0) with a modifiedversion of the code multi, and compared to the observed spectra.  with these new determinations in the range -4 &lt;[fe/h]&lt; -2.5, both [na/fe] and[na/mg] are almost constant with a low scatter. in the turn-off stars and"unmixed" giants (located in the low rgb): [na/fe] = -0.21 +/- 0.13 or [na/mg]= -0.45 +/- 0.16. these values are in good agreement with the recentdeterminations of [na/fe] and [na/mg] in nearby metal-poor stars. moreover weconfirm that all the sodium-rich stars are "mixed" stars (i.e., giants locatedafter the bump, which have undergone an extra mixing). none of the turn-offstars is sodium-rich. as a consequence it is probable that the sodiumenhancement observed in some mixed giants is the result of a deep mixing.

0810.0205	galactic abundance gradients from cepheids : on the iron abundance  gradient around 10-12 kpc	context: classical cepheids can be adopted to trace the chemical evolution ofthe galactic disk since their distances can be estimated with very highaccuracy. aims: homogeneous iron abundance measurements for 33 galacticcepheids located in the outer disk together with accurate distancedeterminations based on near-infrared photometry are adopted to constrain thegalactic iron gradient beyond 10 kpc. methods: iron abundances were determinedusing high resolution cepheid spectra collected with three differentobservational instruments: espadons@cfht, narval@tbl and feros@2.2m eso/mpgtelescope. cepheid distances were estimated using near-infrared (j,h,k-band)period-luminosity relations and data from saao and the 2mass catalog. results:the least squares solution over the entire data set indicates that the irongradient in the galactic disk presents a slope of -0.052+/-0.003 dex/kpc in the5-17 kpc range. however, the change of the iron abundance across the disk seemsto be better described by a linear regime inside the solar circle and aflattening of the gradient toward the outer disk (beyond 10 kpc). in the latterregion the iron gradient presents a shallower slope, i.e. -0.012+/-0.014dex/kpc. in the outer disk (10-12 kpc) we also found that cepheids present anincrease in the spread in iron abundance. current evidence indicates that thespread in metallicity depends on the galactocentric longitude. finally, currentdata do not support the hypothesis of a discontinuity in the iron gradient atgalactocentric distances of 10-12 kpc. conclusions: the occurrence of a spreadin iron abundance as a function of the galactocentric longitude indicates thatlinear radial gradients should be cautiously treated to constrain the chemicalevolution across the disk.
