0901.0556	the first positive detection of molecular gas in a grb host galaxy	we report on strong h2 and co absorption from gas within the host galaxy ofgamma-ray burst (grb) 080607. analysis of our keck/lris afterglow spectrumreveals a very large hi column density (nhi = 10^22.70 cm^-2) and strongmetal-line absorption at z_grb = 3.0363 with a roughly solar metallicity. wedetect a series of a-x bandheads from co and estimate n(co) = 10^16.5 cm^-2 andt_ex^co &gt; 100k. we argue that the high excitation temperature results from uvpumping of the co gas by the grb afterglow. similarly, we observe h2 absorptionvia the lyman-werner bands and estimate n(h2) = 10^21.2 cm^-2 with t_ex^h2 =10--300k. the afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with r_v=4 anda_v=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175a bump. additionally,modeling of the swift/xrt x-ray spectrum confirms a large column density withn(h) = 10^22.58 cm^-2. remarkably, this molecular gas has extinctionproperties, metallicity, and a co/h2 ratio comparable to those of translucentmolecular clouds of the milky way, suggesting that star formation at high zproceeds in similar environments as today. however, the integrateddust-to-metals ratio is sub-galactic, suggesting the dust is primarilyassociated with the molecular phase while the atomic gas has a much lowerdust-to-gas ratio. sightlines like grb 080607 serve as powerful probes ofnucleosynthesis and star-forming regions in the young universe and contributeto the population of "dark" grb afterglows.

0902.3661	an imaging and spectroscopic study of four strong mgii absorbers  revealed by grb060418	we present results from an imaging and spectroscopic study of four strongmgii absorbers of w(2796) &gt;~ 1 ang revealed by the afterglow of grb060418 atz_grb=1.491. these absorbers, at z=0.603,0.656,1.107 and z_grb, exhibit largeion abundances that suggest neutral gas column densities characteristic ofdamped lya systems. the imaging data include optical images obtained using lrison the keck i telescope and using acs on board hst, and near-infrared h-bandimages obtained using panic on the magellan baade telescope and k'-band imagesobtained using nirc2 with lgsao on the keck ii telescope. these images revealsix distinct objects at &lt;~ 3.5'' of the afterglow's position, two of whichexhibit well-resolved mature disk morphology, one shows red colors, and threeare blue compact sources. follow-up spectroscopic observations using lrisconfirm that one of the disk galaxies coincides with the mgii absorber atz=0.656. the observed broad-band spectral energy distributions of the seconddisk galaxy and the red source indicate that they are associated with theabsorbers at z=0.603 and z=1.107, respectively. these results show that strongmgii absorbers identified in grb afterglow spectra are associated with typicalgalaxies of luminosity ~ (0.1-1) l* at impact parameter &lt;~ 10 h^-1 kpc. theclose angular separation would preclude easy detections toward a bright quasar.finally, we associate the remaining three blue compact sources with the grbhost galaxy, noting that they are likely star-forming knots located atprojected distances 2-12 h^-1 kpc from the afterglow. at the afterglow'sposition, we derive a 2-sigma upper limit to the underlying sfr intensity of0.0074 m_sun yr^-1 kpc^-2.

0905.0001	the host galaxies of swift dark gamma-ray bursts: observational  constraints on highly obscured and very high-redshift grbs	in this work we present the first results of our imaging campaign at keckobservatory to identify the host galaxies of "dark" gamma-ray bursts (grbs),events with no detected optical afterglow or with detected optical fluxsignificantly fainter than expected from the observed x-ray afterglow. we findthat out of a uniform sample of 29 swift bursts rapidly observed by the palomar60-inch telescope through march 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), allevents have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxydetection, or both. our results constrain the fraction of swift grbs comingfrom very high redshift (z &gt; 7), such as the recent grb 090423, to between0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. in contrast, a significant fraction of thesample requires large extinction columns (host-frame a_v &gt; 1 mag, with severalevents showing a_v &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominantcause of the dark grb phenomenon. we infer that a significant fraction of grbs(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscuredregions. however, the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal opticalcolors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinityof the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.

0905.0690	the collimation and energetics of the brightest swift gamma-ray bursts	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are widely believed to behighly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). as a result ofthis beaming factor, the true energy release from a grb is usually severalorders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. measuring thisopening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in theafterglow light curve (a "jet" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in theswift era. here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of theisotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, e(gamma, iso)) grbs in the swift erato search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energyrelease. we present multi-wavelength (radio through x-ray) observations of grbs050820a, 060418, and 080319b, and construct afterglow models to extract theopening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.together with results from previous analyses of grbs 050904 and 070125, we findevidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supportingthe canonical picture of grbs as collimated explosions. the most naturalexplanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most swift grbs istherefore selection effects. however, the opening angles for the events in oursample are larger than would be expected if all grbs had a canonical energyrelease of ~ 10e51 erg. the total energy release we measure for those"hyper-energetic" (e(total) &gt;~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enoughto start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0906.2201	new observations of the very luminous supernova 2006gy: evidence for  echoes	supernova (sn) 2006gy was a hydrogen-rich core-collapse sn that remains oneof the most luminous optical supernovae ever observed. the total energy budget(&gt; 2 x 10^51 erg radiated in the optical alone) poses many challenges forstandard sn theory. we present new ground-based near-infrared (nir)observations of sn 2006gy, as well as a single epoch of hubble space telescope(hst) imaging obtained more than two years after the explosion. our nir datataken around peak optical emission show an evolution that is largely consistentwith a cooling blackbody, with tentative evidence for a growing nir excessstarting at day ~100. our late-time keck adaptive optics (ao) nir image, takenon day 723, shows little change from previous nir observations taken around day400. furthermore, the optical hst observations show a reduced decline rateafter day 400, and the sn is bluer on day 810 than it was at peak. thislate-time decline is inconsistent with co56 decay, and thus is problematic forthe various pair-instability sn models used to explain the nature of sn 2006gy.the slow decline of the nir emission can be explained with a light echo, and weconfirm that the late-time nir excess is the result of a massive (&gt;10 msun)dusty shell heated by the sn peak luminosity. the late-time opticalobservations require the existence of a scattered light echo, which may begenerated by the same dust that contributes to the nir echo. both the nir andoptical echoes originate in the proximity of the progenitor, ~10^18 cm for thenir echo and &lt;~10-40 pc for the optical echo, which provides further evidencethat the progenitor of sn 2006gy was a very massive star.

0907.1285	the discovery of vibrationally-excited h_2 in the molecular cloud near  grb 080607	grb 080607 has provided the first strong observational signatures ofmolecular absorption bands toward any galaxy hosting a gamma-ray burst. despitethe identification of dozens of features as belonging to various atomic andmolecular (h_2 and co) carriers, many more absorption features remainedunidentified. here we report on a search among these features for absorptionfrom vibrationally-excited h_2, a species that was predicted to be produced bythe uv flash of a grb impinging on a molecular cloud. following a detailedcomparison between our spectroscopy and static, as well as dynamic, models ofh_2* absorption, we conclude that a column density of 10^{17.5+-0.2} cm^{-2} ofh_2* was produced along the line of sight toward grb 080607. depending on theassumed amount of dust extinction between the molecular cloud and the grb, themodel distance between the two is found to be in the range 230--940 pc. such arange is consistent with a conservative lower limit of 100 pc estimated fromthe presence of mg i in the same data. these distances show that substantialmolecular material is found within hundreds of pc from grb 080607, part of thedistribution of clouds within the grb host galaxy.

0910.3166	grb081028 and its late-time afterglow re-brightening	swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising x-ray re-brightening ofclear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long gamma-ray burst (grb):grb081028. a rising phase is likely present in all grbs but is usually hiddenby the prompt tail emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what islater to give rise to the shallow decay phase. contemporaneous opticalobservations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection frequency of a fastcooling synchrotron spectrum through the optical band, which disfavours theafterglow onset (start of the forward shock emission along our line of sightwhen the outflow is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening.we investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations areconsistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-axis. the highon-axis energy budget implied by this interpretation suggests differentphysical origins of the prompt and (late) afterglow emission. strong spectralsoftening takes place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track theevolution of the spectral peak energy from the gamma-rays to the x-rays andhighlight the problems of the high latitude and adiabatic coolinginterpretations. notably, a softening of both the high and low spectral slopeswith time is also observed. we discuss the low on-axis radiative efficiency ofgrb081028 comparing its properties against a sample of swift long grbs withsecure e_gamma,iso measurements.

0911.3150	unveiling the origin of grb 090709a: lack of periodicity in a reddened  cosmological long-duration gamma-ray burst	we present broadband (gamma-ray, x-ray, near-infrared, optical, and radio)observations of the gamma-ray burst (grb) 090709a and its afterglow in aneffort to ascertain the origin of this high-energy transient. previous analysessuggested that grb 090709a exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a periodof 8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration grbs but typical of flares fromsoft gamma-ray repeaters. when properly accounting for the underlying shape ofthe power-density spectrum of grb 090709a, we find no conclusive (&gt; 3 sigma)evidence for the reported periodicity. in conjunction with the location of thetransient (far from the galactic plane and absent any nearby host galaxy in thelocal universe) and the evidence for extinction in excess of the galacticvalue, we consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. a long-duration grb,however, can account for the majority of the observed properties of thissource. grb 090709a is distinguished from other long-duration grbs primarily bythe large amount of obscuration from its host galaxy (a_k,obs &gt;~ 2 mag).

0911.4719	sn 2008iy: an unusual type iin supernova with an enduring 400 day rise  time	we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the type iinsupernova (sn) 2008iy. sn 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of~400 days, making it the first sn to take significantly longer than 100 days toreach peak optical luminosity. the peak absolute magnitude of sn 2008iy was m_r~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x10^50 erg. spectroscopically, sn 2008iy is very similar to the type iin sn1988z at late times, and, like sn 1988z, it is a luminous x-ray source (bothsupernovae had an x-ray luminosity l_ x &gt; 10^41 erg/s). the halpha emissionprofile of sn 2008iy shows a narrow p cygni absorption component, implying apre-sn wind speed of ~100 km/s. we argue that the luminosity of sn 2008iy ispowered via the interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellarmedium. the ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density ofclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from theprogenitor. this scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodicphase of enhanced mass-loss &lt; 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitorwind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. we favour theformer scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodesobserved for luminous blue variable (lbv) stars. the progenitor wind speed andincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, andperhaps all, type iin supernovae experience lbv-like eruptions shortly beforecore collapse. we also discuss the host galaxy of sn 2008iy, a subluminousdwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons why the recent suggestion that unusual,luminous supernovae preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result ofobservational biases.

1004.2900	afterglow observations of fermi-lat gamma-ray bursts and the emerging  class of hyper-energetic events	we present broadband (radio, optical, and x-ray) light curves and spectra ofthe afterglows of four long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs 090323, 090328,090902b, and 090926a) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) and largearea telescope (lat) instruments on the fermi satellite. with its wide spectralbandpass, extending to gev energies, fermi is sensitive to grbs with very largeisotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). although rare, these events areparticularly important for testing grb central-engine models. when combinedwith spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are ableto constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburstmedium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of theoutflows. in agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativisticenergy budget of at least one of these events (grb 090926a) exceeds thecanonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. such energies pose asevere challenge for models in which the grb is powered by a magnetar orneutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectationsfor magneto-hydrodynamical (mhd) collapsar models. our jet opening angles(theta) are similar to those found for pre-fermi grbs, but the large initiallorentz factors (gamma_0) inferred from the detection of gev photons implytheta gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in mhd models ofjet acceleration. finally, we find that these fermi-lat events preferentiallyoccur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that thismight result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicityprogenitor stars. future studies of fermi-lat afterglows in the radio with theorder-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the evla shoulddefinitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.

1007.0661	progenitor diagnostics for stripped core-collapse supernovae: measured  metallicities at explosion sites	metallicity is expected to influence not only the lives of massive stars butalso the outcome of their deaths as supernovae (sne) and as gamma-ray bursts(grbs). however, there are surprisingly few direct measurements of the localmetallicities of different flavors of core-collapse sne. here we present thelargest existing set of host-galaxy spectra with h ii region emission lines atthe sites of 35 stripped-envelope core-collapse sne. we derive local oxygenabundances in a robust manner in order to constrain the sn ib/c progenitorpopulation. we obtain spectra at the sn sites, include sne from targeted anduntargeted surveys, and perform the abundance determinatinos using threedifferent oxygen-abundance calibrations. the sites of sne ic (the demise of themost heavily stripped stars having lost both the h and he layers) aresystematically more metal rich than those of sne ib (arising from stars thatretained their he layer) in all calibrations. a kolmogorov-smirnov test yieldsthe very low probability of 1% that sn ib and sn ic environment abundances,which are different on average by ~0.2 dex (in the pettini &amp; pagel scale), aredrawn from the same parent population. broad-lined sne ic (without grbs) occurat metallicities between those of sne ib and sne ic. lastly, we find that thehost-galaxy central oxygen abundance is not a good indicator of the local snmetallicity; hence, large-scale sn surveys need to obtain local abundancemeasurements in order to quantify the impact of metallicity on stellar death.

1009.0004	monster in the dark: the ultraluminous grb 080607 and its dusty  environment	we present early-time optical through infrared photometry of the brightgamma-ray burst grb 080607, starting only 6 s following the initial trigger inthe rest frame. complemented by our previously published spectroscopy, thishigh-quality photometric dataset allows us to solve for the extinctionproperties of the redshift 3.036 sightline, giving perhaps the most detailedinformation on the ultraviolet continuum absorption properties of any sightlineoutside our local group to date. the extinction properties are not adequatelymodeled by any ordinary extinction template (including the average milky way,large magellanic cloud, and small magellanic cloud curves), partially becausethe 2175-angstrom feature (while present) is weaker by about a factor of twothan when seen under similar circumstances locally. however, the spectralenergy distribution is exquisitely fitted by the more general fitzpatrick &amp;massa (1990) parameterization of local-group extinction, putting it in the samefamily as some peculiar milky way extinction curves. after correcting for this(considerable, a_v = 3.3 +/- 0.4 mag) extinction, grb 080607 is revealed tohave been among the most optically luminous events ever observed, comparable tothe naked-eye burst grb 080319b. its early peak time (t_rest &lt; 6 s) indicates ahigh initial lorentz factor (gamma &gt; 600), while the extreme luminosity may beexplained in part by a large circumburst density. only because of its earlyhigh luminosity could the afterglow of grb 080607 be studied in such detail inspite of the large attenuation and great distance, making this burst anexcellent prototype for the understanding of other highly obscuredextragalactic objects, and of the class of "dark" grbs in particular.

1103.1797	the subluminous and peculiar type ia supernova ptf09dav	ptf09dav is a peculiar subluminous type ia supernova (sn) discovered by thepalomar transient factory (ptf). spectroscopically, it appears superficiallysimilar to the class of subluminous sn1991bg-like sne, but it has severalunusual features which make it stand out from this population. its peakluminosity is fainter than any previously discovered sn1991bg-like sn ia (m_b-15.5), but without the unusually red optical colors expected if the faintluminosity were due to extinction. the photospheric optical spectra have veryunusual strong lines of sc ii and mg i, with possible sr ii, together withstronger than average ti ii and low velocities of ~6000 km/s. the host galaxyof ptf09dav is ambiguous. the sn lies either on the extreme outskirts (~41kpc)of a spiral galaxy, or in an very faint (m_r&gt;-12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike other1991bg-like sne which are invariably associated with massive, old stellarpopulations. ptf09dav is also an outlier on the light-curve-width--luminosityand color--luminosity relations derived for other sub-luminous sne ia. theinferred 56ni mass is small (0.019+/-0.003msun), as is the estimated ejectamass of 0.36msun. taken together, these properties make ptf09dav a remarkableevent. we discuss various physical models that could explain ptf09dav. heliumshell detonation or deflagration on the surface of a co white-dwarf can explainsome of the features of ptf09dav, including the presence of sc and the lowphotospheric velocities, but the observed si and mg are not predicted to bevery abundant in these models. we conclude that no single model is currentlycapable of explaining all of the observed signatures of ptf09dav.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1106.5491	automating discovery and classification of transients and variable stars  in the synoptic survey era	the rate of image acquisition in modern synoptic imaging surveys has alreadybegun to outpace the feasibility of keeping astronomers in the real-timediscovery and classification loop. here we present the inner workings of aframework, based on machine-learning algorithms, that captures expert trainingand ground-truth knowledge about the variable and transient sky to automate 1)the process of discovery on image differences and, 2) the generation ofpreliminary science-type classifications of discovered sources. since follow-upresources for extracting novel science from fast-changing transients areprecious, self-calibrating classification probabilities must be couched interms of efficiencies for discovery and purity of the samples generated. weestimate the purity and efficiency in identifying real sources with a two-epochimage-difference discovery algorithm for the palomar transient factory (ptf)survey. once given a source discovery, using machine-learned classificationtrained on ptf data, we distinguish between transients and variable stars witha 3.8% overall error rate (with 1.7% errors for imaging within the sloandigital sky survey footprint). at &gt;96% classification efficiency, the samplesachieve 90% purity. initial classifications are shown to rely primarily oncontext-based features, determined from the data itself and external archivaldatabases. in the ~one year since autonomous operations, this discovery andclassification framework has led to several significant science results, fromoutbursting young stars to subluminous type iip supernovae to candidate tidaldisruption events. we discuss future directions of this approach, including thepossible roles of crowdsourcing and the scalability of machine learning tofuture surveys such a the large synoptical survey telescope (lsst).

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

1109.3167	the dark grb080207 in an extremely red host and the implications for  grbs in highly obscured environments	[abridged] we present comprehensive x-ray, optical, near- and mid-infrared,and sub-mm observations of grb 080207 and its host galaxy. the afterglow wasundetected in the optical and near-ir, implying an optical to x-ray index &lt;0.3,identifying grb 080207 as a dark burst. swift x-ray observations show extremeabsorption in the host, which is confirmed by the unusually large opticalextinction found by modelling the x-ray to nir afterglow spectral energydistribution. our chandra observations obtained 8 days post-burst allow us toplace the afterglow on the sky to sub-arcsec accuracy, enabling us to pinpointan extremely red galaxy (ero). follow-up host observations with hst, spitzer,gemini, keck and the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) provide a photometricredshift solution of z ~1.74 (+0.05,-0.06) (1 sigma), 1.56 &lt; z &lt; 2.08 at 2sigma) for the ero host, and suggest that it is a massive and morphologicallydisturbed ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ulirg) system, with l_fir ~ 2.4 x10^12 l_solar. these results add to the growing evidence that grbs originatingin very red hosts always show some evidence of dust extinction in theirafterglows (though the converse is not true -- some extinguished afterglows arefound in blue hosts). this indicates that a poorly constrained fraction of grbsoccur in very dusty environments. by comparing the inferred stellar masses, andestimates of the gas phase metallicity in both grb hosts and sub-mm galaxies wesuggest that many grb hosts, even at z&gt;2 are at lower metallicity than thesub-mm galaxy population, offering a likely explanation for the dearth ofsub-mm detected grb hosts. however, we also show that the dark grb hosts aresystematically more massive than those hosting optically bright events, perhapsimplying that previous host samples are severely biased by the exclusion ofdark events.

1112.3963	the luminous infrared host galaxy of short-duration grb 100206a	the known host galaxies of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (grbs) to date arecharacterized by low to moderate star-formation rates and a broad range ofstellar masses. in this paper, we positionally associate the recentunambiguously short-hard swift grb 100206a with a disk galaxy at redshiftz=0.4068 that is rapidly forming stars at a rate of ~30 m_sun/yr, almost anorder of magnitude higher than any previously identified short grb host. usingphotometry from gemini, keck, pairitel, and wise, we show that the galaxy isvery red (g-k = 4.3 ab mag), heavily obscured (a_v ~ 2 mag), and has thehighest metallicity of any grb host to date (12 + log[o/h]_kd02 = 9.2): it is aclassical luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), with l_ir ~ 4 x 10^11 l_sun. whilethese properties could be interpreted to support an association of this grbwith very recent star formation, modeling of the broadband spectral energydistribution also indicates that a substantial stellar mass of mostly olderstars is present. the current specific star-formation rate is modest (specificsfr ~ 0.5 gyr^-1), the current star-formation rate is not substantiallyelevated above its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign ofrecent merger activity. our observations are therefore equally consistent withan older progenitor, similar to what is inferred for other short-hard grbs.given the precedent established by previous short grb hosts and the significantfraction of the universe's stellar mass in lirg-like systems at z &gt;~0.3, anolder progenitor represents the most likely origin of this event.

1206.0748	x-ray emission from supernovae in dense circumstellar matter  environments: a search for collisionless shocks	(abridged). the optical light curve of some sne may be powered by the outwarddiffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thickcircumstellar matter (csm). recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediatedand -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into acollisionless shock and can produce hard x-rays. the x-rays are expected topeak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. here we report on asearch, using swift and chandra, for x-ray emission from 28 sne that belong toclasses whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense csm(iin/ibn/slsn-i). two sne in our sample have x-ray properties that are roughlyconsistent with the expectation for x-rays from a collisionless shock inoptically thick csm. therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves arepowered by shock breakout in csm. we show that two other events were too x-raybright during the sn maximum optical light to be explained by the shockbreakout model. we conclude that the light curves of some, but not all,type-iin/ibn sne are powered by shock breakout in csm. for the rest of the snein our sample, including all the slsn-i events, our x-ray limits are not deepenough and were typically obtained at too early times to conclude about theirnature. we argue that the optical light curves of sne, for which the x-rayemission peaks at late times, are likely powered by the diffusion of shockenergy from a dense csm. we comment about the possibility to detect some ofthese events in radio.

1211.6528	an independent measurement of the incidence of mgii absorbers along  gamma-ray burst sightlines: the end of the mystery?	in 2006, prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement ofvery strong mg ii absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-raybursts (grbs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasarsightlines. this counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set ofastrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of thesehas obviously resolved the puzzle. using the largest set of grb afterglowspectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. in an independentsample of grb spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than prochter et al.,we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\aa rest-frame equivalentwidth mg ii absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. this isfully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbersalong quasar sightlines. therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancementand suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. signatures of theoriginal result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$enhancement over l(z)qso), but the statistical significance now lies at$\approx 90%$ c.l. restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolutionspectra of grb afterglows (which overlaps substantially with prochter et al.),we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of mg ii absorption.the reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is noconnection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (orechellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong mg ii doublets. onlya larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on thismatter.

1301.5903	a population of massive, luminous galaxies hosting heavily dust-obscured  gamma-ray bursts: implications for the use of grbs as tracers of cosmic star  formation	we present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavilydust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swift satellite duringthe years 2005-2009, representing all grbs with an unambiguous host-frameextinction of a_v&gt;1 mag from this period. deep observations with keck, gemini,vlt, hst, and spitzer successfully detect the host galaxies and establishspectroscopic or photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us toprovide measurements of the intrinsic host star-formation rates, stellarmasses, and mean extinctions. compared to the hosts of unobscured grbs atsimilar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured grbs are (onaverage) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidlystar-forming and dust-obscured. while this demonstrates that grbs populate alltypes of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems atz~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall grb population continues to show ahighly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference forlow-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely sfr-selectedgalaxy sample. this supports the notion that the grb rate is strongly dependenton metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in the universeunderwent a transition in their chemical properties ~9 gyr ago. we alsoconclude that, based on the absence of unobscured grbs in massive galaxies andthe absence of obscured grbs in low-mass galaxies, the dust distributions ofthe lowest-mass and the highest-mass galaxies are relatively homogeneous, whileintermediate-mass galaxies (~10^9 m_sun) have diverse internal properties.

1307.2366	a multi-wavelength investigation of the radio-loud supernova ptf11qcj  and its circumstellar environment	we present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic (fromradio to x-ray) follow-up observations of ptf11qcj, a supernova discovered bythe palomar transient factory. ptf11qcj is located at a distance of dl ~ 124mpc. our observations with the karl g. jansky very large array show that thisevent is radio-loud: ptf11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable tothat of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated supernova 1998bw (l_{5ghz} ~10^{29} erg/s/hz). ptf11qcj is also detected in x-rays with the chandraobservatory, and in the infrared band with spitzer. our multi-wavelengthanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material. theradio observations suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of ~10^{-4} msun/yr x(v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest moving ejecta(at ~10d after explosion). however, these estimates are derived assuming thesimplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellarmaterial characterized by radial power-law density profile, and do not accountfor possible inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.the radio light curve shows deviations from such a simple model, as well as are-brightening at late times. the x-ray flux from ptf11qcj is compatible withthe high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission (within thelarge uncertainties). an ir light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreementwith our infrared data. our analysis of pre-explosion data from the palomartransient factory suggests that a precursor eruption of absolute magnitude m_r~ -13 mag may have occurred ~ 2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion. based onour panchromatic follow-up campaign, we conclude that ptf11qcj fits theexpectations from the explosion of a wolf-rayet star. precursor eruptions maybe a feature characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.

1312.3967	identifying high-redshift grbs with ratir	we present a template fitting algorithm for determining photometricredshifts, $z_{\rm phot}$, of candidate high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grbs).using afterglow photometry, obtained by the reionization and transientsinfrared (ratir) camera, this algorithm accounts for the intrinsic grbafterglow spectral energy distribution (sed), host dust extinction and theeffect of neutral hydrogen (local and cosmological) along the line of sight. wepresent the results obtained by this algorithm and ratir photometry of grb130606a, finding a range of best fit solutions $5.6 &lt; z_{\rm phot} &lt; 6.0$ formodels of several host dust extinction laws (none, mw, lmc and smc), consistentwith spectroscopic measurements of the redshift of this grb. using simulatedratir photometry, we find our algorithm provides precise measures of $z_{\rmphot}$ in the ranges $4 &lt; z_{\rm phot} \lesssim 8$ and $9 &lt; z_{\rm phot} &lt; 10$and can robustly determine when $z_{\rm phot}&gt;4$. further testing highlightsthe required caution in cases of highly dust extincted host galaxies. thesetests also show that our algorithm does not erroneously find $z_{\rm phot} &lt; 4$when $z_{\rm sim}&gt;4$, thereby minimizing false negatives and allowing us torapidly identify all potential high-redshift events.

1401.5468	precursors prior to type iin supernova explosions are common: precursor  rates, properties, and correlations	there is a growing number of supernovae (sne), mainly of type iin, whichpresent an outburst prior to their presumably final explosion. these precursorsmay affect the sn display, and are likely related to some poorly chartedphenomena in the final stages of stellar evolution. here we present a sample of16 sne iin for which we have palomar transient factory (ptf) observationsobtained prior to the sn explosion. by coadding these images taken prior to theexplosion in time bins, we search for precursor events. we find five type iinsne that likely have at least one possible precursor event, three of which arereported here for the first time. for each sn we calculate the control time.based on this analysis we find that precursor events among sne iin are common:at the one-sided 99% confidence level, more than 50% of sne iin have at leastone pre-explosion outburst that is brighter than absolute magnitude -14, takingplace up to 1/3 yr prior to the sn explosion. the average rate of suchprecursor events during the year prior to the sn explosion is likely largerthan one per year, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common. wealso find possible correlations between the integrated luminosity of theprecursor, and the sn total radiated energy, peak luminosity, and rise time.these correlations are expected if the precursors are mass-ejection events, andthe early-time light curve of these sne is powered by interaction of the snshock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1404.0881	the host of the sn-less grb 060505 in high resolution	the spiral host galaxy of grb 060505 at z=0.089 was the site of a puzzlinglong duration burst without an accompanying supernova. studies of the burstenvironment by th\"one et al. (2008) suggested that this grb came from thecollapse of a massive star and that the grb site was a region with propertiesdifferent from the rest of the galaxy. we reobserved the galaxy in high spatialresolution using the vimos integral-field unit (ifu) at the vlt with a spaxelsize of 0.67 arcsec. furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data fromhires/keck at two different slit positions covering the grb site, the center ofthe galaxy and an hii region next to the grb region. we compare the propertiesof different hii regions in the galaxy with the grb site and study the globaland local kinematic properties of this galaxy. the resolved data show that thegrb site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 z_solar, butits specific sfr (ssfr) of 7.4 m_solar/yr/l/l* and age (determined by thehalpha ew) are similar to other hii regions in the host. the galaxy shows agradient in metallicity and ssfr from the bulge to the outskirts as it iscommon for spiral galaxies. this gives further support to the theory that grbsprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in s-typegalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.kinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for largeperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. this studyconfirms the collapsar origin of grb060505 but reveals that the properties ofthe hii region surrounding the grb were not unique to that galaxy. spatiallyresolved observations are key to know the implications and interpretations ofunresolved grb hosts observations at higher redshifts.

0803.3215	observations of the naked-eye grb 080319b: implications of nature's  brightest explosion	the first gamma-ray burst (grb) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen withthe naked eye, grb 080319b at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisitefollow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. we present ourdetailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over5000 images starting 51 s after the grb trigger, in concert with our ownanalysis of the swift data. the event is extreme not only in observedproperties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded atoptical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly highisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. at early times, theafterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. the overall spectralenergy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infraredwavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction inthe host frame. the afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: startingat about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red atlate times. in our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidencefor an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. finally, we examine thedetectability of such events with current and future facilities and find thatsuch an event could be detected in gamma-rays by bat out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),while the nominal exist sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. at k band,this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~17.

1411.1073	a machine learning method to infer fundamental stellar parameters from  photometric light curves	a fundamental challenge for wide-field imaging surveys is obtaining follow-upspectroscopic observations: there are &gt; $10^9$ photometrically catalogedsources, yet modern spectroscopic surveys are limited to ~few x $10^6$ targets.as we approach the large synoptic survey telescope (lsst) era, new algorithmicsolutions are required to cope with the data deluge. here we report thedevelopment of a machine-learning framework capable of inferring fundamentalstellar parameters (teff, log g, and [fe/h]) using photometric-brightnessvariations and color alone. a training set is constructed from a systematicspectroscopic survey of variables with hectospec/mmt. in sum, the training setincludes ~9000 spectra, for which stellar parameters are measured using thesegue stellar parameters pipeline (sspp). we employed the random forestalgorithm to perform a non-parametric regression that predicts teff, log g, and[fe/h] from photometric time-domain observations. our final, optimized modelproduces a cross-validated root-mean-square error (rmse) of 165 k, 0.39 dex,and 0.33 dex for teff, log g, and [fe/h], respectively. examining the subset ofsources for which the sspp measurements are most reliable, the rmse reduces to125 k, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to what is achievablevia low-resolution spectroscopy. for variable stars this represents a ~12-20%improvement in rmse relative to models trained with single-epoch photometriccolors. as an application of our method, we estimate stellar parameters for~54,000 known variables. we argue that this method may convert photometrictime-domain surveys into pseudo-spectrographic engines, enabling theconstruction of extremely detailed maps of the milky way, its structure, andhistory.

1412.6530	a detailed study of the optical attenuation of gamma-ray bursts in the  swift era	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry of 28 gamma-ray bursts(grbs) detected by the \textit{swift} satellite and rapidly observed by thereionization and transients infrared/optical (ratir) camera. we compare theoptical flux at fiducial times of 5.5 and 11 hours after the high-energytrigger to that in the x-ray regime to quantify optical darkness. 46$\pm$9 percent (13/28) of all bursts in our sample and 55$\pm$10 per cent (13/26) of longgrbs are optically dark, which is statistically consistently with previousstudies. fitting ratir optical and nir spectral energy distributions (seds) of19 grbs, most (6/7) optically dark grbs either occur at high-redshift ($z&gt;4.5$)or have a high dust content in their host galaxies ($a_{\rm v} &gt; 0.3$).performing k-s tests, we compare the ratir sample to those previously presentedin the literature, finding our distributions of redshift, optical darkness,host dust extinction and x-ray derived column density to be consistent. the onereported discrepancy is with host galaxy dust content in the bat6 sample, whichappears inconsistent with our sample and other previous literature. comparingx-ray derived host galaxy hydrogen column densities to host galaxy dustextinction, we find that grbs tend to occur in host galaxies with a highermetal-to-dust ratio than our own galaxy, more akin to the large and smallmagellanic clouds. finally, to mitigate time evolution of optical darkness, wemeasure $\beta_{\rm ox,rest}$ at a fixed rest frame time, $t_{\rm rest}=1.5$hours and fixed rest frame energies in the x-ray and optical regimes. choosingto evaluate optical flux at $\lambda_{\rm rest}=0.25~\mu$m, we removehigh-redshift as a source of optical darkness, demonstrating that opticaldarkness must result from either high-redshift, dust content in the host galaxyalong the grb sight line, or a combination of the two.

1509.09234	the central engine of grb 130831a and the energy breakdown of a  relativistic explosion	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most luminous explosions in the universe, yetthe nature and physical properties of their energy sources are far fromunderstood. very important clues, however, can be inferred by studying theafterglows of these events. we present optical and x-ray observations of grb130831a obtained by swift, chandra, skynet, ratir, maidanak, ison, not, lt andgtc. this burst shows a steep drop in the x-ray light-curve at $\simeq 10^5$ safter the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\alpha \sim 6$. such a rarebehaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (fs) model andindicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of"internal origin", produced by a dissipation process within anultrarelativistic outflow. we propose that the source of such an outflow, whichmust produce the x-ray flux for $\simeq 1$ day in the cosmological rest frame,is a newly born magnetar or black hole. after the drop, the faint x-rayafterglow continues with a much shallower decay. the optical emission, on theother hand, shows no break across the x-ray steep decrease, and the late-timedecays of both the x-ray and optical are consistent. using both the x-ray andoptical data, we show that the emission after $\simeq 10^5$ s can be explainedwell by the fs model. we model our data to derive the kinetic energy of theejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a grb withemission of internal origin visible for a long time. furthermore, we break downthe energy budget of this grb into the prompt emission, the late internaldissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it withthe energy of the associated supernova, sn 2013fu.

0806.1182	photometry and spectroscopy of grb 060526: a detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst	aims: with this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (grb) 060526 at $z=3.221$.methods: we present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for agrb afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. the data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. the afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.the absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of grb 060526. results: thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. it shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. the broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. the metallicity derived from\ion{s}{ii} and \ion{fe}{ii} of [s/h] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [fe/h] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other grb hosts at similar redshifts. at the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to f775w(ab) = 28.5 mag with the hst,implying an absolute magnitude of the host m(1500 \aa{})$&gt;$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the grb may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

astro-ph;0005465	a jet model for the afterglow emission from grb000301c	we present broad-band radio observations of the afterglow of grb000301c,spanning from 1.4 to 350 ghz for the period of 3 to 83 days after the burst.this radio data, in addition to measurements at the optical bands, suggest thatthe afterglow arises from a collimated outflow, i.e. a jet. to test thishypothesis in a self-consistent manner, we employ a global fit and find that amodel of a jet, expanding into a constant density medium (ism+jet), providesthe best fit to the data. a model of the burst occurring in a wind-shapedcircumburst medium (wind-only model) can be ruled out, and a wind+jet modelprovides a much poorer fit of the optical/ir data than the ism+jet model. inaddition, we present the first clear indication that the reported fluctuationsin the optical/ir are achromatic with similar amplitudes in all bands, andpossibly extend into the radio regime. using the parameters derived from theglobal fit, in particular a jet break time, t_{jet}=7.5 days, we infer a jetopening angle of \theta=0.2, and consequently the estimate of the emittedenergy in the grb itself is reduced by a factor of 50 relative to the isotropicvalue, giving e=1.1 \times 10^{51} ergs.

astro-ph;0006201	the bright gamma-ray burst 991208 - tight constraints on afterglow  models from observations of the early-time radio evolution	the millimeter wavelength emission from grb 991208 is the second brightestever detected, yielding a unique data set. we present here well-sampled spectraand light curves over more than two decades in frequency for a two-week period.this data set has allowed us for the first time to trace the evolution of thecharacteristic synchrotron self-absorption frequency nu_a and peak frequencynu_m, and the peak flux density f_m: we obtain nu_a \propto t^{-0.15 +- 0.12},nu_m \propto t^{-1.7 +- 0.4}, and $_m \propto t^{-0.47 +- 0.11}. from the radiodata we find that models of homogeneous or wind-generated ambient media with aspherically symmetric outflow can be ruled out. a model in which therelativistic outflow is collimated (a jet) can account for the observedevolution of the synchrotron parameters, the rapid decay at opticalwavelengths, and the observed radio to optical spectral flux distributions thatwe present here, provided that the jet transition has not been fully completedin the first two weeks after the event. these observations provide additionalevidence that rapidly decaying optical/x-ray afterglows are due to jets andthat such transitions either develop very slowly or perhaps never reach thepredicted asymptotic decay f(t) \propto t^{-p}.

astro-ph;0006206	grb 991216 joins the jet set: discovery and monitoring of its optical  afterglow	the optical light curve of the energetic gamma-ray burst grb 991216 isconsistent with jet-like behavior in which a power-law decay steepens fromt**(-1.22 +/- 0.04) at early times to t**(-1.53 +/- 0.05) in a gradualtransition at around 2 d. the derivation of the late-time decay slope takesinto account the constant contribution of a host or intervening galaxy whichwas measured 110 d after the event at r = 24.56 +/- 0.14, although the lightcurve deviates from a single power law whether or not a constant term isincluded. the early-time spectral energy distribution of the afterglow can bedescribed as f_nu ~ nu**(-0.74 +/- 0.05) or flatter between optical and x-ray,which, together with the slow initial decay, is characteristic of standardadiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium. assuming that a reportedabsorption-line redshift of 1.02 is correct, the apparent isotropic energy of6.7 x 10**53 erg is reduced by a factor of ~ 200 in the jet model, and theinitial half-opening angle is ~ 6 deg. grb 991216 is the third good example ofa jet-like afterglow (following grb 990123 and grb 990510), supporting a trendin which the apparently most energetic gamma-ray events have the narrowestcollimation and a uniform ism environment. this, plus the absence of evidencefor supernovae associated with jet-like afterglows, suggests that these eventsmay originate from a progenitor in which angular momentum plays an importantrole but a massive stellar envelope or wind does not, e.g., the coalescence ofa compact binary.

astro-ph;0008029	the redshift and the host galaxy of grb 980613: a gamma-ray burst from a  merger-induced starburst?	we present optical and near-ir identification and spectroscopy of the hostgalaxy of grb 980613. the burst was apparently associated with the optically(restframe uv) brightest component of a system of at least five galaxies orgalaxy fragments at a redshift of z = 1.0969. the component we identify as thehost galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate, sfr = 5m_solar/yr, but a high sfr per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. the imagecomponents show a broad range of (r-k) colors, with two of them being very red,possibly due to dust. overall morphology of the system can be naturallyinterpreted as a strong tidal interaction of two or more galaxies, at aredshift where such events were much more common than now. given the wellestablished causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts, we propose thatthis is a strong case for a grb originating from a merger-induced starburstsystem. this supports the proposed link between grbs and massive starformation.

astro-ph;0010176	the observed offset distribution of gamma-ray bursts from their host  galaxies: a robust clue to the nature of the progenitors	we present a comprehensive study to measure the locations of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) relative to their host galaxies. in total, we find the offsets of 20long-duration grbs from their apparent host galaxy centers utilizingground-based images from palomar and keck and space-based images from thehubble space telescope (hst). the median projected angular (physical) offset is0.17 arcsec (1.3 kpc). the median offset normalized by the individual hosthalf-light radii is 0.98 suggesting a strong connection of grb locations withthe uv light of their hosts. this provides strong observational evidence forthe connection of grbs to star formation. we compare the observed offsetdistribution with an exponential disk, a model for the location of collapsars.the statistical comparison shows good agreement, with the kolmogorov-smirnovprobability that the observed offsets derive from the model distribution ofp_ks = 0.45. we also compare the observed grb offsets with the expected offsetdistribution of delayed merging remnant progenitors (black hole--neutron starand neutron star--neutron star binaries). we find that delayed merging remnantprogenitors, insofar as the predicted offset distributions from populationsynthesis studies are representative, can be ruled out at the 2 x 10^{-3}level. this is arguably the strongest observational constraint yet againstdelayed merging remnants as the progenitors of long-duration grbs. in thecourse of this study, we have also discovered the putative host galaxies of grb990510 and grb 990308 in archival hst data.

astro-ph;0012303	multi-color observations of the grb000926 afterglow	we present multi-color light-curves of the optical afterglow of grb 000926.beginning ~1.5 days after the burst, the light-curves of this grb steepenmeasurably. the existence of such achromatic breaks are usually taken to be animportant observational signature that the ejecta are not expandingisotropically, but rather have a collimated jet-like geometry. if we interpretthe data in this context, we derive an opening angle of 5 degrees, whichreduces the energy release compared to an isotropic model by a factor of ~275,to 1.7 x 10^51 erg. to fit the data with a simple jet model requires extinctionalong the line of sight. the derived a_v is in the range 0.11 - 0.82 mag,depending on the adopted extinction law and whether the electrons giving riseto the optical emission are undergoing synchrotron cooling or not. since thisis in excess of the expected extinction from our galaxy, we attribute this tothe grb host. we note that this extinction is typical of a galactic disk, andtherefore the event likely took place in the disk of its host.

astro-ph;0102278	grb 000418: a hidden jet revealed?	we report on optical, near-infrared and centimeter radio observations ofgrb000418 which allow us to follow the evolution of the afterglow from 2 to 200days after the gamma-ray burst. in modeling these broad-band data, we find thatan isotropic explosion in a constant density medium is unable to simultaneouslyfit both the radio and optical data. however, a jet-like outflow with anopening angle of 10-20 degress provides a good description of the data. theevidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based on the behavior of the radiolight curves, since the expected jet break is masked at optical wavelengths bythe light of the host galaxy. we also find evidence for extinction, presumablyarising from within the host galaxy, with a(v)=0.4 mag, and host flux densitiesof f_r=1.1 ujy and f_k=1.7 ujy. these values supercede previous work on thisburst due to the availability of a broad-band data set allowing a globalfitting approach. a model in which the grb explodes into a wind-stratifiedcircumburst medium cannot be ruled out by these data. however, in examining asample of other bursts (e.g. grb990510, grb000301c) we favor the jetinterpretation for grb000418.

astro-ph;0103377	broadband observations of the afterglow of grb 000926: observing the  effect of inverse compton scattering and evidence for a high-density  environment	grb 000926 has one of the best-studied afterglows to-date, with multiplex-ray observations, as well as extensive multi-frequency optical and radiocoverage. broadband afterglow observations, spanning from x-ray to radiofrequencies, provide a probe of the density structure of the circumburstmedium, as well as of the ejecta energetics, geometry, and the physicalparameters of the relativistic blastwave resulting from the explosion. wepresent an analysis of {\em chandra x-ray observatory} observations of thisevent, along with {\em hubble space telescope} and radio monitoring. we combinethese data with ground-based optical and ir observations and fit thesynthesized afterglow lightcurve using models where collimated ejecta expandinto a surrounding medium. we find that we can explain the broadband lightcurvewith reasonable physical parameters only if the cooling is dominated by inversecompton scattering. excess x-ray emission in the broadband spectrum indicatesthat we are directly observing a contribution from inverse compton scattering.it is the first time this has been observed in a grb afterglow, and it impliesthat the grb exploded in a reasonably dense (n~30 cm^{-3}) medium, consistentwith a diffuse interstellar cloud environment.

astro-ph;0106574	the cosmic gamma-ray bursts	cosmic gamma-ray bursts are one of the great frontiers of astrophysics today.they are a playground of relativists and observers alike. they may teach usabout the death of stars and the birth of black holes, the physics in extremeconditions, and help us probe star formation in the distant and obscureduniverse. in this review we summarise some of the remarkable progress in thisfield over the past few years. while the nature of the grb progenitors is stillunsettled, it now appears likely that at least some bursts originate inexplosions of very massive stars, or at least occur in or near the regions ofmassive star formation. the physics of the burst afterglows is reasonably wellunderstood, and has been tested and confirmed very well by the observations.bursts are found to be beamed, but with a broad range of jet opening angles;the mean gamma-ray energies after the beaming corrections are ~ 10^51 erg.bursts are associated with faint &lt;r&gt; ~ 25 mag) galaxies at cosmologicalredshifts, with &lt;z&gt; ~ 1. the host galaxies span a range of luminosities andmorphologies, but appear to be broadly typical for the normal, activelystar-forming galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes. some ofthe challenges for the future include: the nature of the short bursts andpossibly other types of bursts and transients; use of grbs to probe theobscured star formation in the universe, and possibly as probes of the veryearly universe; and their detection as sources of high-energy particles andgravitational waves.

astro-ph;0107539	the afterglow and the host galaxy of the dark burst grb 970828	grb 970828 was the first well-localized gamma-ray burst (grb) x-ray afterglowfor which no optical afterglow was found despite a prompt, deep search down tor_lim ~ 24.5 mag. we report the discovery of a short-lived radio flare withinthe x-ray localization error circle of this burst. such radio flares are seenin about 25% of grb afterglows and their origin is not well understood. theprecise radio position enabled us to identify the likely host galaxy of thisburst, and to measure its redshift, z = 0.9578. the host appears to be aninteracting/merging system. under the assumption that the x-ray afterglow ismainly due to synchrotron mechanism we infer the optical afterglow flux. theobserved upper limits to the optical flux are easily explained by invoking anintervening dusty cloud within the host galaxy. these observations support theidea that grbs with no detectable optical afterglows or "dark grbs" can be dueto dust extinction within the host galaxies. the census of dark grbs can thenbe used to constrain the fraction of the obscured star formation in theuniverse. we argue that the existing data already indicate that the obscuredstar-formation rate is no more than 1/2 of that seen at uv and opticalwavelengths.

astro-ph;0108436	grb 010222: a burst within a starburst	we present millimeter and submillimeter wavelength observations andnear-infrared k-band imaging toward the bright gamma-ray burst grb 010222. overseven epochs the flux density of the source was constant with an average fluxdensity 3.74+/-0.53 mjy at 350 ghz and 1.05+/-0.22 mjy at 250 ghz, giving aspectral index alpha=3.78+/-0.25. we rule out the possibility that thisemission originated from the burst or its afterglow and we conclude that it isdue to a dusty, high redshift starburst galaxy (smm j14522+4301). we argue thatthe host galaxy of grb 010222 is the most plausible counterpart of smmj14522+4301, based in part on the centimeter detection of the host at theexpected level. the optical/nir properties of the host galaxy of grb 010222suggest that it is a blue, sub-l_*, similar to other grb host galaxies. thiscontrasts with the enormous far-infrared luminosity of this galaxy based on oursubmillimeter detection (l_bol~4x10^{12} l_odot). we suggest that this grb hostgalaxy has a very high star formation rate, sfr 600 m_\odot/yr, most of whichis unseen at optical wavelengths.

astro-ph;0110566	keck spectroscopy and hst imaging of grb 000926: probing a host galaxy  at z = 2. 038	we present early-time keck spectroscopic observations and late-time hubblespace telescope (hst) imaging of grb 000926. the hst images show a small offsetbetween the optical transient and the compact host galaxy. combined with thelarge equivalent widths measured for metallic absorption lines by the keckechellette spectrograph and imager (esi) and the low-resolution imagingspectrometer (lris), this indicates that the grb exploded near the center ofits host. the esi spectroscopy reveals two absorption systems centered at z =2.0379 \pm 0.0008 with a velocity separation of 168 km s^{-1}, which weinterpret as being due to individual clouds in the host galaxy. the ratios ofchromium to zinc equivalent widths indicates the host is depleted in dustrelative to local values to a similar degree as damped lyman alpha systems atthe same redshift. further, the two clouds appear to have similar relativemetal abundance and dust to gas ratio. if one cloud is associated with the grbsite, this implies the explosion did not significantly alter the surroundingenvironment.

astro-ph;0203467	grb 011121: a massive star progenitor	of the cosmological gamma-ray bursts, grb 011121 has the lowest redshift,z=0.36. more importantly, the multi-color excess in the afterglow detected inthe hubble space telescope (hst) light curves is compelling observationalevidence for an underlying supernova. here we present near-infrared and radioobservations of the afterglow. we undertake a comprehensive modeling of theseobservations and those reported in the literature and find good evidencefavoring a wind-fed circumburst medium. in detail, we infer the progenitor hada mass loss rate of mdot ~ 10^-7 / v_w3 mo/yr where v_w3 is the speed of thewind from the progenitor in units of 10^3 km/s. this mass loss rate is similarto that inferred for the progenitor of sn 1998bw which has been associated withgrb 980425. our data, taken in conjunction with the hst results of bloom et al.(2002), provide a consistent picture: the long duration grb 011121 had amassive star progenitor which exploded as a supernova at about the same time asthe grb event.

0808.2193	the exceptionally luminous type ii-l sn 2008es	we report on our early photometric and spectroscopic observations of theextremely luminous type ii supernova (sn) 2008es. with an observed peak opticalmagnitude of m_v = 17.8 and at a redshift z = 0.213, sn 2008es had a peakabsolute magnitude of m_v = -22.3, making it the second most luminous sn everobserved. the photometric evolution of sn 2008es exhibits a fast decline rate(~0.042 mag d^-1), similar to the extremely luminous type ii-l sn 2005ap. weshow that sn 2008es spectroscopically resembles the luminous type ii-l sn1979c. although the spectra of sn 2008es lack the narrow and intermediate-widthline emission typically associated with the interaction of a sn with thecircumstellar medium of its progenitor star, we argue that the extremeluminosity of sn 2008es is powered via strong interaction with a dense,optically thick circumstellar medium. the integrated bolometric luminosity ofsn 2008es yields a total radiated energy at ultraviolet and optical wavelengthsof &gt;10^51 ergs. finally, we examine the apparently anomalous rate at which thetexas supernova search has discovered rare kinds of supernovae, including thefive most luminous supernovae observed to date, and find that their results areconsistent with those of other modern sn searches.

astro-ph;0207009	time-dependent optical spectroscopy of grb 010222: clues to the grb  environment	we present sequential optical spectra of the afterglow of grb 010222 obtainedone day apart using the low resolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and theechellette spectrograph and imager (esi) on the keck telescopes. threelow-ionization absorption systems are spectroscopically identified atz1=1.47688, z2=1.15628, and z3=0.92747. the higher resolution esi spectrumreveals two distinct components in the highest redshift system at z1a=1.47590and z1b=1.47688. we interpret the z1b=1.47688 system as an absorption featureof the disk of the host galaxy of grb 010222. the best fitted power-law opticalcontinuum and [zn/cr] ratio imply low dust content or a local gray dustcomponent near the burst site. in addition, we do not detect strong signaturesof vibrationally excited states of h_2. if the grb took place in a superbubbleor young stellar cluster, there are no outstanding signatures of an ionizedabsorber, either. analysis of the spectral time dependence at low resolutionshows no significant evidence for absorption-line variability. this lack ofvariability is confronted with time-dependent photoionization simulationsdesigned to apply the observed flux from grb 010222 to a variety of assumedatomic gas densities and cloud radii. the absence of time dependence in theabsorption lines implies that high-density environments are disfavored. inparticular, if the grb environment was dust free, its density was unlikely toexceed nh=10^2 cm^-3. if depletion of metals onto dust is similar to galacticvalues or less than solar abundances are present, then nh &gt; 2 x 10^4 cm^-3 isprobably ruled out in the immediate vicinity of the burst.

astro-ph;0207320	the faint optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 020124: implications  for the nature of dark gamma-ray bursts	we present ground-based optical observations of grb 020124 starting 1.6 hoursafter the burst, as well as subsequent very large array (vla) and hubble spacetelescope (hst) observations. the optical afterglow of grb 020124 is one of thefaintest afterglows detected to date, and it exhibits a relatively rapid decay,$f_\nu\propto t^{-1.60\pm 0.04}$, followed by further steepening. in addition,a weak radio source was found coincident with the optical afterglow. the hstobservations reveal that a positionally coincident host galaxy must be thefaintest host to date, r&gt;29.5 mag. the afterglow observations can be explainedby several models requiring little or no extinction within the host galaxy,a_v~0-0.9 mag. these observations have significant implications for thestatistics of the so-called dark bursts (bursts for which no optical afterglowis detected), which are usually attributed to dust extinction within the hostgalaxy. the faintness and relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of grb020124, combined with the low inferred extinction indicate that some darkbursts are intrinsically dim and not dust obscured. thus, the diversity in theunderlying properties of optical afterglows must be observationally determinedbefore substantive inferences can be drawn from the statistics of dark bursts.

astro-ph;0208008	discovery of grb 020405 and its late red bump	we present the discovery of grb 020405 made with the inter-planetary network(ipn). with a duration of 60 s, the burst appears to be a typical long durationevent. we observed the 75-square acrminute ipn error region with the mountstromlo observatory's 50-inch robotic telescope and discovered a transientsource which subsequently decayed and was also associated with a variable radiosource. we identify this source as the afterglow of grb 020405. subsequentobservations by other groups found varying polarized flux and established aredshift of 0.690 to the host galaxy. motivated by the low redshift wetriggered observations with wfpc2 on-board the hubble space telescope (hst).modeling the early ground-based data with a jet model, we find a clear redexcess over the decaying optical lightcurves that is present between day 10 andday 141 (the last hst epoch). this `bump' has the spectral and temporalfeatures expected of an underlying supernova (sn). in particular, the red colorof the putative sn is similar to that of the sn associated with grb 011121, atlate time. restricting the sample of grbs to those with z&lt;0.7, a total of fivebursts, red bumps at late times are found in grb 970228, grb 011121, and grb020405. it is possible that the simplest idea, namely that all long durationgrbs have underlying sne with a modest dispersion in their properties(especially peak luminosity), is sufficient to explain the non detections.

astro-ph;0301342	the cosmic gamma-ray bursts and their host galaxies in a cosmological  context	studies of the cosmic gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and their host galaxies are nowstarting to provide interesting or even unique new insights in observationalcosmology. observed grb host galaxies have a median magnitude r ~ 25 mag, andshow a range of luminosities, morphologies, and star formation rates, with amedian redshift z ~ 1. they represent a new way of identifying a population ofstar-forming galaxies at cosmological redshifts, which is mostly independent ofthe traditional selection methods. they seem to be broadly similar to thenormal field galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes, andindicate at most a mild luminosity evolution over the redshift range theyprobe. studies of grb optical afterglows seen in absorption provide a powerfulnew probe of the ism in dense, central regions of their host galaxies, which iscomplementary to the traditional studies using qso absorption line systems.some grb hosts are heavily obscured, and provide a new way to select apopulation of cosmological sub-mm sources. a census of detected opticaltranistents may provide an important new way to constrain the total obscuredfraction of star formation over the history of the universe. finally, detectionof grb afterglows at high redshifts (z &gt; 6) may provide a unique way to probethe primordial star formation, massive imf, early igm, and chemical enrichmentat the end of the cosmic reionization era.

astro-ph;0301421	the broadband afterglow of grb980703	we present radio observations of the afterglow of the bright gamma-ray burstgrb980703 made between one day and one year after the burst. these data arecombined with published late-time radio measurements and existing optical,near-infrared (nir) and x-ray observations to create a comprehensive broadbanddataset for modeling the physical parameters of the outflow. while awind-stratified medium cannot be ruled out statistically, it requires a highfraction of the shock energy in the electrons, and so is not favored ontheoretical grounds. instead, the data are consistent with a fireball model inwhich the ejecta are collimated and expanding into a constant density medium.the radio data cannot be fit with an isotropic shock but instead require a jetbreak at ~ 3.5 days, not seen at optical wavelengths due to the presence of a abright host galaxy. the addition of the full radio dataset constrains theself-absorption frequency, giving an estimate of the circumburst density of n ~30 cm^-3, a value which differs substantially from previous estimates. thisresult is consistent with the growing number of grb afterglows for whichbroadband modeling yields n ~= 0.1-100 cm^-3, with a typical value ~ 10 cm^-3.

astro-ph;0302210	grb energetics and the grb hubble diagram: promises and limitations	we present a complete sample of 29 grbs for which it has been possible todetermine temporal breaks (or limits) from their afterglow light curves. weinterpret these breaks within the framework of the uniform conical jet model,incorporating realistic estimates of the ambient density and propagating errorestimates on the measured quantities. in agreement with our previous analysisof a smaller sample, the derived jet opening angles of those 16 bursts withredshifts result in a narrow clustering of geometrically-corrected gamma-rayenergies about e_gamma = 1.33e51 erg; the burst-to-burst variance about thisvalue is a factor of 2.2. despite this rather small scatter, we demonstrate ina series of grb hubble diagrams, that the current sample cannot placemeaningful constraints upon the fundamental parameters of the universe. indeedfor grbs to ever be useful in cosmographic measurements we argue the necessityof two directions. first, grb hubble diagrams should be based upon fundamentalphysical quantities such as energy, rather than empirically-derived andphysically ill-understood distance indicators. second, a more homogeneous setshould be constructed by culling sub-classes from the larger sample. thesesub-classes, though now first recognizable by deviant energies, ultimately mustbe identifiable by properties other than those directly related to energy. weidentify a new sub-class of grbs (``f-grbs'') which appear both underluminousby factors of at least 10 and exhibit a rapid fading at early times. about10-20% of observed long-duration bursts appear to be f-grbs.

astro-ph;0302249	is the redshift clustering of long-duration gamma-ray bursts  significant?	the 26 long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with known redshifts form adistinct cosmological set, selected differently than other cosmological probessuch as quasars and galaxies. since the progenitors are now believed to beconnected with active star-formation and since burst emission penetrates dust,one hope is that with a uniformly-selected sample, the large-scale redshiftdistribution of grbs can help constrain the star-formation history of theuniverse. however, we show that strong observational biases in ground-basedredshift discovery hamper a clean determination of the large-scale grb rate andhence the connection of grbs to the star formation history. we then focus onthe properties of the small-scale (clustering) distribution of grb redshifts.when corrected for heliocentric motion relative to the local hubble flow, theobserved redshifts appear to show a propensity for clustering: 8 of 26 grbsoccurred within a recession velocity difference of 1000 km/s of another grb.that is, 4 pairs of grbs occurred within 30 h_65^-1 myr in cosmic time, despitebeing causally separated on the sky. we investigate the significance of thisclustering. comparison of the numbers of close redshift pairs expected from thesimulation with that observed shows no significant small-scale clusteringexcess in the present sample; however, the four close pairs occur only in abouttwenty percent of the simulated datasets (the precise significance of theclustering is dependent upon the modeled biases). we conclude with someimpetuses and suggestions for future precise grb redshift measurements.

astro-ph;0304169	optical limits on precursor emission from gamma-ray bursts with known  redshift	making use of virtual observatory data, we present the first comprehensivesample of optical observations conducted before the explosion times of allgamma-ray bursts (grbs) with known redshifts. in total, the fields of 11 suchgrbs were observed by the near-earth asteroid tracking (neat) program fromyears to hours before the bursts. though the typical limiting magnitudes fromthese observations are r~20 mag, we find no evidence for a significantdetection of a precursor. the deepest non-detection of precursor emission isfrom grb 030329, reaching down to an absolute b-band magnitude of m_b -18 magfrom 6--1500 days (restframe) before the burst. this is of comparablebrightness to supernovae, which, in some scenarios for grb progenitors, arepredicted to pre-date a grb on similar timescales. since sources cannot belocalized to better than ~500 milliarcsecond (3 sigma) with current large-areasurveys, unrelated supernovae or agn activity in grb hosts could be mistakenfor genuine precursor emission. this possibility motivates the need for notonly deep wide-field imaging, but imaging at high spatial resolution.

astro-ph;0308034	optical-infrared andicam observations of the transient associated with  grb 030329	we present photometry of the transient associated with grb 030329 obtainedwith the ctio 1.3--meter telescope and the andicam instrument, a dualoptical/infrared imager with a dichroic centered at one micron. without theneed for light curve interpolation to produce snapshot broadband spectra, weshow that the transient spectrum remained statistically achromatic from day 2.7to day 5.6, during a re-brightening episode. associating the light in theseearly epochs with the grb afterglow, we infer a modest level of extinction dueto the host galaxy in the line--of--sight toward the grb: a_v(host) = 0.30 +/-0.03 mag for beta = -0.5 and a_v(host) &lt; 0.4 mag (3 sigma) for any physicallyplausible value of beta (with flux f_nu ~ lambda^-beta). we conclude that thespectral slope of the afterglow component was more than beta = -0.8 between day2.7-5.6 after the grb, excluding the possibility that the synchrotron coolingbreak passed through the optical/ir bandpass over that period. takingextinction into account, a decomposition of the light curve into an afterglowand supernova component requires the presence of a supernova similar to that ofsn 1998bw, an afterglow that shows some evidence for a second break around day8-10, and a fifth re-brightening event around day 15. assuming an sn1988bw-like evolution and a contemporaneous grb and sn event, the peak snbrightness was m_v = -19.8 +/- 0.4 - 5 log h_65 mag.

astro-ph;0312594	the detailed optical light curve of grb 030329	(abridged) we present densely sampled bvri light curves of the opticaltransient associated with the gamma-ray burst grb 030329, the result of acoordinated observing campaign conducted at five observatories. augmented withpublished observations of this grb, the compiled optical dataset contains 2687photometric measurements, obtained between 78 minutes and 79 days after theburst. we show that the underlying supernova 2003dh evolved faster than, andwas probably somewhat fainter than the type ic sn 1998bw, associated with grb980425. we find that our data can be described by a broken power-law decayperturbed by a complex variable component. the early- and late-time decayslopes are determined to be ~1.1 and ~2, respectively. assuming this singlepower-law model, we constrain the break to lie between ~3 and ~8 days after theburst. this simple, singly-broken power-law model, derived only from theanalysis of our optical observations, may also account for available multi-banddata, provided that the break happened ~8 days after the burst. the morecomplex double-jet model of berger et al. provides a comparable fit to theoptical, x-ray, mm and radio observations of this event. we detect asignificant change in optical colors during the first day. our color analysisis consistent with a cooling break frequency sweeping through the optical bandduring the first day. the light curves of grb 030329 reveal a rich array ofvariations, superposed over the mean power-law decay. we find that the earlyvariations are asymmetric, with a steep rise followed by a relatively slower(by a factor of about two) decline. the variations maintain a similar timescale during the first four days, and then get significantly longer.

astro-ph;0405062	grb 021211 as a faint analogue of grb 990123: exploring the similarities  and differences in their optical afterglows	we present b, v, rc, j, h, and ks photometry of the optical afterglow of thegamma-ray burst grb 021211 taken at the magellan, mmt, and wiyn observatoriesbetween 0.7 and 50 days after the burst. we find an intrinsic spectral slope atoptical and near-infrared wavelengths of 0.69 +/- 0.14 at 0.87 days. theoptical decay during the first day is almost identical to that of grb 990123except that grb 021211's optical afterglow was intrinsically approximately 38times fainter, and the transition from the reverse shock to the forward shockmay have occurred earlier than it did for grb 990123. we find no evidence for ajet break or the cooling break passing through optical frequencies during thefirst day after the burst. there is weak evidence for a break in the j-banddecay between 0.89 and 1.87 days which may be due to a jet. the optical andinfrared data are consistent with a relativistic fireball where the shockedelectrons are in the slow cooling regime and the electron index is 2.3 +/- 0.1.the forward shock appears to have been expanding in a homogeneous ambientmedium during the first day after the burst. our analysis suggests that the jetof grb 021211 may have a small opening angle and that the total gamma-rayenergy is likely to be much less than the canonical value of 1.33e+51 erg. ifthis is the case then it is possible that most of the energy of the burst is inanother form such as a frozen magnetic field, supernova ejecta, or a second jetcomponent. the host galaxy of grb 021211 is subluminous and has a starformation rate of at least one solar mass per year.

astro-ph;0405266	direct detection of dark matter with space-based laser interferometers	dark matter pervades the solar system, free-streaming at the halo's localgalactic orbital velocity and density. as these objects pass through the solarsystem, they perturb gravitationally, and thus very weakly, all nearby inertialmasses. making use of this, we propose an approach to the direct detection ofdark matter at previously inaccessible intermediate masses (1e14 -- 1e20 gm).such mass scales are relevant for example for dark matter made of primordialblack holes or clumped matter in a sequestered sector. if such dark matterexists it will be unambiguously detectable through its inelastic gravitationalinteraction with the proposed laser interferometer space antenna (lisa)experiment. we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by studying the darkmatter signal in numerical simulations of the lisa data stream. a moreconservative approach -- to detect dark matter in the differential accelerationpower spectrum -- significantly underestimates the expected rates for lisa.interestingly, while the space-density of 1e15 gm dm objects would becomparable to the space-density of asteroids of similar masses, such ``lightmatter'' contaminants are readily detectable in reflected solar light, allowingfor the elimination of the major background.

astro-ph;0503508	a contemporaneous infrared flash from a long gamma-ray burst: an echo  from the central engine	the explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (grb) is thought toproduce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the centralengine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internalshocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the externalenvironment produces long-wavelength afterglow. while afterglow observationscontinue to refine our understanding of grb progenitors and relativisticshocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of theorigin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. only oneconcurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated withemission from an external shock. here we report the discovery of infrared (ir)emission contemporaneous with a grb, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset ofgrb 041219a. our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phaseof the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of anylong-wavelength emission associated with a grb. analysis of an initial ir pulsesuggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. this opens a newpossibility to study the central engine of grbs with ground-based observationsat long wavelengths.

astro-ph;0505480	closing in on a short-hard burst progenitor: constraints from early-time  optical imaging and spectroscopy of a possible host galaxy of grb 050509b	the localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 050509b was awatershed event. thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the grb position byswift, we began imaging the grb field 8 minutes after the burst and continuedfor the following 8 days. no convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow orsupernova was found for the object. we present a re-analysis of the xrtafterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4" to the west of the xrtposition reported previously. close to this position is a bright ellipticalgalaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster ofgalaxies. based on positional coincidences, the grb and the bright ellipticalare likely to be physically related. we thus have discovered evidence that atleast some short-duration, hard-spectra grbs arise at cosmological distances.however, while grb 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration grbs, wedemonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy isconsistent with that of long-duration grbs. based on this analysis, on thelocation of the grb (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there isnow observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts ariseduring the merger of a compact binary. we limit the properties of ali-paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' other progenitor models are still viable, andadditional rapidly localized bursts from the swift mission will undoubtedlyhelp to further clarify the progenitor picture.

astro-ph;0510022	the galaxy hosts and large-scale environments of short-hard gamma-ray  bursts	the rapid succession of discovery of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs hasled to unprecedented insights into the energetics of the explosion and natureof the progenitors. yet short of the detection of a smoking gun, like a burstof coincident gravitational radiation or a li-paczynski mini-supernova, it isunlikely that a definitive claim can be made for the progenitors. as was thecase with long--duration soft--spectrum grbs, however, the expectation is thata systematic study of the hosts and the locations of short grbs could begin toyield fundamental clues about their nature. we present the first aggregatestudy of the host galaxies of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs. inparticular, we present the gemini--north and keck discovery spectra of thegalaxies that hosted three short grbs and a moderate--resolution (r~6000)spectrum of a fourth host. we find that these short--hard grbs originate in avariety of low-redshift (z&lt;1) environments that differ substantially from thoseof long--soft grbs, both on individual galaxy scales and on galaxy--clusterscales. specifically, three of the bursts are found to be associated with oldand massive galaxies with no current (&lt; 0.1 msol/hr) or recent star formation.two of these galaxies are located within a cluster environment. theseobservations support an origin from the merger of compact stellar remnants,such as double neutron stars of a neutron star--black hole binary. the fourthevent, in contrast, occurred within a dwarf galaxy with a star formation rateexceeding 0.5 msol/yr. therefore, it appears that like supernovae of type ia,the progenitors of short--hard bursts are created in all galaxy types,suggesting a corresponding class with a wide distribution of delay timesbetween formation and explosion.

astro-ph;0606763	when do internal shocks end and external shocks begin? early-time  broadband modelling of grb 051111	even with the renaissance in gamma-ray burst (grb) research fostered by theswift satellite, few bursts have both contemporaneous observations at longwavelengths and exquisite observations at later times across theelectromagnetic spectrum. we present here contemporaneous imaging with the kaitrobotic optical telescope, dense optical sampling with lulin, and supplementedwith infrared data from pairitel and radio to gamma-ray data from theliterature. for the first time, we can test the constancy of microphysicalparameters in the internal-external shock paradigm and carefully trace the flowof energy from the grb to the surrounding medium. kait data taken &lt;~1 minuteafter the start of grb051111 and coinciding with the fading gamma-ray tail ofthe prompt emission indicate a smooth re-injection of energy into the shock. nocolor change is apparent in observations beginning ~1.5 minutes after the grband lasting for the first hour after the burst. there are achromatic fluxmodulations about the best-fit model at late (t~10^4 s) times, possibly due tovariations in the external density. we find that the host-galaxy extinction iswell fit by a curve similar to that ofthe small magellanic cloud. low visualextinction, a_v~0.2 mag, combined with high column densities determined fromthe x-ray and optical spectroscopy (n_h&gt; 10^21 cm^-2), indicate a lowdust-to-metals ratio and a possible over-abundance of the light metals. anapparent small ratio of total to selective extinction (r_v~2) argues againstdust destruction by the grb. time constancy of both the ir/optical/uv spectralenergy distribution and the soft x-ray absorption suggests that the absorbingmaterial is not local to the grb.

astro-ph;0607223	a putative early-type host galaxy for grb 060502b: implications for the  progenitors of short-duration hard-spectrum bursts	starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-durationhard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (shb) by swift last year, a growing body ofevidence has suggested that shbs are associated with an older andlower-redshift galactic population than long-soft grbs and, in a few cases,with large (&gt;~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putativehost galaxies. here we present observations of the field of grb 060502b, a shbdetected by swift and localized by the x-ray telescope (xrt). we find a massivered galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec fromour revised xrt position. using associative and probabilistic arguments wesuggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of grb 060502b. if true, thisoffset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc inprojection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any shb to date andalmost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset.spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host showit to have undergone a large ancient starburst. if the progenitor of grb060502b was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the grb explosionsince birth is tau = 1.3 +- 0.2 gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the shbprogenitor is v_kick = 55 +- 15 km/s.

astro-ph;0703538	the troublesome broadband evolution of grb 061126: does a grey burst  imply grey dust?	we report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (grb 061126) with an extremelybright (r ~ 12 mag at peak) early-time optical afterglow. the optical afterglowis already fading as a power law 22 seconds after the trigger, with nodetectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident witha large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. the optical--infrared photometricspectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but itexhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 safter the burst. this color change is contemporaneous with a switch from arelatively fast decay to slower decay. the rapidly decaying early afterglow isbroadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a brightforward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time x-rayobservations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is notobserved. indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burstwould qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flatoptical-to-x-ray spectral index. our photometric spectral energy distributionprovides no evidence of host-galaxy extinction, requiring either largequantities of grey dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006,based upon our late-time keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins forthe x-ray and optical afterglows.

0809.2608	high-redshift starbursting dwarf galaxies revealed by grb afterglows	we present a study of 15 long-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxies atz&gt;2. the grbs are selected with available early-time afterglow spectra in orderto compare interstellar medium (ism) absorption-line properties with stellarproperties of the host galaxies. in addition to five previously studied hosts,we consider new detections for the host galaxies of grb050820 and grb060206 andplace 2-sigma upper limits to the luminosities of the remaining unidentifiedhosts. we examine the nature of the host galaxy population and find that (1)the uv luminosity distribution of grb host galaxies is consistent withexpectations from a uv luminosity weighted random galaxy population with amedian luminosity of &lt;l(uv)&gt;=0.1 l*; (2) there exists a moderate correlationbetween uv luminosity and siii 1526 absorption width, which together with theobserved large line widths of w(1526)&gt;1.5 ang for a large fraction of theobjects suggests a galactic outflow driven velocity field in the host galaxies;(3) there is tentative evidence for a trend of declining ism metallicity withdecreasing galaxy luminosity in the star-forming galaxy population at z=2-4;(4) the interstellar uv radiation field is found ~ 35-350 times higher in grbhosts than the galactic mean value; and (5) additional galaxies are found at &lt;2" from the grb host in all fields with known presence of strong mgiiabsorbers, but no additional faint galaxies are found at &lt; 2" in fields withoutstrong mgii absorbers. our study confirms that the grb host galaxies (withknown optical afterglows) are representative of unobscured star-forminggalaxies at z&gt;2, and demonstrates that high spatial resolution images arenecessary for an accurate identification of grb host galaxies in the presenceof strong intervening absorbers.

astro-ph;9807050	expected characteristics of the subclass of supernova gamma-ray bursts  (s-grbs)	the spatial and temporal coincidence between the gamma-ray burst (grb) 980425and supernova (sn) 1998bw has prompted speculation that there exists a class ofgrbs produced by sne (``s-grbs''). robust arguments for the existence of arelativistic shock have been presented on the basis of radio observations. aphysical model based on the radio observations lead us to propose the followingcharacteristics of supernovae grbs (s-grbs): 1) prompt radio emission andimplied brightness temperature near or below the inverse compton limit, 2) highexpansion velocity of the optical photosphere as derived from lines widths andenergy release larger than usual, 3) no long-lived x-ray afterglow, and 4) asingle pulse (sp) grb profile. radio studies of previous sne show that onlytype ib and ic potentially satisfy the first condition. accordingly we haveinvestigated proposed associations of grbs and sne finding no convincingevidence (mainly to paucity of data) to confirm any single connection of a snwith a grb. if there is a more constraining physical basis for the bursttime-history of s-grbs beyond that of the sp requirement, we suggest the 1% oflight curves in the batse catalogue similar to that of grb 980425 mayconstitute the subclass. future optical follow-up of bursts with similarprofiles should confirm if such grbs originate from some fraction of sn typeib/ic.

astro-ph;9807315	the host galaxy of grb 970508	we present late-time imaging and spectroscopic observations of the opticaltransient (ot) of gamma-ray burst (grb) 970508. imaging observations roughly200 and 300 days after the burst provide unambiguous evidence for theflattening of the light-curve. the spectroscopic observations reveal twopersistent features which we identify with [o ii] 3727 angstrom and [ne iii]3869 angstrom at a redshift of z= 0.835 -- the same redshift as the absorptionsystem seen when the transient was bright. the ot was coincident with theunderlying galaxy to better than 370 milliarcsec or a projected radialseparation of less than 2.7 kpc. the luminosity of the [o ii] line implies aminimum star-formation rate of &gt; 1 m_solar per year. in our assumed cosmology,the implied restframe absolute magnitude is m_b = -18.55, or l_b = 0.12 l_*.this object, the likely host of grb 970508, can thus be characterized as anactively star-forming dwarf galaxy. the close spatial connection between thisdwarf galaxy and the grb requires that at least some fraction of progenitors benot ejected in even the weakest galactic potentials.

astro-ph;9902182	the host galaxy of grb 990123	we present deep images of the field of gamma-ray burst (grb) 990123 obtainedin a broad-band uv/visible bandpass with the hubble space telescope, and deepnear-infrared images obtained with the keck-i 10-m telescope. both the hst andkeck images show that the optical transient (ot) is clearly offset by 0.6arcsec from an extended object, presumably the host galaxy. this galaxy is themost likely source of the metallic-line absorption at z = 1.6004 seen in thespectrum of the ot. with magnitudes v_{c} ~ 24.6 +/- 0.2 and k = 21.65 +/- 0.30mag this corresponds to an l ~ 0.7 l_* galaxy, assuming that it is located at z= 1.6. the estimated unobscured star formation rate is sfr ~ 6 m_sun/yr, whichis not unusually high for normal galaxies at comparable redshifts. the strengthof the observed metallic absorption lines is suggestive of a relatively highmetallicity of the gas, and thus of a chemically evolved system which may beassociated with a massive galaxy. it is also indicative of a high columndensity of the gas, typical of damped ly-alpha systems at high redshifts. weconclude that this is the host galaxy of grb 990123. no other obvious galaxiesare detected within the same projected radius from the ot. there is thus noevidence for strong gravitational lensing magnification of this burst, and somealternative explanation for its remarkable energetics may be required. theobserved offset of the ot from the center of its apparent host galaxy, 5.5 +/-0.9 proper kpc (projected) in the galaxy's rest-frame, both refutes thepossibility that grbs are related to galactic nuclear activity and supportsmodels of grbs which involve the death and/or merger of massive stars. further,the hst image suggests an intimate connection of grb 990123 and a star-formingregion.

astro-ph;9902272	the afterglow, the redshift, and the extreme energetics of the gamma-ray  burst 990123	afterglow, or long-lived emission, has now been detected from about a dozenwell-positioned gamma-ray bursts. distance determinations made by measuringoptical emission lines from the host galaxy, or absorption lines in theafterglow spectrum, place the burst sources at significant cosmologicaldistances, with redshifts ranging from ~1--3. the energy required to producethe bright gamma-ray flashes is enormous: up to ~10^{53} erg or 10 percent ofthe rest mass energy of a neutron star, if the emission is isotropic. here wepresent the discovery of the optical afterglow and the redshift of grb 990123,the brightest well-localized grb to date. with our measured redshift of &gt;1.6,the inferred isotropic energy release exceeds the rest mass of a neutron starthereby challenging current theoretical models for the origin of grbs. we arguethat the optical and ir afterglow measurements reported here may provide thefirst observational evidence of beaming in a grb, thereby reducing the requiredenergetics to a level where stellar death models are still tenable.

astro-ph;9903441	discovery of a radio flare from grb 990123	we report the discovery of a radio counterpart to grb 990123. in contrast toprevious well-studied radio afterglows which rise to peak flux on a timescaleof a week and then decay over several weeks to months, the radio emission fromthis grb was clearly detected one day after the burst, after which it rapidlyfaded away. the simplest interpretation of this ``radio flare'' is that itarises from the reverse shock. in the framework of the afterglow modelsdiscussed to date, a forward shock origin for the flare is ruled out by ourdata. however, at late times, some radio afterglow emission (commensurate withthe observed late-time optical emission, the optical afterglow) is expectedfrom the forward shock. the relative faintness of the observed late-time radioemission provides an independent indication for a jet-like geometry in thisgrb. we use the same radio observations to constrain two key parameters of theforward shock, peak flux and peak frequency, to within a factor of two. thesevalues are inconsistent with the notion advocated by several authors that theprompt optical emission detected by rotse smoothly joins the optical afterglowemission. finally, with hindsight we now recognize another such radio flare andthis suggests that one out of eight grbs has a detectable radio flare. thisabundance coupled with the reverse shock interpretation suggests that the radioflare phenomenon has the potential to shed new light into the physics ofreverse shocks in grbs.

astro-ph;9905301	the unusual afterglow of grb 980326: evidence for the gamma-ray  burst/supernova connection	cosmic gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been firmly established as one of themost powerful phenomena in the universe, releasing electromagnetic energyapproaching the rest-mass energy of a neutron star in a few seconds. the twocurrently popular models for grb progenitors are the coalescence of two compactobjects (such as neutron stars or black holes) or collapse of a massive star.an unavoidable consequence of the latter model is that a bright supernovaeshould accompany the grb. the emission from this supernova competes with themuch brighter afterglow produced by the relativistic shock that gives rise tothe grb itself. here we present evidence for an unusual light curve for grb980326 based on new optical observations. the transient brightened ~3 weeksafter the burst to a flux sixty times larger than that extrapolated from therapid decay seen at early time. furthermore, the spectrum changed dramaticallyand became extremely red. we argue that the new source is the underlyingsupernova. if our hypothesis is true then this would be the first evidence fora supernova connection with grbs at cosmological distances. we suggest thatgrbs with long durations are associated with death of massive stars.

astro-ph;9909407	the radio afterglow and the host galaxy of the x-ray rich grb 981226	we report the discovery of a radio transient vla 232937.2-235553, coincidentwith the proposed x-ray afterglow for the gamma-ray burst grb 981226. this grbhas the highest ratio of x-ray to gamma-ray fluence of all the grbs detected bybepposax so far and yet no corresponding optical transient was detected. theradio light curve of vla 232937.2-235553 is qualitatively similar to that ofseveral other radio afterglows. at the sub-arcsecond position provided by theradio detection, optical imaging reveals an extended r=24.9 mag object, whichwe identify as the host galaxy of grb 981226. afterglow models which invoke ajet-like geometry for the outflow or require an ambient medium with a radialdensity dependence, such as that produced by a wind from a massive star, areboth consistent with the radio data. furthermore, we show that the observedproperties of the radio afterglow can explain the absence of an opticaltransient without the need for large extinction local to the grb.

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.
