0902.0384	evidence for a non-uniform initial mass function in the local universe	many results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial massfunction (imf) is universal. our observations of hi selected galaxies in thelight of h-alpha and the far-ultraviolet (fuv) challenge this notion. the fluxratio h-alpha/fuv from these two star formation tracers shows strongcorrelations with the surface-brightness in h-alpha and the r band: low surfacebrightness (lsb) galaxies have lower ratios compared to high surface brightnessgalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models usingcommonly favored imf parameters. weaker but significant correlations ofh-alpha/fuv with luminosity, rotational velocity and dynamical mass are foundas well as a systematic trend with morphology. the correlated variations ofh-alpha/fuv with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family ofgalaxy scaling relations. the h-alpha/fuv correlations can not be due to dustcorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation historycan not explain the trends with both h-alpha and r surface brightness. lsbgalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photonsconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. the mostplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of theupper mass limit and/or slope of the imf at the upper end. we outline ascenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of theformation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars form. ourresults imply that the star formation rate measured in a galaxy is highlysensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. a non-universal imf also callsinto question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxiesand star formation histories derived from color magnitude diagrams. abridged.

0907.2416	properties and origin of the high-velocity gas toward the large  magellanic cloud	in the spectra of 139 early-type large magellanic cloud (lmc) stars observedwith fuse and with deep radio parkes hi 21-cm observations along those stars,we search for and analyze the absorption and emission from high-velocity gas at+90&lt;v&lt;+175 km/s. the hi column density of the high-velocity clouds (hvcs) alongthese sightlines ranges from &lt;10^18.4 to 10^19.2 cm^-2. the incidence of thehvc metal absorption is 70%, significantly higher than the hi emissionoccurrence of 32%. we find that the mean metallicity of the hvc is [oi/hi] =-0.51 (+0.12,-0.16). there is no strong evidence for a large variation in thehvc metallicity, implying that thes e hvcs have a similar origin and are partof the same complex. the mean and scatter of the hvc metallicities are moreconsistent with the present-day lmc oxygen abundance than that of the smallmagellanic cloud or the milky way. we find that on average [siii/oi] = +0.48(+0.15,- 0.25) and [feii/oi] = +0.33 (+0.14,-0.21), implying that the hvccomplex is dominantly ionized. the hvc complex has a multiphase structure witha neutral (oi, feii), weakly ionized (feii, nii), and highly ionized (ovi)components, and has evidence of dust but no molecules. all the observedproperties of the hvc can be explained by an energetic outflow from the lmc.this is the first example of a large (&gt;10^6 m_sun) hvc complex that is linkedto stellar feedback occurring in a dwarf spiral galaxy.

0908.1168	the second survey of the molecular clouds in the large magellanic cloud  by nanten. ii. star formation	we studied star formation activities in the molecular clouds in the largemagellanic cloud. we have utilized the second catalog of 272 molecular cloudsobtained by nanten to compare the cloud distribution with signatures of massivestar formation including stellar clusters, and optical and radio hii regions.we find that the molecular clouds are classified into three types according tothe activities of massive star formation; type i shows no signature of massivestar formation, type ii is associated with relatively small hii region(s) andtype iii with both hii region(s) and young stellar cluster(s). the radiocontinuum sources were used to confirm that type i gmcs do not host opticallyhidden hii regions. these signatures of massive star formation show a goodspatial correlation with the molecular clouds in a sense they are locatedwithin ~100 pc of the molecular clouds. among possible ideas to explain the gmctypes, we favor that the types indicate an evolutionary sequence; i.e., theyoungest phase is type i, followed by type ii and the last phase is type iii,where the most active star formation takes place leading to cloud dispersal.the number of the three types of gmcs should be proportional to the time scaleof each evolutionary stage if a steady state of massive star and clusterformation is a good approximation. by adopting the time scale of the youngeststellar clusters, 10 myrs, we roughly estimate the timescales of types i, iiand iii to be 6 myrs, 13 myrs and 7 myrs, respectively, corresponding to alifetime of 20-30 myrs for the gmcs with a mass above the completeness limit, 5x 10^4 msun.

0910.3610	high resolution x-ray imaging of supernova remnant 1987a	we report observations of the remnant of supernova 1987a with the highresolution camera (hrc) onboard the chandra x-ray observatory. a direct imagefrom the hrc resolves the annular structure of the x-ray remnant, confirmingthe morphology previously inferred by deconvolution of lower resolution datafrom the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer. detailed spatial modeling showsthat the a thin ring plus a thin shell gives statistically the best descriptionof the overall remnant structure, and suggests an outer radius 0.96" +/- 0.05"+/- 0.03" for the x-ray-emitting region, with the two uncertaintiescorresponding to the statistical and systematic errors, respectively. this isvery similar to the radius determined by a similar modeling technique for theradio shell at a comparable epoch, in contrast to previous claims that theremnant is 10-15% smaller at x-rays than in the radio band. the hrcobservations put a flux limit of 0.010 cts/s (99% confidence level, 0.08-10 kevrange) on any compact source at the remnant center. assuming the sameforeground neutral hydrogen column density as towards the remnant, this allowsus to rule out an unobscured neutron star with surface temperature t^\infty &gt;2.5mk observed at infinity, a bright pulsar wind nebula or a magnetar.

1303.4825	giant radio galaxies: i. intergalactic barometers	we present new wideband radio observations with the australia telescopecompact array of a sample of 12 giant radio galaxies. the radio observationsare part of a larger radio-optical study aimed at relating the radio structureswith the ambient medium on large scales. with projected linear sizes largerthan 0.7 mpc, these objects are ideal candidates for the study of the warm-hotintergalactic medium (whim). the sample includes sources with sizes spanning0.8 to 3.2 mpc and total powers of 1.2*10^24 to 4.0*10^26 w hz^-1 at 2.1 ghz.redshifts were limited to z&lt;0.15 to permit spectroscopic observations of thehosts and neighbouring galaxies, which were obtained using the aaomegaspectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. we derive lobe energy densitiesfrom the radio observations via equipartition arguments. the inferred pressuresin the lobes of the giant radio sources, which range from 1.1*10^-15 to2.0*10^-14 pa (80 to 1500 cm^-3 k), are lower than previously inferred fromx-ray observations of dense filaments. comparison with the overwhelmingly largesimulations (owls) suggests that the whim in pressure balance with the radiolobes has a temperature in excess of ~10^6.5 k or a particle overdensity in therange 50 to 500. this study highlights the capability of next generationsurveys, such as the evolutionary map of the universe (emu) survey with theaustralian square kilometre array pathfinder (askap), to study populations ofgiant radio sources at lower surface brightness and thereby discriminatebetween models for the cosmological evolution of the intergalactic medium andexamine the validity of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

1308.5054	b0707-359: a case study of change in agn-black hole spin axis	structures of radio galaxies have the potential to reveal inconstancy in theaxis of the beams, which reflect the stability in the spin axis of thesupermassive black hole at the centre. we present radio observations of thegiant radio galaxy b0707-359 whose structure offers an interesting case studyof an agn that may be exhibiting not only inconstancy in agn output but alsoinconstancy in direction of ejection axis. its radio morphology shows evidencefor a restarting of the jets accompanied by an axis change. the observedside-to-side asymmetries of this giant radio galaxy suggest that the new jetsare not in the plane of the sky. we infer that the hotspot advance velocitiesare unusually large and of magnitude a few-tenths of the speed of light. thedual-frequency radio images are consistent with a model where the beams fromthe central engine ceased, creating a relic double radio source; thisinterruption was accompanied by triggering of a movement of the axis of thecentral engine at a rate of a few degrees myr^-1. the closer location of thegiant radio galaxy axis to the host minor axis rather than the host major axisis supportive of the restarting and axis-change model for the formation of thedouble-double structure rather than the backflow model.

1310.3913	evolution of the radio remnant of supernova 1987a: morphological changes  from day 7000	we present radio imaging observations of supernova remnant 1987a at 9 ghz,taken with the australia telescope compact array over 21 years from 1992 to2013. by employing a fourier modeling technique to fit the visibility data, weshow that the remnant structure has evolved significantly since day 7000(mid-2006): the emission latitude has gradually decreased, such that theoverall geometry has become more similar to a ring structure. around the sametime, we find a decreasing trend in the east-west asymmetry of the surfaceemissivity. these results could reflect the increasing interaction of theforward shock with material around the circumstellar ring, and the relativeweakening of the interaction with the lower-density material at higherlatitudes. the morphological evolution caused an apparent break in the remnantexpansion measured with a torus model, from a velocity of 4600+150-200 km/sbetween day 4000 and 7000 to 2400+100-200 km/s after day 7000. however, weemphasize that there is no conclusive evidence for a physical slowing of theshock at any given latitude in the expanding remnant, and that a change ofradio morphology alone appears to dominate the evolution. this is supported byour ring-only fits which show a constant expansion of 3890+/-50 km/s withoutdeceleration between days 4000 and 9000. we suggest that once the emissionlatitude no longer decreases, the expansion velocity obtained from the torusmodel should return to the same value as that measured with the ring model.

1310.4408	radio observations of supernova 1987a	supernovae and their remnants are believed to be prodigious sources ofgalactic cosmic rays and interstellar dust. understanding the mechanisms behindtheir surprisingly high production rate is helped by the study of nearby youngsupernova remnants. there has been none better in modern times than sn1987a,for which radio observations have been made for over a quarter of a century. wereview extensive observations made with the australia telescope compact array(atca) at centimetre wavelengths. emission at frequencies from 1 to 100 ghz isdominated by synchrotron radiation from an outer shock front which has beengrowing exponentially in strength from day 3000, and is currently sweepingaround the circumstellar ring at about 4000 km s$^{-1}$. three dimensionalmodels of the propagation of the shock into the circumstellar medium are ableto reproduce the main observational features of the remnant, and theirevolution. we find that up to 4% of the electrons encountered by the shock areaccelerated to relativistic energies. high-frequency alma observations willbreak new ground in the understanding of dust and molecule production.

1310.4968	the radio remnant of supernova 1987a at high frequencies and high  resolution	as the remnant of supernova (sn) 1987a has been getting brighter over time,new observations at high frequencies have allowed imaging of the radio emissionat unprecedented detail. we present a new radio image at 44 ghz of thesupernova remnant (snr), derived from observations performed with the australiatelescope compact array (atca) in 2011. the diffraction-limited image has aresolution of $349\times225$ mas, which is the highest achieved to date inhigh-dynamic range images of the snr. we also present a new image at 18 ghz,also derived from atca observations performed in 2011, which is super-resolvedto $0./!/!^{\prime\prime}25$. the new 44 and 18 ghz images yield the firsthigh-resolution spectral index map of the remnant. the comparison of the 44 ghzimage with contemporaneous x-ray and h$\alpha$ observations allows furtherinvestigations of the nature of the remnant asymmetry and sheds more light intothe progenitor hypotheses and sn explosion. in light of simple free-freeabsorption models, we discuss the likelihood of detecting at 44 ghz thepossible emission originating from a pulsar wind nebula (pwn) or a compactsource in the centre of the remnant.

1404.6077	galactic interstellar turbulence in the southern sky seen through  spatial gradients of the polarization vector	radio synchrotron polarization maps of the galaxy can be used to infer theproperties of interstellar turbulence in the diffuse warm ionized medium (wim).in this paper, we investigate the spatial gradient of linearly polarizedsynchrotron emission ($|\nabla\textbf{p}|/|\textbf{p}|$) as a tracer ofturbulence, the relationship of the gradient to the sonic mach number of thewim, and changes in morphology of the gradient as a function of galacticposition in the southern sky. we use data from the s-band polarization all skysurvey (s-pass) to image the spatial gradient of the linearly polarizedsynchrotron emission ($|\nabla \textbf{p}|/|\textbf{p}|$) of the entiresouthern sky at $2.3$~ghz. the spatial gradient of linear polarization revealsrapid changes of the density and magnetic fluctuations in the wim due tomagnetic turbulence as a function of galactic position; we make comparisons ofthese data to ideal mhd numerical simulations. in order to constrain the sonicmach number ($m_{s}$), we apply a high order moments analysis to theobservations and to the simulated diffuse, isothermal ism with idealmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. we find that polarization gradient maps revealelongated structures, which we associate with turbulence in the ism. ouranalysis corroborates the view of a turbulent wim in a transonic regime$m_{s}\lesssim 2$. filamentary structures with typical widths down to theangular resolution are seen and the observed morphologies match closely withnumerical simulations and in some cases h$\alpha$ contours. the $|\nabla\textbf{p}|/|\textbf{p}|$ intensity is found to be approximately log-normaldistributed. no systematic variations of the sonic mach number are observed asa function of galactic coordinates, which is consistent with turbulence in thewim inferred by the analysis of h$\alpha$ data.

1409.4068	multi-dimensional simulations of the expanding supernova remnant of sn  1987a	the expanding remnant from sn 1987a is an excellent laboratory forinvestigating the physics of supernovae explosions. there are still a largenumber of outstanding questions, such the reason for the asymmetric radiomorphology, the structure of the pre-supernova environment, and the efficiencyof particle acceleration at the supernova shock. we explore these questionsusing three-dimensional simulations of the expanding remnant between days 820and 10,000 after the supernova. we combine a hydrodynamical simulation withsemi-analytic treatments of diffusive shock acceleration and magnetic fieldamplification to derive radio emission as part of an inverse problem.simulations show that an asymmetric explosion, combined with magnetic fieldamplification at the expanding shock, is able to replicate the persistentone-sided radio morphology of the remnant. we use an asymmetric truelove &amp;mckee progenitor with an envelope mass of $10 m_{\sun}$ and an energy of $1.5\times 10^{44} j$. a termination shock in the progenitor's stellar wind at adistance of $0\farcs43-0\farcs51$ provides a good fit to the turn on of radioemission around day 1200. for the h\textsc{ii} region, a minimum distance of$0\farcs63\pm0\farcs01$ and maximum particle number density of $(7.11\pm1.78)\times 10^7$ m$^{-3}$ produces a good fit to the evolving average radius andvelocity of the expanding shocks from day 2000 to day 7000 after explosion. themodel predicts a noticeable reduction, and possibly a temporary reversal, inthe asymmetric radio morphology of the remnant after day 7000, when the forwardshock left the eastern lobe of the equatorial ring.

1501.01048	the ska as a doorway to angular momentum	angular momentum is one of the most fundamental physical quantities governinggalactic evolution. differences in the colours, morphologies, star formationrates and gas fractions amongst galaxies of equal stellar/baryon mass m arepotentially widely explained by variations in their specific stellar/baryonangular momentum j. the enormous potential of angular momentum science is onlyjust being realised, thanks to the emergence of the first simulations ofgalaxies with converged spins, paralleled by a dramatic increase in kinematicobservations. such observations are still challenged by the fact that most ofthe stellar/baryon angular momentum resides at large radii. in fact, the radiusthat maximally contributes to the angular momentum of an exponential disk(3re-4re) is twice as large as the radius that maximally contributes to thedisk mass; thus converged measurements of angular momentum require eitherextremely deep ifs data or, alternatively, kinematic measurements of neutralatomic hydrogen (hi), which naturally resides at the large disk radii thatdominate the angular momentum. the ska has a unique opportunity to become theworld-leading facility for angular momentum studies due to its ability tomeasure the resolved and/or global hi kinematics in very large andwell-characterised galaxy samples. these measurements will allow, for example,(1) a very robust determination of the two-dimensional distribution of galaxiesin the (m,j)-plane, (2) the largest, systematic measurement of the relationshipbetween m, j, and tertiary galaxy properties, and (3) the most accuratemeasurement of the large-scale distribution and environmental dependence ofangular momentum vectors, both in terms of norm and orientation. all thesemeasurements will represent exquisite tools to build a next generation ofgalaxy evolution models.

1501.01077	observations of the intergalactic medium and the cosmic web in the ska  era	the interaction of galaxies with their environment, the intergalactic medium(igm), is an important aspect of galaxy formation. one of the most fundamental,but unanswered questions in the evolution of galaxies is how gas circulates inand around galaxies and how it enters the galaxies to support star formation.we have several lines of evidence that the observed evolution of star formationrequires gas accretion from the igm at all times and on all cosmic scales. thisgas remains largely unaccounted for and the outstanding questions are wherethis gas resides and what the physical mechanisms of accretion are. the gas isexpected to be embedded in an extended cosmic web made of sheets and filaments.such large-scale filaments of gas are expected by cosmological numericalsimulations, which have made significant progress in recent years. suchsimulations do not only model the large scale structure of the cosmic web, butalso investigate the neutral gas component. to truly make significant progressin understanding the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the igm, columndensities of nhi=10^18 cm-2 and below have to be probed over large areas on thesky at sub-arcminute resolution. these are the densities of the fainteststructures known today around nearby galaxies, though mostly found with singledish telescopes which do not have the resolution to resolve these structuresand investigate any kinematics. existing interferometers lack the collectingpower or short baselines to achieve brightness sensitivities typically belownhi=10^19 cm-2. reaching lower column densities with current facilities isfeasible, however requires prohibitively long observing times. the ska will forthe first time break these barriers, enabling interferometric observations anorder of magnitude deeper than current interferometers and with an order ofmagnitude better linear resolution than single-dish telescopes.

1502.06296	a radio-polarisation and rotation measure study of the gum nebula and  its environment	the gum nebula is 36 degree wide shell-like emission nebula at a distance ofonly 450 pc. it has been hypothesised to be an old supernova remnant, fossilhii region, wind-blown bubble, or combination of multiple objects. here weinvestigate the magneto-ionic properties of the nebula using data from recentsurveys: radio-continuum data from the nrao vla and s-band parkes all skysurveys, and h-alpha data from the southern h-alpha sky survey atlas. we modelthe upper part of the nebula as a spherical shell of ionised gas expanding intothe ambient medium. we perform a maximum-likelihood markov chain monte-carlofit to the nvss rotation measure data, using the h-halpha data to constrainaverage electron density in the shell $n_e$. assuming a latitudinal backgroundgradient in rm we find $n_e=1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.4} {\rm cm}^{-3}$, angular radius$\phi_{\rm outer}=22.7^{+0.1}_{-0.1} {\rm deg}$, shell thickness$dr=18.5^{+1.5}_{-1.4} {\rm pc}$, ambient magnetic field strength$b_0=3.9^{+4.9}_{-2.2} \mu{\rm g}$ and warm gas filling factor$f=0.3^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$. we constrain the local, small-scale (~260 pc)pitch-angle of the ordered galactic magnetic field to$+7^{\circ}\lesssim\wp\lesssim+44^{\circ}$, which represents a significantdeviation from the median field orientation on kiloparsec scales(~-7.2$^{\circ}$). the moderate compression factor $x=6.0\,^{+5.1}_{-2.5}$ atthe edge of the h-alpha shell implies that the 'old supernova remnant' originis unlikely. our results support a model of the nebula as a hii region around awind-blown bubble. analysis of depolarisation in 2.3 ghz s-pass data isconsistent with this hypothesis and our best-fitting values agree well withprevious studies of interstellar bubbles.

1505.03622	from star-forming galaxies to agn: the global hi content from a stacking  experiment	we study the atomic neutral hydrogen (hi) content of $\sim$1600 galaxies upto $z \sim 0.1$ using stacking techniques. the observations were carried outwith the westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) in the area of the sdsssouth galactic cap (ssgc), where we selected a galaxy sample from the sdssspectroscopic catalog. multi-wavelength information is provided by sdss, nvss,galex, and wise. we use the collected information to study hi trends withcolor, star-forming, and active galactic nuclei (agn) properties.  using nuv-r colors, galaxies are divided into blue cloud, green valley andred sequence galaxies. as expected based on previous observations, we detect hiin green valley objects with lower amounts of hi than blue galaxies, whilestacking only produces a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit for red galaxies with m$_{\rmhi}$ $&lt;$ (5 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$ and m$_{\rm hi}/\rm{l}_r$$&lt;$ 0.02 $\pm$ 0.006 $\rm m_{\odot} / \rm l_{\odot} $. we find that the hicontent is more dependent on nuv-r color, and less on ionization properties, inthe sense that regardless of the presence of an optical agn (based on opticalionization line diagnostics), green-valley galaxies always show hi, whereas redgalaxies only produce an upper limit. this suggests that feedback from opticalagn is not the (main) reason for depleting large-scale gas reservoirs.  low-level radio continuum emission in our galaxies can stem either from starformation, or from agn. we use the wise color-color plot to separate thesephenomena by dividing the sample into ir late-type and ir early-type galaxies.we find that the radio emission in ir late-type galaxies stems from enhancedstar formation, and this group is detected in hi. however, ir early-typegalaxies lack any sign of hi gas and star formation activity, suggesting thatradio agn are likely to be the source of radio emission in this population.

0805.4195	fourier modeling of the radio torus surrounding supernova 1987a	we present detailed fourier modeling of the radio remnant of supernova 1987a,using high-resolution 9 ghz and 18 ghz data taken with the australia telescopecompact array over the period 1992 to 2008. we develop a parameterizedthree-dimensional torus model for the expanding radio shell, in which theemission is confined to an inclined equatorial belt; our model alsoincorporates both a correction for light travel-time effects and an overalleast-west gradient in the radio emissivity. by deriving an analytic expressionfor the two-dimensional fourier transform of the projected three-dimensionalbrightness distribution, we can fit our spatial model directly to theinterferometric visibility data. this provides robust estimates to the radiomorphology at each epoch. the best-fit results suggest a constant remnantexpansion at 4000 +/- 400 km/s over the 16-year period covered by theobservations. the model fits also indicate substantial mid-latitude emission,extending to 40 degree on either side of the equatorial plane. this likelycorresponds to the extra-planar structure seen in h$\alpha$ and ly$\alpha$emission from the supernova reverse shock, and broadly supports hydrodynamicmodels in which the complex circumstellar environment was produced by aprogression of interacting winds from the progenitor. our model quantifies theclear asymmetry seen in the radio images: we find that the eastern half of theradio remnant is consistently ~40 brighter than the western half at all epochs,which may result from an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution between these twohemispheres.

0807.1532	a radio and optical polarization study of the magnetic field in the  small magellanic cloud	we present a study of the magnetic field of the small magellanic cloud (smc),carried out using radio faraday rotation and optical starlight polarizationdata. consistent negative rotation measures (rms) across the smc indicate thatthe line-of-sight magnetic field is directed uniformly away from us with astrength 0.19 +/- 0.06 microgauss. applying the chandrasekhar-fermi method tostarlight polarization data yields an ordered magnetic field in the plane ofthe sky of strength 1.6 +/- 0.4 microgauss oriented at a position angle 4 +/-12 degs, measured counter-clockwise from the great circle on the sky joiningthe smc to the large magellanic cloud (lmc). we construct a three-dimensionalmagnetic field model of the smc, under the assumption that the rms andstarlight polarization probe the same underlying large-scale field. the vectordefining the overall orientation of the smc magnetic field shows a potentialalignment with the vector joining the center of the smc to the center of thelmc, suggesting the possibility of a "pan-magellanic'' magnetic field. acosmic-ray driven dynamo is the most viable explanation of the observed fieldgeometry, but has difficulties accounting for the observed uni-directionalfield lines. a study of faraday rotation through the magellanic bridge isneeded to further test the pan-magellanic field hypothesis.

astro-ph;0005267	an extragalactic hi cloud with no optical counterpart?	we report the discovery, from the hi parkes all-sky survey (hipass), of anisolated cloud of neutral hydrogen which we believe to be extragalactic. the himass of the cloud (hipass j1712-64) is very low, 1.7 x 10^7 msun, using anestimated distance of ~3.2 mpc. most significantly, we have found no opticalcompanion to this object to very faint limits (mu(b)~ 27 mag arcsec^-2). hipassj1712-64 appears to be a binary system similar to, but much less massive than,hi 1225+01 (the virgo hi cloud) and has a size of at least 15 kpc. the meanvelocity dispersion, measured with the australia telescope compact array(atca), is only 4 km/s for the main component and because of the weak ornon-existent star-formation, possibly reflects the thermal linewidth (t&lt;2000 k)rather than bulk motion or turbulence. the peak column density for hipassj1712-64, from the combined parkes and atca data, is only 3.5 x 10^19 cm^-2,which is estimated to be a factor of two below the critical threshold for starformation. apart from its significantly higher velocity, the properties ofhipass j1712-64 are similar to the recently recognised class of compact highvelocity clouds. we therefore consider the evidence for a local group orgalactic origin, although a more plausible alternative is that hipass j1712-64was ejected from the interacting magellanic cloud/galaxy system atperigalacticon ~ 2 x 10^8 yr ago.

astro-ph;0209523	detection of carbon monoxide within the magellanic bridge	the mopra 22m and sest 15m telescopes have been used to detect and partiallymap a region of 12co(1-0) line emission within the magellanic bridge, a regionlying between the large and small magellanic clouds. the emission appears to beembedded in a cloud of neutral hydrogen, and is in the vicinity of an irassource. the co emission region is found to have a 60um/100um flux density ratiotypical for 12co(1-0) detections within the smc, although it has asignificantly lower 12co brightness and velocity width. these suggest that theobserved region is of a low metallicity, supporting earlier findings that themagellanic bridge is not as evolved as the smc and magellanic stream, which arethemselves of a lower metallicity than the galaxy. our observations, along withempirical models based on smc observations, indicate that the radius of thedetected co region has an upper limit of ~16 pc. this detection is, to ourknowledge, the first detection of co emission from the magellanic bridge and isthe only direct evidence of star formation through molecular cloud collapse inthis region.

astro-ph;0505591	the hipass catalogue: iii - optical counterparts &amp; isolated dark  galaxies	we present the largest catalogue to date of optical counterparts for hiradio-selected galaxies, hopcat. of the 4315 hi radio-detected sources from thehi parkes all sky survey (hipass) catalogue, we find optical counterparts for3618 (84%) galaxies. of these, 1798 (42%) have confirmed optical velocities and848 (20%) are single matches without confirmed velocities. some galaxy matchesare members of galaxy groups. from these multiple galaxy matches, 714 (16%)have confirmed optical velocities and a further 258 (6%) galaxies are withoutconfirmed velocities. for 481 (11%), multiple galaxies are present but nosingle optical counterpart can be chosen and 216 (5%) have no obvious opticalgalaxy present. most of these 'blank fields' are in crowded fields along thegalactic plane or have high extinctions.  isolated 'dark galaxy' candidates are investigated using an extinction cut ofabj &lt; 1 mag and the blank fields category. of the 3692 galaxies with an abjextinction &lt; 1 mag, only 13 are also blank fields. of these, 12 are eliminatedeither with follow-up parkes observations or are in crowded fields. theremaining one has a low surface brightness optical counterpart. hence, noisolated optically dark galaxies have been found within the limits of thehipass survey.

astro-ph;0506224	a neutral hydrogen survey of the large magellanic cloud: aperture  synthesis and multibeam data combined	using a fourier-plane technique, we have merged hi atca and parkes data setsproviding an accurate set of images of the lmc sensitive to structure on scalesof 15 pc (for an lmc distance of 55 kpc) upwards. the spatial dynamic range(2.8 orders of magnitude), velocity resolution (1.649 km/s), brightnesstemperature sensitivity (2.4 k) and column density sensitivity ($8.9 \times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ per 1.649 km/s channel) allow for the studies of phenomenaranging from the galaxy-wide interaction of the lmc with its close neighboursto the small-scale injection of energy from supernovae and stellar associationsinto the ism of the lmc. we find that a previous analysis of the holes andshells (kim et al. 1999) in the hi distribution shows the same power- lawbehavior with that of clumps. the measured perimeter p and measured enclosedarea a of each hi cloud in a log-log plot give us a set of points lying alongwith a slope of d/2 = 0.73 $\pm$ 0.1. the relation between area and perimeterof each identified hi cloud, p $\propto$ $a^{d/2}$, can determine the fractaldimension d=1.47 $\pm$ 0.2 of a cloud boundary (vogelaar &amp; wakker 1994;williams, blitz, &amp; mckee 2000). the measured fractal dimension of hi clouds inthe lmc is similar to the dimension, d=1.4, found in many studies of themolecular ism.

astro-ph;0506475	imaging of the radio remnant of sn 1987a at 12 mm wavelength	observations of the radio remnant of supernova 1987a using the australiatelescope compact array in the 12-mm band on 2003 july 31 (day 6002.7 after theexplosion) give the first fully resolved radio image of the supernova remnant.the diffraction-limited image has a resolution of about 0.45 arcsec, a factorof two better than that of the 3-cm images previously obtained. there isexcellent agreement between the 12-mm image and a contemporaneoussuper-resolved 3-cm image. super-resolution of the 12-mm image gives a furtherfactor of two improvement in resolution, to 0.25 arcsec, albeit with limiteddynamic range. while the spatial distributions of the radio and x-ray emissionare broadly similar, there are significant differences in detail with nocorrespondence in the regions of brightest emission. the 12-mm image is wellmodelled by a thick equatorial ring inclined at 43 deg to the line of sight.this, together with the common east-west asymmetry and the relatively steadyincrease in the radio flux density, suggests that the reverse shock is the mainsite for generation of the radio emission.

astro-ph;0602380	a multi-resolution analysis of the radio-fir correlation in the large  magellanic cloud	we investigate the local correlation betwen the 1.4 ghz radio continuum and60 micron far-infrared (fir) emission within the large magellanic cloud (lmc)on spatial scales between 0.05 and 1.5 kpc. on scales below ~1 kpc, theradio-fir correlation is clearly better than the correlation of the cold gastracers with either the radio or the fir emission. for the lmc as a whole,there is a tight correlation between the radio and fir emission on spatialscales above ~50 pc. by decomposing the radio emission into thermal andnon-thermal components, however, we show that the scale on which the radio-fircorrelation breaks down is inversely proportional to the thermal fraction ofthe radio emission: regions that show a strong correlation to very small scalesare the same regions where the thermal fraction of the radio emission is high.contrary to previous studies of the local radio-fir correlation in the lmc, weshow that the slope of the relation between the radio and fir emission isnon-linear. in bright star-forming regions, the radio emission increases fasterthan linearly with respect to the fir emission (power-law slope of ~1.2),whereas a flatter slope of ~0.6-0.9 applies more generally across the lmc. ourresults are consistent with a scenario in which the uv photons and cosmic raysin the lmc have a common origin in massive star formation, but the cosmic raysare able to diffuse away from their production sites. our results do notprovide direct evidence for coupling between the magnetic field and the localgas density, but we note that synchrotron emission may not be a good tracer ofthe magnetic field if cosmic rays can readily escape the lmc.

astro-ph;0602571	neutral hydrogen clouds near early-type dwarf galaxies of the local  group	parkes neutral hydrogen 21 cm line (hi) observations of the surroundings of 9early-type local group dwarfs are presented. we detected numerous hi clouds inthe general direction of those dwarfs and these clouds are often offset fromthe optical center of the galaxies. although all the observed dwarfs, exceptantlia, occupy phase-space regions where the high-velocity cloud (hvc) densityis well above average, the measured offsets are smaller than one would expectfrom a fully random cloud distribution. possible association is detected for 11of the 16 investigated clouds, while, for two galaxies, sextans and leo i, nohi was detected. the galaxies where hi clouds were found not to coincide withthe optical, yet have a significant probability of being associated are:sculptor dsph, tucanna, lgs3, cetus, and fornax. if the clouds are indeedassociated, these galaxies have hi masses of $m_{hi} = 2\times10^5 m_{\odot}$,$m_{hi} = 2\times10^6 m_{\odot}$, $m_{hi} = 7\times10^5 m_{\odot}$, $m_{hi} =7\times10^5 m_{\odot}$, and $m_{hi} = 1\times10^5 m_{\odot}$, respectively.however, neither ram pressure nor tidal stripping can easily explain theoffsets. in some cases, large offsets are found where ram pressure should bethe least effective.

astro-ph;0604108	a massive spiral galaxy in the zone of avoidance	we report the discovery of a very hi-massive disk galaxy, hizoa j0836-43, ata velocity of v_hel = 10689 km/s, corresponding to a distance of 148 mpc(assuming h_0=75 km/s/mpc). it was found during the course of a systematic hisurvey of the southern zone of avoidance (|b| &lt; 5 deg) with the multibeamsystem at the 64m parkes radio telescope. follow-up observations with theaustralia telescope compact array (atca) reveal an extended hi disk. we derivean hi mass of 7.5 x 10^10 msun. using the hi radius, we estimate a totaldynamical mass of 1.4 x 10^12 msun, similar to the most massive known diskgalaxies such as malin 1. hizoa j0836-43 lies deep in the zone of avoidance (l,b = 262.48 deg, -1.64 deg) where the optical extinction is very high, a_b =9.8. however, in the near-infrared wavebands, where the extinction isconsiderably lower, hizoa j0836-43 is clearly detected by both denis and 2mass.deep aat near-infrared (ks and h-band) images show that hizoa j0836-43 is aninclined disk galaxy with a prominent bulge (scale length 2.5 arcsec or 1.7kpc), and an extended disk (scale length 7 arcsec or 4.7 kpc) which can betraced along the major axis out to a radius of 20 arcsec or 13.4 kpc (at 20mag/arcsec^2 in ks). the hi disk is much more extended, having a radius of 66kpc at 1 msun/pc^2. detections in the radio continuum at 1.4 ghz and at 60micron (iras) are consistent with hizoa j0836-43 forming stars at a rate of ~35msun/yr. we compare the properties of hizoa j0836-43 with those of the mosthi-massive galaxies currently known, ugc 4288, ugc 1752 and malin 1, all ofwhich are classified as giant low surface brightness galaxies.

astro-ph;0604442	the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies- ii. the star  formation rate density of the local universe	we derive observed halpha and r band luminosity densities of an hi-selectedsample of nearby galaxies using the singg sample to be l_halpha' = (9.4 +/-1.8)e38 h_70 erg s^-1 mpc^-3 for halpha and l_r' = (4.4 +/- 0.7)e37 h_70 ergs^-1 a^-1 mpc^-3 in the r band. this r band luminosity density is approximately70% of that found by the sloan digital sky survey. this leads to a local starformation rate density of log(sfrd) = -1.80 +0.13/-0.07(random) +/-0.03(systematic) + log(h_70) after applying a mean internal extinctioncorrection of 0.82 magnitudes. the gas cycling time of this sample is found tobe t_gas = 7.5 +1.3/-2.1 gyr, and the volume-averaged equivalent width of thesingg galaxies is ew(halpha) = 28.8 +7.2/-4.7 a (21.2 +4.2/-3.5 a withoutinternal dust correction). as with similar surveys, these results imply thatsfrd(z) decreases drastically from z ~ 1.5 to the present. a comparison of thedynamical masses of the singg galaxies evaluated at their optical limits withtheir stellar and hi masses shows significant evidence of downsizing: the mostmassive galaxies have a larger fraction of their mass locked up in starscompared with hi, while the opposite is true for less massive galaxies. we showthat the application of the kennicutt star formation law to a galaxy having themedian orbital time at the optical limit of this sample results in a starformation rate decay with cosmic time similar to that given by the sfrd(z)evolution. this implies that the sfrd(z) evolution is primarily due to thesecular evolution of galaxies, rather than interactions or mergers. this isconsistent with the morphologies predominantly seen in the singg sample.

astro-ph;0604444	the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies: i. description and  initial results	we introduce the survey for ionization in neutral gas galaxies (singg), acensus of star formation in hi-selected galaxies. the survey consists ofh-alpha and r-band imaging of a sample of 468 galaxies selected from the hiparkes all sky survey (hipass). the sample spans three decades in hi mass andis free of many of the biases that affect other star forming galaxy samples. wepresent the criteria for sample selection, list the entire sample, discuss ourobservational techniques, and describe the data reduction and calibrationmethods. this paper focuses on 93 singg targets whose observations have beenfully reduced and analyzed to date. the majority of these show a singleemission line galaxy (elg). we see multiple elgs in 13 fields, with up to fourelgs in a single field. all of the targets in this sample are detected inh-alpha indicating that dormant (non-star forming) galaxies with m(hi) &gt; ~3e7m_sun are very rare. a database of the measured global properties of the elgsis presented. the elg sample spans four orders of magnitude in luminosity(h-alpha and r-band), and h-alpha surface brightness, nearly three orders ofmagnitude in r surface brightness and nearly two orders of magnitude in h-alphaequivalent width (ew). the surface brightness distribution of our sample isbroader than that of the sloan digital sky survey spectroscopic sample, the(ew) distribution is broader than prism-selected samples, and the morphologiesfound include all common types of star forming galaxies (e.g. irregular,spiral, blue compact dwarf, starbursts, merging and colliding systems, and evenresidual star formation in s0 and sa spirals).

astro-ph;0703279	an hi survey of six local group analogs: i. survey description and the  search for high-velocity clouds	we have conducted an hi 21 cm emission-line survey using the parkes 20cmmultibeam instrument and the australia telescope compact array (atca) of sixloose groups of galaxies chosen to be analogs to the local group. the goal ofthis survey is to make a census of the hi-rich galaxies and high-velocityclouds (hvcs) within these groups and compare these populations with those inthe local group. the parkes observations covered the entire volume of eachgroup with a rms m(hi) sensitivity of 4-10x10^5 m(sun) per 3.3 km/s channel.all potential sources detected in the parkes data were confirmed with atcaobservations at ~2' resolution and the same m(sun) sensitivity. all theconfirmed sources have associated stellar counterparts; no starless hiclouds--hvc analogs--were found in the six groups. in this paper, we present adescription of the survey parameters, its sensitivity and completeness. usingthe population of compact hvcs (chvcs) around the milky way as a templatecoupled with the detailed knowledge of our survey parameters, we infer that ournon-detection of chvc analogs implies that, if similar populations exist in thesix groups studied, the chvcs must be clustered within 90 kpc of groupgalaxies, with average m(hi) &lt; 4x10^5 m(sun) at the 95% confidence level. thecorollary is that the same must apply to milky way chvcs. this is consistentwith our previous results from a smaller sample of groups, and in accordancewith recent observational and theoretical constraints from other authors. theseresults confirm that there is very little neutral matter around galaxies, andthat any substantial reservoir of baryons must be in other phases.

astro-ph;9612234	the asymmetric radio remnant of sn 1987a	we present seven years of radio observations of sn 1987a made with theaustralia telescope compact array. at 1.4, 2.4, 4.8 and 8.6 ghz, the fluxdensity of the radio remnant has increased monotonically since emission wasredetected 1200 days after the explosion. on day 3200, the remnant wasexpanding at 2800 +/- 400 km/s, which we interpret as indicating significantdeceleration of the fastest moving ejecta. since day 1787 the spectral indexhas remained constant at alpha = -0.95 +/- 0.04. these observations are allconsistent with the shock having encountered a denser, shocked, component ofthe progenitor's stellar wind. at the current rate of expansion, the shock isexpected to encounter the inner optical ring in the year 2006 +/- 3.  using super-resolution, we have also obtained 9 ghz images of the remnant(resolution approx 0".5) at four epochs. the emission is distributed around therim of a near-circular shell, but has become increasingly asymmetric with time.there are two "hotspots" to the east and west, aligned along the major axis ofthe optical ring. this morphology is most likely indicative of an axisymmetriccircumstellar medium into which the shock is expanding, consistent with presentunderstanding of the progenitor star and its environment.

astro-ph;9808023	the disruption of nearby galaxies by the milky way	interactions between galaxies are common and are an important factor indetermining their physical properties such as position along the hubblesequence and star-formation rate. there are many possible galaxy interactionmechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression,gravitational interaction and cluster tides. the relative importance of thesemechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly knownparameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halosthat surround galaxies. a nearby example of a galaxy interaction where themechanism is controversial is that between our own galaxy and two of itsneighbours -- the large and small magellanic clouds. here we present the firstresults of a new hi survey which provides a spectacular view of thisinteraction. in addition to the previously known magellanic stream, whichtrails 100 degrees behind the clouds, the new data reveal a counter-streamwhich lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the clouds. thisresult supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streamsare tidally torn from the body of the magellanic clouds.
