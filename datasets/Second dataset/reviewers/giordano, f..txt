0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.1625	abell 611. ii. x-ray and strong lensing analyses	we present the results of our analyses of the x-ray emission and of thestrong lensing systems in the relaxed galaxy cluster abell 611 (z=0.288). weinfer the x-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles ofthe intra-cluster medium within the radius r ~ 700 kpc through a non-parametricapproach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adoptinga matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of abell611 via the x-ray data. we derive the total projected mass in the centralregion of abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensingfeatures through the publicly available analysis software lenstool. as a finalstep we compare the results obtained with both methods. we derive a goodagreement between the x-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in thecentral region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginaldisagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating thestrong lensing results in the outer spatial range. we suggest that in this casethe x-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrectestimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of thedark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different masscomponents in the strong lensing analysis. we discuss the effect of somepossible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. we find a slightdependence of the measurements of the x-ray temperatures (and therefore of thex-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, withtotal deviations on the value of m_200 of the order of the 1-sigma statisticalerror. the strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to theparameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, inparticular to the modelling of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg) baryoniccomponent.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1008.3996	measurement of azimuthal asymmetries associated with deeply virtual  compton scattering on a longitudinally polarized deuterium target	azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of a real photon from alongitudinally polarized deuterium target are measured with respect to targetpolarization alone and with respect to target polarization combined with beamhelicity and/or beam charge. the asymmetries appear in the distribution of thereal photons in the azimuthal angle $\phi$ around the virtual photon direction,relative to the lepton scattering plane. the asymmetries arise from the deeplyvirtual compton scattering process and its interference with the bethe-heitlerprocess. the results for the beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries from atensor polarized deuterium target with vanishing vector polarization are shownto be compatible with those from an unpolarized deuterium target, which isexpected for incoherent scattering dominant at larger momentum transfer.furthermore, the results for the single target-spin asymmetry and for thedouble-spin asymmetry are found to be compatible with the correspondingasymmetries previously measured on a hydrogen target. for coherent scatteringon the deuteron at small momentum transfer to the target, these findings implythat the tensor contribution to the cross section is small. furthermore, thetensor asymmetry is found to be compatible with zero.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1107.4302	implications for the structure of the relativistic jet from  multiwavelength observations of ngc 6251	ngc 6251 is a luminous radio galaxy ~104 mpc away that was detectedsignificantly with the fermi gamma-ray space telescope, and before that withegret (onboard the compton gamma-ray observatory). different observationalconstraints favor a nuclear origin for the gamma-ray emission. here we presenta study of the spectral energy distribution (sed) of the core of ngc 6251, andgive results of modeling in the one-zone synchrotron/ssc framework. the sscmodel provides a good description of the radio to gamma-ray emission but, asfor other misaligned sources, predicts a lower lorentz factor (\gamma~2.4) thantypically found when modeling blazars. if the blazar unification scenario iscorrect, this seems to point to the presence of at least two emitting regionsin these objects, one with a higher and one with a lower lorentz factor. thesolution of a structured jet, with a fast moving spine surrounded by a slowlayer, is explored and the consequences of the two models for the jetenergetics and evolution are discussed.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.6285	constraints on cosmic-ray efficiency in the supernova remnant rcw 86  using multi-wavelength observations	several young supernova remnants (snrs) have recently been detected in thehigh-energy and very-high-energy gamma-ray domains. as exemplified by rxj1713.7-3946, the nature of this emission has been hotly debated, and directevidence for the efficient acceleration of cosmic-ray protons at the snr shocksstill remains elusive. we analyzed more than 40 months of data acquired by thelarge area telescope (lat) on-board the fermi gamma-ray space telescope in thehe domain, and gathered all of the relevant multi-wavelength (from radio to vhegamma-rays) information about the broadband nonthermal emission from rcw 86.for this purpose, we re-analyzed the archival x-ray data from the asca/gasimaging spectrometer (gis), the xmm-newton/epic-mos, and the rxte/proportionalcounter array (pca). beyond the expected galactic diffuse background, nosignificant gamma-ray emission in the direction of rcw 86 is detected in any ofthe 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 gev fermi-lat maps. in the hadronic scenario, thederived he upper limits together with the hess measurements in the vhe domaincan only be accommodated by a spectral index gamma &lt;= 1.8, i.e. a valuein-between the standard (test-particle) index and the asymptotic limit oftheoretical particle spectra in the case of strongly modified shocks. theinterpretation of the gamma-ray emission by inverse compton scattering of highenergy electrons reproduces the multi-wavelength data using a reasonable valuefor the average magnetic field of 15-25 mug. for these two scenarios, weassessed the level of acceleration efficiency. we discuss these results in thelight of existing estimates of the magnetic field strength, the effectivedensity and the acceleration efficiency in rcw 86.

1505.03102	bose-einstein correlations in hadron-pairs from lepto-production on  nuclei ranging from hydrogen to xenon	bose-einstein correlations of like-sign charged hadrons produced indeep-inelastic electron and positron scattering are studied in the hermesexperiment using nuclear targets of $^1$h, $^2$h, $^3$he, $^4$he, n, ne, kr,and xe. a gaussian approach is used to parametrize a two-particle correlationfunction determined from events with at least two charged hadrons of the samesign charge. this correlation function is compared to two different empiricaldistributions that do not include the bose-einstein correlations. onedistribution is derived from unlike-sign hadron pairs, and the second isderived from mixing like-sign pairs from different events. the extractionprocedure used simulations incorporating the experimental setup in order tocorrect the results for spectrometer acceptance effects, and was tested usingthe distribution of unlike-sign hadron pairs. clear signals of bose-einsteincorrelations for all target nuclei without a significant variation with thenuclear target mass are found. also, no evidence for a dependence on theinvariant mass w of the photon-nucleon system is found when the results arecompared to those of previous experiments.

1509.01979	infn camera demonstrator for the cherenkov telescope array	the cherenkov telescope array is a world-wide project for a new generation ofground-based cherenkov telescopes of the imaging class with the aim ofexploring the highest energy region of the electromagnetic spectrum. with twoplanned arrays, one for each hemisphere, it will guarantee a good sky coveragein the energy range from a few tens of gev to hundreds of tev, with improvedangular resolution and a sensitivity in the tev energy region better by oneorder of magnitude than the currently operating arrays. in order to cover thiswide energy range, three different telescope types are envisaged, withdifferent mirror sizes and focal plane features. in particular, for the highestenergies a possible design is a dual-mirror schwarzschild-couder opticalscheme, with a compact focal plane. a silicon photomultiplier (sipm) basedcamera is being proposed as a solution to match the dimensions of the pixel(angular size of ~ 0.17 degrees). infn is developing a camera demonstrator madeby 9 photo sensor modules (psms, 64 pixels each, with total coverage 1/4 of thefocal plane) equipped with fbk (fondazione bruno kessler, italy) nearultraviolet high fill factor sipms and front-end electronics (fee) based on atarget 7 asic, a 16 channels fast sampler (up to 2gs/s) with deep buffer,self-trigger and on-demand digitization capabilities specifically developed forthis purpose. the pixel dimensions of $6\times6$ mm$^2$ lead to a very compactdesign with challenging problems of thermal dissipation. a modular structure,made by copper frames hosting one psm and the corresponding fee, has beenconceived, with a water cooling system to keep the required workingtemperature. the actual design, the adopted technical solutions and theachieved results for this demonstrator are presented and discussed.

1510.00004	search for extended gamma-ray emission from the virgo galaxy cluster  with fermi-lat	galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (dm)annihilation signals. depending on the substructure of the dm halo of a galaxycluster and the cross sections for dm annihilation channels, these signalsmight be detectable by the latest generation of $\gamma$-ray telescopes. herewe use three years of fermi large area telescope (lat) data, which are the mostsuitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearbyvirgo galaxy cluster. our analysis reveals statistically significant extendedemission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profilewith a radius of 3\deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. wedemonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends onthe adopted interstellar emission model (iem) and is most likely an artifact ofour incomplete description of the iem in this region. we also search for andfind new point source candidates in the region. we then derive conservativeupper limits on the velocity-averaged dm pair annihilation cross section fromvirgo. we take into account the potential $\gamma$-ray flux enhancement due todm sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. for dmannihilating into $b\overline{b}$, assuming a conservative sub-halo modelsetup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above theexpectation from the thermal cross section for$m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim100\,\mathrm{gev}$. in a more optimistic scenario, weexclude $\langle \sigma v \rangle\sim3\times10^{-26}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$for $m_{\mathrm{dm}}\lesssim40\,\mathrm{gev}$ for the same channel. finally, wederive upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-rayinteractions in the inter cluster medium. we find that the volume-averagedcosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than $\sim6\%$.

1512.05053	leading-order determination of the gluon polarisation using a novel  method	a re-evaluation of the gluon polarisation $\delta g/g$ in the nucleon ispresented, which is based on the measurement of the longitudinal double-spinasymmetry using semi-inclusive events with photon virtuality $q^2&gt;1~({\rmgev}/c)^2$. the data were obtained by the compass experiment at cern using a160 gev/$c$ polarised muon beam scattering off a polarised $^6$lid target. thegluon polarisation is evaluated for three intervals of the nucleon momentumfraction carried by gluons, $x_{\rm g}$, covering the range $0.04 \!&lt;\! x_{ \rmg}\! &lt;\! 0.28$ . a novel method covering the full range in hadron transversemomentum $p_{\rm t}$ and a neural network approach are used. the valuesobtained at leading order in pqcd do not show any significant dependence on$x_{\rm g}$. averaged over the three intervals, the result is $\langle \deltag/g \rangle = 0.113 \pm 0.038_{\rm (stat.)}\pm 0.036_{\rm (syst.)}$ at $\langlex_{\rm g} \rangle \approx 0.10$ and a hard scale of $\mu^2= \langle q^2 \rangle= 3 ({\rm gev}/c)^2$. the obtained result suggests that the gluon polarisationis positive in the measured $x_{\rm g}$ range.

astro-ph;0701853	structure and evolution of magnetized clusters: entropy profiles, s-t  and l_x-t relations	we study the impact of an intracluster magnetic field on the main structuralproperties of clusters and groups of galaxies: the radial density and entropyprofiles, the s-t relation and the l_x-t relation for groups and clusters ofgalaxies. to this aim, we develop a description of the intra-cluster gas basedon the hydrostatic equilibrium condition and on the magnetic virial theorem inthe presence of a radial distribution of the magnetic field b(r)=b_* \times[\rho_g(r)]^alpha, with alpha \sim 0.9, as indicated by observations andnumerical simulation. our analysis shows that such a description is able toprovide a possible explanation of three problematic aspects of the clusterstructure: i) the flattening of the entropy profile in the cluster center; ii)the flatness of the s-t relation; iii) the increasing steepening of the l_x-trelation from the cluster scale towards the group scales. the available entropyand x-ray luminosity data indicate that an increase of the magnetic field b_*\sim t^0.5 is required to reproduce at the same time both the s-t and the l_x-trelations. it follows that a consistent description of the magnetized icm canprovide a simple explanation of several (or of all) of these still openproblems, and thus weakens the need for the inclusion of othernon-gravitational effects which have been proposed so far for the explanationof some of these features. this (initial, but not conclusive) analysis can beregarded as a starting point for a more refined analytical exploration of thephysics of the magnetized intra-cluster medium, and it provides testablepredictions that can be proven or disproven with the next coming sensitiveobservations of groups and clusters in the x-ray band and in the radiofrequency band.
