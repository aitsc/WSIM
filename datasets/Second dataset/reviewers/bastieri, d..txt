0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1001.4531	observations of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermi-lat  detector and constraints on dark matter models	we report on the observations of 14 dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the fermigamma-ray space telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey modeoperations. the fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particledark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pairannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (wimps). local group dwarfspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the colddark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches fordark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matterdominated environments. no significant gamma-ray emission was detected above100 mev from the candidate dwarf galaxies. we determine upper limits to thegamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra fromwimp annihilation. the resulting integral flux above 100 mev is constrained tobe at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. using recent stellarkinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improveddeterminations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidatedwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of wimps inseveral widely studied extensions of the standard model. with the present data,we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermalrelic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and wimps(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models wheresupersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. the gamma-ray limitspresented here also constrain some wimp models proposed to explain the fermiand pamela e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and modelswith tev masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs.

1002.2951	gamma-ray excess from a stacked sample of high- and  intermediate-frequency peaked blazars observed with the magic telescope	between 2004 and 2009 a sample of 28 x-ray selected high- andintermediate-frequency peaked blazars with a x-ray flux larger than 2 ujy at 1kev in the redshift range from 0.018 to 0.361 was observed with the magictelescope at energies above 100 gev. seven among them were detected and theresults of these observations are discussed elsewhere. here we concentrate onthe remaining 21 blazars which were not detected during this observationcampaign and present the 3 sigma (99.7 %) confidence upper limits on theirflux. the individual flux upper limits lie between 1.6 % and 13.6 % of theintegral flux from the crab nebula. applying a stacking method to the sample ofnon-detections with a total of 394.1 hours exposure time, we find evidence foran excess with a cumulative significance of 4.9 standard deviations. it is notdominated by individual objects or flares, but increases linearly with theobservation time as for a constant source with an integral flux level of ~1.5 %of that observed from the crab nebula above 150 gev.

1002.4415	constraints on cosmological dark matter annihilation from the fermi-lat  isotropic diffuse gamma-ray measurement	the first published fermi large area telescope (fermi-lat) measurement of theisotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single powerlaw, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from darkmatter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 gev. we use the absolute sizeand spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits onthree types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,charged leptons and monochromatic photons. predicted gamma-ray fluxes fromannihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distributionof dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structureformation we assess these uncertainties. we also quantify how the dark matterconstraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on theuniverse's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. in reasonable background anddark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it ispossible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons andpositrons measured by the fermi-lat and pamela experiments. derived limits alsostart to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. inminimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. for themonochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only darkmatter scenarios with very strong signals.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1106.1589	mrk 421 active state in 2008: the magic view, simultaneous  multi-wavelength observations and ssc model constrained	context: the blazar markarian 421 is one of the brightest tev gamma-raysources of the northern sky. from december 2007 until june 2008 it wasintensively observed in the very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev) band by thesingle-dish major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov telescope (magic-i).aims: we aimed to measure the physical parameters of the emitting region of theblazar jet during active states. methods: we performed a dense monitoring ofthe source in vhe with magic-i, and also collected complementary data in softx-rays and optical-uv bands; then, we modeled the spectral energy distributions(sed) derived from simultaneous multi-wavelength data within the synchrotronself--compton (ssc) framework. results: the source showed intense and prolongedgamma-ray activity during the whole period, with integral fluxes (e &gt; 200 gev)seldom below the level of the crab nebula, and up to 3.6 times this value.eight datasets of simultaneous optical-uv (kva, swift/uvot), soft x-ray(swift/xrt) and magic-i vhe data were obtained during different outburstphases. the data constrain the physical parameters of the jet, once thespectral energy distributions obtained are interpreted within the framework ofa single-zone ssc leptonic model. conclusions: the main outcome of the study isthat within the homogeneous model high doppler factors (40 &lt;= delta &lt;= 80) areneeded to reproduce the observed sed; but this model cannot explain theobserved short time-scale variability, while it can be argued thatinhomogeneous models could allow for less extreme doppler factors, more intensemagnetic fields and shorter electron cooling times compatible with hour orsub-hour scale variability.

1107.4977	gamma-ray and parsec-scale jet properties of a complete sample of  blazars from the mojave program	we investigate the fermi lat gamma-ray and 15 ghz vlba radio properties of ajoint gamma-ray- and radio-selected sample of agns obtained during the first 11months of the fermi mission (2008 aug 4 - 2009 jul 5). our sample contains thebrightest 173 agns in these bands above declination -30 deg. during thisperiod, and thus probes the full range of gamma-ray loudness (gamma-ray toradio band luminosity ratio) in the bright blazar population. the latterquantity spans at least four orders of magnitude, reflecting a wide range ofspectral energy distribution (sed) parameters in the bright blazar population.the bl lac objects, however, display a linear correlation of increasinggamma-ray loudness with synchrotron sed peak frequency, suggesting a universalsed shape for objects of this class. the synchrotron self-compton model isfavored for the gamma-ray emission in these bl lacs over external seed photonmodels, since the latter predict a dependence of compton dominance on dopplerfactor that would destroy any observed synchrotron sed peak - gamma-rayloudness correlation. the high-synchrotron peaked (hsp) bl lac objects aredistinguished by lower than average radio core brightness temperatures, andnone display large radio modulation indices or high linear core polarizationlevels. no equivalent trends are seen for the flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrq) in our sample. given the association of such properties withrelativistic beaming, we suggest that the hsp bl lacs have generally lowerdoppler factors than the lower-synchrotron peaked bl lacs or fsrqs in oursample.

1108.0501	the radio/gamma-ray connection in active galactic nuclei in the era of  the fermi large area telescope	we present a detailed statistical analysis of the correlation between radioand gamma-ray emission of the active galactic nuclei (agn) detected by fermiduring its first year of operation, with the largest datasets ever used forthis purpose. we use both archival interferometric 8.4 ghz data (from the vlaand atca, for the full sample of 599 sources) and concurrent single-dish 15 ghzmeasurements from the owens valley radio observatory (ovro, for a sub sample of199 objects). our unprecedentedly large sample permits us to assess with highaccuracy the statistical significance of the correlation, using asurrogate-data method designed to simultaneously account for common-distancebias and the effect of a limited dynamical range in the observed quantities. wefind that the statistical significance of a positive correlation between the cmradio and the broad band (e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray energy flux is very high for thewhole agn sample, with a probability &lt;1e-7 for the correlation appearing bychance. using the ovro data, we find that concurrent data improve thesignificance of the correlation from 1.6e-6 to 9.0e-8. our large sample sizeallows us to study the dependence of correlation strength and significance onspecific source types and gamma-ray energy band. we find that the correlationis very significant (chance probability &lt;1e-7) for both fsrqs and bl lacsseparately; a dependence of the correlation strength on the consideredgamma-ray energy band is also present, but additional data will be necessary toconstrain its significance.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1108.5391	observations of the crab pulsar between 25 gev and 100 gev with the  magic i telescope	we report on the observation of $\gamma$-rays above 25\,gev from the crabpulsar (psr b0532+21) using the magic i telescope. two data sets fromobservations during the winter period 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 are used. inorder to discuss the spectral shape from 100\,mev to 100\,gev, one year ofpublic {\it fermi} large area telescope ({\it fermi}-lat) data are alsoanalyzed to complement the magic data. the extrapolation of the exponentialcutoff spectrum determined with the fermi-lat data is inconsistent with magicmeasurements, which requires a modification of the standard pulsar emissionmodels. in the energy region between 25 and 100\,gev, the emission in the p1phase (from -0.06 to 0.04, location of the main pulse) and the p2 phase (from0.32 to 0.43, location of the interpulse) can be described by power laws withspectral indices of $-3.1 \pm 1.0_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$ and $-3.5 \pm0.5_{stat} \pm 0.3_{syst}$, respectively. assuming an asymmetric lorentzian forthe pulse shape, the peak positions of the main pulse and the interpulse areestimated to be at phases $-0.009 \pm 0.007$ and $0.393 \pm 0.009$, while thefull widths at half maximum are $0.025 \pm 0.008$ and $0.053 \pm 0.015$,respectively.

1111.3331	simultaneous multi-wavelength campaign on pks 2005-489 in a high state	the high-frequency peaked bl lac object pks 2005-489 was the target of amulti-wavelength campaign with simultaneous observations in the tev gamma-ray(h.e.s.s.), gev gamma-ray (fermi/lat), x-ray (rxte, swift), uv (swift) andoptical (atom, swift) bands. this campaign was carried out during a high fluxstate in the synchrotron regime. the flux in the optical and x-ray bandsreached the level of the historical maxima. the hard gev spectrum observed withfermi/lat connects well to the very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) spectrummeasured with h.e.s.s. with a peak energy between ~5 and 500 gev. compared toobservations with contemporaneous coverage in the vhe and x-ray bands in 2004,the x-ray flux was ~50 times higher during the 2009 campaign while the tevgamma-ray flux shows marginal variation over the years. the spectral energydistribution during this multi-wavelength campaign was fit by a one zonesynchrotron self-compton model with a well determined cutoff in x-rays. theparameters of a one zone ssc model are inconsistent with variability timescales. the variability behaviour over years with the large changes insynchrotron emission and small changes in the inverse compton emission does notwarrant an interpretation within a one-zone ssc model despite an apparentlysatisfying fit to the broadband data in 2009.

1111.5544	constraining cosmic rays and magnetic fields in the perseus galaxy  cluster with tev observations by the magic telescopes	galaxy clusters are being assembled today in the most energetic phase ofhierarchical structure formation which manifests itself in powerful shocks thatcontribute to a substantial energy density of cosmic rays (crs). hence,clusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act asenergy reservoirs for additional cr sources, such as active galactic nuclei andsupernova-driven galactic winds. to detect the gamma-ray emission from crinteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to dateobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energygamma-rays and observed the perseus cluster with the magic cherenkov telescopesfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. this campaign resulted inthe detection of the central radio galaxy ngc 1275 at energies e &gt; 100 gev witha very steep energy spectrum. here, we restrict our analysis to energies e &gt;630 gev and detect no significant gamma-ray excess. this constrains the averagecr-to-thermal pressure ratio to be &lt;= 1-2%, depending on assumptions and themodel for cr emission. comparing these gamma-ray upper limits to predictionsfrom cosmological cluster simulations that include crs constrains the maximumcr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to be &lt; 50%.alternatively, this may argue for non-negligible cr transport processes such ascr streaming and diffusion into the outer cluster regions. finally, we derivelower limits on the magnetic field distribution assuming that the perseus radiomini-halo is generated by secondary electrons/positrons that are created inhadronic cr interactions: assuming a spectrum of e^-2.2 around tev energies asimplied by cluster simulations, we limit the central magnetic field to be &gt; 4-9microg, depending on the rate of decline of the magnetic field strength towardlarger radii.

1206.1346	gev observations of star-forming galaxies with \textit{fermi} lat	recent detections of the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 253 by gamma-raytelescopes suggest that galaxies rapidly forming massive stars are moreluminous at gamma-ray energies compared to their quiescent relatives. buildingupon those results, we examine a sample of 69 dwarf, spiral, and luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies at photon energies 0.1-100 gev using 3 years ofdata collected by the large area telescope (lat) on the \textit{fermi gamma-rayspace telescope} (\textit{fermi}). measured fluxes from significantly detectedsources and flux upper limits for the remaining galaxies are used to explorethe physics of cosmic rays in galaxies. we find further evidence forquasi-linear scaling relations between gamma-ray luminosity and both radiocontinuum luminosity and total infrared luminosity which apply both toquiescent galaxies of the local group and low-redshift starburst galaxies(conservative $p$-values $\lesssim0.05$ accounting for statistical andsystematic uncertainties). the normalizations of these scaling relationscorrespond to luminosity ratios of $\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{1.4 \rm{ghz}})= 1.7 \pm 0.1_{\rm (statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ and$\log(l_{0.1-100 \rm{gev}}/l_{8-1000 \mu\rm{m}}) = -4.3 \pm 0.1_{\rm(statistical)} \pm 0.2_{\rm (dispersion)}$ for a galaxy with a star formationrate of 1 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, assuming a chabrier initial mass function.using the relationship between infrared luminosity and gamma-ray luminosity,the collective intensity of unresolved star-forming galaxies at redshifts$0&lt;z&lt;2.5$ above 0.1 gev is estimated to be 0.4-2.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ phcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (4-23% of the intensity of the isotropic diffusecomponent measured with the lat). we anticipate that $\sim10$ galaxies could bedetected by their cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission during a 10-year\textit{fermi} mission.

1207.0616	gamma-ray observations of the orion molecular clouds with the fermi  large area telescope	we report on the gamma-ray observations of giant molecular clouds orion a andb with the large area telescope (lat) on-board the fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope. the gamma-ray emission in the energy band between \sim100 mev and\sim100 gev is predicted to trace the gas mass distribution in the cloudsthrough nuclear interactions between the galactic cosmic rays (crs) andinterstellar gas. the gamma-ray production cross-section for the nuclearinteraction is known to \sim10% precision which makes the lat a powerful toolto measure the gas mass column density distribution of molecular clouds for aknown cr intensity. we present here such distributions for orion a and b, andcorrelate them with those of the velocity integrated co intensity (wco) at a1{\deg} \times1{\deg} pixel level. the correlation is found to be linear over awco range of ~10 fold when divided in 3 regions, suggesting penetration ofnuclear crs to most of the cloud volumes. the wco-to-mass conversion factor,xco, is found to be \sim2.3\times10^20 cm-2(k km s-1)-1 for the high-longitudepart of orion a (l &gt; 212{\deg}), \sim1.7 times higher than \sim1.3 \times 10^20found for the rest of orion a and b. we interpret the apparent high xco in thehigh-longitude region of orion a in the light of recent works proposing anon-linear relation between h2 and co densities in the diffuse molecular gas.wco decreases faster than the h2 column density in the region making the gas"darker" to wco.

1207.2147	magic observations of the giant radio galaxy m87 in a low-emission state  between 2005 and 2007	we present the results of a long m87 monitoring campaign in very high energy$\gamma$-rays with the magic-i cherenkov telescope. we aim to model thepersistent non-thermal jet emission by monitoring and characterizing the veryhigh energy $\gamma$-ray emission of m87 during a low state. a total of 150\,hof data were taken between 2005 and 2007 with the single magic-i telescope, outof which 128.6\,h survived the data quality selection. we also collected datain the x-ray and \textit{fermi}--lat bands from the literature (partiallycontemporaneous). no flaring activity was found during the campaign. the sourcewas found to be in a persistent low-emission state, which was at a confidencelevel of $7\sigma$. we present the spectrum between 100\,gev and 2\,tev, whichis consistent with a simple power law with a photon index $\gamma=2.21\pm0.21$and a flux normalization at 300\,gev of $(7.7\pm1.3) \times 10^{-8}$ tev$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$. the extrapolation of the magic spectrum into the gev energyrange matches the previously published \textit{fermi}--lat spectrum well,covering a combined energy range of four orders of magnitude with the samespectral index. we model the broad band energy spectrum with a spine layermodel, which can satisfactorily describe our data.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1301.7087	radio to gamma-ray variability study of blazar s5 0716+714	we present the results of a series of radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out between april 2007 andjanuary 2011. the multi-frequency observations were obtained using severalground and space based facilities. the intense optical monitoring of the sourcereveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variabilitytrend at a time scale of ~350 days. episodes of fast variability recur on timescales of ~ 60-70 days. the intense and simultaneous activity at optical andgamma-ray frequencies favors the ssc mechanism for the production of thehigh-energy emission. two major low-peaking radio flares were observed duringthis high optical/gamma-ray activity period. the radio flares are characterizedby a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of ashock and its evolution. we found that the evolution of the radio flaresrequires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of thesource. different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of\delta &gt; 20 and equipartition magnetic field b_eq &gt; 0.36 g. causality argumentsconstrain the size of emission region \theta &lt; 0.004 mas. we found asignificant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with thoseat optical and gamma-rays. the optical/gev flux variations lead the radiovariability by ~65 days. the longer time delays between low-peaking radiooutbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors ofradio ones. an orphan x-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emissionmodels, rendering them too simple. here we also describe the spectral energydistribution modeling of the source from simultaneous data taken throughdifferent activity periods.
