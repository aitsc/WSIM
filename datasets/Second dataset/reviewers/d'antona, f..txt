0907.1765	the c+n+o abundances and the splitting of the subgiant branch in the  globular cluster ngc 1851	among the newly discovered features of multiple stellar populations inglobular clusters, the cluster ngc 1851 harbours a double subgiant branch, thatcan be explained in terms of two stellar generations, only slightly differingin age, the younger one having an increased total c+n+o abundance. thanks tothis difference in the chemistry, a fit can be made to the subgiant branches,roughly consistent with the c+n+o abundance variations already discovered twodecades ago, and confirmed by recent spectroscopic data. we compute theoreticalisochrones for the main sequence turnoff, by adopting four chemical mixturesfor the opacities and nuclear reaction rates. the standard mixture hasz=10$^{-3}$ and [$\alpha$/fe]=0.4, the others have c+n+o respectively equal to2, 3 and 5 times the standard mixture, according to the element abundancedistribution described in the text. we compare tracks and isochrones, and showhow the results depend on the total cno abundance. we notice that differentinitial cno abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicityand age, may lead to differences in the turnoff morphology that can be easilyattributed to an age difference. we simulate the main sequence and subgiantbranch data for ngc 1851 and show that an increase of c+n+o by a factor $\sim$3best reproduces the shift between the subgiant branches. we compare the mainsequence width in the color m$_{f336w}$-m$_{f814w}$ with models, and find thatthe maximum helium abundance compatible with the data is y$\simeq$0.29. weconsider the result in the framework of the formation of the second stellargeneration in globular clusters, for the bulk of which we estimate a heliumabundance of y$\simlt 0.26$.

0908.1650	the influence of the c+n+o abundances on the determination of the  relative ages of globular clusters: the case of ngc 1851 and ngc 6121 (m4)	the color magnitude diagram (cmd) of ngc 1851 presents two subgiant branches(sgb), probably due the presence of two populations differing in total cnocontent. we test the idea that a difference in total cno may simulate an agedifference when comparing the cmd of clusters to derive relative ages. wecompare ngc 1851 with ngc 6121 (m4), a cluster of very similar [fe/h]. we findthat, with a suitable shift of the cmds that brings the two red horizontalbranches at the same magnitude level, the unevolved main sequence and red giantbranch match, but the sgb of ngc 6121 and its red giant branch "bump" arefainter than in ngc 1851. in particular, the sgb of ngc 6121 is even slightlyfainter than the the faint sgb in ngc 1851. both these features can beexplained if the total cno in ngc 6121 is larger than that in ngc 1851, even ifthe two clusters are coeval. we conclude by warning that different initialc+n+o abundances between two clusters, otherwise similar in metallicity andage, may lead to differences in the turnoff morphology that can be easilyattributed to an age difference.

0909.4391	rb-rich asymptotic giant branch stars in the magellanic clouds	we present high-resolution (r~60,000) optical spectra of a carefully selectedsample of heavily obscured and presumably massive o-rich asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars in the magellanic clouds (mcs). we report the discovery ofstrong rb i lines at 7800 a in four rb-rich lmc stars at luminosities equal toor greater than the standard adopted luminosity limit for agb stars(mbol~-7.1), confirming that "hot bottom burning" (hbb) may produce a fluxexcess in the more massive agb stars. in the smc sample, just one of the fivestars with mbol&lt;-7.1 was detected in rb; the other stars may be massive redsupergiants. the rb-rich lmc agb stars might have stellar masses of at least~6-7 msun. our abundance analysis show that these rb-rich stars are extremelyenriched in rb by up to 10^3-10^5 times solar but seem to have only mild zrenhancements. the high rb/zr ratios, if real, represent a severe problem forthe s-process, even if the 22ne source is operational as expected for massiveagb stars; it is not possible to synthesize copious amounts of rb without alsooverproducing zr. the solution to the problem may lie with an incompletepresent understanding of the atmospheres of luminous agb stars.

0912.3150	a detailed study of the main sequence of the globular cluster ngc 6397:  can we derive constraints on the existence of multiple population?	if ngc 6397 contains a large fraction of "second generation" stars (&gt;70%according to recent analysis), the helium abundance of its stars might also beaffected, show some star-to-star variation, and be larger than the standard bigbang abundance y~0.24. can we derive constraints on this issue from theanalysis of the main sequence width and from its luminosity function? we buildup new models for the turnoff masses and the main sequence down to the hydrogenburning minimum mass, adopting two versions of an updated equation of state(eos) including the opal eos. models consider different initial helium and cnoabundances to cover the range of possible variations between the first andsecond generation stars. we compare the models with the observational mainsequence. we also make simulations of the theoretical luminosity functions, fordifferent choices of the mass function and of the mixture of first and secondgeneration stars, and compare them with the observed luminosity function, bymeans of the kolmogorov smirnov --ks-- test. the study of the width of the mainsequence at different interval of magnitude is consistent with the hypothesisthat both generations are present in the cluster. if the cno increase suggestedby spectroscopic observation is taken into account the small helium spread ofthe main sequence in ngc 6397 implies a substantial helium uniformity (dy~0.02)between first and second generation stars. the possible spread in heliumdoubles if an even larger increase of cno is considered. the luminosityfunction is in any case well consistent with the observed data.

1004.3426	terzan 5: an alternative interpretation for the split horizontal branch	we consider the horizontal branch (hb) of the globular cluster terzan 5,recently shown to be split into two parts, the fainter one (delta m_k ~ 0.3mag)having a lower metallicity than the more luminous. both features show that itcontains at least two stellar populations. the separation in magnitude has beenascribed to an age difference of ~6 gyr and interpreted as the result of anatypical evolutionary history for this cluster. we show that the observed hbmorphology is also consistent with a model in which the bright hb is composedof second generation stars that are metal enriched and with a helium massfraction larger (by delta y ~ 0.07) than that of first generation starspopulating the fainter part of the hb. terzan 5 would therefore be anomalous,compared to most "normal" clusters hosting multiple populations, only becauseits second generation is strongly contaminated by supernova ejecta; thepreviously proposed prolonged period of star formation, however, is notrequired. the iron enrichment of the bright hb can be ascribed either tocontamination from type ia supernova ejecta of the low-iron, helium rich,ejecta of the massive asympotic giant branch stars of the cluster, or to itsmixing with gas, accreting on the cluster from the environment, that has beensubject to fast metal enrichment due to its proximity with the galactic bulge.the model here proposed requires only a small age difference, of ~100myr.

1007.5301	abundances for a large sample of red giants in ngc 1851: hints for a  merger of two clusters?	we present the abundance analysis of a sample of more than 120 red giants inthe globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851, based on flames spectra. we find a smallbut detectable metallicity spread. this spread is compatible with the presenceof two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. if stars are divided intothese two groups according to their metallicity, both components show a na-oanticorrelation (signature of a genuine gc nature) of moderate extension. themetal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. we tentativelypropose the hypothesis that ngc 1851 formed from a merger of two individual gcswith a slightly different fe and alpha-element content, and possibly an agedifference up to 1 gyr. this is supported also by number ratios of stars on thesplit subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. the distribution ofn-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea thatthe enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately, and notas a continuum of events in a single gc. the most probable explanation is thatthe proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later mergedto produce the present gc.

1103.0867	ngc 2419: a large and extreme second generation in a currently  undisturbed cluster	we analyse complementary hst and subaru data for the globular cluster ngc2419. we make a detailed analysis of the horizontal branch (hb), that appearscomposed by two main groups of stars: the luminous blue hb stars ---that extendby evolution into the rr lyrae and red hb region--- and a fainter, extremelyblue population. we examine the possible models for this latter group andconclude that a plausible explanation is that they correspond to a significant(~30 %) extreme second generation with a strong helium enhancement (y~0.4). wealso show that the color dispersion of the red giant branch is consistent withthis hypothesis, while the main sequence data are compatible with it, althoughthe large observational error blurs the possible underlying splitting. while itis common to find an even larger (50 -- 80) percentage of second generation ina globular cluster, the presence of a substantial and extreme fraction of thesestars in ngc 2419 might be surprising, as the cluster is at present well insidethe radius beyond which the galactic tidal field would be dominant. if asimilar situation had been present in the first stages of the cluster life, thecluster would have retained its initial mass, and the percentage of secondgeneration stars should have been quite small (up to ~10 %). such a largefraction of extreme second generation stars implies that the system must havebeen initially much more massive and in different dynamical conditions thantoday. we discuss this issue in the light of existing models of the formationof multiple populations in globular clusters.

1105.0366	the oxygen vs. sodium (anti)correlation(s) in omega cen	recent exam of large samples of omega cen giants shows that it shares withmono-metallic globular clusters the presence of the sodium versus oxygenanticorrelation, within each subset of stars with iron content in the range-1.9&lt;~[fe/h]&lt;~-1.3. these findings suggest that, while the second generationformation history in omega cen is more complex than that of mono-metallicclusters, it shares some key steps with those simpler cluster. in addition, thegiants in the range -1.3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;~-0.7 show a direct o--na correlation, atmoderately low o, but na up to 20 times solar. these peculiar na abundances arenot shared by stars in other environments often assumed to undergo a similarchemical evolution, such as in the field of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy. theseo and na abundances match well the yields of the massive asymptotic giantbranch stars (agb) in the same range of metallicity, suggesting that the starsat [fe/h]&gt;-1.3 in omega cen are likely to have formed directly from the pureejecta of massive agbs of the same metallicities. this is possible if themassive agbs of [fe/h]&gt;-1.3 in the progenitor system evolve when all thepristine gas surrounding the cluster has been exhausted by the previous starformation events, or the proto--cluster interaction with the galaxy caused theloss of a significant fraction of its mass, or of its dark matter halo, and thesupernova ejecta have been able to clear the gas out of the system. the absenceof dilution in the metal richer populations lends further support to a scenarioof the formation of second generation stars in cooling flows from massive agbprogenitors. we suggest that the entire formation of omega cen took place in afew 10^8yr, and discuss the problem of a prompt formation of s--processelements.

1106.0810	in search of massive single-population globular clusters	most globular clusters so far examined host (at least) two stellarpopulations. this feature requires a two--step process, in which the nuclearlyprocessed matter from a first generation (fg) of stars gives birth to a secondgeneration (sg) bearing the fingerprint of a fully cno-cycled matter. since thepresent population of most globular clusters is made up largely of sg stars, asubstantial fraction of the fg (&gt;~90%) must be lost. nevertheless, two types ofclusters dominated by a simple stellar population (fg clusters) should exist:either clusters initially too small to be able to retain a cooling flow andform a sg (fg-only clusters), or massive clusters that could retain the cnoprocessed ejecta and form a sg, but were unable to lose a significant fractionof their fg (mainly-fg clusters). we attempt a classification of fg clusters,based on the morphology of their horizontal branches (hbs), as displayed inphotomectric catalogues for 106 clusters. fg candidates are the clusters inwhich the hb can be reproduced by the evolution of an almost unique mass. &lt;20%of clusters with [fe/h]&lt;-0.8 appear to be fg, but only ~10% probably had a masssufficient to form at all an sg. this small percentage confirms on a widerdatabase that the sg is a dominant constituent of today's clusters, suggestingthat its formation is an ingredient necessary for the survival of globularclusters during their dynamical evolution in the galactic tidal field. pal3turns out to be a good example of fg-only cluster. hb simulations and spacedistribution of its components, indicate that m 53 is a "mainly-fg" cluster.mainly-fg candidates may be also ngc5634, ngc5694 and ngc6101. in contrast, ngc2419 contains &gt;30% of sg stars, and its present dynamical status bears lessinformation on its formation process than the analysis of the chemicalabundances of its stars and of its hb morphology.

0709.4601	multiple stellar populations in globular clusters: collection of  information from the horizontal branch	the majority of the inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of globularcluster (gc) stars appear due to primordial enrichment by hot-cno cycledmaterial processed in stars belonging to a first stellar generation. eithermassive agb envelopes subject to hot bottom burning, or the envelopes ofmassive fastly rotating stars could be the progenitors. in both cases, thestars showing chemical anomalies must have also enhanced helium abundance, andwe have proposed that this higher helium could be at the basis of the manydifferent morphologies of gc horizontal branches (hb) for similar ages andmetallicities. the helium variations have been beautifully confirmed by thesplitting of the main sequence in the clusters omega cen and ngc 2808, but thiseffect can show up only for somewhat extreme helium abundances. therefore it isimportant to go on using the hb morphology to infer the number ratio of thefirst to the second generation in as many clusters as possible. we exemplifyhow it is possible to infer the presence of a he-rich stellar component indifferent clusters thanks to different hb features (gaps, rr lyr periods andperiod distribution, ratio of blue to red stars, blue tails). in many clustersat least 50% of the stars belong to the second stellar generation, and in somecases we suspect that the stars might all belong to the second generation. weshortly examine the problem of the initial mass function required to achievethe observed number ratios and conclude that: 1) the initial cluster must havebeen much more massive than today's cluster, and 2) formation of the secondstellar generation mainly in the central regions of the cluster may help inobtaining the desired values.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1111.2053	the transition from carbon dust to silicates production in  low-metallicity agb and sagb stars	we compute the mass and composition of dust produced by stars with masses inthe range 1msun&lt;m&lt;8 msun and with a metallicity of z=0.001 during their agb andsuper agb phases. stellar evolution is followed from the pre-main sequencephase using the code aton which provides, at each timestep, the thermodynamicsand the chemical stucture of the wind. we use a simple model to describe thegrowth of the dust grains under the hypothesis of a time-independent,spherically symmetric stellar wind. we find that the total mass of dustinjected by agb stars in the interstellar medium does not increasemonotonically with stellar mass and ranges between a minimum of 10^{-6}msun forthe 1.5msun stellar model, up to 2x10^{-4} msun, for the 6msun case. dustcomposition depends on the stellar mass: low-mass stars (m &lt; 3msun) producecarbon-rich dust, whereas more massive stars, experiencing hot bottom burning,never reach the carbon-star stage, and produce silicates and iron. this is inpartial disagreement with previous investigations in the literature, which arebased on synthetic agb models and predict that, when the initial metallicity isz=0.001, c-rich dust is formed at all stellar masses. the differences are dueto the different modelling of turbulent convection in the super-adiabaticityregime. also in this case the treatment of super-adiabatic convection shows upas the most relevant issue affecting the dust-formation process. we alsoinvestigate super agb stars with masses 6.5msun&lt;m&lt;8 msun that evolve over a onecore.due to a favourable combination of mass loss and hot bottom burning, thesestars are predicted to be the most efficient silicate-dust producers, releasing[2 - 7]x 10^{-4} msun masses of dust. we discuss the robustness of thesepredictions and their relevance for the nature and evolution of dust at earlycosmic times.

1205.6216	dust formation around agb and sagb stars: a trend with metallicity?	we calculate the dust formed around agb and sagb stars of metallicity z=0.008by following the evolution of models with masses in the range 1m&lt;m&lt;8mthroughthe thermal pulses phase, and assuming that dust forms via condensationof molecules within a wind expanding isotropically from the stellar surface. wefind that, because of the strong hot bottom burning (hbb) experienced, highmass models produce silicates, whereas lower mass objects are predicted to besurrounded by carbonaceous grains; the transition between the two regimesoccurs at a threshold mass of 3.5m. these fndings are consistent with theresults presented in a previous investigation, for z=0.001. however, in thepresent higher metallicity case, the production of silicates in the moremassive stars continues for the whole agb phase, because the hbb experienced issofter at z=0.008 than at z=0.001, thus the oxygen in the envelope, essentialfor the formation of water molecules, is never consumed completely. the totalamount of dust formed for a given mass experiencing hbb increases withmetallicity, because of the higher abundance of silicon, and the softer hbb,both factors favouring a higher rate of silicates production. this behaviour isnot found in low mass stars,because the carbon enrichment of the stellarsurface layers, due to repeated third drege up episodes, is almost independentof the metallicity. regarding cosmic dust enrichment by intermediate massstars, we ?nd that the cosmic yield at z=0.008 is a factor 5 larger than atz=0.001. in the lower metallicity case carbon dust dominates after about 300myr, but at z=0.008 the dust mass is dominated by silicates at all times,with aprompt enrichment occurring after about 40 myr, associated with the evolutionof stars with masses m =7.5 -8m.

1207.1544	models for the lithium abundances of multiple populations in globular  clusters and the possible role of the big bang lithium	globular cluster stars show chemical abundance patterns typical of hot-cnoprocessing. lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellarenvironments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among differentmodels proposed to account for multiple populations. in order to reproduce theobserved o-na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiplepopulations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from thenuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,diluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. thelithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal tothe lithium abundance emerging from the big bang- affects the lithium chemicalpatterns among the cluster stars. this paper focuses on a scenario in whichprocessed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. we examinethe predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiplepopulations. we study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in theejecta of massive agb (a(li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how ourmodels can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithiumyields predicted by recent super--agb models. we show that the super--agbyields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of bluemain sequence stars in wcen and/or ngc2808. in addition, we examine thedifferent model results obtained by assuming for the pristine gas either thebig bang abundance predicted by the standard models (a(li)=2.6-2.7), or theabundance detected at the surface of population ii stars (a(li)=2.2-2.3). oncea chemical model is well constrained, the o--li distribution could perhaps beused to shed light on the primordial lithium abundance.

1306.3351	the puzzle of metallicity and multiple stellar populations in the  globular clusters in fornax	we examine the photometric data for fornax clusters, focussing our attentionon their horizontal branch color distribution and, when available, on the rrlyr variables fraction and period distribution. based on our understanding ofthe hb morphology in terms of varying helium content in the context of multiplestellar generations, we show that clusters f2, f3 and f5 must containsubstantial fractions of second generation stars (~54-65%). on the basis of asimple chemical evolution model we show that the helium distribution in theseclusters can be reproduced by models with cluster initial masses ranging fromvalues equal to ~4 to ~10 times larger than the current masses. models with avery short second generation star formation episode can also reproduce theobserved helium distribution but require larger initial masses up to abouttwenty times the current mass. while the lower limit of this range of possibleinitial gc masses is consistent with those suggested by the observations of thelow metallicity field stars, we also discuss the possibility that themetallicity scale of field stars (based on caii triplet spectroscopy) and themetallicities derived for the clusters in fornax may not be consistent witheach other. the reproduction of the hb morphology in f2,f3,f5 requires twointeresting hypotheses: 1) the first generation hb stars lie all at "red"colours. according to this interpretation, the low metallicity stars in thefield of fornax, populating the hb at colours bluer than the blue side((v-i)o&lt;=0.3 or (b-v)o&lt;=0.2) of the rr lyrs, should be second generation starsborn in the clusters;a preliminary analysis of available colour surveys offornax field provides a fraction ~20% of blue hb stars, in the low metallicityrange; 2) the mass loss from individual second generation red giants is a fewpercent of a solar mass larger than the mass loss from first generation stars.

1311.0683	the formation of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 tuc	we use the combination of photometric and spectroscopic data of 47 tuc starsto reconstruct the possible formation of a second generation of stars in thecentral regions of the cluster, from matter ejected from massive asymptoticgiant branch stars, diluted with pristine gas. the yields from massive agbstars with the appropriate metallicity (z=0.004, i.e. [fe/h]=-0.75) arecompatible with the observations, in terms of extension and slope of thepatterns observed, involving oxygen, nitrogen, sodium and aluminium. based onthe constraints on the maximum helium of 47 tuc stars provided by photometricinvestigations, and on the helium content of the ejecta, we estimate that thegas out of which second generation stars formed was composed of about one-thirdof gas from intermediate mass stars, with m&gt;= 5mo and about two-thirds ofpristine gas. we tentatively identify the few stars whose na, al and oabundances resemble the undiluted agb yields with the small fraction of 47 tucstars populating the faint subgiant branch. from the relative fraction of firstand second generation stars currently observed, we estimate that the initial fgpopulation in 47 tuc was about 7.5 times more massive than the cluster currenttotal mass.

0803.0235	self-enrichment in globular clusters: is there a role for the  super-asymptotic giant branch stars?	in four globular clusters (gcs) a non negligible fraction of stars can beinterpreted only as a very helium rich population. the evidence comes from thepresence of a "blue" main sequence in $\omega$ cen and ngc 2808, and from thethe very peculiar horizontal branch morphology in ngc 6441 and ngc 6388.although a general consensus is emerging on the fact that self--enrichment is acommon feature among gcs, the helium content required for these stars isy$\simgt$0.35, and it is difficult to understand how it can be produced withoutany --or, for $\omega$ cen, without a considerable--associated metalenhancement. we examine the possible role of super--agb stars, and show thatthey may provide the required high helium. however, the ejecta of the mostmassive super--agbs show a global cno enrichment by a factor of $\simeq$4, dueto the dredge--out process occurring at the second dredge up stage. if theseclusters show no evidence for this cno enrichment, we can rule out that atleast the most massive super--agbs evolve into o--ne white dwarfs and take partin the formation of the second generation stars. this latter hypothesis mayhelp to explain the high number of neutron stars present in gcs. the mostmassive super--agbs would in fact evolve into electron--capture supernovae.their envelopes would be easily ejected out of the cluster, but the remnantneutron stars remain into the clusters, thanks to their small supernova natalkicks.

1409.4694	the chemical composition of red giants in 47 tucanae i: fundamental  parameters and chemical abundance patterns	context: the study of chemical abundance patterns in globular clusters is ofkey importance to constrain the different candidates for intra-clusterpollution of light elements. aims: we aim at deriving accurate abundances for alarge range of elements in the globular cluster 47 tucanae (ngc 104) to add newconstraints to the pollution scenarios for this particular cluster, expandingthe range of previously derived element abundances. methods: using tailored 1dlte atmospheric models together with a combination of equivalent widthmeasurements, lte, and nlte synthesis we derive stellar parameters and elementabundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 13 red giantstars near the tip of the rgb. results: we derive abundances of a total 27elements (o, na, mg, al, si, ca, sc, ti, v, cr, mn, fe, co, ni, cu, zn, y, zr,mo, ru, ba, la, ce, pr, nd, eu, dy). departures from lte were taken intoaccount for na, al and ba. we find a mean [fe/h] = $-0.78\pm0.07$ and$[\alpha/{\rm fe}]=0.34\pm0.03$ in good agreement with previous studies. theremaining elements show good agreement with the literature, but the inclusionof nlte for al has a significant impact on the behaviour of this key element.conclusions: we confirm the presence of an na-o anti-correlation in 47 tucanaefound by several other works. our nlte analysis of al shifts the [al/fe] tolower values, indicating that this may be overestimated in earlier works. noevidence for an intrinsic variation is found in any of the remaining elements.

1410.4564	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. i. overview of the project and detection of multiple stellar  populations	in this paper we describe a new uv-initiative hst project (go-13297) thatwill complement the existing f606w and f814w database of the acs globularcluster (gc) treasury by imaging most of its clusters through uv/blue wfc3/uvisfilters f275w, f336w and f438w. this "magic trio" of filters has shown anuncanny ability to disentangle and characterize multiple-population (mp)patterns in gcs in a way that is exquisitely sensitive to c, n, and o abundancevariations. combination of these passbands with those in the optical also givesthe best leverage for measuring helium enrichment. the dozen clusters that hadpreviously been observed in these bands exhibit a bewildering variety of mppatterns, and the new survey will map the full variance of the phenomenon. theubiquity of multiple stellar generations in gcs has made the formation of thesecornerstone objects more intriguing than ever; gc formation and the origin oftheir mps have now become one and the same problem. in the present paper wewill describe the data base and our data reduction strategy, as well as theuses we intend to make of the final photometry, astrometry, and proper motions.we will also present preliminary color-magnitude diagrams from the data so farcollected. these diagrams also draw on data from go-12605 and go-12311, whichserved as a pilot project for the present go-13297.

1508.01804	the hubble space telescope uv legacy survey of galactic globular  clusters. vi. the internal kinematics of the multiple stellar populations in  ngc 2808	numerous observational studies have revealed the ubiquitous presence ofmultiple stellar populations in globular clusters and cast many hard challengesfor the study of the formation and dynamical history of these stellar systems.in this letter we present the results of a study of the kinematic properties ofmultiple populations in ngc 2808 based on high-precision hubble space telescopeproper-motion measurements. in a recent study, milone et al. have identifiedfive distinct populations (a, b, c, d, and e) in ngc 2808. populations d and ecoincide with the helium-enhanced populations in the middle and the blue mainsequences (mms and bms) previously discovered by piotto et al.; populations a,b, and c correspond to the redder main sequence (rms) that in the piotto et al.was associated with the primordial stellar population. our analysis shows that,in the outermost regions probed (between about 1.5 and 2 times the clusterhalf-light radius), the velocity distribution of populations d and e isradially anisotropic (the deviation from an isotropic distribution issignificant at the ~3.5-sigma level). stars of populations d and e have asmaller tangential velocity dispersion than those of populations a, b, and c,while no significant differences are found in the radial-velocity dispersion.we present the results of a numerical simulation showing that the observeddifferences between the kinematics of these stellar populations are consistentwith the expected kinematic fingerprint of the diffusion towards the clusterouter regions of stellar populations initially more centrally concentrated.

1508.01932	the extended main sequence turn off cluster ngc1856: rotational  evolution in a coeval stellar ensemble	multiple or extended turnoffs in young clusters in the magellanic clouds haverecently received large attention. a number of studies have shown that they maybe interpreted as the result of a significant age spread (several 10^8yr inclusters aged 1--2 gyr), while others attribute them to a spread in stellarrotation. we focus on the cluster ngc 1856, showing a splitting in the upperpart of the main sequence, well visible in the color m_{f336w}-m_{f555w}$, anda very wide turnoff region. using population synthesis available from thegeneva stellar models, we show that the cluster data can be interpreted assuperposition of two main populations having the same age (~350myr), composedfor 2/3 of very rapidly rotating stars, defining the upper turnoff region andthe redder main sequence, and for 1/3 of slowly/non-rotating stars. since rapidrotation is a common property of the b-a type stars, the main question raisedby this model concerns the origin of the slowly/non-rotating component. binarysynchronization is a possible process behind the slowly/non-rotatingpopulation; in this case, many slowly/non-rotating stars should still be partof binary systems with orbital periods in the range from 4 to 500 days. suchperiods imply that roche lobe overflow occurs, during the evolution of theprimary off the main sequence, so most primaries may not be able to ignite corehelium burning, consistently why the lack of a red clump progeny of the slowlyrotating population.

0705.3401	a model for the globular cluster extreme anomalies	in spite of the efforts made in the latest years, still there is nocomprehensive explanation for the chemical anomalies of globular cluster stars.among these, the most striking is oxygen depletion, which reaches values downto [o/fe]~-0.4 in most clusters, but in m13 it goes down to less than [o/fe]~ -1. in this work we suggest that the anomalies are due to the super position oftwo different events: 1) primordial self-enrichment: this is asked to explainthe oxygen depletion down to a minimum value [o/fe]~ -0.4; 2) extra mixing in afraction of the stars already born with anomalous composition: these objects,starting with already low [o/fe], will reduce the oxygen abundance down to themost extreme values. contrary to other models that invoke extra mixing toexplain the chemical anomalies, we suggest that it is active only if there is afraction of the stars in which the primordial composition is not only oxygendepleted, but also extremely helium rich (y~ 0.4), as found in a few gcs fromtheir main sequence multiplicity. we propose that the rotational evolution (andan associated extra mixing) of extremely helium rich stars may be affected bythe fact that they develop a very small or non existent molecular weightbarrier during the evolution. we show that extra mixing in these stars, havinginitial chemistry that has already been cno processed, affects mainly theoxygen abundance, and to a much smaller extent if affects the sodium abundance.the model also predicts a large fluorine depletion concomitant with the oxygendepletion, and a further enhancement of the surface helium abundance, whichreaches values close to y=0.5 in the computed models. we stress that, in thistentative explanation, those stars that are primordially o--depleted, but arenot extremely helium rich do not suffer deep extra mixing.

0807.4233	the fraction of second generation stars in globular clusters from the  analysis of the horizontal branch	most globular clusters (gc) show chemical inhomogeneities in the compositionof their stars, apparently due to a second stellar generation (sg) in which theforming gas is enriched by hot-cno cycled material processed in stars belongingto a first stellar generation (fg). we propose to use the horizontal branch(hb) to infer which is today the relative number fraction of ''normal" andanomalous stars in clusters. we assume that the anomalies also include enhancedhelium abundance. helium variations have been recognized to be able to explainseveral puzzling peculiarities (gaps, rr lyr periods and period distribution,ratio of blue to red stars, blue tails) in hbs. we extend the analysis to asmany clusters as possible. we show that, with few exceptions, 50% or more ofthe stars belong to the sg. in other cases, where one would think of a simplestellar population, we suggest that the stars might all belong to the sg. wefit the optical and uv data of ngc2808, including a reproduction of the mainsequence splittings and an exam of the problem of "blue hook" stars. we alsoshow a detailed fit of the totally blue hb of m13, one among the clusters thatare possibly fully made up by sg stars. we conclude that the formation of thesg is a crucial event in the life of gcs. a high fraction of sg stars can beachieved only if the initial cluster was much more massive than the present oneand most of the fg low mass stars have been lost. as shown by d'ercole et al.,the mass loss due to type ii supernovae of the fg may be the processresponsible for triggering the expansion of the cluster, the stripping of itsouter layers and the loss of most of the fg low-mass stars.

astro-ph;0104170	where have all the submillisecond pulsars gone?	the existence of pulsars with spin period below one millisecond is expected,though they have not been detected up to now. their formation depends on thequantity of matter accreted from the companion which, in turn, is limited bythe mechanism of mass ejection from the binary. mass ejection must beefficient, at least in some cases, in order to produce the observed populationof moderately fast spinning millisecond pulsars. first we demonstrate, in theframework of the widely accepted recycling scenario, using a populationsynthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period belowone millisecond is expected. then we propose that significant variations in themass-transfer rate may cause, in systems with orbital periods larger than 1 hr,the switch-on of a radio pulsar whose radiation pressure is capable of ejectingout of the system most of the matter transferred by the companion and preventany further accretion. we show how this mechanism could dramatically alter thebinary evolution since the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the innerlagrangian point is still active while the accretion is inhibited. moreover wedemonstrate that the persistency of this ``radio ejection'' phase depends onthe binary orbital period, demonstrating that close systems (orbital periodslower than 1 hr) are the only possible hosts for ultra fast spinning neutronstars. this could explain why submillisecond pulsars have not been detected sofar, as current radio surveys are hampered by computational limitations withrespect to the detection of very short spin period pulsars in short orbitalperiod binaries.

astro-ph;0310463	the different fates of a low-mass x-ray binary. i: conservative mass  transfer	we study the evolution of a low mass x-ray binary coupling a binary stellarevolution code with a general relativistic code that describes the behavior ofthe neutron star. we assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (b~10^8 g).in the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that duringthe binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to theneutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. this issufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with theneutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable ofejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. wefind that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up tomoderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almostunavoidable. the collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretionphase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in asupramassive sequence. in this last case the collapse is driven by energylosses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. for extremely supramassive neutronstars these energy losses cause a spin up. as a consequence the pulsar willhave a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. thisbehavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and thereforecould be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. if ther-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, thegravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a ns toroughly 2 ms. in this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even morecommon since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black holeduring accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency.

astro-ph;0502195	helium self--enrichment and the second parameter problem in m3 and m13	inspection of the cm diagrams of globular clusters having similar heavyelement content shows that the luminosity of the red giant bump relative to theturnoff (delta v_{to}^{bump}) differs by more than 0.1 mag between clusterswith different horizontal branch morphology. unfortunately, carefulconsideration of the data leaves us with only one pair (m3 and m13) of clustersgood for a quantitative discussion. for this pair we consider differences inage and helium content as possible causes for the difference in deltav_{to}^{bump}, and find more convincing support for the latter. a larger heliumcontent in m13 stars (y~0.28 vs. y~0.24) accounts for various cm diagramfeatures, such as the difference in the luminosity level of rr lyr variablesand of the red giant bump with respect to the turnoff luminosity, and thehorizontal branch morphology. this enhanced helium can be tentativelyunderstood in the framework of self--enrichment by massive asymptotic giantbranch stars in the first ~100 myr of the cluster life. a modestself--enrichment can be present also in m3 and can be the reason for the stillunexplained presence of a not negligible number of luminous, oosterhoff ii typerr lyr variables. the hypothesis that a larger helium content is the secondparameter for clusters with very blue horizontal branch morphology could bechecked by an accurate set of data for more clusters giving turnoff, rr lyrsand bump magnitudes within a unique photometry.

astro-ph;0505347	a helium spread among the main sequence stars in ngc 2808	we studied the color distribution of the main sequence of the globularcluster ngc 2808, based on new deep hst-wfpc2 photometry of a field in theuncrowded outskirts of the cluster. the color distribution of main sequencestars is wider than expected for a single stellar population, given our(carefully determined) measurement errors. about 20% of the sample stars aremuch bluer than expected and are most plausibly explained as a populationhaving a much larger helium abundance than the bulk of the main sequence. weestimate that the helium mass fraction of these stars is y ~ 0.4. ngc 2808 mayhave suffered self-enrichment, with different stellar populations born from theejecta of the intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars of thefirst generation. in addition to the y=0.40 stars, roughly 30% of the starsshould have y distributed between 0.26-0.29 while 50% have primordial y, toexplain also the peculiar horizontal branch morphology. three main stages ofstar formation are identified, the first with primordial helium content y ~0.24, the second one born from the winds of the most massive agbs of the firststellar generation (6-7msun), having y ~ 0.4, and a third one born from thematter ejected from less massive agbs (~ 3.5-4.5msun) with y ~ 0.26-0.29. for along hiatus of time (several 10^7yr) between the second and third generation,star formation might have been inhibited by the explosion of late supernovae iideriving from binary evolution.

astro-ph;0508259	85peg a: which age for a low metallicity solar like star?	we explore the possible evolutionary status of the primary component of thebinary 85 pegasi, listed as a target for asteroseismic observations by the mostsatellite. in spite of the assessed `subdwarf' status, and of the accuratedistance determination from the hipparcos data, the uncertainties in themetallicity and age, coupled with the uncertainty in the theoretical models,lead to a range of predictions on the oscillation frequency spectrum.nevertheless, the determination of the ratio between the small separation infrequency modes, and the large separation as suggested by roxburgh (2004),provides a very good measure of the star age, quite independent of themetallicity in the assumed uncertainty range. in this range, the constraint onthe dynamical mass and the further constraint provided by the assumption thatthe maximum age is 14 gyr limit the mass of 85pega to the range from 0.75 to0.82msun. this difference of a few hundreths of solar masses leads to welldetectable differences both in the evolutionary stage (age) and in theasteroseismic properties. we show that the age determination which will bepossible through the asteroseismic measurements for this star is independenteither from the convection model adopted or from the microscopic metaldiffusion. the latter conclusion is strengthened by the fact that, althoughmetal diffusion is still described in an approximate way, recent observationssuggest that the real stars suffer a smaller metal sedimentation with respectto the models.

astro-ph;0509051	why are massive o-rich agb stars in our galaxy not s-stars?	we present the main results derived from a chemical analysis carried out on alarge sample of galactic o-rich agb stars using high resolution opticalspectroscopy (r~40,000-50,000) with the intention of studying their lithiumabundances and/or possible s-process element enrichment. our chemical analysisshows that some stars are lithium overabundant while others are not. theobserved lithium overabundances are interpreted as a clear signature of theactivation of the so-called ``hot bottom burning'' (hbb) process in massivegalactic o-rich agb stars, as predicted by the models. however, these stars donot show the zirconium enhancement (taken as a representative for the s-processelement enrichment) associated to the third dredge-up phase following thermalpulses. our results suggest that the more massive o-rich agb stars in ourgalaxy behave differently from those in the magellanic clouds, which are bothli- and s-process-rich (s-type stars). reasons for this unexpected result arediscussed. we conclude that metallicity is probably the main responsible forthe differences observed and suggest that it may play a more important rolethan generally assumed in the chemical evolution of agb stars.

astro-ph;0511798	radio-ejection and bump-related orbital period gap of millisecond binary  pulsars	the monotonic increase of the radius of low mass stars during their ascent onthe red giant branch halts when they suffer a temporary contraction. thisoccurs when the hydrogen burning shell reaches the discontinuity in hydrogencontent left from the maximum increase in the convective extension, at the timeof the first dredge up, and produces a well known "bump" in the luminosityfunction of the red giants of globular clusters. if the giant is the masslosing component in a binary in which mass transfer occurs on the nuclearevolution time scale, this event produces a temporary stop in the masstransfer, which we will name "bump related" detachment. if the accretingcompanion is a neutron star, in which the previous mass transfer has spun upthe pulsar down to millisecond periods, the subsequent mass transfer phase maybe altered by the presence of the energetic pulsar. in fact, the onset of aradio--ejection phase produces loss of mass and angular momentum from thesytem. we show that this sequence of events may be at the basis of the shortageof systems with periods between ~ 20 and 60 days in the distribution ofbinaries containing millisecond pulsars. we predict that systems which can bediscovered at periods into the gap should have preferentially either magneticmoments smaller than ~ 2 x10^{26}gcm^3, or larger than ~ 4x10^{26}gcm^3. wefurther show that this period gap should not be present in population ii.

astro-ph;0606577	modelling the closest double degenerate system rxj0806.3+1527 and its  decreasing period	in the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary rxj0806.3+1527 consists of a low masshelium white dwarf (donor) transferring mass towards its more massive whitedwarf companion (primary), we consider as possible donors white dwarfs whichare the result of common envelope evolution occurring when the helium core massof the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2msun), so that they aresurrounded by a quite massive hydrogen envelope (~1/100msun or larger), andlive for a very long time supported by proton--proton burning. mass transferfrom such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogenburning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burningshell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.we model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that theradius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. thisradius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fullydegenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)the orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the perioddecrease of the binary rxj0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor ofabout 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problemconnected with the small x-ray luminosity of this object. the possibility thatsuch evolution describes the system rxj0806.3+1527 is also consistent with thepossible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whoseconfirmation would become a test of the model.

astro-ph;0609106	lithium and zirconium abundances in massive galactic o-rich agb stars	lithium and zirconium abundances (the latter taken as representative fors-process enrichment) are determined for a large sample of massive galactico-rich agb stars, for which high resolution optical spectroscopy has beenobtained (r=40,000-50,000). this is done by computing synthetic spectra basedon classical hydrostatic model atmospheres for cool stars using extensive linelists. the results obtained are discussed in the framework of hot bottomburning (hbb) and nucleosynthesis models. the complete sample is studiedattending to various observational properties such as the position of the starsin the iras two-colour diagram ([12]-[25] vs [25]-[60]), galactic distribution,expansion velocity (derived from the oh maser emission) and period ofvariability (when available). we conclude that a considerable fraction of thesources observed are actually massive agb stars (m &gt; 3-4 solar masses)experiencing hbb, as deduced from the strong li overabundances found. acomparison of our results with similar studies carried out in the past for themagellanic clouds (mcs) reveals that, in contrast to mc agb stars, our galacticsample does not show any indication of s-process element enrichment. thedifferences observed are explained as a consequence of metallicity effects.finally, we discuss the results obtained in the framework of stellar evolutionby comparing our results with the data available in the literature for galacticpost-agb stars and pne.

astro-ph;0610406	ngc 6441: another indication for a very high helium content in globular  cluster stars	the metal-rich bulge globular cluster ngc 6441 shows a well developed bluehorizontal branch (rich et al.), together with a strong slope upward from thered clump to the blue of the rr lyrae region. both features, the formercorresponding to the well-known second parameter problem, are not explained byconventional evolutionary models. helium self-enrichment is proposed as apossible solution to both questions, a mechanism already invoked for theinterpretation of the peculiarities in ngc 2808 and m13. we make use ofhorizontal branch simulations, covering a wide range in main sequence heliumabundance, to investigate whether the main features of ngc 6441 horizontalbranch population, including the rr lyrae variables period, can be reproduced.to describe the horizontal branch of ngc 6441, the helium content y in the redclump must reach at least 0.35; values up to y~0.37 are necessary to populatethe rr lyr region, reproducing also the observed mean long periods; dependingon the dispersion in mass loss assumed in the simulations, values up toy~0.38--0.40 are necessary to populate the blue hb. the total self--enrichedpopulation amounts to ~60% of the whole stellar content. self-enrichment andmultiple star formation episodes in the early evolution of globular clustersappear more and more able to account for many of the chemical and populationpeculiarities observed in these systems. the very large helium abundances(y&gt;0.35) required for ~14% of the horizontal branch population pose someproblem on the enrichment mechanisms.
