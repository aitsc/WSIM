0902.3237	the clustering of mgii absorption systems at z=0.5 and detection of cold  gas in massive halos	we measure the large-scale clustering of mgii \lambda\lambda 2796,2803absorbers with respect to a population of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) at z\sim 0.5. from the cross-correlation measurements between mgii absorbers andlrgs, we calculate the mean bias of the dark matter halos in which theabsorbers reside. we investigate systematic uncertainties in the clusteringmeasurements due to the sample selection of lrgs and due to uncertainties inphotometric redshifts. first, we compare the cross-correlation amplitudesdetermined using a it flux-limited lrg sample and a volume-limited one. thecomparison shows that the relative halo bias of mgii absorbers using aflux-limited lrg sample can be overestimated by as much as \approx 20%. next,we assess the systematic uncertainty due to photometric redshift errors using amock galaxy catalog with added redshift uncertainties comparable to the data.we show that the relative clustering amplitude measured without accounting forphotometric redshift uncertainties is overestimated by \approx 10%. afteraccounting for these two main uncertainties, we find a 1-\sigmaanti-correlation between mean halo bias and absorber strength that translatesinto a 1-\sigma anti-correlation between mean galaxy mass and w_r(2796). theresults indicate that a significant fraction of the mgii absorber population ofw_r(2796)=1-1.5 \aa are found in group-size dark matter halos of log m_h &lt;13.4, whereas absorbers of w_r(2796)&gt;1.5 \aa are seen in halos of log m_h&lt;12.7. a larger dataset would improve the precision of the clusteringmeasurements and the relationship between w_r and halo mass. finally, thestrong clustering of mgii absorbers down to \sim 0.3 h^{-1} mpc indicates thepresence of cool gas inside the virial radii of the halos hosting the lrgs.

0706.2364	super star cluster ngc1705-1: a local analogue to the birthsite of  long-duration gamma-ray bursts	recent observations suggest that global properties of the host galaxies forlong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are particularly well-suited for creatingthe massive star progenitors of these grbs. motivated by the hypothesis thatmassive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-metallicity galaxies area natural birthsite for grb progenitors, we present a comparison study of theism properties along the sightline toward the super star cluster, ngc1705-1,and those in distant grb hosts. using the same set of metal transitions in theuv and applying known ism structures in ngc1705, we find that ngc1705-1resembles distant grb host galaxies in its high neutral gas column, lowmolecular gas fraction, low metallicity, alpha-element enhancement,and low dustdepletion. the lack of molecular gas is due to the enhanced uv radiation fieldin the starburst environment, consistent with the expectations for grbprogenitors. in addition, the known presence of dense neutral gas clouds atr&lt;500 pc from ngc1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of c^+, si^+, and fe^+ions that may be subsequently excited by the afterglow uv radiation field toproduce excited lines commonly seen in grb host ism. we further argue that theapparent offset in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionizationtransitions from absorption-line observations alone already offers importantclues for related starburst episodes in grb host galaxies. our study shows thata statistical comparison between the ism around star clusters and high-redshiftgrb progenitors is important for identifying the key physical parameters thatfacilitate the formation of grbs.

0908.3691	on the redshift evolution of mgii absorption systems	we use a halo occupation approach to connect mgii absorbers to dark matterhalos as a function of redshift. using the model constructed in tinker &amp; chen(2008), we parameterize the conditional probability of an absorber ofequivalent width wr being produced by a halo of mass m_h at a given redshift,p(wr|m_h,z). we constrain the free parameters of the model by matching theobserved statistics of mgii absorbers: the frequency function f(wr), theredshift evolution n(z), and the clustering bias b(wr). the redshift evolutionof wr&gt;1 a absorbers increases from z=0.4 to z=2, while the total halo crosssection decreases monotonically with redshift. this discrepancy can only beexplained if the gaseous halos evolve with respect to their host halos. we makepredictions for the clustering bias of absorbers as a function of redshiftunder different evolutionary scenarios, eg, the gas cross section per haloevolves or the halo mass scale of absorbers changes. we demonstrate that therelative contribution of these scenarios may be constrained by measurements ofabsorber clustering at z&gt;1 and z~0.1. if we further assume aredshift-independent mass scale for efficient shock heating of halo gas ofmcrit = 10^{11.5} msol/h, absorber evolution is predominantly caused by achanging halo mass scale of absorbers. our model predicts that strong absorbersalways arise in ~mcrit halos, independent of redshift, but the mass scale ofweak absorbers decreases by 2 dex from 0&lt;z&lt;2. thus, the measuredanti-correlation of clustering bias and wr should flatten by z~1.5.

0707.2594	a new constraint on the escape fraction in distant galaxies using  gamma-ray burst afterglow spectroscopy	we describe a new method to measure the escape fraction fesc of ionizingradiation from distant star-forming galaxies using the afterglow spectra oflong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs). optical spectra of grb afterglows allowus to evaluate the optical depth of the host ism, according to the neutralhydrogen column density n(hi) observed along the sightlines toward thestar-forming regions where the grbs are found. different from previous effortin searching for faint, transmitted lyman continuum photons, our method is notsubject to background subtraction uncertainties and does not require priorknowledge of either the spectral shape of the host galaxy population or the igmlya forest absorption along these grb sightlines. because most grbs occur insub-l_* galaxies, our study also offers the first constraint on fesc fordistant low-mass galaxies that dominate the cosmic luminosity density. we havecompiled a sample of 27 grbs at redshift z&gt;2 for which the underlying n(hi) inthe host ism are known. these grbs together offer a statistical sampling of theintegrated optical depth to ionizing photons along random sightlines fromstar-forming regions in the host galaxies, and allow us to estimate the meanescape fraction &lt;fesc&gt; averaged over different viewing angles. we find&lt;fesc&gt;=0.02\pm 0.02 and place a 95% c.l. upper limit &lt;fesc&gt; &lt;= 0.075 for thesehosts. we discuss possible biases of our approach and implications of theresult. finally, we propose to extend this technique for measuring &lt;fesc&gt; atz~0.2 using spectra of core-collapse supernovae.

1011.0735	what determines the incidence and extent of mgii absorbing gas around  galaxies?	we study the connections between on-going star formation, galaxy mass, andextended halo gas, in order to distinguish between starburst-driven outflowsand infalling clouds that produce the majority of observed mgii absorbers atlarge galactic radii (&gt;~ 10 h^{-1} kpc) and to gain insights into halo gascontents around galaxies. we present new measurements of total stellar mass(m_star), h-alpha emission line strength (ew(h-alpha)), and specific starformation rate (ssfr) for the 94 galaxies published in h.-w. chen et al.(2010). we find that the extent of mgii absorbing gas, r_mgii, scales withm_star and ssfr, following r_mgii \propto m_star^{0.28}\times ssfr^{0.11}. thestrong dependence of r_mgii on m_star is most naturally explained, if moremassive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed mgiiabsorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formationin the galaxies. the additional scaling relation of r_mgii with ssfr can beunderstood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburstoutflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos.the latter is motivated by the well-known ssfr--m_star} inverse correlation infield galaxies. our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and mgiiabsorbers along common sightlines provides an empirical characterization ofhalo gaseous radius versus halo mass. a comparison study of r_mgii around red-and blue-sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint forresolving the physical origin of the observed ssfr--m_star} relation ingalaxies.

1011.6390	star formation from dla gas in the outskirts of lyman break galaxies at  z~3	we present evidence for spatially extended low surface brightness emissionaround lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the v band image of the hubble ultra deepfield, corresponding to the z~3 rest-frame fuv light, which is a sensitivemeasure of star formation rates (sfrs). we find that the covering fraction ofmolecular gas at z~3 is not adequate to explain the emission in the outskirtsof lbgs, while the covering fraction of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gasat high redshift is sufficient. we develop a theoretical framework to connectthis emission around lbgs to the expected emission from neutral h i gas i.e.,damped lyman alpha systems (dlas), using the kennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation.working under the hypothesis that the observed fuv emission in the outskirts oflbgs is from in situ star formation in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas, theresults suggest that the sfr efficiency in such gas at z~3 is between factorsof 10 and 50 lower than predictions based on the local ks relation. the totalsfr density in atomic-dominated gas at z~3 is constrained to be ~10% of thatobserved from the inner regions of lbgs. in addition, the metals produced by insitu star formation in the outskirts of lbgs yield metallicities comparable tothose of dlas, which is a possible solution to the "missing metals" problem fordlas. finally, the atomic-dominated gas in the outskirts of galaxies at bothhigh and low redshifts has similar reduced sfr efficiencies and is consistentwith the same power law.

0709.1470	on the halo occupation of dark baryons	we introduce a new technique that adopts the halo occupation framework forunderstanding the origin of qso absorption-line systems. our initial studyfocuses specifically on mgii absorbers. we construct a model of the gaseouscontent in which the absorption equivalent width w_r is determined by the theamount of cold gas, in the form of discrete clouds, along a sightline through ahalo. the two quantities that we specify per halo in the model are (1) the meanabsorption strength per unit surface mass density a_w(m), and (2) the meancovering factor kappa_g(m) of the gaseous clouds. these parameters determinethe conditional probability distribution of w_r as a function of halo mass,p(w_r|m). two empirical measurements are applied to constrain the model: (i)the absorber frequency distribution function and (ii) the w_r-dependentclustering amplitude. we find that the data demand a rapid transition in thegas content of halos at ~10^11.5 msol/h, below which halos containpredominantly cold gas and beyond which gas becomes predominantly hot. in orderto reproduce the observed overall strong clustering of the absorbers and theanti-correlation between w_r and halo mass m, roughly 5% of gas in halos up to10^14 msol/h is required to be cold. the gas covering factor is near unity overa wide range of halo mass, supporting that mg ii systems probe an unbiasedsample of typical galaxies. we discuss the implications of our study in thecontexts of mass assembly of distant galaxies and the origin of qso absorptionline systems.

1108.0656	red nuggets at high redshift: structural evolution of quiescent galaxies  over 10 gyr of cosmic history	we present an analysis of the size growth seen in early-type galaxies over 10gyr of cosmic time. our analysis is based on a homogeneous synthesis ofpublished data from 17 spectroscopic surveys observed at similar spatialresolution, augmented by new measurements for galaxies in the gemini deep deepsurvey. in total, our sample contains structural data for 465 galaxies (mainlyearly-type) in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.7. the size evolution ofpassively-evolving galaxies over this redshift range is gradual and continuous,with no evidence for an end or change to the process around z~1, as has beenhinted at by some surveys which analyze subsets of the data in isolation. thesize growth appears to be independent of stellar mass, with the mass-normalizedhalf-light radius scaling with redshift as r_e (1+z)^(-1.62 +/- 0.34).surprisingly, this power law seems to be in good agreement with the recentlyreported continuous size evolution of uv-bright galaxies in the redshift rangez~0.5-3.5. it is also in accordance with the predictions from recenttheoretical models.

1108.4057	the star formation history of luminous red galaxies hosting mgii  absorbers	we present a spectroscopic sample of z \approx 0.5 luminous red galaxies(lrgs) that are located within physical projected distances \rho \leq 350 kpc/hof a qso sightline. of the 37 lrgs in our sample, eight have associated mgiiabsorbers with rest-frame equivalent width wr(2796)&gt;0.3a and velocityseparation |dv| \leq 350 km/s and 29 do not have associated mgii absorbers to a2-sigma limit of wr(2796)=0.3a. we perform a stellar population synthesisanalysis using stacked spectra of the mgii absorbing and non-absorbing lrgsubsamples. we find that lrgs with or without associated mgii absorbers sharesimilar star formation histories and are best described by old stellarpopulation models (\geq 1 gyr). younger stellar populations (\leq 1 gyr) failto reproduce their spectra. these findings are consistent with the lack of[oii] emission features in the lrg spectra. the primarily old stellarpopulations in the lrgs indicate that starburst driven outflows are unlikely toexplain the observed mgii absorbers at large distances from the lrgs. inaddition, the spectroscopic lrg sample allows us to derive a sensitiveconstraint for the cool gas covering fraction of &lt;\kappa&gt;=14 +/- 6% in the lrghalos for absorbers of wr(2796)&gt;0.3a. finally, we speculate on the origin ofthe observed mgii absorbers around the lrgs.

1110.0487	near-infrared spectroscopy of grb host galaxies at z &gt;~ 1.5: insights  into host galaxy dynamics and interpretations of afterglow absorption spectra	this paper presents near-infrared echellette spectra of faint galaxies in thefields around grb 050820a at redshift z=2.613 and grb 060418 at z=1.490. thespectroscopic data show that both grbs originate in a dynamic environment ofinteracting galaxies separated by &lt; 15 h^{-1} kpc in projected distance and|dv| &lt;~ 60 km/s in line-of-sight velocity. the optical afterglows revealed inearly-epoch hubble space telescope images are at least 2.5 h^{-1} kpc (or 0.4")away from the high surface brightness regions of the interacting members,indicating that the grb events occurred either in the outskirts of a compactstar-forming galaxy or in a low surface brightness satellite. comparisons ofthe systemic redshifts of the host galaxies and the velocity distribution ofabsorbing clouds revealed in early-time afterglow spectra further show that themajority of the absorbing clouds are redshifted from these compact star-forminggalaxies. these include the gas producing fine-structure absorption lines atphysical distances d ~ a few x 100 pc from the grb afterglow. the lack ofblueshifted absorbing clouds and the spatial offset of the grb event from thestar-forming regions make it difficult to attribute the observed large velocityspread (~ 200-400 km/s) of absorbing gas in the grb host to galactic-scaleoutflows. we consider a scenario in which the grb event occurred in a dwarfsatellite of the interacting group and interpret the broad absorptionsignatures in the afterglow spectra as a collective effect of the turbulenthalo gas and the host star-forming ism. we briefly discuss the implications forthe absorption properties observed in the afterglow spectra.

1110.3321	on the observed w_mgii--l_[oii] correlation in sdss qso spectra	this paper investigates the effect of differential aperture loss with sdssfibers and examines whether such selection bias would result in the observedcorrelation between rest-frame absorption equivalent width of mgii absorbers,wr(2796), and mean associated [oii] luminosity, l_[oii], in sdss qso spectra.we demonstrate based on a monte carlo simulation that the observed wr(2796) vs.l_[oii] correlation of mgii absorbers can be well-reproduced, if all galaxiesfound in deep surveys possess extended mgii halos and if the extent of mgiihalos scales proportionally with galaxy mass as shown in previous studies. theobserved correlation can be explained by a combination of (1) the knownwr(2796) vs. rho anti-correlation in galaxy and mgii absorber pairs and (2) anincreasing aperture loss in the 3" diameter sdss fiber for galaxies at largerrho. galaxies at larger projected distances produce on average weaker mgiiabsorbers and weaker (or zero) l_[oii] in sdss qso spectra. we show that suchcorrelation diminishes when larger fibers are adopted and is therefore notphysical. while under a simple halo model the majority of mgii absorbers do notdirectly probe star-forming disks, they trace photo-ionized halo gas associatedwith galaxies. we show that because of the scaling relation between extendedgas cross-section and galaxy mass, the number density evolution of the mgiiabsorber population as a whole provides a good measure of the cosmic starformation history.

(2009) andplace constraints on the evolution of lambda_mfp with redshift, including anestimate of the "breakthrough" redshift of z = 1.6. consistent with results athigher z, we find that a significant fraction of the opacity for absorption ofionizing photons comes from systems with n_hi &lt;= 10^{17.5} cm^(-2) with a valuefor the total lyman opacity of tau_lyman = 0.40 +/- 0.15. finally, we determinethat at minimum, a 5-parameter (4 power-law) model is needed to describe thecolumn density distribution function f(n_hi, x) at z \sim 2.4, find thatf(n_hi,x) undergoes no significant change in shape between z \sim 2.4 and z\sim 3.7, and provide our best fit model for f(n_hi,x).

1204.6316	warm gas in the virgo cluster: i. distribution of lya absorbers	the first systematic study of the warm gas (t=10^4-5 k) distribution across agalaxy cluster is presented using multiple background qsos to the virgocluster. we detect 25 lya absorbers (n_hi = 10^13.1-15.4 cm^-2) in the virgovelocity range toward 9 of 12 qso sightlines observed with cosmic originspectrograph, with a cluster impact parameter range of 0.36-1.65 mpc(0.23-1.05r_vir). including 18 lya absorbers previously detected by stis orghrs toward 7 of 11 background qsos in and around the virgo cluster, weestablish a sample of 43 absorbers towards a total of 23 background probes forstudying the incidence of lya absorbers in and around the virgo cluster. withthese absorbers, we find: (1) warm gas is predominantly in the outskirts of thecluster and avoids the x-ray detected hot icm. also, lya absorption strengthincreases with cluster impact parameter. (2) lya absorbing warm gas traces coldhi emitting gas in the substructures of the virgo cluster. (3) including theabsorbers associated with the surrounding substructures, the warm gas coveringfraction (100% for n_hi &gt; 10^13.1 cm^-2) is in agreement with cosmologicalsimulations. we speculate that the observed warm gas is part of large-scale gasflows feeding the cluster both the icm and galaxies.

1205.4037	empirical constraints of super-galactic winds at z &gt;= 0.5	(abridged) under the hypothesis that mgii absorbers found near the minor axisof a galaxy originate in the cool phase of winds, we carry out a study toconstrain the properties of large-scale outflows at redshift z &gt;= 0.5 based onthe observed relative motions of individual absorbing clouds with respect tothe positions and orientations of the galaxies. we identify in the literaturefour highly inclined disk galaxies located within 50 kpc and with the minoraxis oriented within 45 degrees of a background qso sightline. deep hst imagesof the galaxies are available for accurate morphologies of the galaxies.echelle spectra of the qso members are also available in public archives forresolving the velocity field of individual absorption clumps. three galaxies inour sample are located at rho=8-34 kpc and exhibit strong associated mgiiabsorption feature with wr(2796) &gt;= 0.8 {\aa}. one galaxy, located at an impactparameters rho=48 kpc, does not show an associated mgii absorber to a 3-sigmalimit of wr(2796)=0.01{\aa}. combining known inclination and orientation anglesof the star-forming disks, and resolved absorption profiles of the associatedabsorbers at rho &lt; 35 kpc, we explore the parameter space for the opening angletheta_0 and the velocity field of large-scale galactic outflows as a functionof z-height, v(z). we find that the absorption profiles of the mgii doubletsand feii series are compatible with the gas being either accelerated ordecelerated, depending on theta_0, though accelerated outflows are valid onlyfor a narrow range of theta_0. under an acceleration scenario, we compare thederived $v(z)$ with predictions from murray et al.

0705.0387	on the incidence of c iv absorbers along the sightlines to gamma-ray  bursts	we report on the statistics of strong (w_r &gt; 0.15 a) c iv absorbers atz=1.5-3.5 toward high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (grbs). in contrast with arecent survey for strong mg ii absorption systems at z &lt; 2, we find that thenumber of c iv absorbers per unit redshift dn/dz does not show a significantdeviation from previous surveys using quasi-stellar objects (qsos) asbackground sources. we find that the number density of c iv toward grbs isdn/dz(z~1.5)= 2.2 +2.8/-1.4, dn/dz(z~2.5)= 2.3 +1.8/-1.1 and dn/dz(z~3.5)= 1.1+2.6/-0.9. these numbers are consistent with previous c iv surveys using qsospectra. binning the entire dataset, we set a 95% c.l. upper limit to theexcess of c iv absorbers along grb sightlines at twice the incidence observedalong qso sightlines. furthermore, the distribution of equivalent widths of thegrb and qso samples are consistent with being drawn from the same parentpopulation. although the results for mg ii and c iv absorbers along grbsightlines appear to contradict one another, we note that the surveys arenearly disjoint: the c iv survey corresponds to higher redshift and more highlyionized gas than the mg ii survey. nevertheless, analysis on larger statisticalsamples may constrain properties of the galaxies hosting these metals (e.g.mass, dust content) and/or the coherence-length of the gas giving rise to themetal-line absorption.

0801.2169	the baryon content of dark matter halos: empirical constraints from mgii  absorbers	we have initiated a survey of mgii 2796, 2803 absorbers near known galaxiesat projected distances rho&lt;~100 h^-1 kpc to a background qso, in order toconstrain the extent and covering fraction of mg^+ ions around galaxies ofdifferent luminosity and mass. the current sample consists of 13 galaxy andabsorber pairs and 10 galaxies that do not produce mgii absorption lines towithin sensitive upper limits. the redshifts of the galaxy and absorber pairsrange from z = 0.2067 to 0.892 with a median of z = 0.3818. we find thatgalaxies at larger impact parameters produce on average weaker mgii absorbers.this anti-correlation is substantially improved when accounting for theintrinsic luminosities of individual galaxies. in addition, there exists adistinct boundary at rho=r_gas, beyond which no mgii absorbers are found. amaximum likelihood analysis shows that the observations are best described byan isothermal density profile and a scaling relation r_gas = 91 x(l_b/l_{b_*})^(0.35 +/- 0.05) h^-1 kpc (or 69 h^-1 kpc at w(2796)=0.3 ang) witha mean covering factor of &lt;kappa&gt;=80-86%. together with the scaling relationbetween halo mass and galaxy luminosity inferred from halo occupation studies,this scaling of r_gas indicates that gas radius is a fixed fraction of the darkmatter halo radius. we compare our results with previous studies and discussthe implications of our analysis for constraining the baryon content ofgalactic halos and for discriminating between competing scenarios forunderstanding the nature of the extended gas.

0801.2380	a stis survey for ovi absorption systems at 0.12 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 i.: the  statistical properties of ionized gas	we have conducted a systematic survey for intervening ovi absorbers inavailable echelle spectra of 16 qsos at z_qso = 0.17-0.57. these spectra wereobtained using hst/stis with the e140m grating. our search uncovered a total of27 foreground ovi absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent widthw_r(1031) &gt; 25ma. ten of these qsos exhibit strong ovi absorbers in theirvicinity. our ovi survey does not require the known presence of lya, and theechelle resolution allows us to identify the ovi absorption doublet based ontheir common line centroid and known flux ratio. we estimate the total redshiftsurvey path, \delta z, using a series of monte-carlo simulations, and find that\delta z=1.66, 2.18, and 2.42 for absorbers of strength w_r = 30, 50 and 80ma,respectively, leading to a number density of dn(w &gt; 50ma)/dz = 6.7 +/- 1.7 anddn(w &gt; 30ma)/dz = 10.4 +/- 2.2. in contrast, we also measure dn/dz = 27 +/- 9for ovi absorbers of w_r &gt; 50ma at |\delta v|&lt; 5000 kms from the backgroundqsos. using the random sample of ovi absorbers with well characterized surveycompleteness, we estimate a mean cosmological mass density of the ovi gas\omega(ovi)h = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10^-7. in addition, we show that &lt;5% of oviabsorbers originate in underdense regions that do not show a significant traceof hi. furthermore, we show that the neutral gas column n(hi) associated withthese ovi absorbers spans nearly five orders of magnitude, and show moderatecorrelation with n(ovi). finally, while the number density of ovi absorbersvaries substantially from one sightline to another, it also appears to beinversely correlated with the number density of hi absorbers along individuallines of sight.

1308.2681	probing the igm-galaxy connection at z&lt;0.5 ii. new insights into the  galaxy environments of ovi absorbers in pks 0405-123	we present new absorption-line analysis and new galaxy survey data obtainedfor the field around pks0405-123 at z=0.57. combining previously known oviabsorbers with new identifications in the higher s/n uv spectra obtained withcos, we have established a sample of 7 ovi absorbers and 12 individualcomponents at z=0.0918-0.495 along the sightline toward pks0405-123. wecomplement the available uv absorption spectra with galaxy survey data thatreach 100% completeness at projected distances rho&lt;200 kpc of the quasarsightline for galaxies as faint as 0.1l* (0.2l*) out to redshifts of z=0.35(z=0.5). the high level of completeness achieved at faint magnitudes by oursurvey reveals that ovi absorbers are closely associated with gas-richenvironments containing at least one low-mass, emission-line galaxy. anintriguing exception is a strong ovi system at z=0.183 that does not have agalaxy found at rho&lt;4 mpc, and our survey rules out the presence of anygalaxies of l&gt;0.04l* at rho&lt;250 kpc and any galaxies of l&gt;0.3l* at rho&lt;1 mpc.we further examine the galactic environments of ovi absorbers and those"lya-only" absorbers with hi column density log n(hi)&gt;13.6 and no detectableovi absorption features. the lya-only absorbers serve as a control sample inseeking the discriminating galactic features that result in the observed oviabsorbing gas at large galactic radii. we find a clear distinction in theradial profiles of mean galaxy surface brightness around different absorbers.specifically, ovi absorbers are found to reside in regions of higher meansurface brightness at rho&lt;500 kpc (+5 mag mpc^-2 relative to the background),while only a mild increase in galaxy surface brightness is seen at small rhoaround lya-only absorbers (+2 mag mpc^-2). the additional insights gained fromour deep galaxy survey demonstrates the need to probe to low luminosities tobetter understand absorbing systems.

1312.0016	spatially resolved velocity maps of halo gas around two  intermediate-redshift galaxies	absorption-line spectroscopy of multiply-lensed qsos near a known foregroundgalaxy provides a unique opportunity to go beyond the traditionalone-dimensional application of qso probes and establish a crudethree-dimensional (3d) map of halo gas around the galaxy that records theline-of-sight velocity field at different locations in the gaseous halo. twointermediate-redshift galaxies are targeted in the field around thequadruply-lensed qso he0435-1223 at redshift z=1.689, and absorptionspectroscopy along each of the lensed qsos is carried out in the vicinities ofthese galaxies. one galaxy is a typical, star-forming l* galaxy at z=0.4188 andprojected distance of rho=50 kpc from the lensing galaxy. the other is asuper-l* barred spiral at z=0.7818 and rho=33 kpc. combining known orientationsof the quadruply-lensed qso to the two foreground galaxies with the observedmgii absorption profiles along individual qso sightlines has for the first timeled to spatially resolved kinematics of tenuous halo gas on scales of 5-10 kpcat z&gt;0.2. a mgii absorber is detected in every sightline observed through thehalos of the two galaxies, and the recorded absorber strength is typical ofwhat is seen in previous close qso--galaxy pair studies. while themulti-sightline study confirms the unity covering fraction of mgii absorbinggas at rho &lt; 50 kpc from star-forming disks, the galaxies also present twocontrasting examples of complex halo gas kinematics. different models,including a rotating disk, collimated outflows, and gaseous streams from eitheraccretion or tidal/ram-pressure stripping, are considered for comparisons withthe absorption-line observations, and infalling streams/stripped gas of width&gt;~ 10 kpc are found to best describe the observed gas kinematics acrossmultiple sightlines.

1503.04199	on the possible environmental effect in distributing heavy elements  beyond individual gaseous halos	we present a study of extended galaxy halo gas through hi and ovi absorptionover two decades in projected distance at $z\approx0.2$. the study is based ona sample of $95$ galaxies from a highly complete ($ &gt; 80\%$) survey of faintgalaxies ($l &gt; 0.1l_*$) with archival quasar absorption spectra and $53$galaxies from the literature. a clear anti-correlation is found between hi(ovi) column density and virial radius normalized projected distance, $d/r_{\rmh}$. strong hi (ovi) absorption systems with column densities greater than$10^{14.0}$ ($10^{13.5}$) cm$^{-2}$ are found for $48$ of $54$ ($36$ of $42$)galaxies at $d &lt; \,r_{\rm h}$ indicating a mean covering fraction of$\langle\kappa_{\rm hi}\rangle=0.89$ ($\langle\kappa_{\rm ovi}\rangle=0.86$).ovi absorbers are found at $d\approx r_{\rm h}$, beyond the extent observed forlower ionization species. at $d/r_{\rm h}=1-3$ strong hi (ovi) absorptionsystems are found for only $7$ of $43$ ($5$ of $34$) galaxies($\langle\kappa_{\rm hi}\rangle=0.16$ and $\langle\kappa_{\rmovi}\rangle=0.15$). beyond $d=3\,r_{\rm h}$, the hi and ovi covering fractionsdecrease to levels consistent with coincidental systems. the high completenessof the galaxy survey enables an investigation of environmental dependence ofextended gas properties. galaxies with nearby neighbors exhibit a modestincrease in ovi covering fraction at $d&gt;r_{\rm h}$ compared to isolatedgalaxies ($\kappa_{\rm ovi}\approx0.13$ versus $0.04$) but no excess hiabsorption. these findings suggest that environmental effects play a role indistributing heavy elements beyond the enriched gaseous halos of individualgalaxies. finally, we find that differential hi and ovi absorption betweenearly- and late-type galaxies continues from $d &lt; r_{\rm h}$ to$d\approx3\,r_{\rm h}$.

1505.07838	on the origin of excess cool gas in quasar host halos	previous observations of quasar host halos at z=2 have uncovered largequantities of cool gas that exceed what is found around inactive galaxies ofboth lower and higher masses. to better understand the source of this excesscool gas, we compiled an exhaustive sample of 195 quasars at z=1 withconstraints on chemically enriched, cool gas traced by mgii absorption inbackground quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey. this quasar samplespans a broad range of luminosities from lbol=10^44.4 to 10^46.8 erg/s andallows an investigation of whether halo gas properties are connected withquasar properties. we find a strong correlation between luminosity and cool gascovering fraction. in particular, low-luminosity quasars exhibit a mean gascovering fraction comparable to inactive galaxies of similar masses, but moreluminous quasars exhibit excess cool gas approaching what is reportedpreviously at z=2. moreover, 30-40% of the mgii absorption occurs at radialvelocities of |v|&gt;300 km/s from the quasar, inconsistent with gas bound to atypical quasar host halo. the large velocity offsets and observed luminositydependence of the cool gas near quasars can be explained if the gas arisesfrom: (1) neighboring halos correlated through large-scale structure at mpcscales, (2) feedback from luminous quasars, or (3) debris from the mergersthought to trigger luminous quasars. the first of these scenarios is in tensionwith the lack of correlation between quasar luminosity and clustering while thelatter two make distinct predictions that can be tested with additionalobservations.

0806.0399	a survey for nv absorption at z~z_grb in grb afterglow spectra: clues to  gas near the progenitor star	we survey nv absorption in the afterglow spectra of long-duration gamma-raybursts (grbs) with the intent to study highly ionized gas in the galaxieshosting these events. we identify a high incidence (6/7) of spectra exhibitingnv gas with z~z_grb and the majority show large column densities nv &gt; 10^14cm^-2. with one exception, the observed line-profiles are kinematically `cold',i.e. they are narrow and have small velocity offset (dv &lt; 20 km/s) fromabsorption lines associated with neutral gas. in addition, the nv absorptionhas similar velocity as the uv-pumped fine-structure lines indicating thesehigh ions are located within ~1kpc of the grb afterglow. these characteristicsare unlike those for nv gas detected in the halo/disk of the milky way or alongsightlines through high z damped lya systems but resemble the narrow absorptionline systems associated with quasars and some high z starbursts. we demonstratethat grb afterglows photoionize nitrogen to nv at r~10pc. this process canproduce nv absorption with characteristics resembling the majority of oursample and and we argue it is the principal mechanism for nv along grbsightlines. therefore, the observations provide a snapshot of the physicalconditions at this distance. in this scenario, the observations imply theprogenitor's stellar wind is confined to r&lt;10pc which suggests the grbprogenitors occur within dense (n &gt; 10^3 cm^-3) environments, typical ofmolecular clouds. the observations, therefore, primarily constrain the physicalconditions -- metallicity, density, velocity fields -- of the gas within the(former) molecular cloud region surrounding the grb.

astro-ph;0007447	on the compared accuracy and reliability of spectroscopic and  photometric redshift measurements	we present a comparison between the spectroscopic catalog of the hdf recentlypublished by cohen et al and the redshifts measured by our group for thoseobjects using photometric techniques. we perform this comparison in order tocharacterize the errors associated to the photometric redshift technique. thespectroscopic sample includes over 140 objects in the hdf proper, representingthe deepest, cleanest, most complete spectroscopic catalog ever compiled. westudy each object for which our redshift and the one measured by cohen et aldisagree. in most cases the photometric evidence is strong enough to call for acareful review of the spectroscopic values, as they seem to be in error. it ispossible to characterize the systematic errors associated to our technique,which when combined with the photometric errors allow us to obtain completeinformation on the redshift of each galaxy and its associated confidenceinterval, regardless of apparent magnitude. one of the main conclusions of thisstudy is that, to date, all the redshifts from our published catalog that havebeen checked have been shown to be correct (within the stated confidencelimits). this implies that our galaxy template set is a fair representation ofthe galaxy population at all redshifts (0&lt;z&lt;6) and magnitudes (r&lt;24) exploredto date. on the other hand, spectroscopy of faint sources is subject to unknownand uncharacterized systematic errors, that will in turn be transmitted to anyphotometric redshift technique which uses spectroscopic samples as calibration.our analysis proves that photometric redshift techniques can and must be usedto extend the range of applicability of the spectroscopic redshiftmeasurements.

astro-ph;0011558	the unusual spectral energy distribution of a galaxy previously reported  to be at redshift 6.68	observations of distant galaxies are important both for understanding howgalaxies form and for probing the physical conditions of the universe at theearliest epochs. it is, however, extremely difficult to identify galaxies atredshift z&gt;5, because these galaxies are faint and exhibit few spectralfeatures. in a previous work, we presented observations that supported theidentification of a galaxy at redshift z = 6.68 in a deep stis field. here wepresent new ground-based photometry of the galaxy. we find that the galaxyexhibits moderate detections of flux in the optical b and v images that areinconsistent with the expected absence of flux at wavelength shortward of theredshifted lyman-alpha emission line of a galaxy at redshift z&gt;5. in addition,the new broad-band imaging data not only show flux measurements of this galaxythat are incompatible with the previous stis measurement, but also suggest apeculiar spectral energy distribution that cannot be fit with any galaxyspectral template at any redshift. we therefore conclude that the redshiftidentification of this galaxy remains undetermined.

astro-ph;0104403	the origin of c iv absorption systems at redshifts z&lt;1---discovery of  extended c iv envelopes around galaxies	(abridged) we report the discovery of extended civ gaseous envelopes aroundgalaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type. first, we showthat civ absorption systems are strongly clustered around galaxies on velocityscales of v &lt; 250 km/s and impact parameter scales of rho &lt; 100 h^{-1} kpc butnot on larger velocity or impact parameter scales. next, adopting measurementsof galaxy properties presented in previous papers, we examine how properties ofthe civ absorption systems depend on properties of the galaxies. on the basisof 14 galaxy and absorber pairs and 36 galaxies that do not producecorresponding civ absorption lines to within sensitive upper limits, we findthat: (1) galaxies of a range of morphological type and luminosity appear topossess extended civ gaseous envelopes of radius r ~ 100 h^{-1} kpc, withabrupt boundaries between the civ absorbing and non-absorbing regions. (2) theextent of civ-absorbing gas around galaxies scales with galaxy b-bandluminosity as r \propto l_b^{0.5 +/- 0.1} but does not depend strongly ongalaxy surface brightness, redshift, or morphological type. and (3) thecovering factor of civ clouds within ~ 100 h^{-1} kpc of galaxies is nearlyunity, but there is a large scatter in the mean number of clouds encounteredalong the line of sight. the most significant implication of the study is thatgalaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphological type are surrounded bychemically enriched gas that extends for at least ~ 100 h^{-1} kpc. we considervarious scenarios that may have produced metals at large galactic distance andconclude that accreting satellites are most likely to be responsible forchemically enriched gas at large galactic distances to regular lookinggalaxies.

(1995)and chen et al. (1998) that (1) extended gaseous envelopes are a common andgeneric feature of galaxies of a wide range of luminosity and morphologicaltype, (2) the extent of tenuous gas (n(h i) &gt; 10^{14} cm^{-2} around galaxiesscales with galaxy b-band luminosity as r\propto l_b^{0.39+/-0.09}, and (3)galaxy interactions do not play an important role in distributing tenuous gasaround galaxies in most cases. we further demonstrate that (4) the gaseousextent of galaxies scales with galaxy k-band luminosity as r\proptol_k^{0.28+/-0.08}, and (5) tenuous gas around typical l_* galaxies is likely tobe distributed in spherical halos of radius ~ 180 h^{-1} kpc of covering factorof nearly unity. because galaxies of all morphological types possess extendedgaseous halos and because the extent of tenuous gas around galaxies scales withgalaxy k-band luminosity, we argue that galaxy mass---rather than recentstar-formation activity---is likely to be the dominant factor that determinesthe extent of tenuous gas around galaxies. nevertheless, applying the scalingrelationship between the extent of lya absorbing gas around galaxies and galaxyb-band luminosity, the results of our analysis also suggest that the numberdensity evolution of lya absorption systems may serve to constrain theevolution of the comoving galaxy b-band luminosity density (at least for theredshift interval between z~0 and z~1 that has been studied in our survey).

astro-ph;0107295	discovery of the galaxy proximity effect and implications for  measurements of the ionizing background radiation at low redshifts	we present an analysis of galaxy and qso absorption line pairs toward 24 qsosat redshifts between z~0.2 and 1 in an effort to establish the relationshipbetween galaxies and absorption lines in physical proximity to qsos. wedemonstrate the existence of a galaxy proximity effect, in that galaxies in thevicinities of qsos do not show the same incidence and extent of gaseousenvelopes as galaxies far from qsos. we show that the galaxy proximity effectexists to galaxy-qso velocity separations of ~ 3000 km/s, much larger than thesize of a typical cluster (~ 1000 km/s), i.e. it is more comparable to thescale of the sphere of influence of qso ionizing radiation rather than thescale of galaxy-qso clustering. this indicates that the qso ionizing radiationrather than some dynamical effect from the cluster environment is responsiblefor the galaxy proximity effect. we combine previous findings that (1) many ormost lya absorption lines arise in extended galaxy envelopes, and (2) galaxiescluster around qsos to show that the magnitude of the lya forest proximityeffect is underestimated. consequently, determinations of the uv ionizingbackground intensity using the proximity effect are likely overestimated. weuse the galaxy-qso cross-correlation function measured from our data toestimate the magnitude of this overestimate and find that it could be as highas a factor of 20 at z&lt;1. this can have strong implications for models of theorigin and evolution of the ionizing background, and may indicate that qsosproduce sufficient ionizing flux at all redshifts to account for the entirebackground radiation field.

astro-ph;0111129	the star formation rate intensity distribution function--implications  for the cosmic star formation rate history of the universe	we address the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming onobservations of faint galaxies by examining the distribution of "unobscured"star formation rate intensities versus redshift. we use the star formation rateintensity distribution function to assess the ultraviolet luminosity densityversus redshift, based on our photometry and photometric redshift measurementsof faint galaxies in the hdf and the hdf--s wfpc2 and nicmos fields. we findthat (1) previous measurements have missed a dominant fraction of theultraviolet luminosity density of the universe at high redshifts by neglectingcosmological surface brightness dimming effects, which are important atredshifts larger than z = 2, (2) the incidence of the highest intensity starforming regions increases monotonically with redshift, and (3) the ultravioletluminosity density plausibly increases monotonically with redshift through thehighest redshifts observed. by measuring the spectrum of the luminosity densityversus redshift, we also find that (4) previous measurements of the ultravioletluminosity density at redshifts z &lt; 2 must be reduced by a factor 2 to allowfor the spectrum of the luminosity density between rest-frame wavelengths 1500and 2800 a. and by comparing with observations of high-redshift dampedlyman-alpha absorption systems detected toward background qsos, we further findthat (5) the distribution of star formation rate intensities matches thedistribution of neutral hydrogen column densities at redshifts z = 2 through 5,which establishes a quantitative connection between high-redshift galaxies andhigh column density gas and suggests that high-redshift damped lyman-alphaabsorption systems trace lower star formation rate intensity regions of thesame galaxies detected in star light in the hdf and hdf--s.

astro-ph;0408367	evolved galaxies at z &gt; 1.5 from the gemini deep deep survey: the  formation epoch of massive stellar systems	we present spectroscopic evidence from the gemini deep deep survey (gdds) fora significant population of color-selected red galaxies at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 2.2 whoseintegrated light is dominated by evolved stars. unlike radio-selected objects,the z &gt; 1.5 old galaxies have a sky density &gt; 0.1 per sq. arcmin. conservativeage estimates for 20 galaxies with z &gt; 1.3; &lt;z&gt; = 1.49, give a median age of1.2 gyr and &lt;z_f&gt; = 2.4. one quarter of the galaxies have inferred z_f &gt; 4.models restricted to abundances less than or equal to solar give median agesand z_f of 2.3 gyr and 3.3, respectively. these galaxies are among the mostmassive and contribute approximately 50% of the stellar mass density at 1 &lt; z &lt;2. the derived ages and most probable star formation histories suggest a highstar-formation-rate (300-500 solar masses per year) phase in the progenitorpopulation. we argue that most of the red galaxies are not descendants of thetypical z=3 lyman break galaxies. galaxies associated with luminous sub-mmsources have the requisite star formation rates to be the progenitorpopulation. our results point toward early and rapid formation for asignificant fraction of present day massive galaxies.

astro-ph;0411006	abundance profiles and kinematics of damped lyman-alpha absorbing  galaxies at z &lt; 0.65	we present a spectroscopic study of six damped lya absorption (dla) systemsat z&lt;0.65, based on moderate-to-high resolution spectra of the galaxiesresponsible for the absorbers. combining known metallicity measurements of theabsorbers with known optical properties of the absorbing galaxies, we confirmthat the low metal content of the dla population can arise naturally as acombination of gas cross-section selection and metallicity gradients commonlyobserved in local disk galaxies. we also study the tully-fisher relation of thedla-selected galaxies and find little detectable evidence for evolution in thedisk population between z=0 and z~0.5. additional results of our analysis areas follows. (1) the dla galaxies exhibit a range of spectral properties, frompost-starburst, to normal disks, and to starburst systems, supporting the ideathat dla galaxies are drawn from the typical field population. (2) largerotating hi disks of radius 30 h^{-1} kpc and of dynamic mass m_dyn &gt; 10^{11}h^{-1} m_sun appear to be common at intermediate redshifts. (3) using anensemble of six galaxy-dla pairs, we derive an abundance profile that ischaracterized by a radial gradient of -0.041 +/- 0.012 dex per kiloparsec (orequivalently a scale length of 10.6 h^{-1} kpc) from galactic center to 30h^{-1} kpc radius. (4) adopting known n(hi) profiles of nearby galaxies and thebest-fit radial gradient, we further derive an n(hi)-weighted mean metallicity&lt;z&gt;_weighted = -0.50 +/- 0.07 for the dla population over 100 random lines ofsight, consistent with &lt;z&gt;_weighted = -0.64 (-0.86, +0.40) observed for z~1 dlasystems from prochaska et al. our analysis demonstrates that the low metalcontent of dla systems does not rule out the possibility that the dlapopulation trace the field galaxy population.

astro-ph;0503401	gemini deep deep survey vi: massive hdelta-strong galaxies at z=1	we show that there has been a dramatic decline in the abundance of massivegalaxies with strong hdelta stellar absorption lines from z=1.2 to the present.these ``hdelta-strong'', or hds, galaxies have undergone a recent and rapidbreak in their star-formation activity. combining data from the gemini deepdeep and the sloan digital sky surveys to make mass-matched samples(m*&gt;=10^10.2 msun), with 25 and 50,255 galaxies, respectively), we find thatthe fraction of galaxies in an hds phase has decreased from about 50% at z=1.2to a few percent today. this decrease in fraction is due to an actual decreasein the number density of massive hds systems by a factor of 2-4, coupled withan increase in the number density of massive galaxies by about 30 percent. weshow that this result depends only weakly on the threshold chosen for thehdelta equivalent width to define hds systems (if greater than 4 a) andcorresponds to a (1+z)^{2.5\pm 0.7} evolution. spectral synthesis studies ofthe high-redshift population using the pegase code, treating hdelta_a, ew[oii],dn4000, and rest-frame colors, favor models in which the balmer absorptionfeatures in massive hdelta-strong systems are the echoes of intense episodes ofstar-formation that faded about 1 gyr prior to the epoch of observation. thez=1.4-2 epoch appears to correspond to a time at which massive galaxies are intransition from a mode of sustained star formation to a relatively quiescentmode with weak and rare star-formation episodes. we argue that the most likelylocal descendants of the distant massive hds galaxies are passively evolvingmassive galaxies in the field and small groups.

astro-ph;0507621	probing the igm-galaxy connection toward pks0405-123 ii : a  cross-correlation study of lya absorbers and galaxies at z&lt;0.5	we present a pilot study of the clustering properties of lya absorbers withrespect to known galaxies based on 112 lya absorbers and 482 galaxiesidentified at z&lt;0.5 along the sightline toward pks0405-123. the principal goalis to determine the origin of lya absorbers based on their cross-correlationamplitude with known galaxies and investigate a possible n(hi) dependence ofthe cross-correlation function. the main results of our study are as follows.(1) the cross-correlation function xi_{ga} measured using only emission-linedominated galaxies and lya absorbers of log n(hi) &gt;= 14 shows a comparablestrength to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_{gg} on co-moving,projection distance scales &lt; 1 h^{-1} mpc, while there remains a lack ofcross-correlation signal when using only absorption-line dominated galaxies.this signifies a morphology-dependent xi_{ga} and indicates that strongabsorbers of log n(hi) &gt;= 14 and emission-line galaxies reside in the same halopopulation. (2) a maximum-likelihood analysis shows that lya absorbers of logn(hi) &lt; 13.6 are consistent with being more randomly distributed with respectto known galaxies. finally, (3) we find based on this single sightline that theamplitude of xi_{ga} does not depend sensitively on n(hi) for strong absorbersof log n(hi) &gt;= 13.6.

astro-ph;0508270	echelle spectroscopy of a grb afterglow at z=3.969: a new probe of the  interstellar and intergalactic media in the young universe	we present an echelle spectrum of the swift grb 050730, obtained four hoursafter the burst using the mike spectrograph on the magellan clay telescope whenthe afterglow was at r=17.7. the spectrum reveals a forest of absorptionfeatures superimposed on a simple power-law shaped continuum, best described asf_nu(lambda)\propto lambda^{alpha} with alpha =1.88\pm 0.01 overlambda=7000-9000 a. we identify the grb host at z_grb=3.96855 based on thehydrogen lyman absorption series, narrow absorption lines due to heavy ionssuch as oi, cii, siii, sii, niii, feii, civ, siiv, and nv, and fine structuretransitions such as oi*, oi**, siii*, cii*, and feii*. together thesetransitions allow us to study the the properties of the interstellar medium(ism) in the grb host. the principal results are as follows. (1) we estimate aneutral hydrogen column density of log n(hi)=22.15\pm 0.05 in the host. (2) theassociated metal lines exhibit multiple components over a velocity range of ~80km/s, with &gt;90% of the neutral gas confined in 20 km/s. (3) comparisons betweendifferent ionic transitions show that the host has little/no dust depletion andhas 1/100 solar metallicity. (4) the absorbing gas has much higher density thanthat of intervening damped lya absorption (dla) systems. in addition, we reportthe identification of an intervening dla system at z_dla=3.56439 with logn(hi)=20.3\pm 0.1 and &lt; 5% solar metallicity, a lyman limit system atz_lls=3.02209 with log n(hi)=19.9\pm 0.1, a strong mgii absorber atz_mgii=2.25313, and a pair of mgii absorbers at z_mgii=1.7731, 57 km/s apart.we demonstrate that rapid echelle spectroscopy of grb afterglows helps toreveal a wealth of information in the ism and the intergalactic medium alongthe sightline (abridged).

astro-ph;0512163	high metallicity, photoionised gas in intergalactic large-scale  filaments	we present high-resolution uv spectra of absorption-line systems toward thelow-z qso hs0624+6907 (z=0.3700). coupled with spectroscopic galaxy redshifts,we find that many of these absorbers are integalactic gas clouds distributedwithin large-scale structures. the gas is cool (t&lt;10^5 k) and has relativelyhigh metallicity (z/z_sol&gt;0.9). stis data reveal a cluster of 13 hi lyman alphalines within a 1000 km/s interval at z=0.0635. we find 10 galaxies at thisredshift with impact parameters ranging from 135 h^-1 kpc to 1.37 h^-1 mpc. weattribute the hi lya absorptions to intragroup medium gas, possibly from alarge-scale filament viewed along its long axis. remarkably, the metallicity isnear-solar, [m/h] = -0.05 +/- 0.4 (2 sigma uncertainty), yet the nearest galaxywhich might pollute the igm is at least 135 h_70^-1 kpc away. tidal strippingfrom nearby galaxies appears to be the most likely origin of this highlyenriched, cool gas. more than six abell galaxy clusters are found within 4degree of the sight line suggesting that the qso line of sight passes near anode in the cosmic web. at z~0.077, we find absorption systems as well asgalaxies at the redshift of the nearby clusters abell 564 and abell 559. weconclude that the sight line pierces a filament of gas and galaxies feedinginto these clusters. the absorber at z_abs = 0.07573 associated with abell564/559 also has a high metallicity with [c/h] &gt; -0.6, but again the closestgalaxy is relatively far from the sight line (293 h^-1 kpc).

astro-ph;0601057	dissecting the circumstellar environment of gamma-ray burst progenitors	we investigate properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in galaxieshosting long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) from an analysis of atomicspecies (mgi, fei) and excited fine-structure levels of ions (e.g. siii). ouranalysis is guided primarily by echelle observations of grb 050730 and grb051111. these sightlines exhibit fine-structure transitions of oi, siii, andfeii gas that have not yet been detected in intervening quasar absorption linesystems. our results indicate that the gas with large mgi equivalent width(e.g. grb 051111) must occur at distances &gt;~50pc from grb afterglows to avoidphotoionization. we examine the mechanisms for fine-structure excitation andfind two processes can contribute: (1) indirect uv pumping by the grb afterglowprovided a far-uv intensity in excess of 10^6 times the galactic radiationfield; and (2) collisional excitation in gas with electron density n_e&gt;10^4cm^-3. the observed abundances of excited ions are well explained by uv pumpingwith the gas at approximately a few hundred pc from the afterglow for grb051111 and r&lt;100pc for grb 050730, without invoking extreme gas density andtemperature in the ism. we show that uv pumping alone provides a simpleexplanation for all reported detections of excited ions in grb afterglowspectra. the presence of strong fine-structure transitions therefore may offerlittle constraint for the gas density or temperature. we discuss additionalimplications of uv pumping including its impact on chemical abundancemeasurements, new prospects for observing line-strength variability, and futureprospects for studying the gas density and temperature. finally, we list aseries of criteria that can distinguish between the mechanisms of uv pumpingand collisional excitation.

astro-ph;0602172	probing the igm/galaxy connection toward pks0405-123 iii: the galaxy  survey and correlations with ovi absorbers	we present a galaxy survey of the field surrounding pks0405-123 performedwith the wfccd spectrometer at las campanas observatory. the survey iscomprised of two datasets: (1) a greater than 95% complete survey to r = 20 ofthe field centered on pks0405-123 with 10' radius (l~0.1 l_* and radius of 1mpcat z=0.1); and (2) a set of four discontiguous (i.e. non-overlapping), flankingfields covering ~1 square degree area with completeness ~90% to r=19.5mag. withthese datasets, one can examine the local and large-scale galactic environmentof the absorption systems identified toward pks0405-123. in this paper, wefocus on the ovi systems analyzed in paper i. the results suggest that this gasarises in a diverse set of galactic environments including the halos ofindividual galaxies, galaxy groups, filamentary-like structures, and alsoregions devoid of luminous galaxies. in this small sample, there are no obvioustrends between galactic environment and the physical properties of the gas.furthermore, we find similar results for a set of absorption systems withcomparable n(hi) but no detectable metal-lines. the observations indicate thatmetals are distributed throughout a wide range of environments in the localuniverse. future papers in this series will address the distribution ofgalactic environments associated with metal-line systems and the lya forestbased on data for over 10 additional fields. all of the data presented in thispaper is made public at a dedicated web site.

astro-ph;0603323	a shot in the dark: a technique for locating the stellar counterparts of  damped lyman alpha absorbers	we present initial results from a magellan telescope program to imagegalaxies that give rise to damped lyman absorbers (dlas) at 1.63 &lt; z_dla &lt;2.37. our program differs from previous efforts in that we target quasars withintervening lyman limit systems (lls) along the line of sight at redshift z_lls&gt; 3.5. the higher-redshift lls is applied as a blocking filter to remove theglare of the background quasar at the rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths of theforeground galaxy. the complete absence of quasar light offers an unimpededview along the sightline to the redshift of the lls, allowing an exhaustivesearch for the dla galaxy to the sensitivity limit of the imaging data (at orbetter than 0.25l*). in both of our pilot fields (pks2000-330, z_dla=2.033 andsdss0322-0558, z_dla=1.69), we identify an l* galaxy within 5" of the sightlinewhich has optical colors consistent with star-forming galaxies at z~2. weexamine the correlation between absorption-line properties and galaxyluminosity and impact distance, and compare the high-redshift galaxy andabsorber pairs with those known at z&lt;1.

astro-ph;0606462	temporal variation in excited fe^+ near a grb afterglow	excited si^+ and fe^+ species are routinely observed in the host environmentof gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows, but are not commonly seen in otherextragalactic locations. their presence signals unusual properties in thegaseous environment of these grb hosts that arise either as a result of theintense ionizing radiation of the afterglow or through collision excitation ina dense cloud. in particular, the photon pumping scenario has explicitexpectations for temporal variation in the strength of the excited lines, owingto the decline in the ionizing flux of the grb afterglow. we analyze afterglowspectra of grb 020813 obtained in two epochs of ~16 hours apart, and examinetransitions from the first excited state of fe^+ at j=7/2 in these two sets ofdata. we report a significant decline by at least a factor of five in theequivalent width of the feii 2396 transition, the strongest from the j=7/2state. we perform a monte-carlo analysis and determine that this temporalvariation is present at more than 3sigma level of significance. thisobservation represents the first detection in the temporal variation of theexcited fe+ states in the grb host ism, a direct influence of the burst itselfon its environment. we further estimate that the fe^+ gas resides in 50-100 pcfrom the afterglow, based on the afterglow lightcurve and the presence andabsence of the excited feii 2396 in the two-epoch observations.

astro-ph;0608040	searching for low surface-brightness galaxies in the hubble ultra deep  field: implications for the star formation efficiency in neutral gas at z ~ 3	(abridged) the kennicutt--schmidt law relates the face-on star formation rate(sfr) per unit area with the face-on gaseous column density in nearby galaxies.applying this relation to damped lya absorption systems (dlas) of neutralhydrogen column density n &gt; 1.6x10^21 cm^-2 leads to an estimate that threepercent of the sky should be covered with extended sources brighter thanmu_v~28.4 mag arcsec^-2, if dlas at redshift z=[2.5,3.5] undergo in situ starformation. we test this hypothesis by searching the hubble ultra deep field(udf) f606w image for low surface-brightness features of angular sizes, rangingbetween theta_dla=0.25" and 4.0". our search yields upper limits on thecomoving sfr densities that are between factors of 30 and 100 lower thanpredictions, suggesting a reduction by more than a factor of 10 in starformation efficiency at z~3. we consider several mechanisms that could reducestar formation efficiency at high redshift. we find that the cosmologicalincrease with redshift of the critical surface density for the toomreinstability may be sufficient to suppress star formation to the levels impliedby the udf observations. however, the uncertainties are such that toomreinstabilities may still exist. in that case star formation at column densitiesless than 10^22 cm^-2 may be suppressed by the low molecular content of the dlagas. the upper limits on in situ star formation reduce the predictedmetallicities at z~3 to be significantly lower than observed, and reduce theheat input in the gas to be substantially lower than the inferred coolingrates. in contrast, the radiative output from compact lyman break galaxies(lbgs) with r&lt;27 is sufficient to balance the comoving cooling rate.

astro-ph;0611079	on the absence of wind signatures in grb afterglow spectra: constraints  on the wolf-rayet winds of grb progenitors	we investigate available constraints on the circumstellar medium (csm) aroundlong-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitors from afterglow spectra. wefirst establish a statistical sample of five grb afterglow spectra that havebeen collected and analyzed with no prior knowledge of the line-of-sightproperties. this sample is then adopted for a uniform search of wolf-rayet windsignatures, as represented by civ 1548, 1550 absorption doublets at dv=-1000 to-5000 km/s from the grbs (hereafter civ_{15}). we report the detection of asingle civ_{15} absorber at dv ~ -1500 km/s from grb 050730 and none in therest. our search yields an estimate of 20% for the incidence of civ_{15}absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent width ew(civ 1548)&gt;0.2 ang neargrb host galaxies, consistent with the incidence of intergalactic civ_{15} nearclassical damped lya absorbers toward quasar sightlines. including the twociv_{15} absorbers previously known toward grb 021004, we further demonstratethat the presence of h^0, c^+, and si^+ together with the absence of excitedc^+ or si^+ argue against a csm origin. the null result is consistent with theexpectation that the circumburst medium is fully ionized by the afterglowradiation field. we examine possible scenarios for the survival of the c^{3+}ions, including a clumpy wind model. we find that a clumpy wind is unable toeffectively shield the ionizing radiation and allow c^{3+} to survive at r&lt;10pc from the afterglow. we conclude that the lack of csm-originated civ_{15}absorbers is consistent with wolf-rayet winds terminating at &lt; 30 pc from theirprogenitor stars.

astro-ph;0703666	missing molecular hydrogen and the physical conditions of grb host  galaxies	we examine the abundance of molecular hydrogen (h2) in the spectra of gammaray burst afterglows (grbs). in nearby galaxies h2 traces the cold neutralmedium (cnm) and dense molecular star-forming interstellar gas. though h2 isdetected in at least half of all sightlines towards hot stars in the magellanicclouds and in ~25% of damped lya systems toward quasars, it is not detected inany of the five grb environments with a similar range of neutral hydrogencolumn and metallicity. we detect no vibrationally-excited h2 that would implythe grb itself has photodissociated its parent molecular cloud, so such modelsare ruled out unless the parent cloud was &lt;~4 pc in radius and was fullydissociated prior to the spectroscopic observations, or the star escaped itsparent cloud during its main-sequence lifetime. the low molecular fractions forthe grbs are mysterious in light their large column densities of neutral h andexpectations based on local analogs, i.e. 30 doradus in the lmc. thissurprising lack of h2 in grb-dlas indicates that the destruction processes thatsuppress molecule formation in the lmc and smc are more effective in the grbhosts, most probably a combination of low metallicity and an fuv radiationfield 10--100 times the galactic mean field. these inferred conditions placestrong constraints on the star forming regions in these early galaxies.

astro-ph;9707157	damped lyman-alpha absorption associated with an early-type galaxy at  redshift z = 0.16377	we report new hst and ground-based observations of a damped lyman-alphaabsorption system toward the qso 0850+4400. the redshift of the absorptionsystem is z = 0.163770 and the neutral hydrogen column density of theabsorption system is log n = 19.81 cm**-2. the absorption system is by far thelowest redshift confirmed damped lyman-alpha absorption system yet identified,which provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the nature, impactgeometry, and kinematics of the absorbing galaxy in great detail. theobservations indicate that the absorption system is remarkable in threerespects: first, the absorption system is characterized by weak metalabsorption lines and a low metal abundance, possibly less than 4% of the solarmetal abundance. this cannot be explained as a consequence of dust, because theneutral hydrogen column density of the absorption system is far too low forobscuration by dust to introduce any significant selection effects. second, theabsorption system is associated with a moderate-luminosity early-type s0galaxy, although the absorption may actually arise in one of several very faintgalaxies detected very close to the qso line of sight. third, the absorbingmaterial moves counter to the rotating galaxy disk, which rules out thepossibility that the absorption arises in a thin or thick co-rotating gaseousdisk. these results run contrary to the expectation that low-redshift dampedlyman-alpha absorption systems generally arise in the gas- and metal-rich innerparts of late-type spiral galaxies. we suggest instead that mounting evidenceindicates that low-redshift galaxies of a variety of morphological types maycontain significant quantities of low metal abundance gas at largegalactocentric distances.

astro-ph;9812339	photometry and photometric redshifts of galaxies in the hubble deep  field south nicmos field	we present an electronic catalog of infrared and optical photometry andphotometric redshifts of 323 galaxies in the hubble deep field south nicmosfield at http://www.ess.sunysb.edu/astro/hdfs/home.html. the analysis is basedon infrared images obtained with the hubble space telescope using the nearinfrared camera and multi-object spectrograph and the space telescope imagingspectrograph together with optical images obtained with the very largetelescope. the infrared and optical photometry is measured by means of a newquasi-optimal photometric technique that fits model spatial profiles of thegalaxies determined by pixon image reconstruction techniques to the images. incomparison with conventional methods, the new technique provides highersignal-to-noise-ratio measurements and accounts for uncertainty correlationsbetween nearby, overlapping neighbors. the photometric redshifts are measuredby means of our redshift likelihood technique, incorporating sixspectrophotometric templates which, by comparison with spectroscopic redshiftsof galaxies identified in the hubble deep field north, are known to provideredshift measurements accurate to within an rms relative uncertainty of (deltaz)/(1 + z) &lt; 0.1 at all redshifts z &lt; 6. the analysis reaches a peak h-bandsensitivity threshold of ab(16000) = 28.3 and covers 1.02 acrmin^2 to ab(16000)= 27, 1.27 arcmin^2 to ab(16000) = 26, and 1.44 arcmin^2 to ab(16000) = 25. theanalysis identifies galaxies at redshifts ranging from z near 0 through zgreater than 10, including 17 galaxies of redshift 5 &lt; z &lt; 10 and fivecandidate galaxies of redshift z &gt; 10.

0706.1285	characterizing the low-redshift intergalactic medium towards pks1302-102	we present a detailed analysis of the intergalactic metal-line absorptionsystems in the archival hst/stis and fuse ultraviolet spectra of thelow-redshift quasar pks1302-102 (z_qso = 0.2784). we supplement the archivedata with cloudy ionization models and a survey of galaxies in the quasarfield. there are 15 strong lya absorbers with column densities logn_hi &gt; 14. ofthese, six are associated with at least ciii 977 absorption (logn(c^++) &gt; 13);this implies a redshift density dn_ciii/dz = 36+13/-9 (68% confidence limits)for the five detections with rest equivalent width w_r &gt; 50 ma. two systemsshow ovi 1031,1037 absorption in addition to ciii (logn(o^+5) &gt; 14). one is apartial lyman limit system (logn_hi = 17) with associated ciii, ovi, and siiii1206 absorption. there are three tentative ovi systems that do not have ciiidetected. for one ovi doublet with both lines detected at 3 sigma with w_r &gt; 50ma, dn_ovi/dz = 7+9/-4. we also search for ovi doublets without lya absorptionbut identify none. from cloudy modeling, these metal-line systems havemetallicities spanning the range -4 &lt; [m/h] &lt; -0.3. the two ovi systems withassociated ciii absorption cannot be single-phase, collisionally-ionized mediabased on the relative abundances of the metals and kinematic arguments. fromthe galaxy survey, we discover that the absorption systems are in a diverse setof galactic environments. each metal-line system has at least one galaxy within500 km/s and 600 h^-1 kpc with l &gt; 0.1 l_*.
