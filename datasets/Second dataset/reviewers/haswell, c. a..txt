0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

0908.0189	the main-sequence rotation-colour relation in the coma berenices open  cluster	we present the results of a photometric survey of rotation rates in the comaberenices (melotte 111) open cluster, using data obtained as part of thesuperwasp exoplanetary transit-search programme. the goal of the coma surveywas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence f, g and k dwarfs inthis intermediate-age (~600 myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to whichmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. we find atight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and j-k colour with aroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. the relation is similar to thatseen among f, g and k stars in the hyades. such strong convergence can only beexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from areservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. we conclude thatthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinningradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter thanthe cluster age, and that from the age of coma onward, stars rotate effectivelyas solid bodies. the existence of a tight relationship between stellar mass androtation period at a given age supports the use of stellar rotation period asan age indicator in f, g and k stars of hyades age and older. we demonstratethat individual stellar ages can be determined within the coma population withan internal precision of order 9 percent (rms), using a standard magneticbraking law in which rotation period increases with the square root of stellarage. we find that a slight modification to the magnetic-braking power law, pproportional to t^0.56, yields rotational and asteroseismological ages in goodagreement for the sun and other stars of solar age for which p-mode studies andphotometric rotation periods have been published.

1001.0403	wasp-19b: the shortest period transiting exoplanet yet discovered	we report on the discovery of a new extremely short period transitingextrasolar planet, wasp-19b. the planet has mass mpl = 1.15 \pm 0.08 mj, radiusrpl = 1.31 \pm 0.06 rj, and orbital period p = 0.7888399 \pm 0.0000008 days.through spectroscopic analysis, we determine the host star to be a slightlysuper-solar metallicity ([m/h] = 0.1 \pm 0.1 dex) g-dwarf with teff = 5500 \pm100 k. in addition, we detect periodic, sinusoidal flux variations in the lightcurve which are used to derive a rotation period for the star of prot = 10.5\pm 0.2 days. the relatively short stellar rotation period suggests that eitherwasp-19 is somewhat young (~ 600 myr old) or tidal interactions between the twobodies have caused the planet to spiral inward over its lifetime resulting inthe spin-up of the star. due to the detection of the rotation period, thissystem has the potential to place strong constraints on the stellar tidalquality factor, q's, if a more precise age is determined.

1005.3656	metals in the exosphere of the highly irradiated planet wasp-12b	we present near-uv transmission spectroscopy of the highly irradiatedtransiting exoplanet wasp-12b, obtained with the cosmic origins spectrograph onthe hubble space telescope. the spectra cover three distinct wavelength ranges:nuva (2539-2580 {\aa}), nuvb (2655-2696 {\aa}), and nuvc (2770-2811 {\aa}).three independent methods all reveal enhanced transit depths attributable toabsorption by resonance lines of metals in the exosphere of wasp-12b. lightcurves of total counts in the nuva and nuvc wavelength ranges show a detectionat a 2.5{\sigma} level. we detect extra absorption in the mg ii{\lambda}{\lambda}2800 resonance line cores at the 2.8{\sigma} level. the nuva,nuvb, and nuvc light curves imply effective radii of 2.69+/-0.24 rj,2.18+/-0.18 rj, and 2.66+/-0.22 rj respectively, suggesting the planet issurrounded by an absorbing cloud which overfills the roche lobe. we detectenhanced transit depths at the wavelengths of resonance lines of neutralsodium, tin, and manganese, and at singly ionized ytterbium, scandium,manganese, aluminum, vanadium, and magnesium. we also find the statisticallyexpected number of anomalous transit depths at wavelengths not associated withany known resonance line. our data are limited by photon noise, but taken as awhole the results are strong evidence for an extended absorbing exospheresurrounding the planet. the nuva data exhibit an early ingress, contrary tomodel expectations; we speculate this could be due to the presence of a disk ofpreviously stripped material.

1007.3082	a detailed spectropolarimetric analysis of the planet hosting star  wasp-12	the knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is paramount in several fieldsof stellar astrophysics, particularly in the study of extrasolar planets, whereoften the star is the only visible component and therefore used to infer theplanet's fundamental parameters. another important aspect of the analysis ofplanetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star-planetinteraction. here we present a self-consistent abundance analysis of the planethosting star wasp-12 and a high-precision search for a structured stellarmagnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained withthe espadons spectropolarimeter. our results show that the star does not have astructured magnetic field, and that the obtained fundamental parameters are ingood agreement with what was previously published. in addition we deriveimproved constraints on the stellar age (1.0-2.65 gyr), mass (1.23-1.49 m/m0),and distance (295-465 pc). wasp-12 is an ideal object to look for pollutionsignatures in the stellar atmosphere. we analyse the wasp-12 abundances as afunction of the condensation temperature and compare them with those publishedby several other authors on planet hosting and non-planet hosting stars. wefind hints of atmospheric pollution in wasp-12's photosphere, but are unable toreach firm conclusions with our present data. we conclude that a differentialanalysis based on wasp-12 twins will probably clarify if an atmosphericpollution is present, the nature of this pollution and its implications in theplanet formation and evolution. we attempt also the direct detection of thecircumstellar disk through infrared excess, but without success.

1009.3470	independent discovery and refined parameters of the transiting exoplanet  hat-p-14b	we present superwasp observations of hat-p-14b, a hot jupiter discovered bytorres et al. the planet was found independently by the superwasp team andnamed wasp-27b after follow-up observations had secured the discovery, butprior to the publication by torres et al. our analysis of hat-p-14/wasp-27 isin good agreement with the values found by torres et al. and we refine theparameters by combining our datasets. we also provide additional evidenceagainst astronomical false positives. due to the brightness of the host star, v= 10, hat-p-14 is an attractive candidate for further characterisationobservations. the planet has a high impact parameter, b = 0.907 +/- 0.004, andthe primary transit is close to grazing. this could readily reveal smalldeviations in the orbital parameters indicating the presence of a third body inthe system, which may be causing the small but significant orbitaleccentricity, e = 0.095 +/- 0.011. the system geometry suggests that the planetnarrowly fails to undergo a secondary eclipse. however, even a non-detectionwould tightly constrain the system parameters.

1106.2935	the shocking transit of wasp-12b: modelling the observed early ingress  in the near ultraviolet	near ultraviolet observations of wasp-12b have revealed an early ingresscompared to the optical transit lightcurve. this has been interpreted as due tothe presence of a magnetospheric bow shock which forms when the relativevelocity of the planetary and stellar material is supersonic. we aim toreproduce this observed early ingress by modelling the stellar wind (or coronalplasma) in order to derive the speed and density of the material at theplanetary orbital radius. from this we determine the orientation of the shockand the density of compressed plasma behind it. with this model for the densitystructure surrounding the planet we perform monte carlo radiation transfersimulations of the near uv transits of wasp-12b with and without a bow shock.we find that we can reproduce the transit lightcurves with a wide range ofplasma temperatures, shock geometries and optical depths. our results supportthe hypothesis that a bow shock could explain the observed early ingress.

1207.6210	the habitability and detection of earth-like planets orbiting cool white  dwarfs	since there are several ways planets can survive the giant phase of the hoststar, we examine the habitability and detection of planets orbiting whitedwarfs. as a white dwarf cools from 6000 k to 4000 k, a planet orbiting at 0.01au would remain in the continuous habitable zone (chz) for ~8 gyr. we show thatphotosynthetic processes can be sustained on such planets. the dna-weighted uvradiation dose for an earth-like planet in the chz is less than the maximaencountered on earth, hence non-magnetic white dwarfs are compatible with thepersistence of complex life. polarisation due to a terrestrial planet in thechz of a cool white dwarf is 10^2 (10^4) times larger than it would be in thehabitable zone of a typical m-dwarf (sun-like star). polarimetry is thus aviable way to detect close-in rocky planets around white dwarfs. multi-bandpolarimetry would also allow reveal the presence of a planet atmosphere,providing a first characterisation. planets in the chz of a 0.6 m_sun whitedwarf will be distorted by roche geometry, and a kepler-11d analogue wouldoverfill its roche lobe. with current facilities a super-earth-sizedatmosphereless planet is detectable with polarimetry around the brightest knowncool white dwarf. planned future facilities render smaller planets detectable,in particular by increasing the instrumental sensitivity in the blue.

1302.0879	detection of a magnetic field in three old and inactive solar-like  planet-hosting stars	our understanding of magnetic fields in late-type stars is strongly driven bywhat we know of the solar magnetic field. for this reason, it is crucial tounderstand how typical the solar dynamo is. to do this we need to compare thesolar magnetic field with that of other stars as similar to the sun aspossible, both in stellar parameters and age, hence activity. we present herethe detection of a magnetic field in three planet-hosting solar-like starshaving a mass, age, and activity level comparable to that of the sun. we usedthe harpspol spectropolarimeter to obtain high-resolution high-qualitycircularly polarised spectra of hd 70642, hd 117207, and hd 154088, using theleast-squares deconvolution technique to detect the magnetic field. from thestokes i spectra, we calculated the logr activity index for each star. wecompared the position of the stars in the hertzsprung-russell diagram toevolutionary tracks, to estimate their mass and age. we used the lithiumabundance, derived from the stokes i spectra, to further constrain the ages. weobtained a definite magnetic field detection for both hd 70642 and hd 154088,while for hd 117207 we obtained a marginal detection. due to the lowersignal-to-noise ratio of the observations, we were unable to detect themagnetic field in the second set of observations available for hd 117207 and hd154088. on the basis of effective temperature, mass, age, and activity levelthe three stars can be considered solar analogs. hd 70642, hd 117207, and hd154088 are ideal targets for a comparative study between the solar magneticfield and that of solar analogs.

1303.3375	absorbing gas around the wasp-12 planetary system	near-uv observations of the planet host star wasp-12 uncovered the apparentabsence of the normally conspicuous core emission of the mg2 h&amp;k resonancelines. this anomaly could be due either to (1) a lack of stellar activity,which would be unprecedented for a solar-like star of the imputed age ofwasp-12; or (2) extrinsic absorption, from the intervening interstellar medium(ism) or from material within the wasp-12 system itself, presumably ablatedfrom the extreme hot jupiter wasp-12b. hires archival spectra of the ca2 h&amp;klines of wasp-12 show broad depressions in the line cores, deeper than those ofother inactive and similarly distant stars and similar to wasp-12's mg2 h&amp;kline profiles. we took high resolution espadons and fies spectra of threeearly-type stars within 20' of wasp-12 and at similar distances, which show theism column is insufficient to produce the broad ca2 depression observed inwasp-12. the ebhis h1 column density map supports and strengthens thisconclusion. extrinsic absorption by material local to the wasp-12 system istherefore the most likely cause of the line core anomalies. gas escaping fromthe heavily irradiated planet could form a stable and thick circumstellardisk/cloud. the anomalously low stellar activity index (logr'hk) of wasp-12 isevidently a direct consequence of the extra core absorption, so similar hkindex deficiencies might signal the presence of translucent circumstellar gasaround other stars hosting evaporating planets.

1402.5416	wts-2 b: a hot jupiter orbiting near its tidal destruction radius around  a k-dwarf	we report the discovery of wts-2 b, an unusually close-in 1.02-day hotjupiter (mp=1.12mj, rp=1.363rj) orbiting a k2v star, which has a possiblegravitationally-bound m-dwarf companion at 0.6 arcsec separation contributing~20 percent of the total flux in the observed j-band light curve. the planet isonly 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyedby roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ~40 myr,assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of q'*=10^6. q'* is a key factor indetermining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbitalevolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorlyconstrained by observations. we calculate that the orbital decay of wts-2 bwould correspond to a shift in its transit arrival time of t_shift~17 secondsafter 15 years assuming q'*=10^6. a shift less than this would place a directobservational constraint on the lower limit of q'* in this system. we alsoreport a correction to the previously published expected t_shift for wasp-18 b,finding that t_shift=356 seconds after 10 years for q'*=10^6, which is muchlarger than the estimated 28 seconds quoted in wasp-18 b discovery paper. weattempted to constrain q'* via a study of the entire population of knowntransiting hot jupiters, but our results were inconclusive, requiring a moredetailed treatment of transit survey sensitivities at long periods. we concludethat the most informative and straight-forward constraints on q'* will beobtained by direct observational measurements of the shift in transit arrivaltimes in individual hot jupiter systems. we show that this is achievable acrossthe mass spectrum of exoplanet host stars within a decade, and will directlyprobe the effects of stellar interior structure on tidal dissipation.

1509.05284	starspot distributions on fully convective m dwarfs: implications for  radial velocity planet searches	since m4.5 - m9 dwarfs exhibit equatorial rotation velocities of order 10km/s on average, radial velocity surveys targeting this stellar population willlikely need to find methods to effectively remove starspot jitter. we presentthe first high resolution doppler images of the m4.5 dwarf, gj 791.2a, and them9 dwarf, lp 944-20. the time series spectra of both objects reveal numerousline profile distortions over the rotation period of each star which weinterpret as starspots. the transient distortions are modelled withspot/photosphere contrast ratios that correspond to model atmospheretemperature differences of tphot-tspot = 200 and 300 k. gj 791.2a is a fullyconvective star with vsini = 35.1 km/s. although we find more starspotstructure at high latitudes, we reconstruct spots at a range of phases andlatitudes with a mean spot filling of ~3%. lp 944-20 is one of the brightestknown late-m dwarfs, with spectral type m9v and vsini = 30.8 km/s. its spectraltime series exhibits two dominant transient line distortions that arereconstructed as high latitude spots, while a mean spot filling factor of only1.5% is found. the occurrence of low-contrast spots at predominantly highlatitudes, which we see in both targets here, is in general likely to beresponsible for the low amplitude photometric variability seen in late-mdwarfs. for gj 791.2a, the radial velocities induced by the starspot featuresyield an rms velocity variability of 138 m/s, which can be reduced by a factorof 1.9 using our reconstructed surface brightness distributions.

1512.00552	far-uv spectroscopy of the planet-hosting star wasp-13: high-energy  irradiance, distance, age, planetary mass-loss rate, and circumstellar  environment	several transiting hot jupiters orbit relatively inactive main-sequencestars. for some of those, the logr'hk activity parameter lies below the basallevel (-5.1). two explanations have been proposed so far: (i) the planetaffects the stellar dynamo, (ii) the logr'hk measurements are biased byextrinsic absorption, either by the interstellar medium (ism) or by materiallocal to the system. we present here hubble space telescope/cos far-uv spectraof wasp-13, which hosts an inflated hot jupiter and has a measured logr'hkvalue (-5.26), well below the basal level. from the star's spectral energydistribution we obtain an extinction e(b-v) = 0.045+/-0.025 mag and a distanced = 232+/-8 pc. we detect at &gt;4 sigma lines belonging to three differentionization states of carbon (c1, c2, and c4) and the si4 doublet at ~3 sigma.using far-uv spectra of nearby early g-type stars of known age, we derive ac4/c1 flux ratio-age relation, from which we estimate wasp-13's age to be5.1+/-2.0 gyr. we rescale the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match theflux of the c4 1548 doublet. by integrating the rescaled solar spectrum, weobtain an xuv flux at 1 au of 5.4 erg s^-1 cm^-2. we use a detailed model ofthe planet's upper atmosphere, deriving a mass-loss rate of 1.5x10^11 g s^-1.despite the low logr'hk value, the star shows a far-uv spectrum typical ofmiddle-aged solar-type stars, pointing toward the presence of significantextrinsic absorption. the analysis of a high-resolution spectrum of the ca2h&amp;klines indicates that the ism absorption could be the origin of the low logr'hkvalue. nevertheless, the large uncertainty in the ca2 ism abundance does notallow us to firmly exclude the presence of circumstellar gas.

astro-ph;0111218	halpha flares from v404 cyg in quiescence	we present a spectrophotometric study of short-term optical variability inthe quiescent black hole x-ray transient v404 cyg. this includes two nights ofhigh time-resolution halpha spectroscopy with which we resolve much of thetime-variability, and a further six nights of archival spectroscopy with lowertime-resolution but higher spectral-resolution. we find significant variabilityin most of the data considered, with both the halpha line and the continuumoften varying in a correlated way. this includes both dramatic flares lasting afew hours in which the line flux nearly doubles and lower-level flickering. thestrongest flares involve development of asymmetry in the line profile, with thered wing usually strongest independent of orbital phase. it is unclear why thisis the case, but we discuss several possible explanations. we consider theenergetics of the flares and compare with plausible models includingchromospheric activity on the companion star, local magnetic reconnectionevents within the disc and a varying irradiation from close to the black hole.based on the line profile changes during the flares, we conclude that the mostlikely origin for the variability is variable photoionisation by the centralsource, although local flares within the disc cannot be ruled out.

astro-ph;0511067	discovery and modelling of disc precession in the m31 x-ray binary bo  158?	the low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) associated with the m31 globular cluster bo158 is known to exhibit intensity dips on a ~2.78 hr period. this is due toobscuration of the x-ray source on the orbital period by material on the outeredge of the accretion disc. however, the depth of dipping varied from &lt;10% to\~83% in three archival xmm-newton observations of bo 158. previous worksuggested that the dip depth was anticorrelated with the x-ray luminosity.however, we present results from three new xmm-newton observations that suggestthat the evolution of dipping is instead due to precession of the accretiondisc. such precession is expected in neutron star lmxbs with mass ratios &lt;0.3(i.e. with orbital periods &lt;4 hr), such as the galactic dipping lmxb 4u1916-053. we simulated the accretion disc of bo 158 using cutting-edge 3dsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph), and using the observed parameters. ourresults show disc variability on two time-scales. the disc precesses in aprograde direction on a period of 81+/-3 hr. also, a radiatively-driven discwarp is present in the inner disc, which undergoes retrograde precesson on a\~31 hr period. from the system geometry, we conclude that the dippingevolution is driven by the disc precession. hence we predict that the dippingbehaviour repeats on a ~81 hr cycle.

astro-ph;0605143	multiwavelength observations of exo 0748-676 - i. reprocessing of x-ray  bursts	we present the first high time-resolution simultaneous x-ray, ultraviolet,and optical observations of x-ray bursts in uy vol, the optical counterpart ofthe low mass x-ray binary exo 0748-676, obtained with rxte, hst, and gemini-s.strong reprocessed signals are present in the ultraviolet (a factor of 4) andoptical (a factor of 2.5). these signals are lagged with respect to the x-raysand appear significantly smeared as well. the addition of far-ultravioletcoverage for one burst, together with the high quality of the dataset, allowmuch tighter constraints upon the temperature and geometry of the reprocessingregion than previously possible. a single-zone black body reprocessing modelfor this burst suggests a rise in temperatures during the burst from 18,000 to35,000k and an emitting area comparable to that expected for the disk and/orirradiated companion star. the lags, a mean of 4.0s and range of 2.5s, areconsistent with those expected within the binary. the single-zone black bodymodel cannot reproduce the ratio of optical to ultraviolet flux during theburst, however. the discrepancy, corresponding to underpredicting the opticalby more than a factor of two, seems too large to explain with deviations from alocal black body spectrum and more likely indicates that a range ofreprocessing temperatures are required, as would be expected, with coolerregions not contributing to the uv. comparable results are derived from otherbursts, and in particular the lag and smearing both appear shorter when thecompanion star is on the near side of the disk as predicted. the burst observedby hst also yielded a spectrum of the reprocessed light.

astro-ph;0608142	the superwasp wide-field exoplanetary transit survey: candidates from  fields 23hr &lt; ra &lt; 03hr	photometric transit surveys promise to complement the currently known sampleof extra-solar planets by providing additional information on the planets andespecially their radii. here we present extra-solar planet (esp) candidatesfrom one such survey called, the wide angle search for planets (wasp) obtainedwith the superwasp wide-field imaging system. observations were taken withsuperwasp-north located in la palma during the april to october 2004 observingseason. the data cover fields between 23hr and 03hr in ra at declinations above+12. this amounts to over $\approx$400,000 stars with v magnitudes 8 to 13.5.for the stars brighter than 12.5, we achieve better than 1 percent photometricprecision. here we present 41 sources with low amplitude variability between$\approx$ 1 and 10 mmag, from which we select 12 with periods between 1.2 and4.4 days as the most promising extrasolar planet candidates. we discuss theproperties of these esp candidates, the expected fraction of transits recoveredfor our sample, and implications for the frequency and detection ofhot-jupiters.

astro-ph;0608454	the wasp project and the superwasp cameras	the superwasp cameras are wide-field imaging systems sited at theobservatorio del roque de los muchachos on the island of la palma in the canaryislands, and the sutherland station of the south african astronomicalobservatory. each instrument has a field of view of some ~482 square degreeswith an angular scale of 13.7 arcsec per pixel, and is capable of deliveringphotometry with accuracy better than 1% for objects having v ~ 7.0 - 11.5.lower quality data for objects brighter than v ~15.0 are stored in the projectarchive. the systems, while designed to monitor fields with high cadence, arecapable of surveying the entire visible sky every 40 minutes. depending on theobservational strategy, the data rate can be up to 100gb per night. we haveproduced a robust, largely automatic reduction pipeline and advanced archivewhich are used to serve the data products to the consortium members. the mainscience aim of these systems is to search for bright transiting exo-planetssystems suitable for spectroscopic followup observations. the first 6 monthseason of superwasp-north observations produced lightcurves of ~6.7 millionobjects with 12.9 billion data points.

astro-ph;0609418	a fast hybrid algorithm for exoplanetary transit searches	we present a fast and efficient hybrid algorithm for selecting exoplanetarycandidates from wide-field transit surveys. our method is based on thewidely-used sysrem and box least-squares (bls) algorithms. patterns ofsystematic error that are common to all stars on the frame are mapped andeliminated using the sysrem algorithm. the remaining systematic errors causedby spatially localised flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using aboxcar-smoothing method. we show that the dimensions of the search-parameterspace can be reduced greatly by carrying out an initial bls search on a coarsegrid of reduced dimensions, followed by newton-raphson refinement of thetransit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. weillustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of thesuperwasp survey, comprising 2300 observations of 7840 stars brighter thanv=13.0. we identify 11 likely transit candidates. we reject stars that exhibitsignificant ellipsoidal variations indicative of a stellar-mass companion. weuse colours and proper motions from the 2mass and usno-b1.0 surveys to estimatethe stellar parameters and the companion radius. we find that two stars showingunambiguous transit signals pass all these tests, and so qualify for detailedhigh-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.

astro-ph;0609618	the impact of correlated noise on superwasp detection rates for  transiting extra-solar planets	we present a model of the stellar populations in the fields observed by oneof the superwasp-n cameras in the 2004 observing season. we use the besancongalactic model to define the range of stellar types and metallicities present,and populate these objects with transiting extra-solar planets using themetallicity relation of fischer &amp; valenti (2005).  we investigate the ability of superwasp to detect these planets in thepresence of realistic levels of correlated systematic noise (`red noise'). wefind that the number of planets that transit with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10or more increases linearly with the number of nights of observations. based ona simulation of detection rates across 20 fields observed by one camera, wepredict that a total of 18.6 \pm 8.0 planets should be detectable from thesuperwasp-n 2004 data alone. the best way to limit the impact of co-variantnoise and increase the number of detectable planets is to boost thesignal-to-noise ratio, by increasing the number of observed transits for eachcandidate transiting planet. this requires the observing baseline to beincreased, by spending a second observing season monitoring the same fields.

astro-ph;0610035	artificial variability in xmm-newton observations of x-ray sources: m31  as a case study	power density spectra (pds) that are characteristic of low mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) have been previously reported for m31 x-ray sources observedby xmm-newton. however, we have recently discovered that these pds are falsepositives resulting from the improper manipulation of non-simultaneouslightcurves. the lightcurves produced by the xmm-newton science analysissoftware (sas) are non-synchronised by default. this affects not only thecombination of lightcurves from the three epic detectors (mos1, mos2 and pn),but also background subtraction in the same ccd. it is therefore imperativethat all sas-generated lightcurves are synchronised by time filtering, even ifthe whole observation is to be used. we combined simulated lightcurves atvarious intensities with various offsets and found that the artefact is moredependent on the offset than the intensity. while previous timing results fromm31 have been proven wrong, and also the broken power law pds in ngc 4559ulx-7, xmm-newton was able to detect aperiodic variability in just 3 ks ofobservations of ngc 5408 ulx1. hence xmm-newton remains a viable tool foranalysing variability in extra-galactic x-ray sources.

astro-ph;9803145	the 1996 outburst of gro j1655-40: the challenge of interpreting the  multi-wavelength spectra	we report on the results of a campaign to observe the sxt gro j1655-40 inoutburst using hst, xte and gro and aat. this outburst was qualitatively quitedifferent to other sxt outbursts and to previous outbursts of this source. theonset of hard x-ray activity occurred very slowly, over several months and wasdelayed relative to the soft x-ray rise. during this period, the optical fluxesdeclined steadily. this apparent anti-correlation is not consistent with thestandard disc instability model of sxt outbursts, nor is it expected if theoptical output is dominated by reprocessing. using our derived reddening wefind that our dereddened spectra are dominated by a component peaking in theoptical with the expected nu^1/3 disc spectrum seen only in the uv. we considerpossible interpretations of this spectrum in terms of thermal emission from theouter accretion disc and/or secondary star, both with and without x-rayirradiation, and also as non-thermal optical synchrotron emission from acompact self-absorbed central source. the x-ray spectra broadly resemble thehigh-soft state commonly seen in black hole candidates, but evolve through twosubstates. the outburst dataset cannot readily be interpreted by any standardmodel for sxt outbursts. many of the characteristics could be interpreted witha model combining x-ray irradiation with the disc instability, but with theadded ingredient of a very large disc in this long period system.

astro-ph;9904325	optical studies of the x-ray transient xte j2123-058 - ii. phase  resolved spectroscopy	we present time-resolved spectroscopy of the soft x-ray transient xtej2123-058 in outburst. spectral coverage of 3700-6700a was achieved spanningtwo orbits of the binary. the strongest emission lines are heii 4686a andciii/niii 4640a (bowen blend). other weak emission lines of heii and civ arepresent and balmer lines show a complex structure, possibly contaminated byheii. heii 4686a and ciii/niii 4640a show different orbital light curvesindicating an origin in different regions. heii 4686a profiles show a complexmultiple s-wave structure. doppler tomography reveals this emission is notassociated with the companion star, and occurs at velocities too low forkeplerian disk material. it can possibly be associated with overflowing orsplashing stream material. the optical spectrum approximates a steep bluepower-law, consistent with emission on the rayleigh-jeans tail of a black bodyspectrum. orbital modulations show no wavelength dependence; this is asexpected if both disk and companion star are hot enough for the peak of theirspectral energy distributions to be in the uv. the hot continuum and presenceof high-excitation emission lines indicate strong x-ray heating.
